ANNEX III NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS: Double Tax Agreement with the Slovak Republic 1.Executive summary 1.On 26 September 2023, New Zealand signed the Agreement between New Zealand and the Slovak Republic for the Elimination of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income and the Prevention of Tax Evasion and Avoidance (the Slovak DTA). 2.Double tax agreements (DTAs) are bilateral international treaties that are designed to reduce or eliminate double taxation and other tax impediments to cross-border economic activity and investment. Businesses and individuals contemplating engaging in cross-border activity can be deterred by the costs, risk and uncertainty. DTAs reduce some of the costs and generally help improve certainty. They tend to be favoured by all relevant stakeholder groups and are expressly recommended by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as a tool for encouraging growth in economic ties between countries. 3.New Zealand currently has 40 DTAs in force. DTAs are negotiated and administered by Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue’s DTA negotiation programme generally prioritises the negotiation of agreements that will provide the greatest benefits for New Zealand. Sometimes this may mean updating and modernising existing agreements with major trading and investment partners rather than concluding new agreements. However, additional new agreements are also entered into as opportunities arise. 4.A new DTA has now been concluded with the Slovak Republic. A key factor in the decision to negotiate the agreement was the fact that the Slovak Republic is a member of the European Union (EU) and New Zealand was negotiating a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the EU at the time. DTAs can help maximise the benefits of FTAs. Trade and investment with the Slovak Republic have not previously been particularly high but have increased markedly in recent years and potential for significant future growth in trade and investment exists. A.15A ANNEX III 2. Nature and timing of the proposed treaty action 5. The Agreement between New Zealand and the Slovak Republic for the Elimination of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income and the Prevention of Tax Evasion and Avoidance (the Slovak DTA) was signed in Bratislava on 26 September 2023. 6. The proposed treaty action is to bring the Slovak DTA into force through an exchange of diplomatic notes, in accordance with Article 28 of the Slovak DTA. The Slovak DTA will enter into force on the first day of the third month following the date of receipt of the later note. 7. Before the treaty action is taken, Standing Orders 397 to 400 require the Slovak DTA to undergo Parliamentary treaty examination. It must also be given the force of law in New Zealand, which can be achieved by means of an Order in Council made under section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 8. Like other DTAs, the Slovak DTA will not apply to the Cook Islands, Niue, or Tokelau. 3. Reasons for New Zealand becoming party to the treaty 9. New Zealand entered into its first Double Tax Agreement (DTA) in 1947, and currently has a network of 40 DTAs in force. 10. DTAs are bilateral international treaties that are principally designed to encourage growth in economic ties between countries. They are entered into to foster a more favourable economic environment that will increase cross-border income-earning activity and investment. 11. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has assumed a leading role in promoting the use of DTAs as a way of contributing to the expansion of world trade and developing the world economy. As a member of the OECD, New Zealand is subject to an express recommendation issued by the OECD Council in 1997 for all member countries: ANNEX III ... to pursue their efforts to conclude bilateral tax conventions ... with those member countries, and where appropriate with non-member countries, with which they have not yet entered into such conventions ... 12. At a practical level, DTAs are complex technical documents that provide an interface between two, often conflicting, tax systems. Despite their complexity, however, DTAs are generally favoured by all of the key stakeholder groups that are involved in cross-border economic activity: Taxpayers. A primary concern for any taxpayer contemplating engaging in commercial or employment activity in another jurisdiction is that they must comply with the tax and other legal obligations of two separate jurisdictions. This can be perplexing and obtaining professional advice or tax rulings can be costly and time consuming. Unique issues also arise from cross-border activities, ranging from complex matters such as transfer pricing disputes, to more mundane considerations such as whether taxes paid in the other jurisdiction are creditable against home jurisdiction tax. DTAs help alleviate many of these problems. They establish a framework for the taxation of cross- border activity, prohibit discriminatory taxation, and establish a low-cost mechanism for taxpayers to raise concerns if they have concerns that the DTA is not being correctly applied or interpreted. Investors. Investing across an international border always involves risk. Specific risks arise in respect of tax because of the inherent complexity of tax laws, which can lead to uncertainty as to the actual tax outcome. Tax laws can also change suddenly in some jurisdictions. DTAs assist investors by specifying the maximum rates of tax that can be applied to dividends, interest and royalties. These “headline” rates make it easier for investors to determine the after-tax returns on potential investments. The tax rates are also “locked in” by the DTA, which means that investors can make business decisions with greater confidence. To encourage greater inward investment, New Zealand has unilaterally reduced withholding taxes on certain returns from inbound investment. However, lowering tax rates in a bilateral treaty setting ensures that the rates are also reduced on a reciprocal basis by the DTA partner. This provides benefits to domestic investors. ANNEX III Governments. As double taxation distorts business decisions and generally hinders cross-border economic activity, most jurisdictions unilaterally relieve double taxation of their tax residents. For example, New Zealand tax legislation allows tax residents who derive foreign-sourced income, to credit the foreign tax paid against their New Zealand tax liability. However, DTAs provide more comprehensive relief from double taxation than is possible unilaterally and allow the cost of relieving double taxation to be shared. They do this by allocating taxing rights between the jurisdictions concerned. In addition, DTAs facilitate international cooperation between tax authorities. This is now a less significant role for DTAs than it once was, given that tax cooperation is now also provided for under a multilateral tax assistance treaty. 13. As DTAs are primarily concerned with taxation, they are negotiated and administered by Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue’s DTA negotiation programme seeks to strike a balance between updating and modernising existing DTAs with major trading and investment partners and entering into new agreements as opportunities arise. Generally, negotiations are prioritised on the basis of greatest benefit for New Zealand. Strategic and foreign policy considerations may be relevant to such prioritisation decisions. 14. New Zealand has recently negotiated a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the European Union (EU). DTAs with EU partner countries may help maximise the benefits of the FTA. New Zealand currently has DTAs with 13 of the 27 EU Member Countries, and the DTA with the Slovak Republic is one of several being progressed with the remaining 14. 15. The Slovak Republic is not a major trading and investment partner for New Zealand, though bilateral trade has increased significantly in recent years (albeit from a low base). While exports from New Zealand to the Slovak Republic were less than NZ$1m annually between 2010-2016, exports increased to between NZ$5m to NZ$9m more recently in 2017-2019. The total two-way trade between New Zealand and the Slovak Republic increased from around NZ$65- 85 million between 2014 and 2018, to around NZ$130m in both 2019 and 2020. Investment flows are considerably lower, less than NZ$1m per year in both directions for the same period. ANNEX III 16. There is potential for further growth, particularly if the DTA helps maximise the benefits of the EU FTA. The Slovak Republic is also a fellow small, open trading nation and, like New Zealand, a strong supporter of the multilateral system. The Slovak Republic’s membership in the OECD means that the OECD Council’s recommendation to pursue efforts to conclude bilateral DTAs with other member countries is relevant. 4. Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty entering into force and not entering into force 17. The Slovak DTA involves a trade-off between advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand. On balance, entering into the Slovak DTA is expected to be in New Zealand’s overall interests. Advantages of the treaty entering into force 18. The advantages to New Zealand of the Slovak DTA entering into force can be summarised as follows: • In concert with the recently negotiated EU FTA, the DTA can be expected to foster some forms of bilateral economic activity (such as services, trade and investment). This will benefit New Zealand in terms of employment and business opportunities and offshore earnings. • For New Zealand business interests, the DTA will reduce the cost of importing capital. • For investors in both jurisdictions, the DTA will reduce compliance costs and provide the certainty of low headline withholding tax rates, locked in by the DTA. • For investors, businesses and taxpayers from both jurisdictions, the DTA will provide safeguards such as a mutual agreement procedure, which will facilitate the resolution of tax disputes (including disputes in complex areas such as transfer pricing). ANNEX III • For taxpayers engaged in certain short-term income-earning activities in the other jurisdiction, the DTA will reduce compliance costs and provide cash- flow advantages by eliminating the need to pay tax in that jurisdiction and then claim that tax against their tax liability in their home jurisdiction. • For New Zealand, the DTA will provide an equitable framework for sharing the cost of relieving double taxation between the two jurisdictions. • In some circumstances, New Zealand will no longer need to provide credits for foreign tax paid. • A final advantage of the Slovak DTA is that New Zealand and the Slovak Republic both favour a greater focus on source taxation (as opposed to residence taxation). As a result, New Zealand was able to secure agreement on our key negotiating positions. The Slovak DTA also includes all of the key base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) model anti-abuse provisions. The Slovak DTA therefore represents a good precedent for New Zealand in future negotiations with other countries. Disadvantages of the treaty entering into force 19. As noted above, DTAs offer bilateral solutions to problems that are difficult or impossible to solve unilaterally. However, a potential downside to DTAs is that those solutions are then locked in place by the DTA and can be difficult and costly to change. This can create difficulties if DTA provisions need to be changed urgently. Practical experience indicates that in genuine cases, DTA partners are usually amenable to making necessary changes. However, in extreme cases, if the DTA partner were to refuse to cooperate, the DTA might need to be terminated. 20. A second general disadvantage of DTAs is that they typically give rise to an upfront revenue cost. This is because DTAs allocate taxing rights between the two jurisdictions and lower withholding tax rates on investment returns. The allocation of taxing rights means that New Zealand will lose the ability to tax some income streams to the extent that it could previously (this applies on a reciprocal basis). However, any upfront costs will be mitigated to the extent that ANNEX III the DTA fosters increased cross-border economic activity. Further, as noted below in section 8 “Costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty”, in the case of the Slovak Republic, the upfront revenue costs are expected to be negligible. 21. A third general disadvantage of DTAs is the potential for abuse, in particular, as regards “treaty shopping” or use of DTAs in tax planning techniques designed to reduce taxation in unintended ways. However, the Slovak DTA incorporates the key model anti-abuse provisions which have arisen out of the international BEPS work to provide protection against abuse. Advantages of the treaty not entering into force 22. Not bringing the Slovak DTA into force is an option. In that case, the disadvantages identified above will not arise. Disadvantages of the treaty not entering into force 23. If the Slovak DTA does not enter into force the possibilities for increased trade, investment and other economic activity, particularly those that may open as a consequence of the EU FTA, may not be maximised to their full potential. 5. Legal obligations which would be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position in respect of reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms Summary of key legal obligations 24. DTAs do not impose requirements on taxpayers. The obligations DTAs impose only apply to the respective Governments, requiring both to restrict their taxing rights on a reciprocal basis. When income is derived from one country (the source jurisdiction) by a tax resident of the other country (the residence jurisdiction), the residence jurisdiction generally retains taxing rights under the DTA. The main impact of the DTA is to restrict the ability of the source jurisdiction to tax the income in certain circumstances. 25. The key allocation of taxing rights in the Slovak DTA is as follows: ANNEX III • Business profits of an enterprise will be taxable only in the jurisdiction in which the enterprise is resident, unless profits are derived through a permanent establishment in the source jurisdiction. In that case, the profits may also be taxed in the source jurisdiction (Article 7 refers). The term “permanent establishment” is generally defined in the Slovak DTA as meaning a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on. However, this general rule is supplemented by a number of clarifications and deeming rules which follow New Zealand’s preferred formula, and which will ensure that New Zealand can continue to impose tax on significant business activities such as natural resource exploration or exploitation (Article 5 refers). • Investment returns (dividends, interest and royalties) may generally be taxed in both jurisdictions. However, the amount of withholding tax that can be imposed by the source jurisdiction is limited to 5% for dividends if the dividend is paid to a company that directly owns at least 10% of the voting power of the company paying the dividends, 15% for all other dividends (Article 10 refers), and 10% for interest and royalties (Articles 11 and 12 refer). The limitation does not apply if the dividends, interest or royalties are derived in connection with a permanent establishment in the source jurisdiction. Article 11 of the Slovak DTA also contains an exemption for interest derived by certain government entities, provided the government entity does not directly or indirectly hold more than 10 per cent of the voting power in the payer of the interest. This is in line with New Zealand’s policy to provide sovereign immunity from tax only for passive investment activity, where the investment itself is not in competition with private investment. New Zealand’s DTA policy is that sovereign immunity from tax should not be available where the Government owns an active business to ensure the exemption cannot be used to strip profits out of New Zealand through interest payments. • Income from employment will be taxable only in the jurisdiction in which the employee is resident unless he or she is present in the source jurisdiction ANNEX III for more than six months in a twelve-month period or the employer is a resident of the source jurisdiction (or is non-resident but the employee’s remuneration is borne by a permanent establishment in the source jurisdiction). In those latter cases, the employment income may also be taxed in the source jurisdiction (Article 14 refers). • Pensions will generally be taxable only in the jurisdiction in which the recipient is resident (Article 17 refers). 26. A number of exceptions to the above rules also apply. These include: • Income from real property (referred to as “immovable property” in the Slovak DTA) will always be taxable in the jurisdiction where the property is situated (Articles 6 and 13 refer). • Profits of an enterprise from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic will be taxable only in the jurisdiction in which the enterprise is resident. However, profits from domestic carriage by ship or aircraft will always be taxable in the source jurisdiction (Articles 8 and 13 refer). • Directors’ fees will always be taxable in the jurisdiction in which the company paying the fees is resident (Article 15 refers). • Income from the activities of entertainers and sportspersons will generally be taxable in the source jurisdiction, regardless of whether the entertainer or sportsperson’s residence country also has a taxing right (Article 16 refers). If the visit is wholly or mainly supported by the public funds of either state, then it is taxable only in the residence country. • Salaries and wages for services to a Government of one jurisdiction will generally be exempt from tax in the other jurisdiction. (Article 18 refers.) 27. Where the allocation of taxing rights permits both jurisdictions to tax an item of income, the Slovak DTA will require New Zealand to relieve double taxation of its residents by allowing a credit for the tax paid in the Slovak Republic (Article 21 refers). This is consistent with the unilateral relief mechanism that ANNEX III already applies under New Zealand domestic law. The obligation also applies reciprocally, so the Slovak Republic must allow its residents a credit for New Zealand tax paid. 28. The non-discrimination provision also requires that New Zealand does not subject nationals of the Slovak Republic to a greater tax burden than New Zealand nationals would be subject to in the same circumstances, in particular with regard to residence (Article 22 refers). This requirement applies to both taxation and connected requirements. Additional non-discrimination rules apply with respect to permanent establishments, deductions and New Zealand companies that are wholly or partly owned or controlled by residents of the Slovak Republic. This provision does not apply to rules designed to prevent the avoidance or evasion of taxes. The non-discrimination obligations are reciprocal. 29. In addition to the above obligations, New Zealand will be required to comply with various administrative requirements imposed by the Slovak DTA. These are as follows: • Mutual agreement procedure. New Zealand must comply with the procedures for settling disputes set out in the mutual agreement procedure Article of the Slovak DTA (Article 23 refers). This is discussed below, in the section Dispute resolution. • Exchange of information. The Slovak DTA includes an Article that provides for the exchange of tax-related information between tax authorities, for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax evasion and tax avoidance (Article 24 refers). However, the Exchange of Information provisions in the DTA do not create any new legal obligations beyond those already applying under a multilateral tax assistance convention to which New Zealand and the Slovak Republic are already party. • Assistance in collection. The Slovak DTA includes an Article that provides that New Zealand shall lend assistance to the Slovak Republic in the collection of their revenue taxes. However, the Assistance in Collection provisions in the DTA do not create any new legal obligations beyond those ANNEX III already applying under a multilateral tax assistance convention to which New Zealand and the Slovak Republic are already party. Dispute resolution 30. The Slovak DTA establishes a “mutual agreement procedure” for resolving disputes. Under this procedure, a taxpayer who considers that they have been taxed incorrectly under the DTA, including in transfer pricing cases, can approach their local tax authority under Article 23 to invoke a mutual agreement procedure. If the tax authority considers the case to be justified, and is unable to resolve the case through its own actions, it must approach the tax authority of the other jurisdiction to seek a bilateral resolution. This bipartisan approach is particularly appropriate in the DTA context because a single issue will generally affect a person’s tax position in both jurisdictions. Note that under the mutual agreement procedure the two sides are only obliged to “endeavour” to reach resolution. However, the taxpayer remains free to pursue a case through the Courts (including if they do not agree with the decision reached under the mutual agreement procedure). 31. The mutual agreement procedure also authorises the tax authorities of the two jurisdictions to collectively resolve any difficulties or doubts about the correct interpretation or application of the Slovak DTA. Reservations 32. The Slovak DTA does not allow parties to make reservations upon ratification. Reservations typically only feature in multilateral treaties. When permitted, they effectively enable a party to specify which treaty obligations they are committing to. However, reservations typically do not feature in bilateral treaties like the Slovak DTA. 6. Measures which the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including specific reference to implementing legislation 33. Subject to the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the Slovak DTA will be incorporated into New Zealand legislation by ANNEX III an Order in Council made pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 provides for the giving of overriding effect to DTAs by Order in Council. However, the override relates only to tax matters, and only the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1993 may be overridden. 34. The override of the Inland Revenue Acts is necessary to give effect to the core provisions of the Slovak DTA, which provide relief from tax that would otherwise be imposed under domestic law. The override of the Official Information Act 1982 is necessary to ensure that confidential communications with the other jurisdiction do not have to be disclosed. The override of the Privacy Act 1993 is necessary to ensure that information regarding natural persons can be exchanged according to the terms of the DTA. 35. Article 28 of the Slovak DTA provides for the agreement to be brought into force through an exchange of diplomatic notes between the Contracting States. The Slovak DTA will enter into force on the first day of the third month following the date of receipt of the later diplomatic note. New Zealand will be able to notify the Slovak Republic that all procedures required by domestic law have been completed once the Order in Council has entered into force, which will be 28 days after its publication in the New Zealand Gazette. 36. Thereafter, the provisions of the Slovak DTA will have effect from various dates, according to the terms of the DTA. In New Zealand, the provisions relating to withholding taxes will take effect on the first day of January of the calendar year following the year in which the DTA enters into force. The provisions relating to other taxes will have effect for income years beginning on or after 1 April next following the date on which the DTA enters into force. 37. As an alternative to the above Order in Council mechanism, the Slovak DTA could be given legislative effect by means of the enactment of a dedicated statute. However, this option would unnecessarily increase the amount of primary tax legislation required and is not preferred. ANNEX III 7. Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action 38. As noted elsewhere in this National Interest Analysis, the overall economic effects of the Slovak DTA are expected to be favourable to New Zealand. This is because the Slovak DTA can be expected to encourage growth in trade and investment between New Zealand and the Slovak Republic. It is not possible to quantify the economic benefits but, as noted below, the costs of entering into the DTA are expected to be negligible, and overall the benefits of the Slovak DTA are expected to outweigh the costs. 39. No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. 8. Costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty 40. DTAs constrain New Zealand from taxing certain income and limit the rate at which tax on dividends, royalties and interest can be imposed, and therefore typically can be expected, prima facie, to result in some reduction of New Zealand tax. 41. This potential upfront revenue cost is typically offset by other factors. For example, there will be an offsetting effect to the New Zealand tax base from the reduction of tax in the Slovak Republic, and the reduced need for New Zealand to allow foreign tax credits. There will also be some revenue gains from the expected reduction in tax evasion and tax avoidance resulting from the DTA exchange of information provisions. 42. Data limitations prevent officials from accurately estimating the actual revenue cost of the Slovak DTA. However, due to the limited existing trade and investment flows between the Slovak Republic and New Zealand, any reduction of New Zealand tax is expected to be negligible. 43. In general, as discussed above, DTAs are also expected to give rise to favourable economic benefits, such as increased cross-border services, trade and investment. Again, officials cannot quantify the expected economic benefits of the Slovak DTA but, overall, the benefits are expected to outweigh the costs. ANNEX III 44. Compliance costs for New Zealand businesses are expected to be reduced under the Slovak DTA. 9. Completed or proposed consultation with the community and parties interested in the treaty action 45. The Treasury and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade were consulted about the content of this extended National Interest Analysis. 46. No specific private sector consultation was undertaken. Consistent with international practice, officials generally do not consult on the content of tax treaties. With the exception of a few countries, most jurisdictions do not make their negotiating models public and, therefore, negotiations are also considered to be confidential. 47. The Government sets New Zealand’s strategic priorities in relation to tax treaties and New Zealand’s negotiating model reflects these priorities. 48. New Zealand’s negotiating model is also based on a model tax convention published by the OECD (the OECD Model Tax Convention). As issues are discussed and considered for inclusion in the update to the OECD Model Tax Convention, the OECD seeks feedback from the public, including the OECD’s Business and Industry Advisory Committee (BIAC) which consists of business representatives from around the world. Accordingly, while officials have not specifically consulted the private sector on the Slovak DTA, feedback has been provided (including by interested parties from New Zealand) on the provisions on which New Zealand’s negotiating model is based. 49. There is also a long-standing informal practice whereby practitioners contact Inland Revenue regarding specific issues with New Zealand’s existing DTAs as they arise. This feedback is also used to improve New Zealand’s negotiating model and potentially inform future negotiations. 10. Subsequent protocols and/or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects 50. No further amendments are anticipated at this time. New Zealand will consider future amendments on a case-by-case basis. Any amendments to the Slovak ANNEX III DTA will be subject to the normal domestic approvals and procedures. While there is no amendment clause in the Slovak DTA, amendment would be subject to the usual requirements of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. 51. An accompanying Protocol forms an integral part of the Slovak DTA and was signed at the same time as the main DTA text. Countries often prefer clarifying provisions and departures from their standard DTA model to be located in an accompanying Protocol. 52. While there is no formal review planned for the Slovak DTA, the competent authorities for each country remain in contact to resolve any interpretation and application issues. In addition, taxpayers and practitioners are able to raise such issues with the competent authorities. In the case of New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is the competent authority and the appropriate contact details can be found on the Inland Revenue website. 11. Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty 53. Under Article 29 of the Slovak DTA, after the expiry of five years from the date of entry into force, either party may terminate the agreement by giving written notice of termination through diplomatic channels. The termination would take effect: • for withholding taxes, for amounts paid on or after the first day of January in the calendar year following the receipt of the notice of termination; and • for other taxes, for income years beginning on or after 1 April in the calendar year following the receipt of notice of termination. 54. Article 29 generally follows the approach used in New Zealand’s other DTAs. 12. Agency disclosure statement 55. Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this extended National Interest Analysis, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet. ANNEX III 56. Inland Revenue has analysed the issue of implementing the Slovak DTA, and the legislative and regulatory proposals arising from that implementation. As part of that process, Inland Revenue considered the option of not entering into the DTA. Inland Revenue is of the view that there are no significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis. There are no areas of incompatibility with the “Government expectations for good regulatory practice”. 57. The allocation of taxing rights under the Slovak DTA is consistent with the New Zealand negotiating model, which in turn is based on the OECD’s Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital. The revenue cost to New Zealand as a result of the allocation of taxing rights under the DTA is expected to be negligible, given the limited existing trade and investment flows between New Zealand and the Slovak Republic. 58. If the Slovak DTA is entered into, officials expect compliance costs will decrease, administration costs will increase (but only at the margins), and bilateral trade and investment may increase. However, due to data limitations and, particularly in the case of bilateral trade and investment, uncertainty about behavioural responses, officials are unable to quantify the impacts, although they are likely to be minor or small. 59. The Treasury and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been consulted about the content of this extended NIA. However, consistent with standard international practice, no wider consultation was undertaken. 60. Inland Revenue is also constrained in terms of its ability to monitor the impact of entering into the new DTA to determine whether the impacts anticipated, such as reductions in evasion and avoidance activity and compliance costs, actually materialise. 61. Inland Revenue’s view is that the policy options considered will not impose additional costs on business interests; nor impair private property rights, market competition, or the incentives for business to innovate and invest; nor override fundamental common law principles.

Negligent advice regarding a transfer of land attracting tax liabilities
========================================================================

2017 case note - transfer of a property which attracted adverse tax consequences – negligent advice, derivation of income.

Case

Craig Duthie and Kirsten Taylor-Ruiterman v Denise Michelle Roose \[2017\] NZSC 152

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2007, s BD 3, CB 14, GC 1; High Court Rules, r 10.15

### Summary

This case is an appeal of the Court of Appeal decision in _Roose v Duthie_ \[2016\] NZCA 600. It concerned a transfer of a property which attracted adverse tax consequences. The collective respondents sought damages from the collective appellants on the basis they were given negligent advice. The Court had to consider whether a cause of action accrued (because a tax liability arose) once the sale and purchase agreement became unconditional, or later, when it was settled. The Court held that, the loss (and therefore the cause of action) arose when the income from the transaction was derived. This occurred, in accordance with general principles of derivation, when the transfer was effected (at settlement date) on 2 May 2008. The Attorney-General was invited as intervener in these proceedings.

### Impact

The Supreme Court is willing to involve the Attorney-General on matters of public relevance/importance when they are not a party to proceedings.

The Court confirmed the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s (“the Commissioner”) current position on the derivation of income in land transactions.

### Facts

The property in issue was acquired by Denise Developments Limited (“DDL”) in 2006. DDL subdivided the property into seven sections.

In early 2008, Ms Roose sought advice from Mr Duthie regarding the proposed transfer of the property from DDL to a trust. She claimed that Mr Duthie negligently advised her that such a transfer would not attract income tax and the sale would be zero rated for goods and services tax (“GST”) purposes.

A new trust was formed and DMR Development Limited (“DMR”) was incorporated to act as its trustee. On 14 April 2008 DDL and DMR entered into an agreement under which DDL was to sell, and DMR to purchase the property, for $1,950,000. The agreement provided that on settlement DMR would provide a deed of acknowledgment of debt for the purchase price under which demand for payment could not be made for five years. Settlement was to take place on 21 April 2008, but was later varied by agreement. Settlement was effected electronically on 2 May 2008.

As a result of an audit, the Commissioner determined that DDL’s taxable activity was property development, reassessed DDL’s income tax for the 2009 year and imposed a shortfall penalty.

The respondents contended that had Ms Roose been properly advised by Mr Duthie, DDL would not have transferred the land, and subsequently not incur an unnecessary tax liability as a result of the sale.

### Decision

Toogood J, in the High Court had concluded that when DDL entered into the agreement on 14 April 2008 there was a commitment to a loss at that point (being either a tax liability or the costs associated to prevent that loss). Accordingly, the limitation period began to run from the moment.

Applying the decision in _Thom v Davys Burton_ \[2008\] NZSC 65, \[2009\] 1 NZLR 437 (“_Thom_”) his Honour confirmed that the loss did not arise on transfer (2 May 2008) but when the parties entered into binding legal obligations.

The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, distinguishing this case from _Thom_ on the basis that this was a “no transaction” case. Briefly, the respondents would not have entered into the transaction but for the negligent advice. The Court concluded that DDL’s tax liability arose on 2 May 2008 when the transfer from DDL to DMR was registered. The Court identified that the cause of action accrued when the tax liability arose; damage could be anticipated, but had not been incurred until that point. The Court, referring to _Mills v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (1985) 7 NZTC 5,025 (HC) (“_Mills_”), _Gasparin v Commissioner of Taxation_ (1994) 50 FCR 73 (“_Gasparin_”) and _Ruddenklau v Charlesworth_ \[1925\] NZLR 161 (HC) (“_Ruddenklau_”) considered the tax liability arose on transfer and dismissed the argument that the tax implications became inevitable once the agreement was entered into by the parties.

The Supreme Court observed that for the purposes of this case they were prepared to accept that disposal of the relevant land occurred when the Sale and Purchase Agreement went unconditional on 14 April 2008 (consistent with _Mills_).

Considering the principles of income derivation, the Supreme Court confirmed that under an unconditional contract for the sale of land, the vendor is entitled to seek specific performance. However, referring to _Ruddenklau_, the Court noted that a right to seek specific performance is not the same as the right to sue for the purchase price as a debt. The Supreme Court, relying on _Gasparin_, confirmed that income is derived at settlement when a debt accrues to the vendor (and not when the vendor is entitled to specific performance).

The appellants argued that the property was sold for less than market value and therefore s GC 1 applied. Consequently, s GC 1 deemed the vendor to have derived the market value (income) when disposal occurred. The Court considered that s GC 1(2) identifies the time at which market value is determined (at disposal) but not the timing of derivation of resulting income, which is determined by reference to the general principles of derivation.

Consequently, the Court found that a tax liability, and thus the cause of action, did not accrue until the date of settlement on 2 May 2008.

The Court also dismissed the argument that unwinding the agreement would have resulted in tax evasion, with severe penalties attached, on the basis that if the respondents had decided not to proceed to settlement, no income would have been derived and therefore no accrual of a liability to tax.

The Court made obiter comments on the nature of “wasted costs” but dismissed any advancement of the argument. The Court agreed with the approach of the Court of Appeal in regards to the “unwind costs” in that had a realisation of the true position occurred before 2 May 2008, there would have been no settlement and the liability would not have arisen.

#### Result

The appeal was dismissed. The appellants were ordered to pay the respondents costs of $25,000 and reasonable disbursements.

Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2004 and to the Double Tax Convention between the Netherlands and New Zealand, which appears in Schedule 1 to the Double Taxation Relief (Netherlands) Order 1981, S.R. 1981/43 (“the Double Tax Convention”). This Ruling applies in respect of Article 19(2) of the Double Tax Convention. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the periodic payment of a Netherlands social security pension to a person who is a resident of New Zealand for tax purposes. This person may be a national of the Netherlands, or of New Zealand, or of both countries. For the purposes of this Ruling the word “national” has the meanings attributed to it by Article 3(1)(h) of the Double Tax Convention. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: • When a New Zealand tax resident receives a Netherlands social security pension, and that person is also a New Zealand citizen, the pension is taxable only in New Zealand. • When a New Zealand tax resident, who is not a New Zealand citizen, receives a Netherlands social security pension, the pension may be subject to tax in both the Netherlands and New Zealand; with the Commissioner giving a credit for tax paid in the Netherlands in accordance with New Zealand’s foreign tax credit rules. 2 The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for an indefinite period beginning on 1 December 2006. This Ruling is signed by me on the 21 st day of December 2007. Susan Price Senior Tax Counsel 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 07/10 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in public ruling BR Pub 07/10 (the Ruling). Background The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in Public Rulings BR Pub 03/01 (Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 15, No. 2 (February 2003)) and BR Pub 98/6 (Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 10, No 12 ( December 1998)). The Ruling has been amended to take into account the introduction of the Income Tax Act 2004. This Ruling clarifies New Zealand’s jurisdiction to tax pensions paid by the Netherlands, including when New Zealand's right to do so is an exclusive right. There has been some confusion about the New Zealand tax treatment of social security pensions paid by the Netherlands Government to people living in New Zealand. Some taxpayers believe the pensions are not taxable in New Zealand if the recipients are not New Zealand citizens. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2004, unless otherwise specified. Legislation Section BD 1(2) reads as follows: Exempt income (2) An amount of income of a person is exempt income if it is their exempt income under a provision in subpart CW (Exempt income) or CZ (Terminating provisions). Section CW 23(1) and (2) reads as follows: Exempt income (1) The following are exempt income: ... (e) an overseas pension. Meaning of overseas pension (2) In this section, overseas pension means - (a) an overseas pension, to the extent of sums subtracted under section 70 of the Social Security Act 1964, by the department currently responsible for administering the Act, from – (i) a monetary benefit paid under Part 1 of the Act; or (ii) a monetary benefit, other than New Zealand superannuation or a veteran’s pension, paid under the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1990: (b) an overseas pension to the extent to which it is subject to an arrangement under section 70(3) of the Social Security Act 1964 but not to the extent of the equivalent amount of New Zealand superannuation, veteran’s pension, or income-tested benefit paid under section 70(3)(b) of the Act. 4 Article 19(2) of the Double Taxation Convention (in schedule 1 to the Double Taxation Relief (Netherlands) Order 1981) reads as follows: a. Any pension paid by, or out of funds created by, one of the States or a political subdivision or a local authority thereof to an individual in respect of services rendered to that State or subdivision or authority and any pension paid to an individual under the social security scheme of one of the States, may be taxed in that State. b. However, such pension shall be taxable only in the State of which the individual is a resident if he is a national of that State. Article 3(1)(h) of the Double Taxation Convention defines the term “national” to mean: 1. in the case of the Netherlands, any individual possessing the nationality of the Netherlands, and any legal person, partnership and association deriving its status as such from the laws in force in the Netherlands; 2. in the case of New Zealand, any individual possessing citizenship of New Zealand and any legal person, partnership and association deriving its status as such from the laws in force in New Zealand. Article X of the Protocol to the Double Tax Convention states: X. With reference to Articles 18 and 19 It is understood that the term “pensions and other similar remuneration” includes only periodical payments. Application of the Legislation Under the Income Tax Act 2004, persons who are resident in New Zealand are subject to New Zealand tax on their worldwide income. Double Tax Conventions and Agreements with other countries override the Income Tax Act and determine which country has jurisdiction to tax the income in question. Among other issues, the Double Tax Convention between the Netherlands and New Zealand determines the tax treatment of periodic pensions paid by an organisation in one country to residents of the other country. Article 18 of the Double Tax Convention sets out which country has the jurisdiction to tax pensions paid by one country to the residents of the other country. This Article, however, does not apply to pensions paid out: • under social security schemes; or • for services rendered to the country paying the pension. Article 19 deals with these two classes of pension. Article 19(2) states that a social security pension may be taxed by the country from which it is paid but the pension shall be taxed only in the country in which the recipient of the pension is resident if the recipient is also a national of the country of residence. Therefore, a social security pension paid to a New Zealand tax resident who is also a national of New Zealand may be taxed only in New Zealand. 5 However, if the recipient is a New Zealand tax resident, but is not a New Zealand citizen, New Zealand does not have an exclusive right to tax the pension. In those circumstances the Double Tax Convention does not restrict either the Netherlands or New Zealand from taxing the pension and the pension could be taxed in both the Netherlands and New Zealand under their domestic law. Persons who are not New Zealand citizens and have tax deducted by the Government of the Netherlands from their Netherlands social security pensions are entitled to tax credits under section LC 1. When this occurs the Commissioner will, in accordance with New Zealand’s foreign tax credit rules, give the recipient a tax credit for the tax paid in the Netherlands. However, these tax credits cannot exceed the amount of tax due in New Zealand. Residence and Nationality Article 4 of the Double Tax Convention sets out rules for determining the residence (for the purpose of the Double Tax Convention) of a person who is resident for tax purposes in both the Netherlands and New Zealand under their domestic law. The term “national” in the case of New Zealand is defined in the Double Tax Convention as: ... any individual possessing citizenship of New Zealand and any legal person, partnership and association deriving its status as such from the laws in force in New Zealand (The rules determining how New Zealand citizenship is acquired are set out in the Citizenship Act 1977.) Hence, under the Double Tax Convention a person who is a citizen of New Zealand is a national of New Zealand. Accordingly, under Article 19(2)(b) of the Double Tax Convention New Zealand has an exclusive right to tax a Dutch social security pension when the recipient is determined to be a New Zealand tax resident under Article 4 and is also a New Zealand citizen. (This will be so whether or not that person is also a Dutch national. In the case of dual nationality, the recipient will still satisfy the requirements of Article 19(2)(b) – New Zealand tax residency and New Zealand citizenship – and the additional fact of possessing Dutch nationality does not alter the conclusion that only New Zealand may tax the pension.) Liability to tax under New Zealand domestic law The Double Tax Convention need not be considered unless an amount of Netherlands pension is taxable under New Zealand domestic law. A Netherlands pension could be fully or partly exempt from tax under section CW 23 of the Income Tax Act 2004. Section CW 23(2)(a) may apply where the New Zealand benefit payable to a Netherlands pensioner has been reduced in terms of section 70(1) of the Social Security Act 1964. Section 70(1) of the Social Security Act 1964 applies where the recipient of a Netherlands pension is also entitled to a benefit of a similar nature under New Zealand social welfare legislation. In that event the New Zealand benefit is to be reduced by the amount of a Netherlands pension and the effect of section CW 23(2)(a) is as follows: • When the amount of the New Zealand superannuation or veteran’s pension payable has been reduced by the amount of a Netherlands pension under section 70(1) of the Social 6 Security Act 1964, section CW 23(2)(a) does not apply. Therefore, the full amount of the Netherlands pension is taxable under New Zealand domestic law. • However,when an entitlement to another type of New Zealand benefit has been reduced by the amount of a Netherlands pension, the Netherlands pension is exempt income under section CW 23(2)(a) to the extent that the New Zealand benefit has been reduced. Therefore, when a deduction from a New Zealand benefit entitlement has been made under section 70(1) of the Social Security Act 1964 and the amount of a Netherlands pension exceeds the amount of the New Zealand benefit entitlement, the amount exceeding the New Zealand benefit entitlement is taxable under New Zealand domestic law. (Note: the section CW 23 exemption does not apply to New Zealand superannuation and veterans’ pensions. They are specifically excluded from this section and are assessable income). Section CW 23(2)(b) applies when an arrangement has been made in respect of an overseas pension under section 70(3) of the Social Security Act 1964. Under section 70(3) of the Social Security Act 1964 an arrangement may be made to pay the full amount of an overseas pension to the chief executive of the department responsible for administering that Act (which is currently the Ministry of Social Development ) in order to receive the full rate of a benefit payment under that Act, the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1990, Part 6 of the War Pensions Act 1954 or the New Zealand Superannuation and Retirement Income Act 2001. This option is available to recipients of Netherlands pensions from 1 July 2002 under the Social Security (Alternative Arrangement for Overseas Pensions) Amendment Regulations 2002. When such an arrangement is made, the Netherlands pension is not taxable under New Zealand domestic law (but the equivalent amount of the New Zealand benefit would be taxable under section CW 23(2)(b)). Example 1 A taxpayer is a Dutch citizen who immigrated to New Zealand two years ago. He receives a Netherlands social security pension. He has not become a New Zealand citizen, but is a tax resident of New Zealand. Both New Zealand and the Netherlands may tax his pension. New Zealand will grant him a tax credit for the tax charged on the pension by the Netherlands. Example 2 A taxpayer has Dutch nationality and immigrated to New Zealand five years ago. She receives a Netherlands social security pension. However, unlike the taxpayer in Example 1, she has become a New Zealand citizen. Only New Zealand may tax the social security pension that she receives from the Netherlands.

[Changes to the GST rules](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-gst-and-remedial-matters-act-2010/changes-to-the-gst-rules "Changes to the GST rules")

New apportionment rules
=======================

Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 amends the GST rules on apportionment, reducing compliance costs for businesses and requiring fewer adjustments.

For GST purposes, the amount of an input tax deduction that can be claimed by a GST-registered purchaser for acquired goods and services should relate to the taxable use of the goods and services.

This is achieved by allowing GST-registered persons to claim a full input tax deduction for GST paid on goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies.

If the goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies are used partly or entirely for another purpose, for example, for private and exempt purposes (non-taxable purposes), the GST Act treats the non-taxable use of goods and services as a taxable supply by the registered person, and output tax is charged accordingly.

Conversely, goods and services acquired principally for a non-taxable purpose (for which the GST-registered person is not entitled to an input tax deduction) could be partly or entirely used to make taxable supplies. In these circumstances, the GST Act allows a deduction to reflect that taxable use.

This approach of taxing the "self supply" of goods and services ignores the original input tax deduction claimed by the GST-registered person as the change-in-use adjustments do not relate to the amount of the deduction claimed on acquisition. This is because the use of goods and services for a non-principal purpose is deemed to be a supply which is separate from the purchase transaction.

Another aspect of the GST rules is that there is no statutory limit on the maximum number of adjustments that have to be made, so the number of adjustments required can be excessive relative to the amounts involved. In addition, since change-in-use adjustments do not relate to the amount of the initial input tax deduction, the value of adjustments that a person is required to make can potentially amount to more than the original GST paid on the purchase. Conversely the value of the deduction received by means of change-in-use adjustments can sometimes exceed the amount of GST originally paid.

Because of the detachment between the initial input tax claimed on acquisition and the subsequent change-in-use adjustments, the rules for imposing GST on mixed use assets have not been sufficiently clear for many taxpayers.

Other issues concerning the current approach were raised by the Court of Appeal decision in _Lundy_ (2005) 22 NZTC 19 at 637, which involved land being used concurrently for taxable (advertised for sale) and non-taxable (generating rental income) purposes.

Proposals to reform the change-in-use adjustments rules were initially outlined in an officials' issues paper, _Options for strengthening GST neutrality in business-to-business transactions_, released in June 2008. In the 2009 discussion document, _GST: Accounting for land and other high-value assets_, the Government proposed to replace the change-in-use adjustment approach with one that would apportion input tax deductions in line with the actual use of the goods and services. The new apportionment rules contained in the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 have therefore been the subject of extensive consultation and incorporate various amendments that arose during the policy development process.

Overall, the new rules are intended to reduce compliance costs for businesses by being simpler and requiring fewer adjustments.

### Key features

The new rules replace the current adjustment approach with an approach that apportions input tax deductions in line with the actual use of the goods and services. In summary, the rules operate as follows:

*   On acquisition, unless an exclusion applies, the portion of a deduction that a registered person can claim must correspond with the portion of the asset's use that is intended for taxable purposes.
*   In subsequent years, a person may be required to adjust the deduction claimed if the extent to which the asset is used for taxable purposes is different from the intended taxable use of the asset. A number of exemptions have been introduced to relieve a person from the requirement to make an adjustment if the amount of tax involved in the adjustment is low.
*   The maximum number of adjustments that a person may be required to make varies according to the asset's value or estimated useful life.
*   Special "wash-up" rules apply when goods and services that have been subject to the apportionment rules are sold or the person deregisters.
*   Special rules also apply to assets used concurrently for taxable and non-taxable purposes.

### Application dates

The new rules will apply to goods and services acquired after 1 April 2011.

For goods and services acquired before 1 April 2011, registered persons will be required to continue making change-in-use adjustments under the current rules. The obligation to make adjustments will, however, be limited by new section 21H for all supplies other than those that wholly or partly consist of land:

*   For goods or services whose market value or book value on 1 April 2011 is $5,000 or less, no adjustment under the old rules may be made after 1 April 2011.
*   For goods or services whose market value or book value on 1 April 2011 is more than $5,000 but not more than $10,000, no adjustment under the old rules may be made after 1 April 2013.
*   For goods or services whose market value or book value on 1 April 2011 is more than $10,000, no adjustment under the old rules may be made after 1 April 2016.

Once the time limit for an asset is reached, the person must stop making any adjustments for change-in-use in respect of that asset.

### Detailed analysis

#### _Apportionment of input tax on acquisition_

##### _Acquisition of standard-rated goods and services_

Under new section 20(3C), a purchaser can deduct input tax on the acquisition of goods and services to the extent to which the goods or services are used for, or are available for use in, making taxable supplies.

In determining the extent to which goods or services are used for making taxable supplies, a person must estimate on acquisition how they intend to use the goods or services, and choose a determination method that provides a fair and reasonable result (new section 20(3G)). The estimate could be made on the basis of any records that are available, previous experience, business plans or other suitable methods. The method of working out the extent of intended taxable use will largely depend on the nature of the goods and services in question. For example, if the asset is a car which is intended to replace an existing car used in the business, the logbook for the previous car could be a reasonable method of stipulating the intended use of the purchased car provided patterns of use were largely unchanged.

The estimated intended taxable use of the goods or services will determine the proportion of the input tax that can be deducted (new section 20(3H)).

New section 20(3D) is a _de minimis_ provision to relieve recipients from the obligation to apportion input tax on the acquisition of goods or services in certain circumstances. In a similar way to the current rules, recipients will not be required to apportion input tax if they make both taxable and exempt supplies and have reasonable grounds to believe that the total value of their exempt supplies in the first adjustment period will be no more than the lesser of $90,000 or 5% of the total consideration for all taxable and exempt supplies.[1](#01)

**Example 1**

John acquires a car for $23,000 (including GST of $3,000) to replace his existing car. The car will be used both in John's business as a sole trader and for private purposes.

The logbook kept by John for his old car shows that in the previous year he used the car 70% of the time for business purposes. Since John does not expect this ratio to substantially change in the future, he estimates that he will use the new car 70% for taxable purposes. Consequently, on acquisition John claims 70% of the available input tax using the formula in section 20(3H):

*   $3,000 × 70% = $2,100

**Example 2**

Safe Life Ltd (SL) is an insurance company that provides mostly life insurance policies (exempt supplies), but also provides a range of other insurance covers (taxable supplies). SL purchases 100 computers for a total consideration of $240,000 (including GST of $31,304).

On acquisition, SL may only claim the portion of the input tax that corresponds with the intended taxable use of the computers. SL estimates that in the 12 months prior to the purchase, 70% of all its supplies were exempt supplies of life insurance policies and 30% of its supplies were taxable supplies of other insurance covers. As a result, SL determines that the computers will be used 30% of the time for the purpose of making taxable supplies and claims 30% of the input tax paid in respect of the computers:

*   $31,304 × 30% = $9.391

**Example 3**

A corner dairy spends $6,000 (exclusive of GST) on renovations.

The major part of the dairy's business involves making taxable supplies. However, the dairy also runs a debtors' account and charges interest on any late payments (exempt supplies). Since the total value of the interest charged (exempt supplies) in the first adjustment period is expected to be no more than the lesser of $90,000 or 5% of the total consideration for all taxable and exempt supplies made by the dairy, the dairy is not required to apportion the input tax in relation to the renovations.

##### _Acquisition of zero-rated goods and services_

The Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 introduces new rules that require suppliers of land, or supplies that include land, to charge GST on the supply at the rate of zero percent in certain circumstances.

New section 20(3J) provides special rules that will allow recipients of zero-rated supplies to determine the GST component of a zero-rated acquisition and account for any non-taxable use of the goods. In the absence of the special rule, any non-taxable use of the land would remain unaccounted for.

Thus, on the acquisition of a zero-rated asset, the purchaser will be required to perform the following steps:

**Identify the nominal amount of tax**

First, the purchaser must identify the nominal amount of tax (the "nominal GST component") that would be chargeable on the value of the supply if the zero-rating rules did not apply and the supply was subject to the standard rate of GST.

**Determine the intended use of the supply**

The purchaser must then determine as a percentage the extent to which they intend to use the goods for making taxable supplies.

**Account for output tax, if any**

If the person estimates that they will not use the asset solely for making taxable supplies, the person must account as output tax for the proportion of the nominal GST component that is attributable to the non-taxable use of the goods.

**Example 4**

Safe Life Ltd (SL) from Example 2 acquires new headquarters for $30 million. There was no GST included in the supply as it is subject to the new zero-rating rules.

On acquisition, SL has to apply the rules in section 20(3J) as follows:

1.  Identify the amount of tax that would be chargeable on the value of the supply if the supply was subject to the standard rate of GST (the nominal GST component):  
    ($30m × 15% = $4,500,000)  
      
    
2.  Determine the extent to which they intend to use the headquarters for making taxable supplies.

SL estimates that 30% of its activity involves making taxable supplies.

3.  Account for the proportion of the nominal GST component that is attributable to the non-taxable use of the goods as an output tax:  
    $4,500,000 × 70% = $3,150,000

SL has to account for output tax of $3,150,000 on acquisition of the new headquarters.

**Example 5**

Eric purchases a building for $3 million. The supply to Eric is zero-rated.

Eric intends to rent the ground floor of the building to commercial tenants, and the upper floors of the building to residential tenants.

On acquisition, Eric has to apply the rules in section 20(3J):

1.  Identify the amount of tax that would be chargeable on the value of the supply if the supply was subject to the standard rate of GST (the nominal GST component):  
    $3m × 15% = $450,000  
      
    
2.  Determine the extent to which he intends to use the building for making taxable supplies.

Eric determines that he intends to use the building 60% in making taxable supplies (rent to commercial tenants) and 40% in making exempt supplies (rent to residential tenants).

3.  Account for the proportion of the nominal GST component that is attributable to the non-taxable use of the goods as output tax:  
    $450,000 × 40% = $180,000

Eric has to account for output tax of $180,000 on acquisition of the building.

#### _Subsequent adjustments for change-in-use_

The new rules seek to achieve as much "first instance" accuracy as possible by requiring taxpayers to make fair and reasonable estimates on the intended taxable and non-taxable uses of acquired goods and services. In an "adjustment period" following the initial input tax deduction claim, taxpayers may, however, be required to make further adjustments if the _actual_ taxable use of an asset is different from its _intended_ taxable use.

##### _"Adjustment period"_

An "adjustment period" (described in new section 21G(2)) is a period at the end of which a person is required to estimate whether an adjustment for a subsequent change-in-use is required. The first adjustment period is a period that starts on the date of acquisition and ends on the date as the person chooses that either corresponds to the person's first balance date that falls after the date of acquisition or to the person's first balance date that falls at least 12 months after the date of acquisition. All subsequent adjustment periods will be annual periods that start on the day after the end of the earlier adjustment period and end on the last day of the equivalent taxable period in which the first adjustment period ended.

**Example 6**

Mary purchases a car on 1 February 2012. Mary's balance date falls on 31 March.

The first adjustment period in respect of the car is, at Mary's option, either:

1.  the period from 1 February 2012 to 31 March 2012; or  
      
    
2.  the period from 1 February 2012 to 31 March 2013.

If Mary has chosen option 1 as her first adjustment period, the second adjustment period will run from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013.

If Mary has chosen option 2 as her first adjustment period, the second adjustment period will run from 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2014.

#### _Number of adjustment periods_

There will be a maximum number of adjustment periods for which adjustments will be required to be made. The default method for identifying the maximum number of adjustment periods is in new section 21G(4)(a) and requires the taxpayer to apply the following GST-exclusive bands of goods and services:

*   $5,001 to $10,000 - two adjustments
*   $10,001 to $500,000 - five adjustments
*   $500,001 or more - ten adjustments.

Alternatively, taxpayers will be able to select the maximum number of adjustments by reference to the estimated useful life of the asset as specified in the Tax Depreciation Rates Determinations set by the Commissioner under section 91AAF of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (new section 21G(4)(b)).

There will be no limit to adjustment periods in relation to land (new section 21G(5)).

##### _Exclusions from the obligation to make adjustments in an adjustment period_

No subsequent change-in-use adjustment will be required for goods and services acquired for the GST-exclusive value of $5,000 or less (new section 21(2)(b)).

**Example 7**

Sherry, a graphic designer, purchases a computer for $3,999 (including GST of $522) to use both for business and private purposes. She estimates that she will use the computer 80% for taxable purposes and claims a deduction of $418 (80% of $522).

Since the GST-exclusive value of the computer is less than $5,000, Sherry will not be required to make any adjustments for change-in-use in any of the subsequent adjustment periods.

For assets with a value of more than $5,000, no adjustment will be required in the relevant adjustment period if the recipient makes both taxable and exempt supplies and the total value of their exempt supplies in the adjustment period to which the adjustment relates is no more than the lesser of $90,000 or 5% of the total consideration for all taxable and exempt supplies for that adjustment period (new sections 21(2)(a) and 20(3D)).

#### _Identifying whether there is substantial change in the use of the goods and services_

If the above exclusions do not apply, new sections 21, 21A and 21B provide that, at the end of an adjustment period, a person must compare the percentage actual use of goods or services with:

*   the percentage intended use of the goods or services (if no previous adjustment has been made); or
*   the previous actual use (if the goods or services have been subject to a previous adjustment).

The "percentage actual use" is defined in section 21G(1)(a) as the extent to which the goods or services are _actually_ used by the person for making taxable supplies. It is calculated from the date of acquisition to the end of the relevant adjustment period. The estimate must be expressed as a percentage.

The "percentage intended use" is defined in section 21G(1)(b) as the extent to which the goods or services are _intended_ to be used by the person for making taxable supplies, estimated at the time of acquisition. The estimate must be expressed as a percentage.

The "previous actual use" is defined in section 21C(b)(i) as the percentage actual use in an earlier period that is the most recent period in which an adjustment has been made.

If the percentage intended use or previous actual use of goods or services is equal to the percentage actual use, the person will not be required to make an adjustment in the relevant adjustment period.

If the percentage actual use of goods or services differs from the percentage intended use or previous actual use, the person will be required to make an adjustment in an adjustment period only if the difference between the amounts is 10 percentage points or more, or the monetary value of the adjustment is more than $1,000 (new section 21(2)(c) and (d)).

#### _Calculating adjustments_

If none of the exclusions mentioned above apply, the person will need to account for a change in use.

New section 21D sets out how to calculate the amount of a change-in-use adjustment for the adjustment period. This will be done by applying the formula:

*   full input tax deduction × percentage difference

The "full input tax deduction" is the total amount of input tax on the supply. In situations where goods were acquired subject to the zero-rating rules, "full input tax deduction" will include any nominal GST component as calculated under section 20(3J).

The "percentage difference" is defined in section 21G(1)(c) as the difference between the percentage actual use and either the percentage intended use or the previous actual use if the person has already made an adjustment in respect of the asset in an earlier adjustment period.

**Example 8: Identifying percentage actual use and percentage intended/previous actual use**

Peter acquires a luxury boat for $500,000 plus GST. On acquisition, Peter estimated that the boat would be used 100% for chartering - a taxable purpose - and claimed the full input tax deduction. However, in later periods Peter uses the boat partly for private purposes.

Based on the value of the boat, Peter determines that there will be five adjustment periods. In those adjustment periods, Peter uses the boat as follows:

*   in the first adjustment period - 100% for taxable purposes;
*   in the second adjustment period - 80% for taxable purposes;
*   in the third adjustment period - 83% for taxable purposes;
*   in the fourth adjustment period - 50% for taxable purposes; and
*   in the fifth adjustment period - 90% for taxable purposes.

The first adjustment period is a period of six months. All subsequent adjustment periods are periods of 12 months.

None of the exclusions apply to this situation. The question is: what are the use percentages that Peter has to compare at the end of each adjustment period?

_First adjustment period_

Percentage intended use - 100%

Percentage actual use - 100%

_Second adjustment period_

Previous actual use - 100%

Percentage actual use - 86.6%

*   (100% × 6/18) + (80% × 12/18)  
      
    
*   \= 33.3 + 53.33 = 86.6%

In the above calculations, figures "6" and "12" represent, respectively, the length of the first and second adjustment periods expressed in months. The figure "18" represents the total number of months since the acquisition of the boat.

_Third adjustment period_

Previous actual use - 86.6%

Percentage actual use - 85.2%

*   (100% × 6/30) + (80% × 12/30) + (83% × 12/30)  
      
    
*   \= 20% + 32% + 33.2% = 85.2%

_Fourth adjustment period_

Previous actual use - 85.2%

Percentage actual use - 75.2%

*   (100% × 6/42) + (80% × 12/42) + (83% × 12/42) + (50% × 12/42)  
      
    
*   \= 14.3% + 22.9 + 23.7% + 14.3% = 75.2%

_Fifth adjustment period_

Previous actual use - 75.2%

Percentage actual use - 78.4%

*   (100% × 6/54) + (80% × 12/54) + (83% × 12/54) + (50% × 12/54) + (90% × 12/54)  
      
    
*   \= 11.1% + 17.8% + 18.4% + 11.1% + 20%  
      
    
*   \= 78.4%

It should be noted that Peter will be required to account for adjustments to Inland Revenue in the second, third, fourth and fifth adjustment periods as in each of those periods either the percentage difference is more than 10 percentage points or the monetary value of the adjustments is more than $1,000. Hence, Peter may not rely on the exclusion in section 21(2)(d).

#### _Imported services_

The reverse charge rules for imported services, in section 8(4B), have been amended. This amendment ties the use of imported services to the defined terms "percentage intended use" and "percentage actual use" to ensure that appropriate apportionment of imported services takes place following the introduction of the new rules. A new time of supply rule has been added to clarify that the supply is deemed to be made in the adjustment period in which the reverse charge rules first apply to the supply.

It is not anticipated that these changes will have a great impact on the primary users of the reverse charge rules. While the rules have changed from a test that looks at the overall business to one that focuses on individual supplies, the application of the revised rules should produce the same overall result as the change-in-use rules.

#### _Special rule for concurrent use of land_

Under the new apportionment approach, the portion of a deduction that a person should be entitled to must correspond with the extent to which the asset is used for taxable purposes. In most situations, an asset may only be used for either taxable or non-taxable purposes at one point in time. For example, at any given time a motor vehicle may be used by a person for making deliveries of goods and services or for taking the person's children to school - but usually not both at the same time.

In some circumstances, however, an asset may be used for taxable and non-taxable purposes at the same point in time, for example, a property developer may supply a house as a dwelling for a few months while advertising the house for sale. Thus, for the duration of the rental period, the asset is not only fully committed to the taxable activity (the sale), but is also simultaneously fully committed to the exempt activity (residential rental income).

Section 21E provides a formula that will assist taxpayers in apportioning between concurrent uses of land. It also allows taxpayers to apply to the Commissioner for an alternative approach should the formula not be workable in their circumstances.

Section 21E(3) requires a registered person to calculate the extent to which the land is used for making taxable supplies by using the formula:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| consideration for taxable supply | ×   | 100% |
| total consideration for supply |

The "consideration for taxable supply" is defined in section 21E(4)(a) as either the amount derived on a disposal of the land or, if the land has not been disposed of, the market value of the land at the time of the adjustment.

The "total consideration for supply" is defined in section 21E(4)(b) as the sum of the amount of the "consideration for the taxable supply" described above and:

*   the amount of all rental income derived from the supply of a dwelling since the land was acquired; and
*   if no rental income is paid or payable in relation to the non-taxable use of land, the market value of rental income that would have been derived from the time of acquisition of the land if rental had been charged.

New section 21E(5) specifies that the market value must be used in determining "consideration for the taxable supply" and/or "total consideration for supply" if amounts derived under those definitions are by associated persons or are not arm's-length amounts.

New section 21E(6) provides that if the market value of the land or rental income is not readily identifiable, the person may use another method to provide a fair and reasonable estimate of the market value.

**Example 9**

Sandy, a property developer, constructed two similar residential houses, House A and House B, next to each other. The construction cost of each house is $230,000 (including GST of $30,000). Sandy intends to sell both properties on completion (a taxable use) and therefore claims a full deduction on the GST incurred on construction.

Sandy is unable to sell the property immediately on completion. Therefore, while still advertising the houses for sale, she:

*   rents out House A and receives rental income of $26,000 in the first adjustment period; and
*   moves into House B and lives there rent-free.

At the end of the first adjustment period, Sandy sells House B for $360,000.

_Adjustment at the end of the first adjustment period - House A_

Since Sandy used the house concurrently for taxable (advertising for sale) and exempt (supplying a residential dwelling) purposes, she uses the formula in section 21E(3) to identify the actual taxable use of the property in the first adjustment period.

The "consideration for taxable supply" is either the amount derived on a disposal of the land or, if the land has not been disposed of, the market value of the land at the time of the adjustment. Sandy has not disposed of House A, but ascertains that the market value of the house is approximately the same as for House B - $360,000.

The "total consideration for supply" is the amount of the "consideration for the taxable supply" ($360,000) and the amount of all rental income ($26,000) derived from the supply of the dwelling since the land was acquired - $386,000.

Therefore, Sandy's taxable use of the house is:

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $360,000 | ×   | 100 | \=  | 93% |
| $386,000 |

Sandy has therefore deducted 7% more input tax than she should have and has to account for this to Inland Revenue:

*   $30,000 × 7% = $2,100

_Adjustment at the end of the first adjustment period - House B_

Since Sandy used the house concurrently for taxable (advertising for sale) and private (residential) purposes, she has to use the formula in section 21E(3) to identify the actual taxable use of the property in the first adjustment period.

The "consideration for taxable supply" is the amount derived on a disposal of the house - $360,000.

Since Sandy did not rent out House B, but still used it for non-taxable purposes, the "total consideration for supply" is the amount of the "consideration for the taxable supply" ($360,000) and the market value of the rental income that she would have derived if she had rented out the property. Sandy estimates that she would have received $26,000 of rental income.

Therefore, Sandy's taxable use of the house is:

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $360,000 | ×   | 100 | \=  | 93% |
| $386,000 |

Sandy has therefore deducted 7% more input tax than she should have and has to account for this amount to Inland Revenue:

*   $30,000 × 7% = $2,100

In both cases it should be noted that Sandy may be able to recover some or all of the unclaimed input tax if she later disposes of the houses in the course of her taxable activity. (See the section below "Adjustment on disposal".)

An additional formula (section 21E(7)) estimates the extent of taxable use of the land if the land has, at any time, been used solely for making non-taxable supplies. The formula is:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| months | ×   | result\* |
| total months |

\* as calculated under the formula in section 21E(3)

"Months" is defined in section 21E(8)(a) as the number of months since acquisition in which all or part of the land is used to some extent for making taxable supplies.

"Total months" is defined in section 21E(8)(b)as the total number of months since acquisition.

By taking into account the solely non-taxable use of the land, the formula will reduce the extent of the taxable use of the land calculated under the formula in section 21E(3).

**Example 10**

The facts are the same as in Example 9. Assume that the length of the first adjustment period was 12 months.

In the second adjustment period, Sandy continues both letting out and advertising for sale House A. However, six months after the start of the second adjustment period, Sandy stops advertising House A for sale as she decides to permanently rent it out.

In the second adjustment period, she receives rental income of $30,000. The market value of House A at the time of the adjustment is still $360,000.

At the end of the second adjustment period, Sandy uses the formula in section 21E to identify the taxable use of the house. For the purposes of the second adjustment period, the "total consideration for supply" is the sum of the market value of the house and all rental income received since the land was acquired:

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $360,000 | ×   | 100 | \=  | 86.5% |
| $416,000 |

However, because the house has been used for six months solely for making non-taxable supplies, she has to apply the formula in section 21E(7):

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 18  | ×   | 86.5% | \=  | 64.8% |
| 24  |

Sandy's percentage actual use of House A in the second adjustment period is 64.8%. The percentage actual use must be compared with the "previous actual use", that is with the percentage actual use as determined in the most recent period in which an adjustment has been made. For Sandy, the previous actual use will be 93%. Sandy has therefore deducted 28.2% more input tax than she should have and has to account for this to Inland Revenue:

*   $30,000 × 28.2% = $8,460

#### _Adjustment on disposal_

When a registered person disposes of, or is treated as disposing of, goods or services in the course of a taxable activity and has not claimed a full input tax deduction, new section 21F allows them to claim an additional amount of input tax.

The amount of deduction available on disposal of goods or services will be calculated under the formula:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| tax fraction | ×   | consideration | ×   | (   | 1   | −   | actual deduction | )   |
| full input tax deduction |

For the purposes of the formula, section 21F(3) provides that:

*   "Tax fraction" has the meaning given in section 2(1). For the purposes of the 15% GST rate, the tax fraction is 3/23.
*   "Consideration" is the amount of consideration received, or treated as received, for the supply.
*   "Actual deduction" is the amount of deduction already claimed, taking into account adjustments made up to the date of disposal.

The amount calculated under the formula, when added to any deduction already claimed, must not be more than the total amount of the input tax on the supply (or the nominal GST component, if the supply was zero-rated).

**Example 11: Appreciating asset**

Same facts as in Example 10.

The total input tax on the construction costs that relate to House A is $30,000. Sandy claimed 64.8% of the total input tax - $19,440.

At the beginning of the third adjustment period, Sandy sold the house to Nigel for $320,000 inclusive of GST.

Since Sandy has not claimed the full input tax in respect of the construction cost incurred in respect of the property, she may use section 21F to make a final adjustment of the input tax:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3   | ×   | $320,000 | ×   | (   | 1   | −   | $19,440 | )   | \=  | $14,692 |
| 23  | $30,000 |

The resulting amount of $14,692, when added to the deduction already claimed ($19,440), is more than the total amount of the input tax on the supply ($30,000). Therefore, the amount of the adjustment that may be claimed by Sandy will be limited to $10,560.

**Example 12: Depreciating asset**

Charles acquired a car for $46,000 (inclusive of GST of $6,000) and claimed 70% of the input tax ($4,200). Having used the car for the intended purpose for three years, Charles sells it for $30,000 inclusive of GST.

Since Charles has not claimed the full input tax in respect of the car and the car was sold in the course of the taxable activity, he may use section 21F to make a final adjustment of the input tax:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3   | ×   | $30,000 | ×   | (   | 1   | −   | $4,200 | )   | \=  | $1,174 |
| 23  | $6,000 |

The amount of the adjustment to be claimed in respect of the taxable disposal of the vehicle is $1,174.

**Example 13: Master example**

John, the sole trader in Example 1, acquired a vehicle for $20,000 plus $3,000 GST. On acquisition, John claimed 70% of the input tax - $2,100.

Since the GST-exclusive value of the car falls between $10,001 to $500,000, he has to monitor the use of the car for five adjustment periods.

In the first adjustment period (a period of 12 months), the entries in the logbook kept by John indicate that he used the car 55% in his business (taxable use).

In the second adjustment period (also a period of 12 months), John used the car 65% in his business.

In the third adjustment period (a period of 12 months), John withdrew the car from use in the business and used it solely for private purposes.

In the fourth adjustment period, John sold the car for $10,000 inclusive of GST.

_First adjustment period_

At the end of the first adjustment period, John has to determine whether he may rely on the exclusions in either section 21(2)(a) (minimal exempt supplies) or section 21(2)(b) (the value of the supply) to avoid any change-in-use adjustments. John determines that the exclusion does not apply.

John therefore has to determine whether the use of the car in the first adjustment period corresponds with the intended taxable use of the car as estimated on acquisition. To do this he must compare the percentage actual use of the car with the percentage intended use of the car.

The logbook kept by John in respect of the car indicated that the taxable use of the car accounted for 55% of its total use. On acquisition, John predicted that he would use the car 70% for taxable purposes. Since the difference between the intended taxable use and the actual taxable use is more that 10%, John may not rely on the exclusion in section 21(2)(c) and has to make an adjustment for change-in-use.

Using the formula in section 21D, John calculates the amount of the deduction that he has to return to Inland Revenue as output tax:

*   $3,000 × 15% = $450

_Second adjustment period_

For the purposes of the adjustment in the second adjustment period, the percentage actual use must be calculated from the date of acquisition to the end of the relevant adjustment period. John used the car for taxable purposes 55% in the first adjustment period of 12 months and 65% in the second adjustment period of 12 months. Overall, over two years, John used the car 60% for taxable purposes:

*   (55% × 12/24) + (65% × 12/24) = 60%

The percentage actual use must be compared with the "previous actual use", that is, with the percentage actual use as determined in the most recent period in which an adjustment has been made. For John, the previous actual use will be 55%, as this was the actual use of the car at the end of the first adjustment period.

Since the difference between the percentage actual use (60%) and the previous actual use (55%) of the car is less than 10 percentage points, John will not be required to account for the amount of the adjustment if the monetary value of the adjustment is less than $1,000.

John calculates that the value of the adjustment is less that $1,000 using the formula in section 21D:

*   $3,000 × 5% = $150

_Third adjustment period_

John calculates the percentage actual use of the car after three adjustment periods:

*   (55% × 12/36) + (65% × 12/36) + (0% × 12/36)  
      
    
*   \= 18.3% + 21.7% + 0 = 40%

The percentage actual use is 40%. This percentage has to be compared with the previous actual use. Since John did not make an adjustment in the previous (second) adjustment period, the "previous actual use" will be the percentage actual use in a period that is the most recent period in which an adjustment has been made. John made an adjustment in the first adjustment period when his percentage actual use was 55%. This percentage will therefore become John's previous actual use for the purposes of the adjustment in the third adjustment period.

Since the difference between the percentage actual use (40%) and the previous actual use (55%) of the car is more than 10 percentage points, John has to account to Inland Revenue for the over-claimed amount of the deduction. The amount of the output tax to be accounted for is:

*   $3,000 × 15% = $450

_Fourth adjustment period_

In the fourth adjustment period, John sold the car in the course of his taxable activity for $10,000. As John has not claimed the full deduction in respect of the car, he may claim an additional amount of the adjustment on disposal under section 21F calculated as follows:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3   | ×   | $10,000 | ×   | (   | 1   | −   | $1,200 | )   | \=  | $783 |
| 23  | $3,000 |

John may claim a deduction of $783 in respect of the taxable disposal of the car.

#### _Entitlement to input tax deduction for goods and services acquired before registration_

New rules have also been introduced that may allow a registered person to claim input tax deductions for goods and services purchased by them before registration.

These will apply in the following circumstances:

*   before becoming a registered person, the person acquired goods or services that were chargeable with GST at the standard rate; and
*   at the time of the registration or at a later time, the person used the goods or services for making taxable supplies; and
*   the original cost of the goods or services, excluding GST, was more than $5,000.

If these conditions are met, a registered person will be able to claim a deduction for the goods and services purchased by them before registration if they hold a tax invoice in relation to the supply as required by section 20(2) or have adequate records that enable the identification of the particulars of an invoice as required by section 24(3).

To claim a deduction, the registered person must make an adjustment for change-in-use under sections 21 and 21A. The ordinary rules for apportionment of input tax would, however, be modified to treat the first adjustment period as the period that starts on the date of the acquisition of the goods or services and ends on the first balance date that falls after the person becomes registered for GST and uses the goods or services for making taxable supplies.

Following the determination of the length of the first adjustment period, the person must identify the percentage actual use of the goods or services in that period, using a method that provides a fair and reasonable result. This percentage actual use would then be compared with the percentage intended use (which will be 0% as the person will not have claimed any deduction on the acquisition). The resulting "percentage difference" will be used to claim an adjusted amount of the deduction under section 21D.

This rule allows goods and services acquired by a person before their registration to enter the apportionment regime. As a consequence, the asset will become subject to the same apportionment rules as any other asset purchased by the registered person.

**Example 14**

On 1 January 2012, Craig, an unregistered person, acquires a car for $23,000 (including GST of $3,000). For the next two years Craig uses the car solely for private purposes.

On 1 January 2014, Craig registers for GST and starts using the car solely for business purposes. Craig's next balance date is 31 March 2014.

Craig has retained the tax invoice received on the purchase of the car. Since the value of the car on the acquisition was more that $5,000, Craig may claim a deduction for the car under section 21B.

Craig's first adjustment period in respect of the car will be treated as the period that starts on the date of the acquisition of the goods or services and ends on the first balance date that falls after the person becomes registered for GST and uses the goods or services for making taxable supplies, that is, from 1 January 2012 to 31 March 2014.

During that period (a total of 27 months), Craig used the car 0% for taxable purposes for 24 months (1 January 2012 to 31 December 2013) and 100% for taxable purposes for three months (1 January 2014 to 31 March 2014). Therefore, his total taxable use in the first adjustment period will be:

*   (0% × 24/27) + (100% × 3/27) = 11%

At the end of the first adjustment period, Craig can claim $330 (11% of the initial input tax of $3,000).

_Subsequent adjustment periods_

The maximum number of adjustments that have to be made for goods and services of value between $10,000 and $500,000 is five.

Therefore, if Craig continues owning the car he may be required to make four additional adjustments. If he sells the car in the course of his taxable activity, he may be entitled to an additional deduction under the wash-up mechanism in section 21F.

#### _Application to acquisitions from associated persons_

New section 3A(3C) amends the application of section 21B for goods or services acquired from an associated person. In these situations, the amount of input tax on goods or services that may be claimed by the person must not be more than the amount accounted for as output tax by the associated supplier of the goods or services.

* * *

1 "First adjustment period" is defined in section 21G(2)(a) as a period that starts on the date of acquisition and ends on the date as the person chooses that either corresponds to the person's first balance date that falls after the date of acquisition or to the person's first balance date that falls at least 12 months after the date of acquisition. See more on "adjustment periods" later in this report.

New definitions of "associated persons"
=======================================

2009 legislation redefines 'associated persons'. The definitions are mainly used in an anti-avoidance capacity to counter non-arm's length transactions.

_**Sections CB 8(c), CD 5, CD 5(2B), CD 6(1)(a)(ii), CD 22(9), CD 25(4), CD 27(1)(b), CD 27(3)(a)(ii), CD 44(10B), CD 44(10C), CD 44(14B), CX 2(5), CZ 9B, DB 42(2), EB 13(2), EX 20B(5)(a)(i), EX 20B(9)(c), FE 21(3)(d)(ii), FE 21(7)(a)(i) and (ii), FE 21(8), GB 28(2), GB 48(1)(b), GB 48(3)(d) and (e), GC 5(5), HC 15(5)(a)(ii), HC 21(3), HC 27(1)(e), HC 27(3), HC 32(2), HC 35(4)(a), HC 36(5), RF 11, YA 1, YB 1 to YB 16 of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections 17(1C)(a), 89N(1)(c)(iii), 89N(1)(c)(v), 141(7)(c) and 141D(3B)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994**_

The definitions of "associated persons" in the Income Tax Act 2007 have been reformed by strengthening and rationalising them. The definitions are mainly used in an anti-avoidance capacity to counter non-arm’s length transactions that could undermine the intent of the income tax legislation.

The reforms address a number of weaknesses in the previous definitions that posed a risk to the tax base. These weaknesses have significant base maintenance implications in areas such as the taxation of land sales, dividends and fringe benefits. The main changes:

*   deal with the weaknesses in the previous definitions in relation to trusts. In particular, there are new tests focusing on a trust’s settlor (that is, the person who provides the trust property);
*   provide more robust rules aggregating the interests of associates to prevent the tests relating to companies being circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among close associates; and
*   implement a tripartite test associating two persons if they are each associated with the same third person, thereby making the associated persons tests as a whole more difficult to circumvent.

The reforms narrow some current tests. For example, the ambit of the relatives test has been reduced from four to two degrees of blood relationship.

The reforms rationalise the income tax definitions of associated persons and other income tax provisions that employ a similar concept, such as the definition of "related persons" in the dividend rules. This represents a major simplification and makes the associated persons concept in the Income Tax Act more coherent.

The associated persons reforms are consistent with a key theme of the government’s tax policy work programme, which is ensuring that the income tax system is robust.

### Background

New Zealand tax law often subjects transactions between associated persons to special scrutiny because these transactions can pose a substantial risk to the tax base. Transactions between associated persons are more likely to lead to tax practices that undermine the intent of our tax laws because of the closeness of the relationships of the persons involved.

The associated persons definitions are used extensively in the Income Tax Act 2007 to determine whether persons are associated for the purposes of operative provisions in the Act. These operative provisions are often of an anti-avoidance nature, and recognise that transactions between related parties are more likely to be non-arm’s length than transactions between independent parties, and that while associated persons are legally separate entities, they may not be economically independent. Because of their relationship to each other, associated persons can often be regarded as single economic entities because of their community of interests. This community of interests may justify these persons not being treated as independent entities for tax purposes.

An important application of the associated persons definitions in the Income Tax Act is in the area of land sales. Parliament’s intent in 1973, when it enacted the current land sale tax rules, was that land dealers, developers and builders should generally be taxed on all gains on property sold within 10 years of acquisition, and they cannot claim to hold non-taxable investment portfolios. This legislative intent is clear from the parliamentary debate. Hon W E Rowling, Minister of Finance, who introduced the relevant legislation, said:

*   "Profits and gains from real property will now be assessed when ... the property was acquired by a land dealer and either was held as part of his land dealing business and later sold - in which case the profits will be assessable irrespective of the period between acquisition and sale - or, if it was not held as part of his land dealing business but is sold within 10 years of acquisition, for example, claimed to be held as an investment but sold within this 10-year period."

It was therefore a deliberate decision by Parliament that gains on land sold by property developers within 10 years of acquisition should generally be taxed.

The previous definitions of associated persons had a number of shortcomings. For example, the associated persons definition which applied for land sales contained loopholes which allowed land dealers, developers and builders to escape tax by operating through closely connected entities.

The Income Tax Act previously had no coherent overall scheme for defining associated persons. For example, some definitions did not consider some obviously close relationships as being associated (for example, a trustee and a beneficiary). On the other hand, they treated some remote relationships as being so (for example, fourth-degree relatives). The multiplicity of definitions and other provisions employing a similar concept (such as the company control definition) created unnecessary complexity in the Act.

The new associated persons definitions address the previous shortcomings in the associated persons definitions in the Income Tax Act - first by addressing their weaknesses and, secondly, rationalising these and similar provisions in the Income Tax Act.

Proposals to reform the definitions of associated persons were initially outlined in an officials’ issues paper, _Reforming the definitions of associated persons_, released in March 2007. The reforms have been the subject of extensive consultation and the new associated persons definitions incorporate various amendments that arose during the policy development process.

This reform of the definitions of associated persons in the Income Tax Act, including the modifications arising from the consultation process, is the first comprehensive review since the inception of a definition of associated persons in the income tax legislation in 1968.

### Key features

The reforms to the associated persons definitions in the Income Tax Act 2007 generally involve replacing the definitions with the objective of strengthening them. The other major part of the reforms involves rationalising these definitions and other income tax provisions which employ a similar concept.

The changes aim to give effect to the policy intention of capturing non-arm’s length transactions, while not applying more widely than is necessary to protect the tax base.

The tests of association in the new associated persons definition in subpart YB are as follows:

*   two companies;
*   a company and a person other than a company;
*   two relatives;
*   a person and a trustee for a relative;
*   a trustee and a beneficiary;
*   trustees with a common settlor;
*   a trustee and a settlor;
*   a settlor and a beneficiary;
*   a trustee and a person with the power of appointment or removal of the trustee;
*   a partnership and a partner; and
*   two persons who are each associated with the same third person (tripartite test).

All 11 associated persons tests generally apply for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. The main exception is in the land provisions where modifications are made so the associated persons definitions cover situations under the effective control of property dealers, developers and builders, but do not apply to other situations.

The tests for determining whether two companies, or a company and a person other than a company, are associated persons include rules that aggregate the interests of associates. This prevents the company-related tests being circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among associated persons.

The test for associating relatives is reduced from four degrees of blood relationship to two degrees only. This test is further limited to spouses and parents and their infant children for the purposes of the land provisions and compliance cost saving provisions relating to low turnover traders and adverse event livestock transfers.

The weaknesses in the previous general associated persons definition in relation to trusts have been addressed by including tests associating a trustee and beneficiary, trustee and settlor, two trustees with common settlor, settlor and beneficiary and a trustee and a person with the power of appointment or removal of the trustee. A number of modifications apply to the trust-based tests to ensure that the associated persons definitions do not apply more widely than is necessary to protect the tax base. They include:

*   Not applying the beneficiary-based associated persons tests (the trustee-beneficiary and settlor-beneficiary tests), and the test associating a person and a trustee for a relative in the case of land sales. It is not necessary to apply these tests to catch the type of structures being used to circumvent the land sale tax rules; the structures causing concern can be caught by other associated persons tests - in particular, the settlor-based trust and tripartite tests.
*   Not treating charitable organisations as beneficiaries for the purposes of the trustee and beneficiary and settlor and beneficiary tests and excluding charitable trusts from the trustee and settlor test.
*   The definition of "settlor" that applies for the purposes of the associated persons tests will not include a person who provides services to a trust for less than market value.

Persons who are married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship are treated as the same single person for the purpose of identifying a common settlor under the two trustees with a common settlor test in section YB 7. This treatment prevents the new associated persons definition being circumvented by the use of "mirror trusts".

The new associated persons definition introduces a tripartite test which associates two persons if they are each associated with the same third person, under different associated persons tests. The tripartite test acts as an important buttress to the other associated persons tests and makes the associated persons definition as a whole more difficult to circumvent.

The reforms also rationalise the current income tax definition of associated persons and other income tax provisions that employ a similar concept, such as the definition of "related person" in the dividend rules. This represents a significant simplification and makes the associated persons concept in the Income Tax Act more coherent.

### Application date

The general application date for the reforms (excluding those applying for the land provisions) is the 2010-11 and later income years. For the purposes of the land provisions (as defined in section YA 1), except for the section which relates to disposal of land within 10 years of completing improvements (section CB 11), the reforms apply to land acquired on or after 6 October 2009, the date of enactment. Given that association is tested in the land provisions at the time of acquisition, this means that for land acquired before 6 October 2009 the former associated persons definitions are the relevant provisions in determining whether the sale of such land is taxable. For the purposes of section CB 11, the reforms apply to land on which improvements started on or after 6 October 2009. Therefore, in the case of the land provisions, the relevant application date is 6 October 2009 irrespective of a person’s balance date.

### Detailed analysis

Subpart YB containing the associated persons definition rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 has been substantially replaced. The new provisions consist of 11 tests of association, which are explained in this article.

New section YB 1(4) states the general rule that the various associated persons tests in subpart YB apply for the purposes of the whole Act unless a provision expressly states otherwise. The main situation where certain exceptions will apply in the new associated persons tests are the land provisions, which are defined in section YA 1. For example, a narrow range of relatives (namely, spouses, civil union partners, de facto partners, and infant children) applies in the new associated persons definitions for the purposes of the land provisions.

New sections YB 1(5) to (8) contain cross-references to several special rules that modify the associated persons definitions for the purpose of specific provisions. These special rules are contained in sections DS 4 (Meaning of film reimbursement scheme), EB 13 (Low-turnover valuation), EX 4 (Limits to requirement to include associated person interests in the controlled foreign company rules), and LP 2 (Tax credits for supplementary dividends). These special rules have not been changed as part of this reform.

#### Two companies test (section YB 2)

Section YB 2 contains the test for associating two companies. Two companies will be associated if:

*   there is a group of persons whose total voting interests in each company are 50% or more - this is the primary test for associating two companies. The concept of voting interests is defined in subpart YC;
*   a market value circumstance exists for either company and there is a group of persons whose total market value interests in each company are 50% or more. A "market value circumstance" is defined in section YA 1 and a "market value interest" is defined in subpart YC. Under the measurement of company ownership rules in subpart YC, a person’s interest in a company is generally measured by reference to the person’s voting interests in the company. If these voting interests in certain circumstances - coming within the definition of "market value circumstance" in section YA 1 - do not reflect accurately the person’s economic interest in a company then the person’s interests are also measured by reference to the person’s market value interests in the company; or
*   there is a group of persons who control both companies by any other means.

##### _Aggregation rule_

The test associating two companies contains a general aggregation rule which provides that in determining whether two companies are associated, a person is treated as holding anything held by persons associated with that person under sections YB 4 to YB 14 (section YB 2(4)). This rule applies for the purposes of the whole Act except the land provisions. The aggregation rule is designed to prevent the two companies test being circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among associated persons, resulting in the 50% interest threshold not being reached.

The two companies test contains a separate rule which aggregates the interests of associates for the purposes of the land provisions (section YB 2(5). Under this rule, a person is treated as holding anything held by persons associated with them under the limited relatives definition in section YB 4 (namely, spouses, civil union partners, de facto partners and infant children) and under the tests in sections YB 7, YB 8, and YB 10 to YB 14. This modification ensures that for the purposes of the land provisions, the general relatives test and the beneficiary-related trust tests do not apply in the aggregation rule for the test associating two companies.

When applying the rules aggregating the interest of associates, the rule is applied afresh to each person and it is irrelevant that a person does not directly hold any shares in a company before the application of the aggregation rule.

![Diagram showing application of general aggregation rule in two companies test](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/7/1/7168fa8041eb36b4a258f34fc1b24342/78-eg1-thumbnail.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203207&hash=FBBD61F1E0881F260E88B94287513CCB)

In this example the aggregation rule, in conjunction with the tripartite test, can be applied to treat Suzy as holding Trust’s shares in Company B. Specifically, Suzy is associated with Suzy Co under the company and person other than a company test in section YB 3, and Suzy Co (with power of appointment of the trustees of Trust) is associated with Trust under section YB 11. Therefore, Suzy and Trust are associated under the tripartite test, and the aggregation rule in section YB 2(4) treats Suzy as holding Trust’s shares in Company B. Taking into account the shares Suzy holds directly in Company A, Company A and Company B are associated under the two companies test in section YB 2.

![Diagram of an example showing application of general aggregation rule in two companies test](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/5/4/5412770041eb38d4a261f34fc1b24342/78-eg2-thumbnail.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203201&hash=FBF5540DFEA53A73891D45A6D3295192)

In this example, the question is whether Company A and Company B are associated.

First, in conjunction with the relatives test in section YB 4, the aggregation rule in section YB 2(4) is applied so that John is treated as holding anything held by his associates. In this case, John is treated as holding Jo’s shares in Company A through his association with Jo under the relatives test in section YB 4.

Secondly, the aggregation rule, in conjunction with the tripartite test, can also be applied to treat John as holding Trust’s shares in Company B. This is because John is associated with Trust under the tripartite test in section YB 14. Specifically, John is associated with John Co under the company and person other than a company test in section YB 3, and John Co (as beneficiary of Trust) is associated with Trust under the trustee and beneficiary test in section YB 6. Therefore, John and the Trust are associated under the tripartite test, and the aggregation rule in section YB 2(4) treats John as holding Trust’s shares in Company B. As a result, because John is treated as holding all the shares in Company A and Company B under section YB 2(4), Company A and Company B are associated under section YB 2.

It is irrelevant that John does not directly hold shares in Company A and Company B before the application of the aggregation rule in section YB 2(4).

![Diagram example 2 showing application of aggregation rule in two companies test in the context of the land provisions](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/5/7/57b7780041eb3e57a277f34fc1b24342/79-1eg-thumbnail.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203222&hash=12145B136F45D96E227E118A13D19633)

In this example, the husband owns 100% of the voting interests in Company A, which is a property developer, and his wife holds 100% of the voting interests in Company B, which sells some land within 10 years of acquisition. Without the aggregation rule in section YB 2(5), the two companies would not be associated despite their close community of interests. The application of the aggregation rule ensures that the two companies are associated under section YB 2, resulting in Company B being liable to tax on the sale of the land.

![Diagram of example 2 showing application of aggregation rule in two companies test in the context of the land provisions](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/1/f/1faf440041eb3eeea27ef34fc1b24342/79-2leg-thumbnail.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203210&hash=20C1C9DCB229C95E5B31B794AD2D5DED)

In this example, Trust A and Trust B are associated under the two trustees with common settlor test in section YB 7. Trust A owns 100% of the voting interests in Company A, which is a property developer, and Trust B owns 100% of the voting interests in Company B, which sells some land within 10 years of acquisition.

The two companies are associated under the two companies test through the use of the aggregation rule contained in that test. Applying the aggregation rule to this example, Trust A is treated as holding anything held by persons associated with it. In this case, Trust A and Trust B are associated under the two trustees with common settlor test in section YB 7. Accordingly, taking into account Trust A’s direct shareholding in Company A, Trust A is treated as holding all the voting interests in Company A and Company B, meaning these two companies are associated.

The aggregation rule can also be applied to treat the common settlor as holding all the voting interests in Company A and Company B because the settlor is associated with Trust A and Trust B under the trustee-settlor test in section YB 8. This also means the two companies are associated.

A result of Company A and Company B being associated is that Company B is liable to tax on the sale of land. Without the aggregation rule, Company A and Company B would not be associated despite their close community of interests.

##### _Other features_

The two companies test provides that the control by any other means limb in the test does not apply to a company that is a state enterprise, Crown Research Institute, Crown health enterprise or a company that is part of the same group of companies as one of these Crown-related entities (section YB 2(6)). It also provides that in the international tax rules (defined in section YA 1) two companies are not associated if one, but not both, is a non-resident (section YB 2(7)).

Additionally, for the purposes of the land provisions, two companies are not associated persons if one is a portfolio investment entity (PIE) or an entity that qualifies for PIE status (section YB 2(8)). This exception ensures that a widely held managed fund is not adversely affected because of the personal land dealings of the directors of the fund.

#### Company and person other than a company test (section YB 3)

Section YB 3 contains the test for associating a company and a person other than a company.

A company and a person other than a company are associated if:

*   the person has a voting interest in the company of 25% or more. The concept of voting interests is defined in subpart YC; or
*   a market value circumstance exists for the company and the person has a market value interest in the company of 25% or more. A "market value circumstance" is defined in section YA 1, and a "market value interest" is defined in subpart YC. Under the measurement of company ownership rules in subpart YC, a person’s interest in a company is generally measured by reference to the person’s voting interests in the company. If these voting interests in certain circumstances - coming within the definition of "market value circumstance" in section YA 1 - do not reflect accurately the person’s economic interest in a company then the person’s interests are also measured by reference to the person’s market value interests in the company.

##### _Aggregation rule_

The test associating a company and person other than a company test contains a general aggregation rule, which applies for the purposes of the whole Act except the land provisions (section YB 3(3)). Accordingly, for the purposes of determining whether a company and a person other than a company are associated, a person is treated as holding anything held by persons associated with the person under sections YB 4 to YB 14. This aggregation rule is designed to prevent the test associating a company and a person other than a company being circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among associated persons, resulting in the interest threshold of 25% not being reached.

The test associating a company and a person other than a company contains a separate rule which aggregates the interests of associates for the purposes of the land provisions (section YB 3(4)). Under this rule, a person is treated as holding anything held by persons associated with the person under the limited relatives definition in sections YB 4 (namely, spouses, civil union partners, de facto partners, and infant children) and under the tests in sections YB 7, YB 8, and YB 10 to YB 14. This modification ensures that for the purposes of the land provisions, the general relatives test and the beneficiary-related trust tests do not apply in the aggregation rule for the test associating a company and person other than a company.

When applying the rule aggregating the interests of associates, the rule is applied afresh to each person being tested for association with a company and it is irrelevant that a person does not directly hold shares in a company before the application of the aggregation rule.

The aggregation rules are an element of both of the company-based tests in sections YB 2 and YB 3. As noted above, the aggregation rules are designed to prevent these tests being circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among associated persons, resulting in the interest thresholds in these tests not being met. As such, the aggregation rules do not act as separate associated persons tests.

Without an aggregation rule, neither Sister A, B nor C would be associated with Family Co. under the company and person other than a company test because their respective interests do not meet the required 25% threshold. However, under the aggregation rule in section YB 3(3), each sister would be associated with the company. This is because for the purposes of determining whether Sister A is associated with Family Co. under section YB 3(1), she is treated as holding her sisters’ 20% voting interests in the company (10% each from Sister B and Sister C). This 20%, when aggregated with her own 10% voting interest, means that Sister A is treated as holding a 30% interest and, therefore, is associated with the company.

The aggregation rule applies afresh to each person - so similarly, Sister B and Sister C are each treated as holding the other two sisters’ aggregate 20% voting interests in the company. Therefore, when aggregated with the 10% interest they each own in the company, Sister B and Sister C are each associated with Family Co.

![Diagram of example 2: application of the general aggregation rule in the company and person other than a company test](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/8/e/8e2b250041eb41c0a292f34fc1b24342/80-eg2-thumbnail.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203219&hash=554295B8A29674BECC8B704C7AA74C5A)

Jo settles Family Trusts No. 1 and No. 2 and arranges for each of them to hold 20% of the shares in Family Co. Jo also arranges for his spouse and child to hold 20% each in Family Co. Jo directly holds only 20%. Under the aggregation rule in section YB 3(3), Jo is treated as holding the shares in Family Co. held by the family trusts and relatives because they are his associates. Accordingly, Jo is associated with Family Co. Without the rule aggregating the interests held by associated persons Jo would not be associated with Family Co. despite the close community of interests.

![Diagram of example 2: Application of the general aggregation rule in the company and person other than a company test](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/2/d/2d49b10041eb47ada2c6f34fc1b24342/81-eg1-thumbnail.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203154&hash=8293DC6C652C5B0319B0DF983A8725DA)

[Larger version of image](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/c/1/c1945d8041eb49d1a2d2f34fc1b24342/81-eg1-large.jpg "This link will open a new window.")

The question in this case is whether the appointer of the trustee in Trust 2 is associated with Developer Co. under the test in section YB 3 associating a company and a person other than a company. The appointer is associated with Developer Co. under this test because of the application of the aggregation rule for land provisions in section YB 3(4) which treats a person as holding anything held by their associates. The appointer is associated with Trust 1 under the tripartite test in section YB 14. Specifically, the appointer is associated with Trust 2 under the test in section YB 11 associating a trustee and their appointer, and Trust 2 is associated with Trust 1 under the test in section YB 7 associating two trustees with a common settlor. Therefore, under the aggregation rule for land provisions in section YB 3(4) the appointer is treated as holding Trust 1’s shares in Developer Co. Accordingly, the appointer and Developer Co. are associated under section YB 3.

Note, however, that the relative of the appointer would not be associated with Developer Co. In particular, the tripartite test does not associate Trust 1 and the relative and therefore the relative is not treated as holding Trust 1’s shares in Developer Co. The aggregation rule is applied afresh to the relative, and not to the appointer, for the purposes of determining whether the relative is associated with Developer Co. Therefore, the fact that the appointer is treated under the aggregation rule as holding Trust 1’s shares when testing for association between the appointer and Developer Co. is disregarded when testing for association between the relative and Developer Co.

##### _Corporate trustees_

In section YB 3, "a person other than a company" includes a company acting in its capacity as a trustee of a trust (section YB 3(5)). This amendment is of a clarifying nature only and is consistent with long-standing policy (_Tax Information Bulletin_, Vol. 3, No. 7, April 1992 at page 23).

The company look-through rules in subpart YC applying to voting and market value interests do not apply to a corporate trustee; therefore, the voting interests or market value interests held by a corporate trustee are not traced through to the shareholders of that corporate trustee. This treatment is a result of the separate capacity that a trustee (whether a company or natural person) has under the Income Tax Act 2007, and is recognised in the definition of "trustee" in section YA 1 which refers to a trustee "only in the capacity of trustee of the trust". This separate trustee capacity feature of the income tax law has been maintained in the new associated persons definitions.

Therefore the shareholders of a corporate trustee are not relevant when testing for association between that trustee and other persons. This is consistent with the general position under the Income Tax Act, which is that a company acting in its capacity as trustee is treated as a trustee rather than a company. This means that the relevant test for determining association between a corporate trustee and a company in which the corporate trustee is a shareholder is section YB 3.

#### Relatives test (section YB 4)

There are three limbs to the general relatives test in the new associated persons definitions:

*   The first limb associates two persons who are within two degrees of blood relationship (section YB 4(1)(a)). Previously the general relatives test extended to the fourth degree of blood relationship. This means that the blood relationships limb of the general relatives test extends to grandparents and siblings but not to nephews and nieces (third degree) and cousins (fourth degree) as the previous test did.
*   The second limb associates two persons who are married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship (section YB 4(1)(b)).
*   The third limb associates two persons if one person is within two degrees of blood relationship to the other person’s spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner (section YB 4(1)(c)). This limb associates persons with their in-laws and step-children.

For the purposes of the relatives associated persons test, a child by adoption is treated as a natural child of the adoptive parents and not as a natural child of the birth parents (section YB 4(3)).

A new provision (section YB 4(4)) has been added to the test associating two relatives to ensure that a person is not associated with another person if the person cannot reasonably be expected to know that the other person exists or that they are within two degrees of blood relationship to the other person. This exclusion is designed to deal with a small minority of situations such as when siblings are separated at a very young age and do not know of each other’s existence.

##### _Narrower application of relatives test in certain cases (section YB 4(2))_

The first and third limbs (section YB 4(1)(a) and (c)) of the general relatives test of association do not apply for the purposes of the land provisions (defined in section YA 1) or two compliance-cost saving provisions in the Income Tax Act - namely, the low turnover trader provision in section EB 13, and the provision relating to the adverse event livestock transfers in section EC 5. In these circumstances, persons are associated because of a blood relationship only if one is the infant child of the other. An "infant child" is defined in the Age of Majority Act 1970 as a person under 20 years of age.

![Diagram example of application of narrow relatives test in section YB 4(2)](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/6/2/628bb40041eb5075a308f34fc1b24342/82-eg1-thumbnail.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203203&hash=EE4FFC6F4730234CC45CF8D377BB1D7F)

[Larger version of image](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/f/1/f1ef6c0041eb597fa37af34fc1b24342/82-eg1-large.jpg "This link will open a new window.")

Under the trading stock provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007, there are special low-compliance cost rules which apply to a "low-turnover trader". For a person to be a low-turnover trader, the turnover of that person’s business, when aggregated with the turnover of associated persons, must be no more than $3 million.

In this example, because a narrow relatives test applies for the purposes of the low-turnover trader rules, Adult Sam and Step-mother company are not associated and therefore Sam is entitled to use the low-turnover trader rules for his business. In particular, because Adult Sam is not treated under the relatives test in section YB 4 as being associated with his step-mother, the aggregation rule in the test in section YB 3 associating a company and a person other than a company does not apply to treat Adult Sam as holding his step-mother’s shares in her company. If the ordinary relatives associated persons test had applied to the low-turnover trader rules Sam would be treated as being associated with Step-mother company under section YB 3 and therefore would not have been entitled to use the low-turnover trader rules.

#### Trustee for relative test (section YB 5)

A person (first person) and a trustee of a trust under which a relative (as defined in section YB 4) of the first person has benefited or is eligible to benefit are associated persons under new section YB 5. For example, a husband and a trustee of a trust under which the husband’s wife is a beneficiary would be associated under this test.

The trustee for relative test does not apply for the purposes of the land provisions. This is consistent with the land provision exclusions in the other beneficiary-related tests in section YB 6 (trustee and beneficiary) and YB 9 (settlor and beneficiary).

![Diagram: Person and trustee for relative: exception for the purposes of the land provisions](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/3/5/3525300041eb5173a31ff34fc1b24342/82-eg2-thumbnail.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203200&hash=8DD9777C595463092AD42E383A616B91)

[Larger version of image](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/0/5/052d268041eb59d6a381f34fc1b24342/82-eg2-large.jpg "This link will open a new window.")

Because the trustee for relative test does not apply for the purposes of the land provisions, the husband would not be associated with the trustee of the trust under which his wife is a beneficiary. Under the previous trustee for relative test in former section YB 12, the husband would have been associated with the trustee for the purposes of the land provisions.

Additionally, as further discussed below, this test does not apply to lines trusts established under the Energy Companies Act 1992 (energy consumer trusts) or the unit trust administering bonus bonds (section YB 16).

#### Trustee and beneficiary test (section YB 6)

A trustee of a trust and a person who has benefited or is eligible to benefit under the trust are associated persons under new section YB 6. This provision does not apply for the purposes of the land provisions.

Persons have benefited under a trust if they have received a distribution under the trust.

Inland Revenue’s long-standing policy on when a person is eligible to benefit under a trust will continue (Tax Information Bulletin, Vol. 7, No. 9, February 1996 at page 25). In particular, a person is "eligible to benefit" when the person is either:

*   named by the trustee as a potential beneficiary; or
*   designated as a member of a class of potential beneficiaries, for example, "the children of …".

When trustees have a general power of appointment, persons not already appointed as beneficiaries under the power are not treated as being eligible to benefit.

Therefore, a person who is eligible to benefit under a trust (as described above) does not need to have actually received a distribution (as defined in section HC 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007) under the trust to qualify as a beneficiary.

An exception to the trustee and beneficiary test for certain employee trusts is contained in section YB 15. Additionally, as with section YB 5, this test does not apply to energy consumer trusts or the unit trust administering bonus bonds (section YB 16).

The trustee and beneficiary test (and other trustee-related tests) are not relevant to unit trust investment vehicles. This is because such unit trusts are treated as companies for all income tax purposes. This means that it is the company-related tests - in particular, section YB 3 - that are the relevant associated persons tests. The 25% threshold in section YB 3 would ensure that retail investors would not be associated with widely held public unit trusts.

The trustee and beneficiary test (and other beneficiary-related tests) are not relevant to purpose trusts such as charitable trusts and community trusts referred to in the Community Trusts Act 1999 (these trusts were established to hold the shares in the successor companies to the former trustee banks). This is because purpose trusts do not at law have beneficiaries.

The previous general definition of associated persons did not contain a trustee and beneficiary test. This constituted a significant omission in test coverage and transactions were often structured to take advantage of the loophole. Without a trustee and beneficiary test in the associated persons definitions, many of the operative rules in the Income Tax Act using the general associated persons definition could be readily circumvented by simply interposing a discretionary trust.

![Diagram: In this example, the company provides a benefit to a beneficiary of its trustee shareholder](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/a/1/a182868041eb5434a329f34fc1b24342/83-eg1-thumbnail.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203206&hash=9EB12B3B744735E984A070D595B3FB64)

[Larger version of image](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/5/1/5118c20041eb5ae1a38af34fc1b24342/83-eg1-large.jpg "This link will open a new window.")

In this example, the company provides a benefit to a beneficiary of its trustee shareholder. The company provides the benefit because the trustee is its sole shareholder. Section CD 6(1)(a)(ii) in the dividend rules treats payments to associated persons of shareholders as dividends. However, without a trustee and beneficiary test, this simple arrangement would avoid the dividend rules.

Under the new trustee and beneficiary test, because the company is providing a benefit to an associated person (Beneficiary) of a shareholder in the company (Trust), the company has made a dividend to the beneficiary under section CD 6(1)(a)(ii).

![Diagram: In this example, an employer provides a low interest loan to a trust under which an employee is a beneficiary.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/8/8/88e79e8041eb5510a33df34fc1b24342/83-eg2-thumbnail.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203153&hash=662EFE5E9C05C347F92FF516826EFE60)

[Larger version of image](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/b/3/b3a9a68041eb5b51a391f34fc1b24342/83-eg2-large.jpg "This link will open a new window.")

In this example, an employer provides a low interest loan to a trust under which an employee is a beneficiary. Under section CX 18, fringe benefit tax applies to fringe benefits provided to associated persons of employees. Without the trustee and beneficiary test in section YB 6, this simple arrangement avoids this rule. However, because of the new trustee and beneficiary test, the employer would be providing a fringe benefit (the low interest loan) to an associated person of the employee (the Trust) and would therefore be subject to fringe benefit tax.

#### Two trustees with common settlor test (section YB 7)

Under new section YB 7, a trustee of a trust and a trustee of another trust are associated persons if the same person is a settlor of both trusts.

New section YB 10 provides that for the purposes of the new section YB 7, "settlor" has the meaning set out in section HC 27 of the Income Tax Act 2007, but does not include a person who provides services to a trust for less than market value.

An exception to the two trustees with common settlor test for certain employee trusts is contained in section YB 15.

Without a test associating two trustees with a common settlor many of the operative rules in the Income Tax Act which use the associated persons definition, such as the dividend rules, could be circumvented by structures such as the following example.

![Diagram of example explained in following text](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/5/e/5e21a38041edc6a1a582f54fc1b24342/84-eg1-thumbnail.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203214&hash=650D0156DC033A076ABDDA8A9B5F615E)

[Larger version of image](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/1/c/1c4ef00041ede3f9a632f74fc1b24342/84-eg1-large.jpg "This link will open a new window.")

In this example, Megan settles Family Trust 1, a trust that owns all of the shares in Family Co. Megan also settles Family Trust 2 whose discretionary beneficiaries include Megan’s children and Megan herself. Family Co. makes a payment to Family Trust 2.

Under the dividend rules in sections CD 3 to CD 6 of the Income Tax Act, any payment made by a company to an associated person of a shareholder of the company is treated as a dividend if that payment would have been a dividend if it had been made to the shareholder.

In the absence of a two trustees with common settlor test, Family Co. has not made a payment to an associated person of its shareholder (Family Trust 1), in terms of section CD 6(1)(a)(ii). Therefore, the payment from Family Co. to Family Trust 2 would not be treated as a dividend.

Under the new two trustees with common settlor test in section YB 7, Family Trust 1 and Family Trust 2 are associated persons as they have a common settlor (Megan). Therefore, the payment from Family Co. to Family Trust 2 (an associated person of Family Co’s shareholder, Family Trust 1) is treated as a dividend.

For the purposes of the two trustees with a common settlor test in section YB 7, two persons who are married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship are treated as the same single person. This is relevant to identifying a common settlor of two trusts, and prevents the new associated persons definition being circumvented by the use of "mirror trusts". This is illustrated in the following example.

![Diagram of example : Two trustees with common settlor: mirror trusts](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/e/8/e872208041edc7e3a58bf54fc1b24342/84-eg2-thumbnail.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203158&hash=EDD13BC6ED0FEA91AF75E3548FB3E5B6)

[Larger version of image](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/d/1/d170bf0041ede470a639f74fc1b24342/84-eg2-large.jpg "This link will open a new window.")

In this example spouse A settles a family trust (Trust A) for the benefit of spouse B and spouse B settles another family trust (Trust B) for the benefit of spouse A. Without the provision in the two trustees with common settlor test treating two persons who are married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship as the same single person, the trustees of Trust A and Trust B would not be associated despite the close community of interests.

The trustees of Trust A and Trust B are associated under new section YB 7 because Spouse A and Spouse B are treated as the same single person and therefore the trustees of Trust A and Trust B have a common settlor.

#### Trustee and settlor test (section YB 8)

A trustee of a trust and a settlor of the trust are associated persons under new section YB 8.

New section YB 10 provides that for the purposes of new section YB 8, "settlor" has the meaning set out in section HC 27, with the modification that a settlor does not include a person who provides services to a trust for less than market value.

An exception to the trustee and settlor test for certain employee trusts is contained in section YB 15.

As with the other trustee-related tests, the trustee and settlor test is an important element of the new associated persons definition. Without this test in the associated persons definitions, schemes could be developed to exploit such a loophole. This is illustrated by the following examples.

![Diagram of example: Trustee and beneficiary test (section YB 6)](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/5/e/5eb5a20041edcac6a59bf54fc1b24342/85-eg1-thumbnail.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203209&hash=99A7477CB2338A97F491FD4B788FC258)

[Larger version of image](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/2/3/2385220041ede5e2a643f74fc1b24342/85-eg1-large.jpg "This link will open a new window.")

In this example, Family Co. makes a payment to Family Trust. Ben is the sole shareholder of Family Co. and the settlor of Family Trust. 

Without a trustee and settlor test in the associated persons definition the payment from Family Co. to Family Trust is not caught as a dividend despite the close community of interests. This is because Family Trust would not be associated with Ben who is the sole shareholder of Family Co. 

Under the new trustee and settlor test in section YB 8, Ben and Family Trust are associated persons as Ben is the settlor of Family Trust. The payment from Family Co. to the Family Trust is accordingly treated as a dividend because Family Co. has made a payment to an associated person (Family Trust) of its shareholder (Ben) in terms of section CD 6(1)(a)(ii).

![Diagram of example of trustee and settlor test (section YB 8)](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/3/7/37a2790041edc8eaa592f54fc1b24342/85-eg2-thumbnail.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203205&hash=62F12E4555C60A24ACE637A2CC0547EB)

[Larger version of image](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/9/9/9912e18041ede626a64af74fc1b24342/85-eg2-large.jpg "This link will open a new window.")

In this example, a non-resident settles a New Zealand trust (with a New Zealand-incorporated company as trustee) which owns New Zealand land and buildings. This investment by the trustee is funded by a loan from the non-resident settlor. If the non-resident is not associated with the New Zealand trustee, then the interest paid on this loan qualifies for the approved issuer levy (AIL) of 2% instead of being subject to the higher non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) rate.

The previous associated persons definition used in the AIL rules was generally deficient in relation to arrangements involving trusts. In this example in particular, without a trustee and settlor test of association, the interest would qualify for AIL treatment despite the in-substance association between the two parties.

The new trustee and settlor test in section YB 8 would associate the non-resident with the New Zealand trustee. Accordingly, the interest derived by the non-resident from New Zealand would be subject to a higher rate of NRWT instead of AIL at 2%, which is the appropriate treatment.

#### Settlor and beneficiary test (section YB 9)

A settlor of a trust and a person who has benefited or is eligible to benefit under the trust are associated persons under section YB 9. This test does not apply for the purposes of the land provisions (as defined in section YA 1).

The settlor and beneficiary test is the third test of association (the others being the trustees with a common settlor and trustee and settlor tests) that is based on the settlor of a trust. This focus on the settlor is consistent with the settlor-based focus of the trust taxation rules.

Given that there is a sufficient connection between a trustee and a beneficiary, as well as between a trustee and a settlor to justify treating them as associated persons, there is equally a sufficient connection between a settlor and a beneficiary to justify treating them as associated persons as well.

An exception to the settlor and beneficiary test for certain employee trusts is also contained in section YB 15.

#### Definition of settlor (section YB 10)

As mentioned above, for the purposes of the settlor-based tests in sections YB 7 to YB 9, settlor has the meaning set out in section HC 27, with the modification that a settlor does not include a person who provides services to a trust for less than market value. This modification prevents a professional advisor who provides services to a trust at no charge being treated as a settlor of the trust.

The term "settlor" has a wide meaning under the section HC 27 definition of that term. A settlor of a trust is defined to mean broadly a person who transfers value to a trust. The definition of settlor is further extended by the provisions of section HC 28, the most significant of which are:

*   When a company makes a settlement, any shareholder with an interest of 10% or more in that company is treated as a settlor in relation to that settlement as well as the company itself.
*   When a trustee of a trust (the first trust) settles another trust (the second trust), the settlor of the second trust is treated as including any person who is a settlor of the first trust.
*   When a person has any rights or powers in relation to a trustee or settlor of a trust which enables the person to require the trustee to treat the person (or any nominee) as a beneficiary of the trust, the person is treated as a settlor of that trust.

The definition of "settlor" is used extensively in the Income Tax Act and its wide meaning is consistent with the settlor-based focus of the trust taxation rules in the Income Tax Act.

The definition of "settlor", in conjunction with the nominee look-through rule in section YB 21, does not include professional advisers acting on behalf of clients and other persons such as friends and family members who simply allow their name to be listed as the settlor on a trust deed. The definition of "settlor" that is being used is essentially the same as that originally enacted in 1988 as part of a reform of the trust rules (with the exception that the provision of services at less than market value are excluded). The main focus of this definition is on persons who provide the trust property, and therefore does not include persons who merely allow their name to go on the trust deed as the named settlor.

It is therefore the client of the professional adviser, or the person that the friend or family member is acting for, who is treated as the settlor under the settlor-based tests in sections YB 7 to YB 9.

This position is consistent with Inland Revenue’s long-standing policy. _Tax Information Bulletin_ of November 1989 on the trust rules at paragraph 6.93 states:

*   "Often professional advisers or relatives will assist in establishing a trust by settling a nominal sum on trust on behalf of another person. In these circumstances it is not appropriate to expose the professional adviser or relative to a potential tax liability. The professional adviser or relative is not the real settlor of the trust but is in effect only an intermediary or facilitator. The real settlor is the person on whose behalf the professional adviser or relative acted in making the settlement. Thus, s.226(3) \[now section YB 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007\] treats the person for whom the nominee or the nominal settlor acted as the settlor rather than the nominee or nominal settlor."

#### Trustee and person with power of appointment or removal test (section YB 11)

A trustee of a trust and person who has a power of appointment or removal of the trustee are associated persons under section YB 11. This test is intended to complement the test associating a trustee and settlor in section YB 8. In many cases, a settlor of a trust, as the author of the instrument creating and governing the administration of the trust, retains the power to appoint or remove trustees. However, this power could be reposed in a separate person.

There is sufficient connection between a trustee of a trust and the person who has the power to appoint or remove the trustee to justify treating them as associated persons.

The situations considered to be caught by the test in section YB 11 associating a trustee and a person with the power of appointment or removal of the trustee include:

*   a person who holds a power to appoint or remove trustees jointly with another person; and
*   a person who holds a power to appoint or remove trustees only with the consent of another person (often referred to as the "protector").

However, the following situations are not considered to be caught by the test in section YB 11:

*   a person who holds a power to appoint or remove trustees only on the happening of certain events in the future (for example, the incapacity of another person) are not treated as currently holding a power of appointment or removal; and
*   a person (often referred to as the protector) who holds the power to veto the appointments or removal of a trustee (because they do not hold any positive power).

The requirement in the tripartite test in section YB 14 that two persons must be associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests should obviate any concerns about whether otherwise unrelated trustees are associated under that test merely because a professional advisor acting in their capacity as such has been granted the power to appoint or remove trustees by their clients.

An exception to the test associating a trustee and a person with a power of appointment or removal of the trustee for certain employee trusts is contained in section YB 15.

#### Partnership and partner test (section YB 12)

A partnership and a partner in the partnership are associated persons under section YB 12(1).

The tripartite test in section YB 14 - which associates two persons if they are each associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests - will not apply to associate the partners themselves with each other. This is because partners in a partnership would be associated with the same third person (the partnership) under the same associated persons test, namely section YB 12.

![Diagram of example: Partnership and partner](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/c/7/c70b2e8041edd1fea5b3f54fc1b24342/87-eg1-thumbnail.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203202&hash=07EBFA866994BDFC1FD4FE627260AED5)

[Larger version of image](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/8/3/83642b8041ede948a657f74fc1b24342/87-eg1-large.jpg "This link will open a new window.")

A, B and C are individuals who are partners in a partnership. Under the partnership and partner test in section YB 12, Partners A, B, and C are each associated with the partnership. However, they are not associated with each other under the tripartite test in section YB 14 through their association with the partnership. The partners may still be associated with each other under a different associated persons test. For example, if partners B and C were married they would be associated with each other under the relatives test in section YB 4.

The test associating a partnership and an associate of a partner in former section YB 17 has been subsumed by the new tripartite test in section YB 14, which associates two persons if they are each associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests. This means that an associate of a partner, such as a spouse of a partner, would still be associated with the partnership itself, as illustrated in the following example.

![Diagram of example: Partnership and associate of a partner: association through tripartite test](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/0/5/055a298041edd2a3a5bbf54fc1b24342/87-eg2-thumbnail.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203211&hash=EEB7C90588E34663A9BE518FB45EE320)

[Larger version of image](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/7/8/7889d20041edead3a662f74fc1b24342/87-eg2-large.jpg "This link will open a new window.")

In this example, the spouse of Partner C is associated with Partner C under the relatives test in section YB 4, and Partner C and Partnership are associated under the partnership and partner test in section YB 12. Therefore, applying the tripartite test, Spouse and Partnership are associated persons as they are each associated with the same third person (Partner C) under different associated persons tests.

#### _Limited partnerships_

There is a separate test for determining if a limited partnership and a limited partner are associated. A limited partnership (as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007) and a limited partner are associated only if the limited partner has a partnership share of 25% or more in the limited partnership (section YB 12(2)). This treatment is appropriate because a limited partner cannot be involved in the management of the partnership (unlike in a general partnership). It should be noted that section YB 12(2) is limited to the limited partners and not the general partner in a limited partnership. A general partner in a limited partnership will be associated with the limited partnership under section YB 12(1).

Section YB 12(3) and (4) contain aggregation rules for limited partnerships, similar to the aggregation rules in the company and person other than a company test in section YB 3 (the aggregation rule in section YB 12(3) applies for the purposes of the whole Act except the land provisions, and the more limited aggregation rule in section YB 12(4) applies for the purposes of the land provisions). This is appropriate given that a limited partner is more akin to a shareholder in a company and the interest threshold for associating a limited partner in a limited partnership - 25% - is the same as the threshold in section YB 3.

![Diagram of example: Aggregation rule for limited partnerships](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/8/1/81c03b8041edd37ba5c2f54fc1b24342/87-eg3-thumbnail.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203213&hash=BB72F51584B6DF71DD1F3B52C8DA543F)

[Larger version of image](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/a/2/a287d68041edeb5da669f74fc1b24342/87-eg3-large.jpg "This link will open a new window.")

In this example, in the absence of an aggregation rule, Spouse A and Spouse B would not be associated with Limited Partnership, as their respective shares in the partnership do not meet the required 25% threshold. However, applying the aggregation rule for limited partnerships in section YB 12(3), both Spouse A and Spouse B would be associated with Limited Partnership. This is because for the purposes of determining whether Spouse A is associated with Limited Partnership under section YB 12(2), Spouse A is treated as holding anything held by associates - in this case, Spouse A is associated with Spouse B under the relatives test in section YB 4. When Spouse A’s 12.5% share in Limited Partnership is aggregated with his associate’s (Spouse B) 12.5% share, the required 25% threshold is met and Spouse A is therefore associated with Limited Partnership under section YB 12(2).

Once again, the aggregation rule is applied afresh to each person. As a result, the aggregation rule is also applied in this case to associate Spouse B with Limited Partnership. This is consistent with the application of the aggregation rule in the company-related tests.

#### Tripartite test (section YB 14)

The tripartite test in section YB 14 associates two persons if they are each associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests.

The tripartite test acts as an important buttress to the other associated persons tests and makes the associated persons definition as a whole more difficult to circumvent.

For the tripartite test to associate two persons, each of these persons must be associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests, not including the tripartite test itself. The requirement that the two persons cannot be associated with the same third person under the tripartite test itself is necessary to prevent the tripartite test operating in a reiterative manner. The requirement that the two persons have to be associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests ensures that the tripartite test does not apply more widely than is necessary to protect the tax base.

The examples below illustrate the important role of the tripartite test in preventing the other associated persons tests being circumvented by arrangements involving the interposition of relatives, companies and trusts which are under the influence or control of the main protagonists.

![Diagram of example: Application of the tripartite test](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/b/6/b6e79d8041edd4e3a5cbf54fc1b24342/88-eg1-thumbnail.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203201&hash=BC0A367119D3DDA6A0D5EF919EA60962)

In this example, the employer makes a low-interest loan to Trust which in turn makes a distribution to Beneficiary Co. which is wholly owned by an employee of the employer. The tripartite test in section YB 14 associates Trust with the employee because they are both associated with Beneficiary Co. In particular, Trust is associated with Beneficiary Co, under the trustee-beneficiary test in section YB 6 and the employee is associated with Beneficiary Co. under the test in section YB 3 associating a company and a person other than a company. As a result, because the employer has provided a fringe benefit (the low-interest loan) to an associate of an employee, the employer would have to account for FBT on the low-interest loan.

![Diagram of example: Application of the tripartite test](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/c/d/cd85078041edd56aa5d2f54fc1b24342/88-eg2-thumbnail.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203215&hash=9ADA37252225CD77B4E7F08D6EBB814E)

[\[Larger version of image](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/d/8/d84fbc8041edec3ca677f74fc1b24342/88-eg2-large.jpg "This link will open a new window.")\
\
In the above example, Suzie settles two family trusts: Trust A and Trust B. Trust A in turn owns all the shares in Family Co. The issue is whether Family Co. is associated with Trust B.\
\
Without a tripartite test, Family Co. and Trust B would not be associated, despite the close community of interests between them. However, under the tripartite test in section YB 14, Family Co. and Trust B are associated. In particular, Family Co. is associated with Trust A under the company and person other than a company test in section YB 3, and Trust A is associated with Trust B under the two trustees with a common settlor test in section YB 7. Therefore, under the tripartite test, Family Co. and Trust B are associated persons.\
\
![Diagram of example: Application of the tripartite test and the aggregation role](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/6/9/69ee0c0041edd71ba5dff54fc1b24342/89-eg1.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203212&hash=416752A52EDC3860DF448FDA1377971F)\

\
In this example, Developer’s spouse settles Trust, which in turn owns all the shares in Family Co. The issue is whether Developer is associated with Family Co. under the test associating a company and a person other than a company in section YB 3.\
\
Developer would be associated with Family Co. under the company and person other than a company test because of the application of the aggregation rule in that test, in conjunction with the tripartite test. In particular, Developer would be treated for the purposes of the company and person other than a company test as holding all the shares held by Trust in Family Co. This is because Trust is associated with Developer under the tripartite test: Developer is associated with his spouse under the relatives test (section YB 4) and Developer’s spouse is associated with Trust under the trustee and settlor test (section YB 8), which means that Developer is associated with Trust under the tripartite test.\
\
Without the tripartite test in section YB 14 and the rule in the company and person other than a company test aggregating interests held by associated persons, Developer would not be associated with Family Co. even though there is a large community of interest between them.\
\
##### _Different associated persons requirement_\
\
The requirement in the tripartite test in section YB 14 that the two persons have to be associated with the same third person under different associated person tests is designed to prevent the tripartite test applying more widely than is necessary to protect the tax base. This requirement is illustrated by the following examples.\
\
![Diagram of example: Different associated persons requirement](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/3/a/3a43108041edd7bca5e9f54fc1b24342/89-eg2-thumbnail.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203157&hash=791B58D024CC7552F36F1D968A0C35C2)\
\
[Larger version of image](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/f/5/f508038041ededa6a686f74fc1b24342/89-eg2-large.jpg "This link will open a new window.")\
\
In this example, individuals X, Y and Z, who are not associated with each other, own all the shares in Company A, Company B and Company C. Without the different associated persons tests requirement, Company A and Company C would be associated under the tripartite test in section YB 14, despite not having any common shareholders. However, because Company A and Company C are each associated with Company B under the same two companies test in section YB 2, they are not associated under the tripartite test.\
\
![Diagram of example: Different associated persons requirement](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/5/4/54d3c30041edd86aa5f0f54fc1b24342/89-eg3-thumbnail.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203215&hash=DD735FBAD3642AA7E09009CAE68CB30C)\
\

\
In this example, Jim and Jo, who are not separately associated with each other, each hold 50% of the voting interests in Company D and are therefore each associated with Company D under the test in section YB 3 associating a company and a person other than a company. Without the different associated persons tests requirement, Jim and Jo would be associated under the tripartite test. However, because Jim and Jo are each associated with Company D (the common third person) under the same test (section YB 3), they are not associated under the tripartite test in section YB 14.\
\
##### _Exception for companies tests (section YB 14(2))_\
\
As well as not applying to associate two persons if they are each associated with the same third person under the same associated persons test, the tripartite test will not associate two persons if they are each associated with the same third person under the company-related tests in sections YB 2 and YB 3.\
\
![Diagram of example: Tripartite test: Companies tests exception](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/7/6/7613dc8041edd95aa5f6f54fc1b24342/90-eg1-thumbnail.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203217&hash=ED4EB6500CD6B504FCABB6D369D2A5E5)\
\

\
In this example, Sid is associated with Company X under the company and person other than a company test in section YB 3, and Company X and Company Y are associated under the two companies test in section YB 2.\
\
Without the companies tests exception in section YB 14(2), the tripartite test would apply to associate Sid and Company Y (Company X being the common third person). This would be the case even though Sid only has a 12.5% interest in Company Y - the product of multiplying Sid’s 25% interest in Company X by Company X’s 50% interest in Company Y - which is below the 25% threshold in the company and person other than a company test in section YB 3. The companies test exception in section YB 14(2) ensures that Sid is not associated with Company Y under the tripartite test.\
\
#### Exceptions for certain trusts and charitable organisations (sections YB 16 and YB 8(2))\
\
##### _Energy consumer trusts and bonus bonds unit trust_\
\
Under section YB 16(1), a lines trust established under the Energy Companies Act 1992, commonly referred to as an energy consumer trust, is excluded from the trustee for relative test (section YB 5) and the test associating trustees and beneficiaries (section YB 6). This is because such trusts are public in nature and do not pose a risk to the tax base. Such large public trusts are different in nature from private trusts which are intended to be subject to the associated persons tests.\
\
Excluding energy consumer trusts from the tests in sections YB 5 and YB 6, ensures that discounts to consumers from electricity lines companies owned by consumer trusts are not treated as dividends, as illustrated in the following example.\
\
![Diagram of example: Exception for energy consumer test](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/7/6/7630dc8041edda2da5fef54fc1b24342/90-eg2-thumbnail.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203203&hash=0B0F148E9AF99D096A5D156BB3C79094)\
\
[Larger version of image](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/2/e/2e94580041edeee8a6a5f74fc1b24342/90-eg2-large.jpg "This link will open a new window.")\
\
The exception for energy consumer trusts also prevents consumer beneficiaries from being associated with one another. Even without this exception, the scope of the tripartite test is such that it would not apply to treat consumer beneficiaries as associated persons. Using the above example, this means that the developer beneficiary and the non-developer beneficiary will not be associated persons. This is because they are both associated with the same third person (Energy consumer trust) under the same associated persons test, namely the trustee and beneficiary test in section YB 6, which means that the tripartite test does not apply.\
\
Additionally, section YB 16(1) also excludes the unit trust that administers bonus bonds from the associated persons tests in section YB 5 and YB 6 because of its public nature. This unit trust is excluded from the unit trust definition in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, and therefore is not treated as a company, which means that the trust-related associated persons tests could potentially apply to it.\
\
##### _Charitable organisations_\
\
Under section YB 16(2), "charitable organisations" (as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007) are not treated as beneficiaries for the purposes of tests associating trustees and beneficiaries (section YB 6) and settlors and beneficiaries (section YB 9).\
\
![Diagram of example](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/f/c/fc5c2a0041eddae4a60cf74fc1b24342/91-eg-thumbnail.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203221&hash=1454DF2933BF02B4F693BA078FDC15CB)\
\
[Larger version of image](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/5/2/52b0800041edf033a6bbf74fc1b24342/91-eg-large.jpg "This link will open a new window.")\
\
Without the exception for charitable organisations in section YB 16(2), the beneficiary-related tests could have unintended consequences. For example, if the beneficiary of several unrelated trusts is the same charity, the trustee and settlor of each such trust could end up being associated with the trustees and settlors of the other trusts without being aware of the fact. This exception therefore ensures that trustees and settlors of trusts in this situation are not treated as associated persons simply because the same charity is a beneficiary under their trusts.\
\
##### _Charitable trusts_\
\
The trustee and settlor test in section YB 8 does not apply if the trust is a charitable trust. This exception - section YB 8(2) - prevents donors to a charitable trust being associated with each other. A charitable trust under the Income Tax Act 2007 is required to be registered as a charitable entity under the Charities Act 2005 and is therefore subject to any regulatory requirements of that Act. Such charities do not pose a risk to the tax base and therefore it is not necessary to include them in the trustee and settlor associated persons test.\
\
#### Rationalising associated persons references in operative provisions\
\
A number of operative provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 previously contained modifications or additional wording in their associated persons references. These modifications were a result of different combinations of the associated persons tests in former subpart YB applying, in particular, the tests that applied for the purposes of the whole Act (excluding the 1973, 1988 and 1990 version provisions) or the 1988 version provisions (corresponding to the associated persons definitions in sections OD 7 and OD 8(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004). An example of such a provision was section EX 21(15).\
\
These modifications to the associated person references in the operative provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 have been generally omitted because they have been effectively subsumed by the various reforms to the associated persons tests in new subpart YB. The wording of these operative provisions therefore has been significantly simplified because they will simply refer to persons being associated without more (for example, without various references to the 1973, 1988 or 1990 version provisions). As a result, the wording of the associated person references in the operative provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 are now streamlined and easier to understand.\
\
For example, the wording of section GB 28(2) was:\
\
*   "A person is treated as being associated with another person if a person would be treated as being associated under the parts of subpart YB (associated persons and nominees) that apply for the purposes of the whole Act (excluding the 1973, 1988, and 1990 version provisions), or the 1988 version provisions, at the time the services are personally performed by the working person."\
\
This wording has been replaced by:\
\
*   "A person is treated as being associated with another person if they are associated at the time the services are personally performed by the working person."\
\
The definitions of the 1973, 1988 and 1990 version provisions and previous section YB 20 have been repealed because they are largely subsumed by the various reforms to the associated persons tests in subpart YB. These definitions equate to the lists of operative provisions to which the former specific associated persons definitions in sections OD 8(4), OD 8(3) and OD 8(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004 applied. However, because of the various modifications that apply in the associated persons tests in relation to the land transaction provisions, previously defined as the "1973 version provisions", this definition has been re-enacted in section YA 1 and called "land provisions".\
\
The new associated persons definition in the Income Tax Act 2007 also applies in the Tax Administration Act 1994 because of section 3(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.\
\
A number of the specific modifications or additional wording in the associated persons references in the operative provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 were incorrect. These references have been corrected applicable from the commencement of the Income Tax Act 2007 on 1 April 2008, even though these references themselves have been omitted as part of these reforms of the associated persons definitions. It is necessary to correct these references from the commencement of the Income Tax Act 2007 on 1 April 2008 because the current associated person reforms do not apply generally until the 2010-11 income year.\
\
##### _Section CD 6(1)(a)(iii) repealed_\
\
A transfer of value from a company to a person is a dividend if the cause of the transfer is a shareholding in the company as described in section CD 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section CD 6(1)(a)(iii) contained an extension which treated as a dividend any distribution made by a company to a trust under which a shareholder of the company, or spouse, civil union or de facto partner of the shareholder, was a beneficiary. This trust extension rule has been repealed because its function is performed by the new associated persons definition - in particular, the trustee-beneficiary test in new section YB 6.\
\
##### _Section CD 22(9) amendment_\
\
The definition of "fifteen percent interest reduction" in section CD 22(9), which relates to the share buy-back exclusion from the dividend definition, refers to "counted associate", which is defined inter alia as "a trustee of a trust under which a spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner, or minor child of the shareholder is a beneficiary". This wording has been amended so that it is consistent with other references in the associated persons definitions which describe discretionary beneficiaries. The provision now refers to a person who has benefited or is eligible to benefit under a trust (instead of referring to a beneficiary).\
\
##### _Section DB 42(2) amendment_\
\
Section DB 42(1) allows a taxpayer a deduction for any loss arising through misappropriation by an employee. Former section DB 42(2) stated that this deduction was not available if the taxpayer and the defalcating employee were associated in certain ways.\
\
The new associated persons definition is comprehensive enough to cover all the relationships described in former section DB 42(2). Therefore the specific associated persons tests in this provision have been replaced by a standard associated persons reference. New section DB 42(2) simply provides that the section does not apply when a person who misappropriates property is associated with the person who carries on the business.\
\
##### _Omitted tests_\
\
Several associated persons tests contained in the previous subpart YB of the Income Tax Act 2007 have been omitted for simplification and rationalisation purposes. These omitted tests were:\
\
*   The test associating two persons if they habitually act together (former section YB 18).\
*   The test associating a person and a charity, friendly society, or non-profit body controlled by that person or a relative of that person (former section YB 19).\
*   The tests associating two companies and a company and a person other than a company, which were based on income interests (former sections YB 3 and YB 7). These tests were redundant given the equivalent comprehensive tests based on voting interests. The existence of these tests can be explained historically by the fact that they were originally enacted in 1988 before the voting interest concept was enacted in 1992.\
*   The test associating a partnership and an associate of a partner (former section YB 17). This test has been subsumed by the new tripartite test in section YB 14. Under the tripartite test two persons are associated if they are each associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests. This means that an associate of a partner, such as a spouse of a partner, would still be associated with the partnership under the tripartite test.\
\
#### Rationalisation of other income tax provisions\
\
A number of provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 embodying a related person concept, similar to that in the associated persons definitions, have been rationalised. It is desirable, from a simplification perspective, that similar concepts in the Act be addressed similarly.\
\
##### _Replacing company control definition with associated persons definition_\
\
Section YC 1 of the Income Tax Act, which defined when a company was treated as being under the control of any persons, has been repealed. Its function is now performed by the new associated persons definition.\
\
The definition of company control in section YC 1 and the definitions of associated persons in subpart YB are conceptually similar in that they define related parties for the purposes of operative provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007. The separate use of the section YC 1 company control definition rather than the associated persons definitions was probably a legacy of the company control definition being developed in the Income Tax Act before the associated persons definitions. The company control definition in the Act was first implemented in 1939, whereas the first associated persons definition in the Act was not enacted until 1968.\
\
Allowing section YC 1 to be subsumed by the new associated persons definition is a desirable simplification measure.\
\
The provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 which previously employed the section YC 1 definition of company control, have been amended to use the new associated persons definition. They are:\
\
*   section GC 5 (leases for inadequate rent);\
*   section RF 11 (dividends paid to companies under control of non-residents); and\
*   paragraph (a) of the definition of "holding company" in section YA 1.\
\
##### _Replacing related person definition with associated person definition_\
\
Former section CD 44(15) to (17) of the Income Tax Act 2007 contained a definition of "related person" which was used in section CD 44(11) and (12) to determine the amount of the capital gain exclusion from a dividend arising from the realisation of a capital asset in the course of a company’s liquidation. As part of the amendments to rationalise the Income Tax Act provisions which embody an associated persons concept, the function of the former related person definition in section CD 44 will be performed by the new associated person definition.\
\
Section CD 44(11) and (12) have been replaced by section CD 44(10A) and (10B) with associated persons references replacing related persons references. The new provisions apply for capital gain amounts derived or losses incurred after 31 March 2010, therefore ensuring that the changes have prospective application only.\
\
For capital gain amounts derived or capital loss amounts incurred between 1 April 1988 to 31 March 2010, the previous law which used the related person definition continues to apply. This law contained in former section CD 44(11), (12) and (15) to (17), is now contained in section CZ 9B of the Income Tax Act 2007.\
\
The references to related persons in the dividend definition in section YA 1 have also been replaced with references to associated persons.\
\
##### _Definition of "relative"_\
\
The definition of "relative" in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 has been simplified so that it extends only to the second degree of blood relationship. Previously the definition also extended for the purposes of some provisions to the fourth degree of blood relationship. The new definition of relative includes a trustee of a trust under which a relative has benefited or is eligible to benefit - this continues the effect of paragraph (c)(v) of the old relative definition.\
\
#### Application of changes to other Acts\
\
A number of provisions in other Acts, which utilise the associated persons definitions in the Income Tax Act 2007, have been consequently amended as a result of these reforms. The provisions in these other Acts are:\
\
*   Fisheries Act 1996, section 59(10)(c) and (d);\
*   Misuse of Drugs Amendment Act 2005, section 31;\
*   Privacy Act 1993, section 6;\
*   Radiocommunications Act 1989, sections 153(2) and 161(2); and\
*   Smoke-free Environments Act 1990, section 2(1).\
\
A number of provisions in other Acts also utilised former section YC 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which defined when a company was treated as being under the control of any persons. These references to section YC 1 have been replaced with references to the new associated persons definition in the Income Tax Act 2007. The provisions in these other Acts are:\
\
*   Insolvency Act 2006, section 182(1);\
*   Public Service Investment Society Management Act (No.2) 1979, section 2(2);\
*   Trustee Companies Management Act 1975, section 2(2); and\
*   Unit Trusts Act 1960, section 3(4).

New disclosure and record-keeping rules relating to resident foreign trustees apply from 1 October 2006.
========================================================================================================

2006 legislation provides a temporary exemption from tax on foreign income for new migrants and certain returning New Zealanders.

### Sections CD 34, CE 2, CQ 2, CQ 5, CW 22B, DN 2, DN 6, EW 5, EW 37, EW 42, EX 16, EX 35, EX 52, FC 22, FC 23, FC 24, HH 2, HH 4, KD 3, NG 2, OB 1 and OE 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004

New rules have been introduced to help remove the tax barriers inhibiting international recruitment to New Zealand.

The tax exemption is for four calendar years (up to 49 months) from the date you qualify as a New Zealand tax resident. The exemption starts from the time you are treated as being tax resident in New Zealand, and is valid until the last calendar day of the month, four years after the month in which you began to meet the residency requirements.

### Background

The rules were introduced to help New Zealand businesses recruit highly skilled individuals from overseas, resulting in positive effects for the New Zealand economy.

Under New Zealand's residence rules, an individual who has been in New Zealand for an aggregate of 183 days in any 12-month period is considered to be a New Zealand resident and is liable to pay New Zealand tax on their worldwide income. Consequently, people coming to New Zealand from overseas may have faced extra tax costs compared with what they would have at home or in other countries. This is partly because some of New Zealand's tax rules relating to foreign-sourced income - such as the foreign investment fund rules and the controlled foreign companies rules - are more comprehensive than those of other countries. Often these extra tax costs were passed on to New Zealand businesses who recruited these people or who used their services. This occurred because the individual often negotiated higher remuneration to compensate for the additional tax liability.

Concerns with the previous law were highlighted by the Tax Review in 2001 in its Final Report and also in the government discussion document, Reducing tax barriers to international recruitment to New Zealand, released in November 2003.

### Key features

The amendments introducing the new international recruitment rules are in the Income Tax Act 2004.

#### Eligibility for the exemption

The new rules for eligibility are contained in sections FC 23 and FC 24. The exemption applies to an individual who is a "transitional resident". An individual is a "transitional resident" provided that she or he has not been tax-resident in New Zealand during the last 10 years, and provided that she or he has never been a transitional resident before. The period that the person becomes a "transitional resident" (the period of exemption) starts on the first day of the month that the individual arrives in New Zealand to take up the exemption and continues for a further 48 months.

#### Types of income that are exempt

##### Foreign-sourced income

Section CW 22B provides that all foreign-sourced income derived by a transitional resident is exempt, except for employment income connected with employment performed while a transitional resident and income from the supply of services.

##### CFC rules

Sections CQ 2 and DN 2 exempt transitional residents from the controlled foreign company (CFC) rules. Attributed CFC income and attributed CFC losses do not arise if an individual holding an interest in a foreign company is a transitional resident.

##### FIF rules

Sections CQ 5 and DN 6 exempt transitional residents from the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules. FIF income and FIF losses do not arise if an individual holding an interest in a foreign investment fund is a transitional resident.

##### Financial arrangements rules

Section EW 5(15B) ensures that the financial arrangements rules do not apply to foreign financial arrangements of transitional residents.

##### Share options

Section CD 2(9) provides that a transitional resident who is granted an employee share option while non-resident, and who exercises the option while a transitional resident, is not liable for tax on the proportion of the gain derived which relates to overseas employment.

##### Trusts

Section HH 2 provides that a trust is considered as a foreign trust for the duration of the exemption if the settlor is a transitional resident. This means that the 12-month period to elect for a foreign trust to become a qualifying trust begins on the date that the settlor ceases to be a transitional resident.

Section HH 4 provides that if the settlor of a trust is a transitional resident, the trustee is not subject to tax on income derived from outside New Zealand.

##### NRWT

Section NG 2(1)(b) provides that transitional residents do not have to withhold non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) - for example, on foreign mortgages.

#### Other changes

The definition of "qualifying person" in sections KD 3 and OB 1 has been amended to exclude transitional residents and their spouses. The effect is that transitional residents and their spouses are not eligible for any form of family assistance. Similarly, the definition of "principal caregiver" in section OB 1 has been amended, so that transitional residents and their spouses are not eligible for an in-work payment.

### Application date

The amendments apply from 1 April 2006 for people arriving in New Zealand on or after this date, with application from the 2005-06 income year and subsequent income years.

### Detailed analysis

#### Eligibility and length of the exemption

The exemption applies to new migrants and returning New Zealanders, who arrive in New Zealand on or after 1 April 2006, and satisfy the definition of "transitional resident". To satisfy the definition of "transitional resident", an individual cannot have been tax-resident in New Zealand during the previous 10 years (section FC 23(b)). Furthermore, the individual cannot previously have been a transitional resident (section FC 23(c)).

The period that the person becomes a "transitional resident" (the period of exemption) starts on the first day of the month the individual arrives in New Zealand to take up the exemption, and continues for a further 48 months (four years) (section FC 24).

An individual can only claim the exemption once in their lifetime (section FC 23(c)). Theoretically, an individual could defer claiming the exemption until a later time, when they will become eligible again.

**Example 1: Eligibility for exemption**  
  
Sally is a New Zealander who has been living in Australia for the past 12 years. Sally decides to return to New Zealand to take up an executive position in an exciting new company, and arrives in New Zealand to live on 24 April 2006.  
  
Sally will be a transitional resident and eligible for the temporary exemption on foreign-sourced income. The exemption will apply from the beginning of the month that she arrived to live in New Zealand - April 2006. The exemption will end on 30 April 2010, which is 48 months and 1 week after her arrival to live in New Zealand.

#### Determining residence for the purposes of the exemption

The definition of "residence" under New Zealand law (section OE 1(2)) is based on physical presence in New Zealand. If a person is present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period, they are considered to be New Zealand-resident from the first date they were present in New Zealand.

This would mean that for some new migrants or returning New Zealanders, their first date of residence would be backdated to a previous visit. Therefore, they would be ineligible for the exemption, if the date of the visit was before 1 April 2006. Or, the period of exemption would begin before the new migrant or returning New Zealander actually moved permanently to New Zealand.

To overcome this problem, sections OE 1(2B) and FC 23 include a rule which effectively ensures that the exemption period begins on the first day the individual arrives in New Zealand to take up the exemption. This is achieved by disabling the 183-day test for the 12 months before arrival, and relying on the "permanent place of abode" test in section OE 1(1).

The purpose of these changes is to exclude any "scoping visits" to New Zealand an individual may have made, when deciding whether or not an individual is eligible for the exemption and when the exemption begins. Note: Whether a person has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand is a question of fact. More information and a discussion of the relevant case law, is set out in Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 7, No. 1, July 1995, pages 10-12.

#### Exclusion from family assistance

Transitional residents and their spouses are not eligible to receive family assistance payments.

Family assistance entitlements are determined by a modified form of net income. If individuals derive offshore income that is exempt under the amendments their net income is reduced. Without any change to the law, individuals deriving exempt offshore income could receive family assistance payments that they would not otherwise be entitled to, or receive higher payments than they would otherwise be entitled to, if this income was not exempt.

For this reason, the definition of "qualifying person" in sections OB 1 and KD 3 and the definition of "principal caregiver" in section OB 1 have been amended.

If an individual is eligible for family assistance, when their foreign-sourced income is taken into account, they can choose not to be a transitional resident and pay tax on their foreign-sourced income. Furthermore, if a transitional resident finds that his or her circumstances change and they require family assistance, he or she could "give up" the exemption by paying tax on their foreignsourced income. That way they can be assessed for family assistance entitlements in the normal way.

#### Scope of the exemption

The types of income/taxes that are exempt under the new rules are, for example:

*   controlled foreign company income that is attributed under New Zealand's CFC rules;
*   foreign investment fund income that is attributed under New Zealand's FIF rules (including foreign superannuation);
*   non-resident withholding tax (for example, on foreign mortgages);
*   approved issuer levy (for example, on foreign mortgages);
*   income arising from the exercise of foreign employee share options;
*   accrual income (from foreign financial arrangements);
*   income from foreign trusts;
*   rental income derived offshore;
*   foreign dividends;
*   foreign interest;
*   royalties derived offshore;
*   income from employment performed overseas before coming to New Zealand, such as bonus payments;
*   gains on the sale of property derived offshore (held on revenue account); and
*   offshore business income (that is not related to the performance of services).

The new rules eliminate those taxes that are generally passed on to New Zealand employers and provides migrants with temporary relief from the most compliancecost intensive aspects of returning foreign income in New Zealand. Those eligible continue to be taxed on New Zealand-sourced income.

**Example 2: Scope of exemption**  
  
Rebecca is from France. She decides to move to New Zealand, and realises that she is eligible for the exemption. She currently owns several residential buildings in France, from which she receives rent and has a mortgage. She also has some shares in various French companies.  
  
She has a bank account with a French bank into which she receives rent from her tenants, and receives interest from the bank.  
  
Under previous New Zealand law, if she were to migrate to New Zealand, she would be liable to pay New Zealand tax on her rental income and interest from her bank accounts. She would also have to withhold non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on her mortgage interest payments made to the French bank. Furthermore, the shares she owns in French companies would constitute FIF interests. She would therefore be liable to pay New Zealand tax on the value of the shares as it accrued, regardless of how much had been distributed.  
  
The new exemption rules mean that she does not have to pay New Zealand tax on her rental and interest income for the period of the exemption. Nor does she have to withhold NRWT on her mortgage interest payments. Furthermore, for the period of exemption, she does not have to pay any New Zealand tax in relation to the shares held in various French companies (either on the value of the shares as it accrues or on distributions from the shares).

##### Employee share options

New section CE 2(9) effectively provides that if a share option is granted in relation to overseas employment (at a time when the employee was not a New Zealand resident), but exercised while the employee is a transitional resident, then the transitional resident will not be taxable on the exercise spread.

However, when the employment services to which a share option relates have been provided both overseas and in New Zealand, the individual is required to pay tax on the New Zealand proportion of the exercise spread. This is done by calculating the value of the benefit (as if the person was not a transitional resident) and deducting the value of the benefit attributable to the period employed as a non-resident, in accordance with the formula provided in section CE 2(9)(b):

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Value before reduction x | period employed as non-resident |
| Period employed |

  
**Example 3: Treatment of share options**  
  
David is a New Zealander who has worked abroad for 15 years, mostly in Asia. David started working for a multinational company on 2 May 2001. The multinational company transfers him to the New Zealand head office on 2 May 2006. On 1 May 2007, the multinational company issues him with some share options, which relate to his employment both in Asia and in New Zealand.  
  
He decides to exercise the share options in December 2007. The gain he receives is $200,000. When filing his tax return he realises that he has to pay tax on the New Zealand portion of the gain. He calculates it as follows:  
  

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| $200,000 x | 1,826 days |
| 2,191 days |
| \= $166,681.88 |     |
| Portion of New Zealand-sourced income |     |
| \= $200 000 - $166,681.88 |     |
| \= $33,318.12 |     |

David is therefore liable for New Zealand tax on $33,318.12.

##### Trusts

Previously, under section HH 2(1), if a settlor of a trust (that would have been a foreign trust had a distribution been made on the day immediately preceding the day that the settlor became a New Zealand resident) became resident in New Zealand, any settlor, trustee or beneficiary of the trust had 12 months to elect to make the trust a qualifying trust for New Zealand tax purposes. The amendment to section HH 2 defers the election until 12 months following the end of the exemption.

Furthermore, previously under section HH 2(1), a New Zealander who settled a foreign trust while non-resident could not elect into the qualifying trust rules upon his or her return to New Zealand. The changes to section HH 2 extend the election period to returning New Zealanders who are transitional residents. When a New Zealander who subsequently becomes a transitional resident settles a trust before their return, any settlor, trustee or beneficiary of the trust has 12 months, following the end of their exemption, to elect into the qualifying trust rules. The trust is deemed to be a foreign trust up until the date that they elect into the qualifying trust rules.

##### Foreign financial arrangements

New section EW 5(15B) states that an arrangement to which a transitional resident is a party to is an excepted financial arrangement if:

*   no other party to the arrangement is a New Zealand resident; and
*   the arrangement is not for the purpose of a business carried on in New Zealand by a party to the arrangement.

As an excepted financial arrangement, such an arrangement is excluded from the financial arrangements rules. This relieves the transitional resident from the compliance-cost intensive task of allocating income from the arrangement over the term of the arrangement and returning the income in New Zealand as allocated.

Furthermore, sections EW 37(1) and EW 42(1) have been amended to cover the situation where a transitional resident enters into the financial arrangement rules once the exemption is ended, or when the arrangement ceases to be an excepted financial arrangement.

##### Employment and services income

The reason for continuing to tax employment income and business income relating to services performed offshore is to prevent New Zealand-sourced income from being recharacterised as foreign-sourced income.

However, it is not uncommon for individuals who arrive in New Zealand to receive income from their previous overseas employment, such as bonus payments. This is because this income is often determined at a later date - for example, during a business's normal performance/pay review period. It would be inappropriate to tax this income simply because the individual is already in New Zealand.

Therefore, section CW 22B(c) excludes such income from being taxable. It provides that income from employment performed overseas before coming to New Zealand is exempt from New Zealand tax.

**Example 4: Treatment of previous employment income**  
  
Craig is a sales professional who arrived in New Zealand from the United States on 10 April 2006. He was offered and accepted a sales job in New Zealand. Before he left the US, he was responsible for securing a big client for his US firm.  
  
His former US employer, during its six-monthly pay and performance review, decides to pay him a bonus for securing the client.  
  
This bonus was paid in relation to employment performed overseas before his arrival in New Zealand. Therefore, the bonus is exempt from New Zealand tax.

##### No deductions/losses can be taken against exempt income

As the exemption exempts foreign-sourced income, section DA 1 disallows deductions for any amount of expenditure or loss incurred in deriving this income. Similarly, any deduction that arises from investing into CFCs or FIFs will be disallowed, as transitional residents are exempt from the CFC and FIF rules.

**Example 5: Deductions against exempt income**  
  
Jordan, who has been living in the United Kingdom (UK) for 15 years, decides to move back home for his children's education. He owns a house in the UK, which he decides to rent out.  
  
However, before he leaves, he decides to modernise the house by painting it inside and out. The radiator is repaired and some electrical work is done on the house.  
  
While in New Zealand, Jordan receives rental income each month from his tenants. However, this income is exempt under the new rules. Therefore, he cannot claim a deduction/loss against his New Zealand sourced income for the repair work he had done on his house in the UK.

##### No CFC/FIF disclosure requirement

The changes to section EX 16 (income interest in a CFC) and EX 35 (attributing interest in a FIF) effectively mean that a transitional resident does not have an interest in a CFC or FIF. Therefore, the transitional resident does not have any disclosure requirement under section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

New disclosure and recordkeeping rules for foreign trusts
=========================================================

2006 legislation introduces new disclosure and record-keeping rules for foreign trusts.

### Sections HH 4(3BB) and HH 4(3BC) of the Income Tax Act 2004, sections 3(1), 22(2)(fb) and (m), 22(2C), 22(7)(d), 59B, 61(1B), 81(4)(mb), 143(1B), 143(IC), 147(2B) and 147B of the Tax Administration Act 1994

New disclosure and record-keeping rules have been introduced for foreign trusts. A New Zealand-resident trustee of a foreign trust (referred to as a "resident foreign trustee") is required to disclose certain information to Inland Revenue and keep financial and other records relating to each foreign trust for New Zealand tax purposes. They are also obliged to provide these records to Inland Revenue, if requested.

Failure to comply with these requirements may result in a resident foreign trustee being subject to sanctions, such as prosecution for knowingly failing to disclose or keep the required information. In certain circumstances, the resident foreign trustee may be taxed in New Zealand on the foreign trust's worldwide income.

All section references in this item are to the Tax Administration Act 1994, unless otherwise stated.

### Background

The new rules will enable New Zealand to meet its exchange of information obligations with its double tax rules will also ensure that New Zealand is better placed to meet its informational obligations as a member of the international community and organisations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

Previously, a foreign trust that received a foreignsourced amount of income was not required to provide information to Inland Revenue or keep records for New Zealand tax purposes about that income. A foreign trust is a trust that is not a unit trust and on each date on which a distribution is made from it, no settlor of it has been resident in New Zealand since the later of 17 December 1987 or the date that the first settlement was made under the terms of the trust.

Information relating to the foreign income of foreign trusts could be requested by foreign tax authorities under the exchange of information provisions in New Zealand's DTAs. As these trusts were not required to provide information to Inland Revenue, there was a risk that New Zealand was unable to provide foreign tax authorities with the information requested.

While the size of the problem is not readily definable, failure to provide information would have affected New Zealand's relationship with its DTA partners. Australian authorities, in particular, were concerned that foreign trusts were being established in New Zealand to avoid Australian tax.

The OECD has recently developed minimum standards to improve greater transparency and exchange of information between foreign tax authorities and to encourage international cooperation on tax matters. To comply with these standards, New Zealand must be in a position to exchange information on the foreign income of foreign trusts that are administered by New Zealand resident trustees.

### Key features

The new rules for resident foreign trustees are contained in the Tax Administration Act 1994 and in new sections HH 4(3BB) and HH 4(3BC) of the Income Tax Act 2004.

*   New section 59B requires that resident foreign trustees must disclose specified information relating to the foreign trust to Inland Revenue, including the name or other identifying particulars of the foreign trust; the name and contact details of the resident foreign trustees and whether a settlor is resident in Australia. If a resident foreign trustee claims to be a "qualifying resident foreign trustee", the name of the "approved organisation" and the name and contact details of the individuals who belong to the approved organisation must be disclosed. If a resident foreign trustee has been appointed to make the required disclosure and keep records, the name of that trustee and the names of the appointing trustees; any changes in this information. New sections 22(2)(fb) and (m), 22(2C) and 22(7)(d) require resident foreign trustees to maintain certain financial and other records in New Zealand for at least seven years after the end of the income year to which they relate. These records should enable the financial position of the foreign trust to be determined.
*   The records required to be maintained must be provided to Inland Revenue, if requested. Such requests may be made periodically in respect of foreign trusts that have an Australian-resident settlor, and on a case-by-case basis if a valid request for information is received from another country with which New Zealand has a DTA.
*   New sections 143(1B), 143 (1C) and current section 143A enable sanctions to apply to resident foreign trustees that knowingly fail to comply with the disclosure and record-keeping requirements.
*   New sections 147(2B) and 147B enable sanctions to apply to the directors or other individuals holding positions of influence over the affairs of a corporate trustee if the trustee has knowingly failed to comply with the new rules.
*   New sections HH 4(3BB) and HH 4(3BC) of the Income Tax Act 2004 provide that in certain circumstances, resident foreign trustees (other than "qualifying resident foreign trustees") may be taxed in New Zealand on the worldwide income of the foreign trust, until such time as the requested information is provided. If a foreign trust has at least one qualifying resident foreign trustee, the income of that trust will never be subject to tax in New Zealand. These trusts will effectively enjoy a safe-harbour treatment.
*   New section 59B(3) provides that in certain cases, there will be a two-year moratorium in applying the new rules.

### Application date

The new rules relating to resident foreign trustees apply from 1 October 2006.

### Detailed analysis

#### New definitions relating to foreign trusts (section 3(1))

##### Resident foreign trustees

The new rules apply to resident foreign trustees only. A "resident foreign trustee" is a person who:

*   either alone or jointly with another person, acts as trustee of a foreign trust; and
*   is resident in New Zealand within the meaning of section OE 1 or section OE 2 of the Income Tax Act 2004.

A resident foreign trustee can be an individual or a corporate body. A trustee of a foreign trust that is registered as a charitable entity under the Charities Act 2005 is specifically excluded from the definition of "resident foreign trustee".

##### Qualifying resident foreign trustees

A "qualifying resident foreign trustee" is a resident foreign trustee which:

*   if an individual is a member of an approved organisation; or
*   has a director or other individual in a position allowing significant influence over the management or administration of the trustee, who is resident in New Zealand within the meaning of section OE 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and is a member of an approved organisation.

##### Approved organisation

An "approved organisation" is an organisation whose members include individuals who are subject to a professional code of conduct and who are subject to a disciplinary process intended to enforce compliance with that code. Members of an approved organisation will typically provide trustee services in the course of their business activities.

In addition, the Commissioner has the discretion to consider other suitable criteria in approving an "approved organisation". Examples of other criteria the Commissioner may consider include:

*   whether the organisation's activities require its members to have certain qualifications; and
*   whether the organisation has a minimum number of members.

To ensure that resident foreign trustees know which organisations have been approved by the Commissioner, the names of these organisations will be published by Inland Revenue on its website and or in appropriate publications (new section 81(4)(mb).

#### Disclosure of information to Inland Revenue

New section 59B requires all resident foreign trustees to provide specific information to Inland Revenue. However, if there is more than one resident foreign trustee, the resident foreign trustees may appoint one of themselves as an agent for the purpose of making the required disclosure.

##### Information to be disclosed

The specific information includes:

*   the name or other identifying particulars (such as the date of settlement) about the foreign trust;
*   the name and contact particulars of the resident foreign trustees;
*   whether a settlor is resident in Australia;
*   if a resident foreign trustee claims to be a qualifying resident foreign trustee, the name of the approved organisation and the name and contact particulars of the individuals who belong to the approved organisation;
*   if a resident foreign trustee has been appointed by another resident foreign trustee as an agent to make disclosure and keep records required by the new rules, the name of that trustee and the names of the appointing trustees; and
*   any changes in the particulars referred to above.

The collection of this information will assist Inland Revenue to identify the appropriate trustee(s) when information about a foreign trust is requested by one of New Zealand's DTA partners.

Inland Revenue will provide the Australian Taxation Office with information relating to foreign trusts that have a resident foreign trustee and an Australianresident settlor on a regular basis. The requirement to inform Inland Revenue if a settlor of a foreign trust is an Australian resident is intended to ensure that Inland Revenue is in a position to request and provide this information. Australia is the only country to which New Zealand is proposing to provide information on that basis.

##### Timing of disclosure

The specific information must be provided as follows:

*   Resident foreign trustees appointed on or after 1 October 2006 will be required to provide the specific information to Inland Revenue 30 days after the later of the date of the person's appointment as a trustee or the date of the person's arrival in New Zealand.
*   Resident foreign trustees appointed before 1 October 2006 will be required to provide the specified information to Inland Revenue 60 days after the later of 1 October 2006 or the date of the person's arrival in New Zealand.

Therefore, in each case a disclosure will not be required until after the resident foreign trustee has arrived in New Zealand.

#### Keeping of financial and other records

New sections 22(2)(fb) and (m) impose an obligation on resident foreign trustees to maintain certain financial and other records in New Zealand for at least seven years after the end of the income year to which they relate.

If there is more than one resident foreign trustee the resident foreign trustees may appoint one of themselves as an agent for the purpose of keeping the records required by the new rules.

##### Meaning of "records"

The definition of "records" in section 22(7) has been amended to require resident foreign trustees of foreign trusts to keep and retain the following records:

*   documents that provide evidence of the creation and constitution of the foreign trust (trust deed or similar);
*   particulars of settlements made on, and distributions made by, the foreign trust, including the date of settlement or distribution, the name and address (if known) of settlors and recipients of distributions;
*   a record of the assets and liabilities of the foreign trust, and details of all sums of money received and expended by the trustee in relation to the foreign trust, including evidence of when and where the receipt and expenditure takes place; and
*   if the foreign trust carries on a business, the charts and codes of accounts, the accounting instruction manuals and the system and programme documentation which describes the accounting system used in each income year in the administration of the trust.

##### Differential record-keeping requirements

The records outlined above are required to be kept by all resident foreign trustees of foreign trusts that are in business.

Foreign trusts that are not in business are excluded from the requirement to keep information relating to their accounting information system. However, the records relating to the assets and liabilities of the foreign trust and the details of all sums of money received and expended by the trustee relating to the trust are required to be kept and retained. This more limited record-keeping is intended to reduce compliance costs for these trusts while ensuring that they maintain sufficient records to enable the financial position of the trust to be determined with reasonable accuracy.

##### Keeping of records offshore

Section 22(2) provides that a person who is required to keep records may apply to Inland Revenue for permission to keep records offshore, or in a language other than English. If a resident foreign trustee does not personally hold information relating to a foreign trust's offshore interests, the trustee may apply to Inland Revenue under this provision and the department may exercise its discretion to allow records to be kept offshore. If records are kept offshore, a trustee will be expected to provide records to Inland Revenue within a reasonable timeframe, if requested.

##### Keeping of records when no resident foreign trustee

If a resident foreign trustee leaves New Zealand and no resident foreign trustees remain in New Zealand, the departing trustee can either seek Inland Revenue's approval to keep and retain the records of the foreign trust outside New Zealand, or maintain the records of the foreign trust in New Zealand. It is the responsibility of the departing trustee to ensure that the records are readily available and can be provided at minimal cost to Inland Revenue, if requested.

#### Sanctions for non-compliance

##### Knowledge offence in section 143A

The main sanction for non-compliance with the new rules is the knowledge offence in section 143A. It applies if a resident foreign trustee "knowingly" fails to disclose information or keep or provide records, as required by law.

If a resident foreign trustee has failed to comply with the new rules but was not aware of these rules, sanctions will not apply. As a matter of practice, if Inland Revenue is aware of the name and contact particulars of a resident foreign trustee, it will notify the trustee of his or her tax responsibilities as a trustee of a foreign trust, seek the required information disclosure and outline the recordkeeping requirements. Whether the trustee is aware of his or her tax responsibilities will be a question of fact to be determined on a case-by-case basis, although it can be reasonably assumed that "professional trustees" and those trustees in the business of providing trustee services will be aware of the new requirements.

If a resident foreign trustee has failed to comply with the new rules and the trustee knew or ought to have known about his or her tax responsibilities as a trustee of a foreign trust, the trustee will be in breach of section 143A and, if convicted, will be subject to a monetary fine and/or imprisonment.

##### Sanctions for directors and managers of corporate trustees (new sections 147(2B) and 147B)

If a corporate trustee has committed an offence under section 143A, a director or other individual who is in a position allowing significant influence over the management or administration of the corporate trustee may also commit an offence under new section 147B. This will occur if the section 143A offence was caused by an act done, or carried out by, or by an omission of, or through knowledge attributable to the director or other person.

New section 147(2B) clarifies that the section 147B offence is not intended to apply to non-managerial employees of corporate trustees such as clerical staff.

##### Application of new sections HH 4(3BB) and HH 4(3BC) of the Income Tax Act 2004

If a non-compliant resident foreign trustee is not a "qualifying resident foreign trustee" and the trustee has been convicted of an offence under section 143A and has not provided the requested information, the world-wide income of the foreign trust will be subject to tax in New Zealand.

This tax liability ceases when the resident foreign trustee provides the required information to Inland Revenue. If a non-compliant resident foreign trustee is a "qualifying resident foreign trustee", the sanctions for noncompliance will be limited to the penalty in section 143A. Therefore, foreign trusts that have at least one qualifying resident foreign trustee will never be subject to tax on their world-wide income – they will effectively enjoy a safe-harbour treatment. A resident foreign trustee can become a qualifying resident foreign trustee, or appoint a co-trustee who meets the qualifying resident foreign trustee criteria, at any time to qualify for the safe-harbour treatment.

The possibility of conviction under section 143A should provide sufficient deterrent for qualifying resident foreign trustees to meet their obligations under the new rules. A successful conviction may lead to disciplinary action being taken by the professional body of which the trustee is a member.

##### Non-application of section 143

The criminal penalty for failure to disclose information or keep records as required by law in section 143 will not apply to resident foreign trustees if they did not know of the new requirements described above, and/or another resident foreign trustee had been appointed to meet those requirements. It is recognised that had this penalty applied it would have created unfair results, especially for non-professional trustees of family trusts or estates and those trustees who are not in the business of providing trustee services.

New section 143(1B) clarifies that a resident foreign trustee cannot commit an offence under section 143(1)(a) for not keeping books and documents required to be kept under section 22. This will occur if the trustee proves that he or she did not know of the requirements of section 22 and/or that another resident foreign trustee had been appointed as agent of the resident foreign trustees for the purposes of section 22 and Inland Revenue had been notified of the appointment.

New section 143(1C) clarifies that a resident foreign trustee cannot commit an offence under section 143(1)(b) for not disclosing information required to be disclosed under section 59B. This will occur if the trustee proves that he or she did not know of the requirements under section 59B and/or that another resident foreign trustee had been appointed as agent of the resident foreign trustees for the purposes of section 59B and Inland Revenue had been notified of the appointment.

#### Two-year moratorium in applying the new rules in certain cases

New section 59B(3) provides that the disclosure required under new section 59B(1) and (2) and the application of section 22(2)(fb) and (m) is delayed for a period of two years (calculated from the date on which the trustee becomes a New Zealand resident). This delay applies to individuals who have been appointed a trustee of a foreign trust before becoming a New Zealand resident and the trustee:

*   becomes a New Zealand resident on or after 1 October 2006; and
*   is not in the business of providing trustee services; and
*   has not been resident in New Zealand on any day in the period five years that ends immediately before the trustee becomes a New Zealand resident.

A trustee who is still resident in New Zealand at the end of the two-year period will be required to disclose the required information to Inland Revenue and start keeping records for New Zealand tax purposes. There is no ability to extend the two-year moratorium.

#### Requests for information about trusts from other countries

When a resident foreign trustee indicates that a settlor of a foreign trust is an Australian resident, Inland Revenue will periodically request additional information about the trust (such as financial records, details of distributions to beneficiaries and the identity of the settlor) and provide this information to the Australian Taxation Office.

Information will be provided to other DTA signatory countries on a case-by-case request basis, when Inland Revenue considers that there are valid grounds for requesting the information. Inland Revenue will not entertain general "fishing expeditions" from tax treaty partners for information on foreign trusts, or satisfy requests for information from countries that do not have a DTA or a tax information exchange agreement with New Zealand.

When a valid request for information is received, Inland Revenue will request additional information from the appropriate resident foreign trustee.

Inland Revenue is permitted to require information to be provided under section 17. That section imposes an obligation on persons to provide information that Inland Revenue considers necessary for any purpose relating to the administration or enforcement of the Inland Revenue Acts, or any other lawful function of the Commissioner.

Any information provided by a trustee will be subject to the existing tax confidentiality laws. Section 81 prevents Inland Revenue from providing information to a foreign jurisdiction except as permitted by section 88 such as under a DTA.

##### Related amendment

New section 61(1B) provides an exemption from the disclosure requirement in section 61 if the resident foreign trustee has complied with the disclosure requirement in new section 59B.

New double tax agreements with Chile, Poland and Spain, new protocols to Australia and Singapore agreements
===========================================================================================================

2006 Order in Council outlines double tax agreements with Chile, Poland and Spain and new protocols in existing agreements with Australia and Singapore.

Three new double tax agreements (DTAs) between New Zealand and Chile, Poland and Spain have entered into force. Two protocols amending existing double tax agreements with Australia and Singapore have also recently entered into force.

The new DTAs with Chile, Poland and Spain are expected to play an important part in facilitating increased bilateral trade and investment between those countries and New Zealand. They are designed to provide certainty of tax treatment and prevent the double taxation of cross-border transactions. By providing for the exchange of information on tax matters, the agreements will also play a valuable role in preventing tax evasion.

The Protocol to the DTA with Australia updates the exchange of information article and introduces a tax collection article between the two countries, which will help extend Australia's Wine Equalisation Tax rebate to New Zealand wine producers.

The Protocol to the Singapore DTA updates the agreement to resolve certain difficulties over the interpretation of the agreement covering entities providing consultancy services.

### New double tax agreements with Chile, Poland and Spain

The agreement with Chile was signed on 10 December 2003 and incorporated into New Zealand law by Order in Council on 21 June 2004. Double tax agreements do not come into force until the necessary legal procedures have been completed in both countries. Those procedures having also been completed in Chile, the agreement came into force on 21 June 2006. The agreement has effect for New Zealand withholding taxes from 1 January 2007 and for other New Zealand taxes for income years beginning on or after 1 April 2007.

The agreement with Poland was signed on 21 April 2005. The agreement with Spain was signed on 28 July 2005. These agreements were incorporated into New Zealand law by Orders in Council made on 26 June 2006. The necessary legal procedures have also been completed in both Poland and Spain. The DTA with Poland therefore came into force on 16 August 2006. It has effect for New Zealand withholding taxes from 1 January 2007 and for other New Zealand taxes for income years beginning on or after 1 April 2007. The agreement with Spain came into force on 31 July 2006 and has effect for New Zealand withholding taxes from 1 September 2006 and for other New Zealand taxes for income years beginning on or after 1 April 2007.

### Protocols amending existing double tax agreements with Australia and Singapore

Protocols setting out changes to New Zealand's existing DTAs with Australia and Singapore were signed on 15 November 2005 and 5 September 2005 respectively. Orders in Council incorporating those protocols into New Zealand law were made on 26 June 2006.

The Protocol with Australia updates the Exchange of Information Article in the existing DTA and broadens the application of that Article to all taxes. In addition, an Assistance in Collection of Taxes Article has been added. These changes will assist the extension of Australia's Wine Equalisation Tax Rebate to New Zealand wine producers. The protocol also gives Australia most favoured nation status in respect of withholding taxes on dividends, interest and royalties. The protocol came into force on 22 January 2007 and has effect from that date, except for Article 4, which inserts new Article 27 (Assistance in Collection of Taxes), which will take effect from a later date, to be agreed between Australia and New Zealand.

The Protocol with Singapore updates the existing DTA to cover New Zealand entities providing consultancy services in Singapore and Singapore entities providing those services in New Zealand. It came into force on 17 August 2006 and the changes it introduced apply to income derived on or after 1 January 2006.

New GST due date for March taxable periods
==========================================

The due date for the March GST returns has been extended to 7 May for the taxable periods ending on or after 31 March 2007.

##### Sections MB 13, MB 14, MB 24, MB 27, and Schedule 13 of the Income Tax Act 2004, and sections 120KC, 120KD of the Tax Administration Act 1994, and section 16 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985

To provide more time for businesses and tax agents to comply with their GST obligations and, from next year, to comply with their provisional tax obligations, the due date for the March GST returns has been extended to 7 May.

### Background

For taxable periods ending on or after March this year the due date for GST returns will change from the last working day of the month to the 28th of the month. Where the 28th falls on a weekend or public holiday, the due date will be the next working day. However, where GST returns are due over the Christmas period (November returns) the due date is extended to 15 January.

Consultations with tax agents has identified that the combination of the changes to the GST due date, bringing it forward by up to three days, and the introduction next year of provisional tax payments aligned to GST due dates could increase businesses' and tax agents' workloads over the Easter period. Also this increased workload occurs during a period where the number of working days available to do the work is reduced as a result of the Easter period.

### Application date

The new due date for March GST returns applies to taxable periods ending on or after 31 March 2007.

### Key features

Sections 16(2) and (5) have been amended to change the March taxable period due date from 28 April to 7 May.

Also a number of consequential amendments have been made to the examples that appear at the end of sections MB13, MB14, MB 24, and MB 27 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and sections 1 0KC and 1 0KD of the Tax Administration Act to reflect the new due date for the March GST taxable period.

Also Schedule 13, Part A of the Income Tax Act 2004 has been updated to reflect the new due date.

Issues with the “Pareto” statistical model attempting to improve the measurement of high wealth 1. As outlined in the supplementary briefing to the incoming Minister of Statistics – Measurement of high wealth in New Zealand (MM2456 refers), Inland Revenue (IR) has been investigating the application of a statistical modelling technique developed by Stats NZ (a “Pareto” model). This model was applied to combined Household Economic Survey (HES) and High Wealth Individuals Research Project data (high-wealth data). 2. Stats NZ has seconded an employee to IR’s High Wealth Individuals Research Project (the Project) to trial the use of this model. The high-wealth data continues to be protected in accordance with IR's Privacy Impact Assessment and has not been shared with Stats NZ. 3. This “Pareto” model developed has been found to not work effectively with the wide range of wealth values when HES data and high-wealth data from the Project is combined. In particular, the model considerably underestimates the level of wealth at the top end of the wealth distribution. That is, the estimate is considerably less than when you add the wealthiest in HES to those in the IR dataset. This issue only became apparent recently after the data was suitable to be tested in the model. 4. Improving the model to address these issues is not feasible in time for publication of the High Wealth Individuals Research report on 18 April 2023. Further, the Project has undertaken to destroy identifiable unit record level data shortly after Project completion. It is not clear that the model could be re-scoped within the required timeframe (although IR is investigating retention of some form of aggregated data). Stats NZ will reach out to the OECD for further advice. 5. It would likely take several months to address the issues with the model. Without certainty as to whether aggregated data will be created by IR, Stats NZ and IR are proposing to follow an alternative approach for publication in the report. Planned alternative approach 6. Stats NZ has been supporting IR in developing aggregated estimates of wealth for the population that are largely comparable with HES for inclusion in the report. Stats NZ and IR see considerable value in utilising this work to improve estimates of the top end of the wealth distribution. 7. Stats NZ has developed an approach that would allow the combination of HES and high-wealth data in a simpler way than “Pareto” modelling, and which the Project could undertake and include in the report to be published on 18 April 2023. 8. This approach effectively replaces some of the population that the wealthiest HES respondent represents with people (or households) in the Project dataset who have greater wealth than the wealthiest HES respondent. 9. This goes some way to addressing that these very wealthy individuals and households are not included in HES survey estimates. The approach may still underestimate the share of the wealth held by the top, as it only includes the wealth of those in the Project. Any wealth held by people who were not identified in the Project, or did not respond, is not included. This would, however, be greater cause for concern if there was a gap between the wealthiest HES respondent and the lowest wealth in the Project dataset, which is not the case. 10. The alternative approach will still account for "sampling error" i.e. the estimated error due to HES collecting information from a fraction of the population, rather than the entire population. The estimates of the wealth held by the top 1, 5, 10 and 50 percent in the report will therefore be a range, as is the case with the estimates on these shares that form part of the official net worth statistics Comparison of measures of high wealth across agencies 11. Following a meeting between the Minister of Statistics and Stats NZ officials in February 2023, the Minister of Statistics requested Stats NZ prepare material on the differences between measures of high wealth across Stats NZ, IR, and the Treasury. Summarised key messages are reflected in Appendix 1. 12. HES net worth survey data provides the most detailed data on the distribution of wealth of individuals and households, with a comprehensive and consistent framework that also provides detailed demographic information. 13. HES is, however, limited in respect of the very wealthy. For instance, all the wealth held by those wealthier than the richest HES participant is not included (MM2456 refers). 14. Combining high-wealth data and HES data – as is planned by the Project with methodological support from Stats NZ – improves on this, taking estimates closer to the actual level of wealth held by the top of the wealth distribution. While Stats NZ and IR have worked to align definitions as far as possible, there are still differences between the approach in the HES and the Project. For example, the Project includes some wealth estimates calculated from multipliers applied to earnings, whereas HES asks respondents market value of businesses. 15. Other methods, such as the capitalisation of taxable income used in the forthcoming Treasury Working Paper – Estimating the distribution of wealth in New Zealand – provide estimates of wealth based on all individuals for which taxation data is available. This avoids the issues with surveying the very wealthy, but relies on strong assumptions, particularly that the wealthy receive the same return on their assets as others. The research itself draws on HES data and aggregate level wealth data (the Stats NZ “household balance sheet”), alongside IR tax administrative data (separate to the high-wealth data). 16. Stats NZ has peer reviewed the Treasury’s capitalisation work. It is a valuable advance and a robust methodology, but the different estimates should be considered alongside each other to fully understand the distribution of wealth. In particular, HES data provides insights across different demographics, and combining HES data with the high-wealth data provides a conservative (i.e. potentially low) estimate of the share of wealth held at the top of the distribution which can be compared alongside estimates from the capitalisation approach. Next steps 17. Stats NZ officials will continue to improve statistical modelling by reaching out to the OECD (while maintaining confidentiality of data itself). It may be possible for modelling to be done before the conclusion of the Project – and the destruction of the unit record data – but this will depend on how work progresses. 18. Stats NZ will support IR to explore ways in which, consistent with the purpose of the Project and Privacy Impact Assessment, high level aggregate information on the distribution of wealth in the Project could be retained for research purposes. 19. The next release of the Household net worth statistics in early 2025 will refer to the estimates in the Project as a way of quantifying the possible wealth of those richer than the wealthiest HES participant. 20. Work to improve survey estimates and sampling approaches will continue at Stats NZ. 21. Officials are available to discuss this report with you at upcoming officials’ meetings, if required. Appendix 1: Key messages on different approaches to measure high wealth These key messages summarise the different approaches and data used to estimate high wealth across Stats NZ, Inland Revenue, and the Treasury. These can be used in response to any queries that may be received regarding these measures and upcoming reports. Officials can provide more detail on how the estimates themselves compare once these estimates are finalised. • Household surveys are a valuable source of information on wealth distribution; however, such surveys typically underestimate the top end of the wealth distribution • Given their small number, the wealthiest households have only a very small chance of being selected to take part in Stats NZ surveys from the approximately 1.9 million households in Aotearoa New Zealand • Further issues can arise if: (i) very wealthy households are less likely to respond than other households; or (ii) if these households underreport their assets when they do respond. • Whatever the reason for the non-observation of the wealthiest households, when they do not appear in the sample data, their absence contributes to an underestimation of the wealth distribution and the share of wealth at the top of the distribution • High Wealth Individuals Research Project data is obtained through direct request of information from individuals identified as holding high wealth, so is more targeted than the sampling in HES, which does not know household wealth before surveying begins. It therefore includes households not covered by HES. • Approaches that combine data on high wealth individuals, such as from Inland Revenue’s High Wealth Individuals Research Project, with survey data can improve estimates of wealth by accounting for wealthy individuals not sufficiently captured in sample surveys. This is the approach taken in the High Wealth Individuals Research Project Report • Estimates can be refined further as statistical modelling techniques are developed • These can be considered alongside approaches that calculate wealth in a different way, such as recent work by the Treasury that uses capital income (e.g. dividends and interest) from tax administrative data across the population to estimate wealth (Estimating the distribution of wealth in New Zealand) • Different approaches will always lead to slightly different estimates, but taken together, they can help provide a clearer picture on the concentration of wealth at the top

[Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2007](/new-legislation/act-articles/student-loan-scheme-amendment-act-2007 "Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2007")

New repayment rules for overseas-based borrowers
================================================

2007 amendment to the Student Loans legislation introduces new repayment rules for borrowers who are based overseas.

##### Sections 31 to 36B and 106 to 111 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992

New repayment rules have been introduced for borrowers who are based overseas.

### Background

Non-resident repayment obligations were initially designed so that loans would be repaid in a maximum of 15 years. This was achieved by requiring quarterly payments of a fixed amount of the principal (based on the loan balance at the beginning of the tax year following the year of departure), plus the estimated interest for the year. If the loan balance was less than $15,000, $1,000 of principal was required each year. For loans over $15,000, principal of one-fifteenth of the original loan balance was required. For many borrowers the amount that they were expected to pay was simply not achievable.

The repayment rules were inconsistent with the objective of encouraging borrowers to return to New Zealand and undermined the government's intent to ensure that debt levels are commensurate with the benefits borrowers receive from their tertiary study.

### Key features

Part 3 of the Act has been repealed and replaced with a new Part 3 (sections 31 to 36B).

### Three-year repayment holiday

Section 32 allows borrowers who become overseas-based after 1 April 2007 an automatic repayment holiday for a maximum period of three years, so their repayment obligation is nil during that period. The repayment holiday may be taken in more than one period, but entitlement remains only for periods during which the borrower is overseas-based.

Under section 33, a borrower may choose not to have a repayment holiday by giving notice to the Commissioner. An opt-out period can be taken more than once, and may be from an earlier date than when the borrower gives notice to the Commissioner. An opt-out period ends if a borrower becomes New Zealand-based. Notice of an opt-out period may be given to the Commissioner by telephone, in writing, or in any other manner acceptable to the Commissioner. However, the Commissioner may still require the notice to be in writing.

##### Transitional rules for borrowers who are overseasbased on 1 April 2007

Sections 106 and 107 restrict entitlement to a repayment holiday for borrowers who were overseas-based on 1 April 2007:

*   Borrowers who are not in arrears on a repayment obligation (whether established or not) are entitled to a three-year repayment holiday.
*   Borrowers who are in arrears and have been non-resident for a continuous period of more than 364 days, but less than two years, are entitled to a two-year repayment holiday.
*   Borrowers who are in arrears and have been non-resident for a continuous period of two years or more, but less than three years, are entitled to a one-year repayment holiday.
*   Borrowers who are in arrears and have been non-resident for a continuous period of three years or more are not entitled to a repayment holiday.

**Example 1**  
  
Katrina had lived in New Zealand all of her life. On 12 May 2008 she goes to the UK to do her OE. Katrina is entitled to a three-year repayment holiday from the day she becomes overseas-based. While she is on the repayment holiday her repayment obligation is nil, but she can make voluntary repayments if she wishes.  
**Example 2**  
  
Peter is overseas-based on 1 April 2007. He went overseas in 2002 and has always met his repayment obligations. Peter is entitled to a three-year repayment holiday from that date.  
**Example 3**  
  
Cath is overseas-based on 1 April 2007. She went overseas in September 2005 (and has been non-resident since leaving New Zealand). Cath has failed to meet her obligations since going overseas and is entitled to a repayment holiday of two years.  
**Example 4**  
  
Doug is overseas-based on 1 April 2007. He has been overseas for eight years (and has been non-resident since leaving New Zealand) and has failed to meet some of his repayment obligations. Doug is not entitled to a repayment holiday.

#### Repayment obligations of overseas-based borrowers not on a repayment holiday

Section 34 sets out the repayment obligations for overseas-based borrowers who are not on a repayment holiday. This includes the repayment obligations for borrowers who have chosen to have an opt-out period.

If the borrower's loan balance is less than $1,000, the borrower's repayment obligation for the first tax year that they are overseas-based and not on a repayment holiday is the amount of the borrower's loan balance.

Otherwise, repayment obligations are calculated as follows:

*   $1,000 a year for loan balances of $15,000 or less;
*   $2,000 a year for loan balances of $15,001 to $30,000; and
*   $3,000 a year for loan balances over $30,000.

If the repayment obligation is for less than a full tax year, the obligation is multiplied by:

|     |
| --- |
| the number of days in the tax year  <br>during which the borrower is overseas-based |
| 365 |

The amount of loan balance is the balance on the date the borrower took the repayment holiday and then at 31 March each year after that date (including interest compounded by that date).

Under section 35, for each tax year an overseas-based borrower is liable to pay a penalty on their entire loan balance, the borrower's repayment obligation is zero. In addition, if the repayment obligation calculated above is greater than the portion of the borrower's loan balance that is not subject to penalties, the repayment obligation is the amount of the loan balance not subject to penalties.

Section 36 specifies that repayments must be paid in two equal instalments that are due on 30 September and 31 March. If, however, a borrower is overseas-based for part of a tax year, under section 36A, the repayment obligation is payable in instalments determined by the Commissioner. For the part of the tax year that the borrower is New Zealand-based, the borrower's repayment obligation is determined in accordance with Part 2 of the Act, except that the amount of the repayment threshold is decreased in proportion to the number of days the borrower is New Zealand-based.

As soon as practicable after being notified, or becoming aware that a borrower is or will be overseas-based, under section 36B the Commissioner must make an assessment of the borrower's overseas-based repayment obligation for that year. The Commissioner must also continue to make an assessment of the borrower's repayment obligation for each year the borrower remains overseas-based. As soon as practicable after making the assessment, the Commissioner must give notice to the borrower of the assessed amount, except if the amount assessed is zero.

**Example 1**  
  
Olivia becomes overseas-based on 20 January 2009. On 5 May 2009, she opts-out of the repayment holiday, and the opt-out period applies from 1 April 2009. Because her loan balance is $31,500 on 31 March 2009, her repayment obligation for the tax year is $3,000. She is required to repay $1,500 on 30 September 2009 and a further $1,500 on 31 March 2010.  
**Example 2**  
  
Roberta becomes overseas-based on 1 February 2008. On 31 January 2011, her entitlement to a repayment holiday ceases. Roberta's loan balance on that date is $17,150. Roberta's repayment obligation for the remainder of the tax year is $2,000 x 59/365 = $323.29. She meets this repayment obligation and does not make any voluntary repayments. Her repayment obligation for the next tax year (1 April 2011 to 31 March 2012) is $2,000. $1,000 will be due on 30 September 2011 and a further $1,000 on 31 March 2012.

##### Interrelationship between amnesty on student loan penalties and new repayment obligations for overseasbased borrowers

The amnesty conditions override a borrower's entitlement to a repayment holiday or the repayment obligations of overseas-based borrowers not on a repayment holiday.

Under section 110, if a borrower was overseas-based on 1 April 2007, has come within the amnesty and met the repayment requirements, he or she is entitled to apply to the Commissioner for a three-year repayment holiday (once they have met the amnesty repayment requirements). An application may be made by telephone, in writing or in any other manner acceptable to the Commissioner. However, the Commissioner may require an application to be in writing. If a borrower does not make an application and subsequently becomes New Zealand-based, the borrower will be entitled to a repayment holiday of up to three years the next time they become overseas-based.

Under section 108, if a borrower comes within the amnesty but fails to comply with the amnesty conditions, he or she is entitled to a restricted repayment holiday as outlined under "Transitional rules for borrowers who are overseas-based on 1 April 2007". In addition, any amounts that the borrower has paid towards meeting the amnesty repayment requirements may be offset against any overseas-based repayment obligation which the borrower may otherwise have had after their restricted repayment holiday ends or while opting out of a repayment holiday.

Under section 109, if a borrower entitled to a restricted repayment holiday subsequently becomes New Zealand-based, they are entitled to a three-year repayment holiday when they next become overseas-based. However, any restricted repayment holiday they have had must count towards the borrower's total three-year repayment holiday.

**Example 1**  
  
Jan comes within the amnesty and meets the repayment requirements, the last payment being made on 30 September 2009. Jan applies to the Commissioner for a repayment holiday. She is entitled to a three-year holiday from the date she became overseas-based.  
**Example 2**  
  
Tracey comes within the amnesty and meets the repayment requirements but does not make an application to the Commissioner for a repayment holiday. Her last repayment was made on 31 March 2010. Her loan balance on that date is $8,300. Tracey's repayment obligation for the following tax year is $1,000. Tracey subsequently returns to New Zealand and becomes a New Zealand-based borrower. Eighteen months after returning, Tracey goes overseas again and becomes an overseas-based borrower. Tracey is automatically entitled to a three-year repayment holiday from the date she becomes overseas-based.  
**Example 3**  
  
On 1 April 2007 Sarah had been non-resident for five years and was in arrears, so she was not entitled to a restricted repayment holiday. Her loan balance was $26,000 and therefore her repayment obligation for the year was $2,000. On 31 May 2007 Sarah applied for the amnesty. She met the first required repayment of $1,000 on 30 September 2007 but failed to meet the others. The $1,000 amnesty repayment is offset against her repayment obligation for the year of $2,000. The remaining $1,000 which she failed to pay is subject to penalties from 1 April 2008.  
**Example 4**  
  
On 1 April 2007 Richard had been non-resident for 13 months, meaning that he was entitled to a restricted repayment holiday of two years from that date. On 11 November 2007 Richard applied for the amnesty. He met the first two required repayments of $500 on 31 March 2008 and 30 September 2008 but failed to meet the payments due on 31 March 2009 and 30 September 2009. Richard's loan balance is increased by half of 5% on 1 April 2009 (because he met half of the amnesty's repayment requirements). The restricted repayment holiday of two years applies, so there is no repayment obligation for the 2008-09 tax year. Richard's repayment obligation for the year ending 31 March 2010 is $1,000. If Richard fails to meet this, penalties will apply from 1 April 2011.

### Application date

The changes came into force on 1 April 2007.

New reporting requirements for most domestic trusts
===================================================

15 October 2021

Last year, the Taxation (Income Tax Rate and Other Amendments) Bill was passed, and new reporting requirements for trusts were introduced.

You can find more details in our News item of 8 December 2020

Consultation on new reporting requirements
------------------------------------------

From the 2021-22 tax year most trustees will need to prepare financial statements and provide additional information with their income tax returns.

Inland Revenue has published two documents for public consultation:

1.  An Officials Paper on the Order In Council (OIC) which prescribes the minimum standard for financial reporting by trustees; and
2.  A draft Operational Statement (OS) setting out Inland Revenue’s proposed approach to applying the trust information-gathering powers contained in sections 59BA and 59BAB of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Trustees will be required to provide:

1.  Summary financial information from their statement of profit or loss and statement of financial position which will be prepared to the minimum standard prescribed by the OIC;
2.  The nature and amount of any settlement made on the trust during the year;
3.  The details of anyone who is a settlor of the trust;
4.  The amount of any distributions made during the year, and the details of the beneficiary who received the distribution;
5.  Details of any person who has powers to appoint or remove trustees and beneficiaries or amend the trust deed.

Consultation process: Official’s paper
--------------------------------------

[Read 'Reporting requirements for domestic trusts' (Official's paper)](https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2021/2021-ip-reporting-requirements-domestic-trusts)

Key areas that we are seeking feedback on are:

1.  Do you have any comment on the specific items proposed?
2.  Should small trusts be partially exempt from these requirements, and if so, is exemption from the following requirements appropriate:
    *   The requirement to apply the principles of accrual accounting (cash accounting will be acceptable for small trusts)
    *   The requirement to provide a statement of accounting policies
    *   The requirement to disclose comparable figures for the previous income year.
3.  If there is to be a partial exemption for small trusts, is the proposed $30,000 income and $30,000 expenditure threshold, and the requirement that the value of total trust assets did not exceed $2,000,000 within that income year, appropriate?
4.  Do you have any comment on the specific items proposed to be included in the schedule?
5.  Are there associated persons transactions that should be excluded from the minimum requirements for trustees? If so, why?

Any other feedback is also welcome. The deadline for submissions is **Monday 15 November 2021**.

New Rules for Business Environmental Expenditure
================================================

2005 changes to the rules covering tax deductions for business environmental expenditure ensure all operating costs are considered when calculating taxable income.

_**Sections CB 6B, CB 24B, CX 43B, DB 16, DB 37, DP 10, DQ 4, EK 1 - EK 23, Schedule 6B and a number of definitions in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004, section DJ 10 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and sections 36BC and 91AAN of the Tax Administration Act 1994**_

The rules covering tax deductions for business environmental expenditure to avoid, remedy or mitigate the discharge of contaminants have been clarified and expanded by:

*   specifying categories of qualifying environmental expenditure and default deduction rates;
*   giving the Commissioner the power to issue rates for other categories of environmental expenditure;
*   removing the current distinction between industrial and non-industrial waste; and
*   introducing a mechanism so that site restoration and monitoring costs can be matched against prior business income.

#### Background

These changes have been made to ensure that all business operating costs, including those for dealing with environmental concerns, are taken into consideration in calculating taxable income, and that the timing of such deductions is appropriate. The changes counter uncertainty regarding the scope of tax deductions available for environmental expenditure.

Previously, business taxpayers could claim a tax deduction for environmental expenditure in three ways: [1](#01)

*   a deduction for normal operating (revenue) expenditure;
*   a deduction under the tax depreciation rules for certain types of capital expenditure, such as tanks, reservoirs, pipes, pumping machinery and screens; and
*   a deduction under section DB 37 (DJ 10) for other capital environmental expenditure.

Under the previous rules, section DJ 10 permitted business taxpayers a deduction for expenditure incurred for the purpose of treating industrial waste when no other allowance was available. It allowed business taxpayers to claim a deduction for the cost of constructing on land in New Zealand any earthworks, ponds, settling tanks, or other similar improvements primarily for the purpose of treating industrial waste to prevent or combat pollution of the environment. When a deduction was available, it was spread evenly over five years, beginning with the year in which the expenditure was incurred.

Despite the existence of a specific section to provide for environmental costs, there were certain expenses which were arguably not deductible. Section DJ 10 pre-dated the Resource Management Act 1991, so did not clearly provide a deduction for costs incurred in complying with new health and environmental standards. It was also unclear what was covered by the term "industrial waste". The uncertainty around the meaning of "industrial waste" and ability to claim tax deductions for site restoration resulted in the incorrect calculation and taxation of income from business activities.

There were also problems in matching business income and tax deductions for environmental costs incurred on or after the cessation of business. Even if a tax deduction was permitted it was likely to give rise to a tax loss of limited value. In determining the tax liability of a business, future restoration liabilities were not taken into account.

#### Key features

A number of changes have been made to the tax rules to counter the problems identified with the tax treatment of business environmental expenditure.

##### Default expenditure categories and deduction rates

Section DB 37 along with Schedule 6B set out categories of deductible environmental expenditure and the rate at which a deduction is available to business taxpayers. The schedule of deductible environmental expenditure is based around the following four categories of costs:  

| General description of expenditure | Rate |
| --- | --- |
| Testing and feasibility expenditure | 100% |
| Construction/improvement expenditure | Default rate based on the lesser of 35 years (1/35) or  <br>the length of the applicable resource consent granted 1/life of resource consent). |
| Restoration expenditure | 100% |
| Monitoring expenditure | 100% |

##### Category-specific deduction rates

Where the default deduction rates do not result in the correct calculation and taxation of income from business activities, a business can apply to Inland Revenue for a category-specific rate.

##### Environmental restoration account (ERA)

A mechanism has been introduced so that site restoration and monitoring costs can be matched against prior business income. Operators of a business can make cash deposits into an ERA equivalent to the tax effect of their accounting restoration provision. This deposit will give rise to a tax deduction so that the business's cash position is unchanged. Interest will be paid on deposits at 3% per annum.

Business taxpayers can obtain a refund from the account if they incur restoration and monitoring expenditure or if the anticipated liability for restoration (as shown by their audited financial statements) decreases. This refund will give rise to taxable income which will be offset by tax deductions for restoration and monitoring expenditure. This is consistent with the objective of matching restoration and monitoring costs against prior business income.

If a business transfers their liability for site restoration or environmental monitoring (for example, on the sale of a site, death, liquidation or bankruptcy) the balance of the restoration account will be transferred to the new taxpayer, if they can be identified, or otherwise to the Ministry for the Environment.

##### Clarifying the meaning of "industrial waste"

Sections DB 37 (2004 Act) and DJ 10 (1994 Act) have been amended retrospectively to remove the word "industrial". This eliminates the previous distinction between industrial and non-industrial waste.

#### Application dates

The majority of amendments apply for income years beginning on and environmental expenditure incurred after 10 June 2005 . However, the removal of the distinction between industrial and non-industrial waste is retrospective to the 1995-96 income year. This protects businesses who have taken a wide interpretation of the term "industrial waste", either in filing their tax returns or in raising a dispute with Inland Revenue. Businesses who have not taken a wide interpretation of the legislation will not be able to take advantage of the retrospective change.

#### Detailed analysis

##### Default expenditure categories and amortisation rates

Section DB 37 along with Schedule 6B set out categories of deductible environmental expenditure and the rate at which a deduction is available to business taxpayers.

Taxpayers are now able to claim a tax deduction for environmental expenditure under section DB 37 if:

*   they carry on business in New Zealand;
*   they incur, as part of that business, or in ending the operations of the business, expenditure listed in Schedule 6B;
*   the expenditure is not listed in Part C of Schedule 6B (land reclamation expenditure, non-environmental dredging expenditure or expenditure related to the acquisition of land);
*   the expenditure is not incurred in relation to revenue account property (other than land that is subject to a section CB 6B election); and
*   no other provision allows a tax deduction for the expenditure.

Farming businesses are included in these provisions so that when the specific agricultural provisions do not provide for an environmental tax deduction, farmers can now rely on section DB 37.

##### Example 1: No deduction available under other provisions

Parkways Limited builds and operates inner-city parking buildings. It has purchased a site in the central city for a new parking building and obtained the necessary resource consents. However, before construction can begin, Parkways Limited needs to deal with a contamination issue left by the previous owner. It will be necessary to remove contaminated soil, fill the area with clean soil and then construct an impermeable surface cap to prevent further contamination. Parkways Limited will then construct the normal car park surface on top of the cap.

The process of removing the contaminated soil and the installation of an impermeable surface cap should constitute expenditure on remedying, or mitigating detrimental effects on the environment. An immediate tax deduction should therefore be available under section DB 37. However, if a tax deduction were available under another provision, for example it if were not possible to separate the restoration activities from the construction of the car park, then a tax deduction would have to be claimed as tax depreciation rather than under section DB 37.

The default categories of expenditure in Schedule 6B are:  

### Expenditure in avoiding, remedying, or mitigating detrimental effects of discharge of contaminant  

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |Part A - Expenditure relating to activity or improvement to land
| General description of expenditure |     | Rate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | Expenditure on investigating and testing locations and methods before a decision is made to use a location or method for an activity or improvement that is intended to avoid, remedy, or mitigate future detrimental effects on the environment from the discharge of a contaminant. | 100% |
| 2   | Expenditure, in the construction of an improvement on land in New Zealand, incurred in order to avoid or mitigate future detrimental effects on the environment from the discharge of a contaminant. | Lesser of 1/35 or 1/consent period |
| 3   | Expenditure on screen planting on land in New Zealand incurred in association with the construction of an improvement to the land that is intended to avoid, or mitigate future detrimental effects on the environment from the discharge of a contaminant. | Lesser of 1/35 or 1/consent period |
| 4   | Expenditure on riparian planting on land in New Zealand incurred in order to avoid or mitigate future detrimental effects on the environment from the discharge of a contaminant. | Lesser of 1/35 or 1/consent period |
| 5   | Expenditure on an activity that is intended to avoid or mitigate the future discharge of a contaminant. | Lesser of 1/35 or 1/consent period |

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |Part B - Expenditure relating to monitoring, remedies, and mitigation
| 1   | Expenditure related to monitoring the discharge of a contaminant. | 100% |
| 2   | Expenditure related to monitoring detrimental effects on the environment from the discharge of a contaminant. | 100% |
| 3   | Expenditure incurred after the discharge of a contaminant, on avoiding, remedying, or mitigating detrimental effects on the environment from the discharged contaminant. | 100% |
| 4   | Expenditure, incurred after the discharge of a contaminant, on removing an improvement to land in New Zealand for the purpose of avoiding, remedying, or mitigating detrimental effects on the environment from the discharged contaminant. | 100% |
| 5   | Expenditure, incurred after the discharge of a contaminant, on the installation of impermeable surfaces on land in New Zealand with the purpose of avoiding, remedying, or mitigating detrimental effects on the environment from the discharged contaminant. | 100% |
| 6   | Expenditure, incurred after the discharge of a contaminant, on replanting land in New Zealand in association with expenditure to avoid, remedy, or mitigate detrimental effects on the environment from the discharged contaminant. | 100% |
| 7   | Expenditure, incurred in the cessation of a business, on disposing of a stored substance that is a potential contaminant in a way that avoids detrimental effects on the environment. | 100% |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |Part C - Excluded expenditure
| 1   | Expenditure related to land reclamation. |
| 2   | Expenditure relating to dredging, other than dredging for the principal purpose of remedying or mitigating detrimental effects on the environment from a discharged contaminant. |
| 3   | Expenditure related to the acquisition of land. |

  
To avoid the uncertainty surrounding the definition of industrial waste, section OB 1 now contains a definition of "contaminant". The definition is linked to section 2(1) of the Resource Management Act 1991 and an item can still be a contaminant even if it is never discharged into the environment.

Businesses planning to take advantage of these changes to secure tax deductions for the investigation, remediation and aftercare of contaminated land should refer to the best practices for management of contaminated land set out in the Ministry for the Environment's Contaminated Land Guidelines series and, in particular, the minimum reporting standards in Guideline Number 1 of that series.

##### Example 2: Types of environmental expenditure

Green Limited is a plastics manufacturer. A number of by-products are produced as a result of its manufacturing processes. Green Limited is therefore looking at potential options for dealing with the by-products. These include changing its manufacturing process, immediate treatment of the by-products, and storing the substances for a period and processing at a later date.

Green Limited pays for a report from an environmental consultant evaluating the different options. Alteration of the manufacturing process proves to be impractical and, due to its location and economies of scale, immediate treatment of the substances is not cost efficient. Green Limited therefore makes an application for a resource consent to store the by-products.

The expenditure incurred on the environmental report is expenditure on investigating and testing an activity intended to avoid, remedy or mitigate detrimental effects on the environment. Expenditure incurred prior to the date a decision is made to use one particular option, (likely to be the date that a resource consent application is made) is environmental feasibility expenditure and immediately deductible under section DB 37. Expenditure incurred from this date would constitute construction expenditure. If no other tax deduction is available (for example for tax depreciation) this expenditure would be deductible over the lesser of 35 years or the period for which the resource consent is granted. If Green Limited felt that this did not accurately reflect the life of the expenditure then they could apply to Inland Revenue for a category specific deduction

##### Example 3: Types of environmental expenditure

Pinot NZ Limited runs a winery. A portion of a neighbouring property has been contaminated as a result of past business activities. Pinot NZ Limited is worried about the impact this may have on its own property, business reputation and income. The owner of the site and person responsible for the contamination cannot be identified. Pinot NZ Limited therefore works with the local council to rectify the contamination (removing and replacing the soil and replanting the area in native bush). While Pinot NZ Limited is not responsible for the contamination and does not own the neighbouring site, this expenditure should qualify under section DB 37 for an immediate tax deduction. It is expenditure incurred by a business in remedying the detrimental effects on the environment from a discharged contaminant and expenditure on replanting land in New Zealand in association with expenditure to avoid, remedy, or mitigate detrimental effects on the environment.

##### Amount and timing of deduction

Section DB 37 sets out the amount of the tax deduction and when this can be claimed. The amount of the deduction for an income year is calculated by multiplying the value of the expenditure by the applicable rate.

The default rates are 100% for testing and feasibility, restoration and monitoring expenditure (listed in Schedule 6B, Part A, item 1 and Part B) and based on the lesser of 35 years or the length of the applicable resource consent for construction and improvement expenditure.

The formula for calculating the rate for construction and improvement expenditure is set out in section DB 37(7). Businesses can opt for either a straight-line or diminishing value deduction by adjusting the rate accordingly. The rate is 100% divided by the assumed life of the environmental expenditure and rounded to the nearest rate listed in Schedule 11. For expenditure that does not require a resource consent the assumed life is  
35 years. For expenditure that requires a resource consent, the assumed life is the lesser of 35 years and the number of years remaining in the resource consent period at the time the expenditure is incurred.

Businesses can also obtain a rate for specific categories of environmental expenditure by applying for a determination from the Commissioner (section DB 37(4)(c)).

##### Example 4: Calculating the correct deduction rate

Olivia Limited is a large multinational corporation. It applies for a resource consent regarding emissions from a new factory. While the factory will undertake all necessary steps to reduce emissions there will still  
be a small discharge made. To counter this, and as part of its resource consent process, Olivia Limited agrees to spend $50,000 planting and maintaining an area of native bush. A resource consent is granted for 25 years.

As the planting expenditure is incurred by Olivia Limited for the purposes of obtaining a resource consent for its new factory it is viewed as business expenditure. The planting expenditure is an activity that is intended to avoid or mitigate the discharge of a contaminant. As such, a tax deduction should be available under section DB 37.

The annual deduction for the expenditure is calculated by multiplying the cost ($50,000) by the deduction rate. The deduction rate is calculated by dividing 100% by the assumed life. As the planting expenditure is associated with a business activity  
that requires a resource consent, the assumed life is 25 years (being the lesser of 35 years and the resource consent period). The closest straight-line rate in Schedule 11 is 4%. Alternatively, a diminishing value rate of 6% can be used.

Section DB 37 also provides for the destruction of an environmental improvement or closure of a business. In these situations, a business can claim the remaining unamortised balance of the expenditure.

The definition of diminished value has been amended to take into account the new environmental expenditure rules. For environmental improvements, diminished value is calculated by taking the amount of environmental expenditure as described in section DB 37, adding any claw-back income under section CB 24B(8) and deducting any environmental tax deductions previously claimed.

##### Example 5: Closure of a business

After 10 years, Olivia Limited closes its operations in New Zealand. Up until the year of closure, Olivia Limited has claimed $20,000 of tax deductions under section DB 37 for its native planting expenditure.

On the closure of its New Zealand factories, the operations for which the expenditure was incurred have come to an end. Olivia Limited is therefore able to claim the remaining $30,000 of expenditure in the year of closure.

Claw-back

While the default deduction rate for environmental construction and improvement expenditure is based on the life of the applicable resource consent, there is a claw-back mechanism in section CB 24B. This is intended to prevent businesses from manipulating the period of their resource consent for the purpose of obtaining a faster tax deduction.

Where a business has claimed a tax deduction based on the period of a resource consent and then substantially altered the period of that consent (consent period is extended or renewed by more than 50%) the taxpayer will be required to calculate tax deductions based on the default rate of 35 years. Any difference between the deductions claimed to date will be clawed back as taxable income in the year that the consent is altered.

##### Example 6: Claw-back

Forest Fields Limited runs a timber treatment plant. It spent $200,000 constructing a settling pond for dealing with the by-products of the treatment process. It has a five-year resource consent for operating the pond. As such it has claimed tax deductions of $180,000 under section DB 37 based on an assumed life of five years. At the end of five years, Forest Fields Limited applies for a 30-year extension to its resource consent.

If Forest Fields Limited had claimed tax deductions based on an assumed life of 35 years, the tax deductions claimed to date would have only been $30,000. Forest Fields Limited is therefore deemed to derive income of $150,000 in the income year in which the consent is extended (because the consent period was extended by more than 50%).

##### Other changes

A tax deduction for restoration expenditure will not always equate to the loss in land value from contamination but in the majority of circumstances it provides a practical solution. However, landfill operators are likely to suffer a complete loss in land value no matter how much is spent on site restoration. The new environmental tax rules therefore allow taxpayers who acquire and use land for the purpose of constructing and operating a landfill to file a revenue account property election under section CB 6B. This ensures a tax deduction is available for the cost of land used for a landfill.

The section CB 6B election must be made before  
24 June 2006 or 12 months after the date of acquisition (whichever is the latest). To ensure a consistent treatment, all of a business's landfill sites and those of any associated parties also need to be subject to the same election. Any consideration received on the disposal of the landfill property will also be taxable income of the business under section CB 6B.

Sections DB 16 (amounts paid for non-compliance and change in use) and DP 10 (cost of timber) have been amended to ensure that section DB 37 remains the section of last resort for deducting environmental expenditure.

##### Category-specific deduction rates

Where the default deduction rates will not result in the correct calculation and taxation of income, a business is able to apply to Inland Revenue under section 91AAN of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for a category-specific deduction rate.

The Commissioner may determine that a person, group or class of persons is to use a particular diminishing value or straight-line rate listed in Schedule 11 for certain types of environmental expenditure.

In making the determination, the Commissioner may consider a number of factors including:

*   the length of time that the expenditure is expected to be effective for its intended purpose;
*   the length of time that the expenditure is expected to earn income;
*   the accounting treatment (including depreciation method);
*   the period of any associated resource consent; and
*   a valuer's estimate.

The Commissioner may decline to issue a determination if the information supplied in support of the determination request is insufficient or if the proposed rate does not differ sufficiently from the existing rate.

Within 30 days of issuing a determination the Commissioner must give notice of the determination to the applicants and publish a notice in the New Zealand Gazette stating where copies of the determination can be obtained. A business affected by a determination may dispute or challenge the determination under Parts 4A  
and 8A.

##### Environmental Restoration Account

The new environmental tax rules introduce a matching mechanism so that site restoration and monitoring costs can be matched against prior business income.

Section EK 1 establishes a Crown Bank Account called the Environmental Restoration Funds Account (referred to as an ERA in subpart EK) into which businesses can  
make payments towards their restoration and environmental monitoring liabilities.

Section EK 4 requires the Commissioner to keep an ERA in the name of every business who makes a qualifying payment. Every payment made under section EK 2 must be entered in that person's ERA.

Amounts entered into a business's ERA may not be removed except by way of refund under sections EK 9 or EK 12 or by way of transfer. However, the Commissioner is allowed to close an ERA if the balance of the account is zero.

Payments to an ERA

Under section EK 2, to be eligible to make payments to an ERA, a taxpayer must carry on business in New Zealand and expect to incur future expenditure that:

*   is listed in Part B of Schedule 6B (monitoring and restoration expenditure);
*   is not listed in Part C of Schedule 6B (land reclamation, non-environmental dredging and land acquisition costs); and
*   is not on revenue account property (other than where section CB 6B applies).

The business must also make a provision for such expenditure in its audited financial statements.

##### Example 7: Calculating the ERA payment

M.A.E. Limited has an accounting restoration provision in its audited financial statements for $2 million. This consists of $1 million for dealing with contaminated soil, $0.5 million for the removal of plant and equipment (necessary to clean up the contaminated soil) and $0.5 million for publicity costs to promote its "green image".

Both the soil clean-up costs and removal of plant and equipment necessary to do this will constitute restoration expenditure under Part B of Schedule 6B. However, the plant and equipment removal costs will be deducted under the tax depreciation rules rather than section DB 37. This does not prevent M.A.E. Limited from making an ERA payment for these costs. Under section EK 2, a person can make a payment to an ERA for expenditure that is of a type listed Part B of Schedule 6B. It is not necessary for a deduction to be claimed under section DB 37 for a deposit to be made to an ERA.

No ERA payment is able to be made in respect of the publicity costs as these do not constitute expenditure that is of a type listed in art B of Schedule 6B.

Section EK 3 deals with the size of payments to an ERA.

The minimum payment level is $1,000. A business's maximum payment is defined in section EK 22 as the lesser of:

*   the amount by which the maximum account balance exceeds the ERA balance at the end of the income year; and
*   the amount permitted as a deposit under the initial five-year spreading mechanism.

A business's maximum account balance (defined in section EK 23) is:

*   zero, if the person does not satisfy section EK 2; or
*   an amount calculated by multiplying the level of their accounting restoration provision by the applicable tax rate.

The spreading mechanism is a transitional measure intended to reduce the cost of allowing payments for historic restoration liabilities. After the initial five-year period taxpayers will be able to make payments up to the (tax effected) level of their accounting restoration provision.

Under the spreading mechanism, the maximum payment for the 2005-06 to the 2010-11 income years is calculated as follows:

Level increase plus (year times 0.2 times initial level) minus contents

*   "Level increase" is the greater of zero or the amount by which the maximum account balance exceeds that for the 2005-06 income year.
*   "Year" is 1 for the 2005-06 income year and increases by 1 for each successive income year. This allows a "catch-up" if no deposit is made for the 2005-06 income year.
*   "Initial level" is the maximum account balance for the 2005-06 income year.
*   "Contents" is the amount of the ERA at the end of the income year

##### Example 8: Maximum account balance and maximum payment

DF Limited has a future site restoration liability as a result of its New Zealand manufacturing operations. To recognise this it has created an accounting restoration provision in its 2005-06 audited financial statements of $1 million.

DF Limited's maximum account balance is $330,000, being $1 million multiplied by 33% (the highest tax rate in Schedule 1 applying to a corporate taxpayer). DF Limited's maximum payment for the 2005-06 income year is $66,000 (being 0 + (1 x 0.2 x 330,000) - 0). Its maximum payment for the 2006-07 income year is $66,000 (being 0 + (2 x 0.2 x 330,000 - 66,000).

In the 2007-08 income year, DF Limited recalculates its restoration liability and increases its accounting provision to $1.5 million. DF Limited's maximum account balance is now $495,000. DF Limited's maximum payment for the 2007-08 income year is $231,000 (being (495,000 - 330,000) + (3 x 0.2 x 330,000) - 132,000).

DF Limited's restoration balance remains unchanged for the 2008-09 and 2009-10 income years and it makes maximum payments to its ERA of $66,000 for each of these years.

In 2010-11, it revises its accounting provision upwards again to $1.8 million. Its maximum account balance is now $594,000. It no longer needs to apply the five-year spreading calculation and therefore its maximum payment for the year is the difference between its ERA balance and maximum account balance ($594,000 - 495,000 = $99,000).

A business is allowed a tax deduction under section DQ 4 for a payment to an ERA. The amount of the deduction is calculated by dividing the amount of the payment by the applicable tax rate (section EK 7). The applicable tax rate is the highest rate of income tax that is stated in Schedule 1 which could apply to the business. The deduction is allowed for the income year for which the payment is made. Section EK 3 deals with the amount and time for making payments to an ERA. Any payment made up to six months after the end of an income year will be treated as a payment for that income year. Discretion has also been given for the Commissioner to accept payments made after this period.

To ensure that the Commissioner has sufficient information to deal with an ERA payment, section EK 5 requires a business making a payment to provide (within two working days) some basic information. This includes:

*   the name of the person;
*   the income year for which the payment is made;
*   a calculation of the business's maximum payment; and
*   any additional information required by the Commissioner.

When this information is not supplied, section EK 9 requires the Commissioner to refund the payment to the payee as soon as it is practical. The payment will not qualify for a deduction under DQ 4 or for interest under section EK 6. Similarly, the refund will not be taxable under section CX 43B (section EK 10). Any payment which is in excess of a business's maximum payment receives the same treatment.

Section EK 21 gives the Commissioner the power to require ERA information in an electronic format and section 36BC of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows the Commissioner to prescribe the electronic format in which details may be provided. This provides flexibility should the system be administered via the internet in the future.

ERA transfers

A business may also apply for a transfer from an ERA. An amount may be transferred from an ERA:

*   to the ERA of another business in accordance with sections EK 15 or EK 16(3)(b);
*   to the department responsible for the  
    administration of the Environment Act 1986  
    under section EK 16(3)(a); or
*   to an ERA of an amalgamated company under section EK 19.

The transfer application must be in writing, state the grounds on which the application is made and the  
amount of the transfer required (section EK 14). A business who makes a transfer from their ERA under sections EK 15, EK 16 or EK 19 derives income equivalent to the grossed-up amount of the transfer (section CB 24B).

The transfer is treated by the recipient as a payment (meaning a tax deduction is available under section DQ 4) as long as the associated environmental obligations have also been transferred, and the business would be entitled to make an equivalent ERA payment. If any part of the transfer does not satisfy these requirements the Commissioner may return the non-qualifying amount back to the transferor. This will be effective as at the date of the original transfer.

As well as a voluntary transfer by a business, the ERA rules also provide for a transfer on the death, bankruptcy or liquidation of a taxpayer. Under section EK 16, if the administrator of a person's estate, the Official Assignee or a person's liquidator notifies the Commissioner that the obligation associated with an ERA deposit has been transferred to another person, the Commissioner must transfer the ERA balance to that person. Where the obligation has "in effect" been transferred to the New Zealand Government (for example, where it is an orphan site) then the Commissioner is required to transfer the associated ERA balance to the Ministry for the Environment (or the department that is at the time responsible for the administration of the Environment  
Act 1986).

The amount of the transfer will be the amount in the business's ERA on the day they die, become bankrupt or are put into liquidation. The transfer will result in income for the transferor derived on the day before the taxpayer's death, bankruptcy or liquidation. For administrative purposes, section EK 17 places a $1,000 minimum threshold on the value of transfers. This applies apart from where the ERA balance is less than $1,000 at the date of refund or transfer.

Finally, sections EK 19 and EK 20 sets out what happens upon an amalgamation or tax consolidation. If an amalgamating company ceases to exist on an amalgamation then there is a transfer to the ERA of the amalgamated company. The amalgamated company is treated as having made all the payments, transfers and refunds made by the amalgamating company. Under section EK 20, on consolidation, the nominated company makes payments and receives refunds on behalf of the consolidated group.

Refunds from an ERA

Under section EK 11, a business is able to apply for an ERA refund when they have incurred Schedule 6B Part B (monitoring and restoration) expenditure that is not listed in Part C of the schedule. The expenditure must be incurred after the date that the business first establishes their ERA (by payment or transfer) and must be equal to or greater than the amount calculated by dividing the refund requested by the applicable tax rate (section EK 12). The application for the refund must be in writing, state the amount of the refund required, grounds on which the refund is made and provide evidence to support those grounds. The amount of the refund is limited to the lesser of the refund requested, the balance of the ERA, and the amount of qualifying expenditure.

The Commissioner must also make a refund where a business's ERA balance exceeds their maximum account balance.

##### Example 9: ERA

Horace Co Limited has an accounting restoration provision in its audited financial statements of $600,000. Over the 2005-06 to 2009-10 income years it makes payments to its ERA of $198,000. This gives rise to total tax deductions over the period of $600,000 and a reduction in Horace Co Limited's tax liability of $198,000 (meaning there is no impact on Horace Co Limited's cash position).

In 2010-11, Horace Co Limited starts to wind down its operations and contracts with an environmental consultant to restore its site (obtaining the necessary resource consents and following Ministry for the Environment guidelines). The total cost of the site restoration is $500,000. Horace Co Limited writes to Inland Revenue to request a refund and supplies accounting records to verify that it has incurred the site restoration expenditure.

Inland Revenue issues a refund of $165,000 (being $500,000 multiplied by 33%). This gives rise to taxable income of $500,000 in the year of receipt. Horace Co Limited is able to offset the tax deductions for the restoration costs against the ERA refund income meaning that there is no further tax to pay.

When the remaining accounting provision is reversed (once Horace Co Limited has met the conditions of its resource consent), Horace Co Limited's maximum account balance will be zero and the remainder of the ERA balance of $33,000 will be refunded. This will give rise to taxable income of $100,000.

  
A refund is income under section CB 24B. The amount of income is calculated by dividing the value of the refund by the applicable tax rate. ERA refunds are sourced from payments on a first-in-first-out basis (section EK 18).

Interest on ERA balances

To encourage businesses to participate in the ERA scheme, the rules provide for a small amount of interest (3% p.a.) to be paid on deposits. This is equivalent to the interest rate paid on the income equalisation scheme.

Interest is calculated from the day after a payment is made until the date it is included in a refund under section EK 12 or transfer under sections EK 15, EK 16 or EK 19.

Interest is paid annually rather than being credited to the ERA. Interest is paid out on the earlier of 31 March each year or the date that the payment is included in a refund or transfer under sections EK 15, EK 16 or EK 19.

##### Clarifying the meaning of "industrial waste"

The previous environmental tax rules (section DB 37 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section DJ 10 of the Income Tax Act 1994) applied solely to dealing with "industrial" waste. There was no definition of this term which led to ongoing uncertainty as to when tax deductions were available for environmental expenditure.

The word "industrial" has been removed from sections DB 37 and DJ 10 to protect taxpayers who have taken a wide interpretation of the term "industrial waste". This clarifies that a tax deduction is available for dealing with all forms of waste.

This change to section DB 37 applies for income years (and expenditure incurred) beginning before 10 June 2005 . The change to DJ 10 is retrospective (back to the 1995-96 income year) and applies where a taxpayer has filed a tax return, notice of proposed adjustment or response notice, or has requested a reassessment, before 16 November 2004, and the correctness of the tax position, notice or request depends on the interpretation of the meaning of "industrial waste".

New rules for spreading income on the sale of patents
=====================================================

2006 amendment to the Income Tax Act allows taxable income from the sale of patent rights to be spread evenly over three income years, at the vendor's election.

##### Section EI 3B of the Income Tax Act 2004

This amendment allows taxable income from the sale of patent rights to be spread evenly over three income years, at the vendor's election.

### Background

Patent rights are often sold for non-cash items, such as shares or share options. Section CB 26 of the Income Tax Act 2004 makes gains on sale of patent rights taxable income, but if patent rights are sold for non-cash items, a vendor can have a tax liability without having the cash to pay it. This can create cashflow problems for vendors of patent rights, thus creating a potential barrier to investment in research and technology.

### Key features

Vendors of patent rights will be able to spread income on sale of patent rights over three years, including the year of sale. Allowing the income spread may help to alleviate the potential cashflow problem, thus helping to reduce the potential barrier to investment in research and technology. The three-year spread is at the taxpayer's election, giving taxpayers greater capacity to plan for the required cashflows.

### Application date

The amendment applies from the 2007-08 income year.

[Taxation (savings investment and miscellaneous provisions) Act 2006 and Taxation (annual rates of income tax 2006-07) Act 2006](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-savings-investment-and-miscellaneous-provisions-act-2006-and-taxation-annual-rates-of-incom "Taxation (savings investment and miscellaneous provisions) Act 2006 and Taxation (annual rates of income tax 2006-07) Act 2006")

New rules for the tax treatment of expenditure on geothermal wells
==================================================================

2006 remedial changes to business environmental tax rules to ensure that all operating costs are considered when calculating taxable income.

##### Sections 14, 54, 55, 56, 57, 163 and 203 of the Income Tax Act 2004

New rules for business environmental expenditure were enacted on 21 June 2005 to ensure that all business operating costs, including those for dealing with environmental concerns, are taken into consideration in calculating taxable income, and that the timing of such deductions is appropriate.

A number of remedial changes have been made to clarify the new business environmental tax rules and ensure that the original legislation has its intended effect.

### Treatment of by-products

The definition of "deductible environmental expenditure" allows a tax deduction for dealing with by-products on cessation of business. However, taxpayers may deal with by-products before cessation. The words "incurred in the cessation of a business" have been removed from item 7, Part B of Schedule 6B, to ensure that expenditure incurred before the cessation of business on the treatment of by-products is deductible and that there is no distortion between the treatment of by-products before and after cessation of business.

### ERA transfers

The business environmental rules contain an Environmental Restoration Account (ERA) mechanism that allows business taxpayers, through making a deposit, to set aside a portion of their tax payments to pay for future site restoration and monitoring expenditure.

To ensure that ERA deposits follow the associated restoration liability, taxpayers are allowed to make transfers from their ERAs in a number of circumstances - for example, on the sale of a site. However, a number of the new ERA provisions were unclear on the treatment of transfers.

Section EK 20, which allows the nominated company for a consolidated group to make ERA payments and applications for refunds on behalf of the consolidated group now also makes specific reference to ERA transfers.

Section EK 6 (interest on payments to ERA) has been amended so that interest is payable on an amount that is treated as a payment under sections EK 15, EK 16 and EK 19. Amendments have also been made to treat an amount as a payment under section EK 16 (transfer on death, bankruptcy or liquidation).

The section EK 16 reference to funds being transferred to the Ministry for the Environment has also been removed as subsequent work indicates that it is now unlikely that a restoration liability would be transferred to the New Zealand government (for example, where there is an orphan site).

### ERA refunds

It was initially proposed that taxpayers would be able to make only one ERA deposit or refund per year. However, in order to increase flexibility, this was subsequently altered. A change has therefore been made to remove the words "or after earlier payment or request for refund" from section CX 43B as this was a reference to the limitation on multiple payments and refunds.

A change has also been made to clarify that there are two types of refunds permitted under section EK 1 - those requested by the taxpayer and those made by Inland Revenue when a taxpayer's ERA exceeds the maximum balance. In calculating the latter, the amount of the refund will be the difference between the actual and permitted balance. The amendments also remove the reference to any amount of refund requested by the taxpayer in subsection EK 12(8).

### Removal of the distinction between industrial and non-industrial waste

The previous environmental tax rules applied solely to dealing with "industrial" waste. There was no definition of this term, resulting in uncertainty about when tax deductions were available for environmental expenditure. The new rules no longer make this distinction and also retrospectively remove the word "industrial" for any income year for which a taxpayer took a position on the definition of industrial waste before the introduction of the new rules. An amendment has been made to section DJ 10 in the Income Tax Act 1994 to allow a taxpayer who initially qualifies to have the word "industrial" removed to apply this same treatment for subsequent income years up until the time that the new environmental tax rules apply.

### Application dates

These amendments apply to expenditure incurred in an income year beginning on or after 10 June 2005. The change to section DJ 10 of the Income Tax Act 1994 applies for income years subsequent to 1994-95 if a taxpayer has taken a tax position on the meaning of "industrial waste" before 16 November 2004.

[Remedial amendments to the Portfolio Investment Entity tax rules](/new-legislation/act-articles/2007-19/remedial-amendments "Remedial amendments to the Portfolio Investment Entity tax rules")

New rules for use of portfolio entity formation loss
====================================================

2007 legislation introduces new rules for the use of portfolio entity formation loss.

The new legislation:

*   Removes the requirement to reduce the amount of any rebate under section KI 1 or a deduction under section DB 43 in relation to portfolio entity formation losses used in a tax calculation period.  Portfolio investor allocated losses can be rebated without restriction and similarly there is no reduction in the amount of loss allowed as a deduction to zero-rated investors in portfolio tax rate entities.  Sections KI 1(3) and DB 43(2) have been repealed to achieve this.
*   Allows a portfolio tax rate entity to use portfolio entity formation loss without restriction to reduce class net income for a portfolio investor class in a portfolio allocation period, if the total portfolio entity formation loss of the entity is less than 5 percent of the total market value of the entity's portfolio entity investments.  Section HL 28(3) has been replaced by new section HL 28(3)(a) to achieve this.
*   Allows a portfolio tax rate entity, whose portfolio entity formation loss exceeds 5 percent of the entity's market value, to use on each day of the first three years of the entity's existence, up to 1/1095 of the total portfolio entity formation loss of the entity to reduce any class net income for a portfolio investor class of the entity on that day.  Under this change;
    *   when there is insufficient class net income for a portfolio investor class on a day, the day's allocation of portfolio entity formation loss can be carried forward and added to the next day's allocation of portfolio entity formation loss;
    *   if there is an amount of portfolio entity formation loss that has not been used after the end of the three-year period, the total amount of unused portfolio entity formation loss can be used without restriction to reduce class net income for a portfolio investor class and a portfolio allocation period.

New sections HL 28(4) and (5) contain the formula for calculating the amount of portfolio entity formation loss that may be allocated to a portfolio allocation period.

##### **New Zealand tax credits must be used before portfolio entity formation losses**

Portfolio entity formation losses allocated under new section HL 28(3) cannot be used to reduce the class net income of a portfolio investor class of an entity if sufficient New Zealand tax credits are available in a portfolio allocation period to offset the portfolio entity tax liability that would otherwise arise.

New Zealand tax credits are defined as imputation credits, credits for resident withholding tax, dividend withholding payment credits and Maori authority credits.  There is no restriction in relation to the use of portfolio entity formation losses where a portfolio investor class has foreign tax credits (that is, credits for foreign NRWT deducted) in an allocation period.

Under new sections HL 28(6) and (7), the amount of portfolio entity formation loss allowed to be allocated to a portfolio allocation period is the lesser of:

*   the maximum allowable portfolio entity formation loss for the allocation period (calculated under section HL 28(4)); or
*   the amount by which the class net income of a portfolio investor class for the allocation period exceeds the total New Zealand tax credits allocated to the period, grossed up to an amount by dividing by the statutory rate of tax for a company.

##### **Clarification that formation losses can be held at the entity or portfolio investor class level**

While section HL 28 treats portfolio entity formation losses as arising at the entity level, a portfolio tax rate entity can choose for portfolio entity formation losses to be held at a portfolio investor class level.  When calculating class taxable income under section HL 19, a class's shares of a portfolio entity formation loss should be determined.  The methodology for determining each class's share is left to the entity.  It therefore follows that the rules do not prevent an entity from dividing the entity's formation losses between classes on becoming a portfolio tax rate entity.

#### Investor fees to be allowed as a deduction against portfolio entity tax liability for an investor

The formula in section HL 20(4) which calculates the portfolio entity tax liability for an investor in a portfolio investor class has been amended to allow certain fees relating to an investor's portfolio investor interest to be taken into account.  That is, a deduction for fees charged to an investor's account (calculated as the amount of fees multiplied by the portfolio investor rate of the investor) can be used to directly reduce the portfolio entity tax liability for the investor.  The fees that would be deductible are those that are charged to the investor for ongoing management and administration services, including switching fees, in relation to their portfolio investor interest.  These fees should be spread over each portfolio allocation period the investor is present in a portfolio investor class.

As the fees charged are specific to the investor, section HL 20(4) is the appropriate mechanism to ensure that each investor's individual fee circumstances are accurately reflected.  The formula also takes into account any fee rebates credited to the investor's account (these rebates would increase the portfolio entity tax liability of the investor, as they would be taxable if paid directly to the investor).

This change to allow fees to reduce the income tax payable by the entity, on behalf of investors, is designed to prevent investors having to file a tax return to get a deduction separately.  Consequently, new section DB 43C has been added to prevent fees charged by portfolio tax rate entities that are included in the portfolio entity tax liability calculation under section HL 20, being deductible separately to the investor.  Similarly, new section CX 44E has been added to prevent any fee rebates being separately taxable to the investor.  These amounts are treated as excluded income to the investor.

Consequential changes to reflect the deduction of fees and addition of fees rebates have also been made to section HL 24, which calculates the portfolio investor allocated income and portfolio investor allocated loss for an investor.

#### Unlisted companies allowed to temporarily qualify as a portfolio listed company

New section HL 11B allows certain unlisted companies to temporarily be treated as portfolio listed companies if they meet a number of criteria.  These criteria include:

*   the company would meet paragraph (a) of the definition of "qualifying unit trust" in section OB 1 (if it were a unit trust); and
*   the company has resolved to become listed on a recognised New Zealand exchange if it were to obtain the required consents; and
*   the company has applied to the Securities Commission for an exemption to disclose in its prospectus its intention to become a listed company; and
*   the company satisfies the Commissioner that it would apply to become a listed company if it obtained the required consents.

The company must be listed on a recognised exchange within two years from when it first elected to be a portfolio investment entity in order to retain portfolio listed company status.

The definition of "portfolio listed company" has been consequentially amended so that a company that is eligible under section HL 11B temporarily qualifies as a portfolio listed company. 

##### Foreign investment vehicles can invest through other foreign investment vehicles

Section HL 5 has been amended to allow a foreign investment vehicle to own more than 20 percent of another foreign investment vehicle.  This allows a foreign investment vehicle to hold investments through other foreign investment vehicles.

Section HL 5 also allows foreign investment vehicles to hold their investments through trusts when the foreign investment vehicle is the sole beneficiary.

[Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2010](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-budget-measures-act-2010 "Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2010")

New tax rates for companies and savings
=======================================

2010 legislation introduces new tax rates for companies and savings; changes to the thin capitalisation rules ensure tax rates apply to foreign-controlled entities.

#### _Sections CS 1, FE 5, FE 6, FE 12, FE 18, HM 47, HM 58, HM 60, LP 2, OZ 7 to OZ 17, RZ 3 to RZ 5 and schedules 1 and 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section 140C of the Tax Administration Act 1994_

The Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2010 introduced changes to the tax rules for business and investments.

*   The company tax rate is being reduced from 30% to 28%.
*   The top tax rate for people saving through portfolio investment entities (PIEs) - including KiwiSaver funds - and other managed funds will also be reduced from 30% to 28%.
*   Other tax rates that apply to KiwiSaver funds and other PIEs are being reduced in line with the changes to personal income tax rates.
*   The safe harbour in the thin capitalisation rules that apply to foreign-controlled entities is being reduced from 75% to 60%.

Together, these reforms are intended to improve the competitiveness of New Zealand's company tax system and to encourage saving. The changes to the thin capitalisation rules support this objective by ensuring that tax rates apply effectively to foreign-controlled entities.

### Key features

The company tax rate will be reduced from 30% to 28%. This change also applies to unit trusts, which are taxed as companies. The resident withholding tax rules for interest paid to companies are being amended accordingly.

The top rate for people saving through PIEs and other managed funds will also be reduced from 30% to 28%. The other tax rates that apply to multi-rate PIEs will be reduced in line with changes to personal income tax rates. Tax rates for investors in multi-rate PIEs will shift automatically from the old rates to the new rates when the changes take effect on 1 October 2010. The rates of retirement scheme contributions tax will be reduced in line with the changes to personal income tax rates.

The thin capitalisation rules deny interest deductions to the extent that the debt percentage (essentially, the debt-to-asset ratio) of a person's New Zealand group exceeds a specified "safe harbour" threshold and is also more than 110 percent of the debt percentage of that person's worldwide group. The safe harbour applying to foreign-controlled entities will be reduced from 75% to 60%. This will reduce the scope for foreign multinational enterprises to reduce the amount of New Zealand tax they pay by loading debt against their New Zealand operations.

A number of transitional arrangements accompany the reduction in the company tax rate. These are based on similar arrangements that accompanied the previous

*   allow companies to continue to pay out imputation credits at the current 30/70 credit-to-dividend ratio until 31 March 2013, provided the credits arose when the company tax rate was 30% or 33%;
*   allow shareholders - other than those eligible for the new 28% tax rate - to use these additional imputation credits to offset their tax; and
*   allow companies that pay provisional tax using the uplift method or the GST ratio method to have immediate access to the tax cut.

### Application dates

For investments through multi-rate PIEs, including most KiwiSaver funds, the reduced tax rates - including the new 28% top rate - will apply from 1 October 2010.

For companies, and for investments through other managed funds, the reduction in the tax rate to 28% will apply for the 2011-12 and subsequent income years. The changes to the thin capitalisation rules will also apply for the 2011-12 and subsequent income years.

### Detailed analysis

Unless otherwise stated, the following references to sections and schedules relate to the Income Tax Act 2007.

#### _Tax rates_

The reduction in the company tax rate and changes to the tax rates that apply to investments through PIEs and other managed funds are achieved through amendments to a number of provisions.

Clause 2 of schedule 1, part A has been amended to reduce the company tax rate to 28%. Since the definition of "company" in section YA 1 includes unit trusts, this reduction also applies to unit trusts. The lower company tax rate will automatically affect the maximum imputation and FDP crediting ratio under section OA 18, which will change from 30/70 to 28/72. A consequential amendment has been made to the formula in section LP 2(2) for calculating tax credits for supplementary dividends.

Clauses 5 and 6 of schedule 1, part A have been amended to similarly reduce the tax rate for group investment funds deriving category A income, approved unit trusts to which the Income Tax (Exempt Unit Trusts) Order 1990 applies, widely held group investment funds, and widely held superannuation funds. Clause 8 of schedule 1, part A has been amended to reduce the rate for life insurance policyholder income.

In schedule 1, part D, table 3, rows 1 and 2 are amended to reduce the rate of resident withholding tax applicable to interest paid to companies when the payer of the interest has been supplied with the tax file number of the company and has either not received a payment rate election or has received a payment rate election choosing the 28% payment rate. Rows 3 and 4 have been amended in line with the changes to personal income tax rates, reducing the rate of resident withholding tax from 38% to 33% for interest paid to a company when the recipient of the interest has either elected for the top personal rate to apply or has not supplied their tax file number to the interest payer.

Changes to the prescribed rates for multi-rate PIEs are contained in schedule 6, table 1.

Section HM 58, as amended, operates to adjust automatically notified investor rates for multi-rate PIEs, unless the investor advises the PIE that a different rate should apply. Section HM 60(6) has been amended so that, if an investor does not notify a multi-rate PIE of their notified investor rate, the rate applied will be 28%.

Section HM 60(3) has been replaced by a new subsection (3) so that multi-rate PIEs can calculate tax for the 2010-11 income year using current notified investor rates for each day in the year up to and including 30 September and the new lower rates for remaining days in the income year. The new lower rates that the multi-rate PIE will apply from 1 October is the rate automatically adjusted on that date under the revised section HM 58 or another rate notified by the investor on or after that date. Consequential amendments to the PIE multi-rate calculation provisions in section HM 47(4)(a)(i) support this treatment.

Section HM 47(4)(ii) has been amended so that, if the PIE is treated as the sole investor, the rate applied will be 28%.

Retirement scheme contributions tax has been reduced by amendments to schedule 6, table 2.

Note that section CS 1, which deals with fund withdrawal tax on superannuation funds, is amended as a consequence of the alignment of the top rate of employer superannuation contribution tax with a taxpayer's marginal rate. This is discussed further in the TIB item that deals with the changes to personal income tax rates. 

#### _Provisional tax rules for companies_

Provisional tax involves payments being made during an income year, in anticipation of an income tax liability for that year. Section RC 5 sets out various methods of calculating provisional tax.

The "standard method" of determining provisional tax liability, under section RC 5(2) and (3), looks to a person's residual income tax for a previous year, uplifting that amount by a specified percentage - normally either 5% or 10%, depending on the circumstances. In view of the reduction in the company tax rate, section RZ 3 has been amended to reduce temporarily the amount of that uplift for persons subject to the new company tax rate of 28%.

*   Where the 5% uplift method applies, section RZ 3(1)(b) and (2)(b)(ii) modifies section RC 5(2) to eliminate any uplift for the 2011-12 income year.
*   Where the 10% uplift method applies, section RZ 3(1)(b), (3)(b)(ii) and (c)(ii) modifies section RC 5(3) to reduce the amount of the uplift to 5% for the 2011-12 and 2012-13 income years (in this case, the modification applies for two years, because section RC 5(3) looks to a person's residual income tax for the tax year before the preceding tax year).

Corresponding modifications to section RC 10 have been made by section RZ 5.

Some provisional taxpayers can choose to calculate their provisional tax payments using the "GST ratio method" under section RC 8. The GST ratio is normally calculated by dividing residual income tax for the preceding year by taxable supplies in that year, although in certain circumstances amounts from earlier years may be used instead. Section RZ 4 modifies section RC 8, reducing the income tax amounts used for the purposes of calculating the GST ratio to reflect the reduction in the company tax rate. For the 2011-12 and 2012-13 income years, section RZ 4(1)(b) and (2)(b) provides that the income tax amount for a new company tax rate person is to be multiplied by 0.95.

#### _Thin capitalisation rules for foreign-controlled entities_

For a person falling within their ambit, the thin capitalisation rules deny interest deductions to the extent that the debt percentage of that person's New Zealand group exceeds the higher of two thresholds specified in section FE 5. One threshold is a "safe harbour". The other threshold is determined as being 110% of the debt percentage of the person's worldwide group (this threshold does not apply to individuals).

The scope of the thin capitalisation rules was recently extended by the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009. Previously, the rules only applied to New Zealand taxpayers if they were, or were controlled by, a non-resident (section FE 2(1)(a) to (d)). They now also apply to New Zealand residents with an income interest in a controlled foreign company (CFC) or with control of a resident company with such an interest (section FE 2(1)(e) to (g)).

Section FE 5 has been amended to reduce the safe harbour for taxpayers that are, or are controlled by, a non-resident from 75% to 60%. This lower safe-harbour is set by section FE 5(1)(a)(i) and (3)(a). The safe harbour for New Zealand residents with CFC interests remains at 75% (section FE 5(1)(b)(i) and (3)(b)). The 110% threshold is also unchanged (section FE 5(1)(a)(ii) and (b)(ii)). Consequential amendments have been made to section FE 6(3)(e) and section FE 12(2).

Section FE 18(5) sets the default percentage for the worldwide group of an excess debt entity. Currently, the default percentage is 68.1818, an amount that when multiplied by 110% is equivalent to a 75% safe harbour. This section has been amended so that, for taxpayers subject to the reduced safe harbour, the default percentage becomes 54.5454: multiplied by 110%. This matches a 60% safe harbour.

The special thin capitalisation rules for banks are not affected by these changes.

#### _Company tax: Transitional arrangements_

**_Imputation and fair dividend payment crediting ratios_**

An immediate reduction of the crediting ratio allowed under section OA 18, which caps the ratio of imputation or fair dividend payment (FDP) credits to dividends, has the potential to disadvantage shareholders if the dividends to which it applies represent a distribution of income that was taxed at 30%. Therefore, the legislation allows this maximum ratio to be overridden for dividends paid during a transitional period, beginning on the first day of the company's 2011-12 income year and ending on 31 March 2013. During that period, companies can attach imputation and FDP credits to dividends up to a maximum ratio of 30/70, provided the underlying income was taxed at 30%. This is achieved by updating sections OZ 7 and OZ 8, which were introduced to deal with the previous company tax rate cut.

If a company imputes dividends using a 30/70 ratio after the 2010-11 income year to an extent that exceeds the credit balance in its imputation credit account relating to income taxed at 30%, a 10% transitional imputation penalty tax will apply under section 140C of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Penalty tax will only arise under section 140C if there is a debit balance relating to 30/70 credits on 31 March 2013. If penalty tax is also payable under section 140B because of an overdrawn balance at 31 March 2013, it will be reduced by any amount payable under section 140C.

**_Benchmark dividends_**

Sections OB 61 and OC 28 provide that the amount of imputation or FDP credits attached to the first dividend paid by a company in a tax year (the "benchmark dividend") sets the imputation ratio for that year. The imputation ratio of subsequent dividends paid in the year must be the same as for the benchmark dividend, unless the company makes a ratio change declaration.

Section OZ 9 has been updated to modify the benchmark dividend ratios in sections OB 61(4) and OC 28(4). This allows companies to change their crediting ratio from 30/70 to 28/72 without making a ratio change declaration. If the benchmark dividend was paid before the start of the 2011-12 income year and credited using a 30/70 ratio, section OZ 9 allows subsequent dividends paid during the transitional period to be credited using a 28/72 ratio. In addition, if the benchmark dividend was credited using a 30/70 ratio under section OZ 8, section OZ 9 allows a 28/72 ratio to be used for subsequent dividends once credits accrued under the 30% tax rate have run out.

_**Shareholders' tax credits**_

If the amount of imputation credits or FDP credits exceeds the maximum ratio allowed under section OA 18, the tax credit available to the shareholder is normally limited to that maximum. Section OZ 10 has been updated to modify sections LE 8 and LE 9 and sections LF 6 and LF 7, allowing shareholders to benefit from additional credits during the transitional period, when these have been attached to dividends in accordance with section OZ 8.

However, if the shareholder is a person, including a multi-rate PIE, eligible for the new 28% rate, section OZ 11 limits the credit available against their tax liability based on a 28/72 ratio, even if the actual crediting ratio of the dividend was higher than this by virtue of section OZ 8. Since a new company tax rate person will only be subject to 28% tax on the dividend, it would be inappropriate to allow them to benefit from additional credits, which could be used to offset tax on other income.

_**Tax credits for non-residents**_

The formula in section LP 2(2) for calculating tax credits for supplementary dividends is amended, reflecting the new 28/72 crediting ratio. Section OZ 12 has been updated to maintain the existing formula for dividends imputed using a 30/70 ratio under the transitional rules.

_**Available subscribed capital**_

The concept of "available subscribed capital" is relevant when a company cancels its shares and pays consideration to compensate a shareholder for that cancellation. For the purposes of determining available subscribed capital, the extent to which a dividend is fully credited may be relevant. The extent to which a dividend is treated as credited is determined using the formula in section CD 43(26). Section OZ 13 has been updated to provide that a ratio of 28/72 should be used for the purposes of this formula even if a dividend has an imputation ratio up to 30/70 during the transitional period.

_**Dividends from qualifying companies**_

A dividend paid by a qualifying company is only taxable in the hands of the shareholder to the extent it is imputed: these dividends are therefore required to be imputed to the maximum extent possible under the imputation rules given the company's available credits. The formula for calculating the amount of a fully imputed distribution is set out in section HA 15(2). Section OZ 14 has been updated to modify this formula, to treat the tax rate as 30%, rather than 28%, for dividends paid during the transitional period to which section OZ 8 applies.

_**Statutory producer boards and cooperative companies**_

For a statutory producer board, the allocation of credits to cash distributions must be done according to the formula in section OB 73(4), while section OB 75(2) allocates credits to notional distributions. For cooperative companies, the equivalent provisions are sections OB 78(3) and OB 80(2). Section OZ 15 has been updated to allow these entities to use a 30/70 crediting ratio during the transitional period.

_**Branch equivalent tax accounts and conduit tax relief accounts**_

Sections OZ 16 and OZ 17 have been updated so that entries in the branch equivalent tax accounts or conduit tax relief accounts of companies or consolidated groups that relate to 2010-11 or earlier income years are adjusted in line with the proposed reduction in the company tax rate. This is because credit balances in these accounts will be used to offset tax liabilities calculated under the proposed new company tax rate.

New Zealand Bill of Rights application by Trinity investors struck out by High Court
====================================================================================

2015 case note - New Zealand Bill of Rights application by Trinity investors struck out by High Court - presumptive bias, tax avoidance, collateral attack.

Case

Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Attorney-General

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, Bill of Rights Act 1990

### Summary

This proceeding concerned an application for orders seeking, amongst other things, to set aside the initial High Court judgment of Venning J in _Accent Management Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2005) 22 NZTC 19,027 (HC) ("_Accent 2004_"). The plaintiffs claimed the judgment was in breach of the Bill of Rights Act 1990 on the basis that Venning J was biased towards the Commissioner, having become beholden to her following non-payment of $4,250 of stamp duty in 1992. Asher J found the High Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs' claim on the basis it was an abuse of process, that the Court did not have jurisdiction and that there was no reasonably arguable case.

### Impact of decision

The judgment confirms the position in _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Redcliffe Forestry Venture Ltd_ \[2012\] NZSC 94, \[2013\] 1 NZLR 804 ("_Redcliffe 2012_") and _Bradbury v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2014\] NZSC 174, (2014) 26 NZTC 21-112 ("_Bradbury 2014_") which found a challenge to a concluded judgment that has been the subject of an appellate judgment should not be mounted in the trial court except in the case of a judgment obtained by fraud.

### Facts

This proceeding is one in a line of collateral proceedings brought by investors in the Trinity scheme against the judgments of the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court that the scheme constituted tax avoidance. (The Supreme Court's decision was reported as _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289 ("_Ben Nevis 2008_").)

This particular proceeding concerned an application by Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd ("Ben Nevis"), Bristol Forestry Venture Ltd ("Bristol"), Clive Bradbury and Gregory Peebles for orders setting aside the initial High Court judgment of Venning J in _Accent 2004_. The plaintiffs claimed the judgment was in breach of the Bill of Rights Act 1990 on the basis that Venning J was biased towards the Commissioner, having become beholden to her following non-payment of $4,250 of stamp duty in 1992.

The defendants applied to strike out the proceeding on the basis it was an abuse of process, that the Court did not have jurisdiction and that there was no reasonably arguable case.

### Decision

Asher J found the High Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs' claim.

His Honour placed the claim in the general context of the Trinity litigation. He recognised the proceeding had its genesis in that hearing and was struck out by Katz J in _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (\[2013\] NZHC 2361, (2013) 26 NZTC 21-032)where the same factual allegations had been made.

Asher J noted that at the time of the hearing in this matter, Katz J's decision was under appeal, but was subsequently upheld by the Court of Appeal (_Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2014\] NZCA 350, (2014) 26 NZTC 21,086) with the Supreme Court later declining leave to appeal in _Bradbury 2014_. In that proceeding, the Court of Appeal had determined that the appropriate forum for remedying claims relating to _Accent 2004_ was the Supreme Court, relying on _Redcliffe 2012_. The effect of _Redcliffe 2012_ was that a challenge to a concluded judgment that had been the subject of an appellate judgment should not be mounted in the trial court except in the case of a judgment obtained by fraud.

Asher J also referred to the Supreme Court's comments in _Bradbury 2014_, that the proceeding was a collateral attack on _Ben Nevis 2008_; that _Redcliffe 2012_ was against the plaintiffs; and that, except in the special case of judgments obtained by fraud, there was no authority supporting their position.

His Honour considered he was bound by those decisions. In the absence of fraud, a challenge to _Accent 2004_ could only be heard in the Supreme Court and, accordingly, there was no jurisdiction to determine an application filed in the High Court. The Court had no jurisdiction to hear the claim and so the proceeding was struck out.

了解新西兰的税务体系
==========

新西兰政府的大部分收入来自以下方面的税收：

*   个人所得税
*   营业所得税
*   商品及服务税。

在新西兰，税收会用于资助政策项目和服务。通过查看财政部所提供的财务报表，您可以看到税收的数额和类型，以及政府的支出。

[收入和支出（财政部）](https://www.treasury.govt.nz/information-and-services/financial-management-and-advice/revenue-and-expenditure#:~:text=The%20three%20largest%20areas%20of,Education%3A%20%2415.3%20billion)

  

新西兰的税务体系允许您自行评估自己的税务状况。这意味着您需要完成以下任务：

*   确保记录并申报您赚取的每一类收入，并为其缴纳正确的税款
*   在[纳税年度](/api/glossary/item?id={E82CF596-48B4-444A-81F8-D3037B851922})
    结束时提交或批准纳税申报表
*   评估您是否符合获得任何社会福利的资格。

个人所得税
-----

此税款是根据您的收入征收。根据设定的收入分级，您在一个纳税年度的总收入会根据不同的分级征收不同的税率。

*   在最低收入分级内的所有收入是按最低税率征税。
*   如果您的收入位于较高分级，则税率会增加，且该税率只适用于您在该分级范围内的收入。

[个人税率](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/tax-codes-and-tax-rates-for-individuals/tax-rates-for-individuals)

[个人所得税](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals)

营业所得税
-----

此税款是根据企业营收征收。如果您是自雇经营或未注册的企业，您将按个人税率纳税。其他企业实体采用不同的税率。访问business.govt.nz网站可查看符合您情况的企业类型。

[企业结构概述 (Business.gov.nz)](https://www.business.govt.nz/getting-started/choosing-the-right-business-structure/business-structure-overview/)

商品及服务税 (GST)
------------

此为针对注册供应商在新西兰销售的商品和服务所征收的税款。当您在新西兰购买商品或服务时，您需为大多数购买内容支付商品及服务税。也有一些您无需支付商品及服务税的例外情况。

在任何为期12个月的时段内，如果您从[应纳税活动](/api/glossary/item?id={20527F17-D96C-4DA1-BD56-75DB0B2CF2D1})
赚取超过60,000新西兰元的[营业额](/api/glossary/item?id={24199208-96A0-484E-A7C9-A8FEAC5318BD})
，则须注册商品及服务税。这意味着您需向您的客户收取商品及服务税，并在纳税年度内转给IRD。

[商品及服务税 (GST)](/gst)

根据不同类型的收入支付正确的税款
----------------

建议您检查个人和企业的收入类型列表。这样，您就可以确保您为每一类收入支付的税费均正确无误。

[个人收入的类型](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/types-of-individual-income)

[企业收入的类型](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-income)

  

您的税务居民身份可能会影响您针对不同类型的收入所需支付的税款。IRD关于个人国际税务的条款罗列了针对不同类型的收入提出的建议，您可以根据自己的身份查看相应的条款：

*   非居民纳税人
*   新西兰税务居民。

提交或批准年终纳税申报表之前，您需要完成此操作。

[个人国际税务](/international-tax/individuals)

  

如果您已成立了正式的公司，或者您正在从事国际业务，请务必查看IRD的国际业务章节。

[国际业务税务](/international-tax/business)

提交或批准您的年终纳税申报表。
---------------

其中某些类型的收入需要您在纳税年度期间纳税。您仍需在纳税年度结束时进行最终检查，看看是否会有：

*   退税
*   待缴税款
*   无待缴税款。

[提交或批准您的年终纳税申报表](/simplified-chinese/end-of-year-tax-return)

社会福利
----

您可能会对现有的社会福利感兴趣。例如，新西兰推出了自愿退休储蓄计划，协助您为退休做好准备。即使您目前尚未符合参与该项目或其他项目的资格（如工作家庭税收抵免计划或学生贷款计划），您将来也可能会想参与。

Case study 1 – Providing relief and support to customers affected by the cyclones

When Cyclone Hale and Cyclone Gabrielle caused states of emergency in Te Ika-a-Maui the North Island in early 2023, Te Taro Taake Inland Revenue was ready to help. By embracing a hands-on approach, cross-agency collaboration, targeted support and proactive community engagement, we worked with others to support businesses and individuals. 

People were dealing with strong winds, severe floods, as well as loss of power, internet connection and cell phone coverage. We distributed relief packages and reached out to people door-to-door. This was vital-without digital communications, we had to communicate with people directly to ensure they were receiving the support they needed.

We worked with other organisations to extend our reach and provide relief to people. Together with Trust Tairāwhiti and Te Manatū Whakahiato Ora the Ministry of Social Development, we also organised a business hub for local enterprises. The hub helped businesses carry on with their essential operations such as paying wages to employees, filing tax returns and navigating obligations where necessary. The hub was available every day, including weekends.

We know that different industries have their own challenges so we organised targeted hui (meetings) for the horticultural, hospitality and tourism sectors. We identified businesses that needed immediate assistance and provided tailored support to help them navigate their specific challenges. 

To ensure our customers were aware of the support available and knew how to reach us, our teams spoke on local radio stations. We proactively worked with tax agents through webinar sessions, ensuring they were equipped with the latest information to relay to their clients. 

We also worked with Rīpeka Whero Aotearoa New Zealand Red Cross and local councils in the Whāngarei area to enable welfare checks and door-to-door visits. Our Whāngarei team distributed non-perishable food packs to the local marae and ensured the local community felt supported.

In the aftermath of the floods in Tāmaki Makaurau Auckland, we worked with Hīkina Whakatutuki the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment to find housing for families who had been left homeless. The team comprised 40 members from various agencies, including Te Mana Ārai o Aotearoa the New Zealand Customs Service, Te Tari Taiwhenua the Department of Internal Affairs, and Te Kaporeihana Āwhina Hunga Whara Accident Compensation Corporation. A specific case demonstrate the team’s swift action and successful outcomes.

### Case 1: Rapid response for a family of 8

When a family of 8 faced homelessness after their house was yellow stickered, the team swiftly coordinated efforts with other agencies and secured new accommodation for the family overnight.

### Case 2: Supporting a family with a child with special needs

A family with a child with special needs had difficulty finding suitable housing, which was causing them immense stress. The team found the family a suitable home–it was accessible and near essential health services.

Case study 2 – Data sharing with Tatauranga Aotearoa Stats NZ

Te Tari Taake Inland Revenue is a critical member of Aotearoa New Zealand’s data system. We hold significant data assets that we and our government partners realise value from to produce statistics, reports and insights into our population and economy. The managed access to sensitive data content is led by Tatauranga Aotearoa, Stats NZ, which collects data from a variety of sources.

Te Tari Taake, Inland Revenue is a major contributor of information to 2 of Stats NZ’s large research databases: the Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI) and Longitudinal Business Database (LBD). The anonymous information in these databases helps government and academic researchers with social and economic questions in the public interest and informs government decision making and policy change. 

Recently, our data has helped build an understanding of how the groups of people who are unemployed and those who receive a Jobseeker Support Benefit overlap each other, and to understand people who are not in the overlap. The data was also used to examine trends in the labour market and will help support people returning to the workforce.

Our data is also helping to build an understanding of Aotearoa’s kaiāwhina workforce (community, health and disability workers). The research aims to provide updated insights on the kaiāwhina workforce, including demographic characteristics, employment profiles, and movements in and out of the workforce. It seeks to support the needs of relevant agencies and contribute to the public good by improving competency and service provision in the health sector.

Anticipated outcomes include input for pay equity settlement, a more comprehensive understanding of the health workforce, collaborative partnerships and reusable code for future workforce analysis. The research will also contribute to broader policy-related questions regarding transitions in the labour market and recovery from events like the COVID-19 pandemic.

We also have a memorandum of understanding with Tatauranga Aotearoa Stats NZ, which allows us to provide information that is critical to their work, which includes: 

*   quarterly retail statistics–shows the level of confidence in the economy
*   gross domestic product statistics–an official measure of economic growth
*   balance of payments statistics–a comprehensive record of New Zealand’s economic relationship with the rest of the world
*   the New Zealand Census of Population and Dwellings–how, as a country, we are changing over time, and the
*   household Economic Survey–measuring the economic wellbeing of New Zealanders.

Business customers gain value from easy and seamless dealings with government

Hīkina Whakatutuki the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s (MBIE's) Better for Business programme researches customer experiences with several government agencies, including Te Tari Taake Inland Revenue. MBIE's Customer Experience Index (CXI) uses 10 dimensions to generate insights into how government agencies can improve the experience that businesses have when they deal with them. 

We scored 66 on the Customer Experience Index.

Over the past year, our CXI score increased by 4 points to 66. More businesses are feeling satisfied and not experiencing frustration during their most recent interaction with us. Some businesses had recently had less contact with us. This perceived upswing in service level could also be related to our increased efforts to help businesses get their tax affairs in order. For example, the launch of the Tax Toolbox to help construction businesses understand their tax obligations.

Note: The survey used to generate information for the Customer Experience Index was put on hold in 2020 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on businesses.

New Zealanders benefit economically and socially through Inland Revenue working collaboratively across our external environment
===============================================================================================================================

We work and share appropriate information with other government agencies and external partners to deliver better services and outcomes for New Zealanders.

This year, the Government’s top priority continued to be responding to COVID-19. This has required a major focus from all government agencies, including Inland Revenue. We have worked with Te Tai Ōhanga the Treasury, Hīkina Whakatutuki the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Manatū Taonga the Ministry of Culture and Heritage, and Te Manatū Whakahiato Ora the Ministry of Social Development to prepare joint advice on policies and support the rollout of services and initiatives.

We also worked with government departments on cross-agency initiatives and administering products and services. Read about our information-sharing agreements, international agreements and memoranda of understanding with other agencies on our website.

#### We supported other agencies to administer COVID-19 support

Throughout the year, we supported Te Manatū Whakahiato Ora the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) by verifying applications for the Leave Support Subsidy and Short-Term Absence Payments.

Between August and December 2021, we supported MSD to administer the Wage Subsidy Scheme. We made a portal available so MSD people could access information directly themselves and verify income information for self-employed people. To further support the integrity of the Wage Subsidy Scheme, using data provided by MSD, we pre-populated 2022 income information for customers with details of the wage subsidy payments they received. Each time the scheme was available, we provided analytical support to MSD to help identify where further post-payment checks may be appropriate. We also took 192,000 calls this year to help verify people's eligibility.

We've also shared our experience with Te Manatū Taonga the Ministry of Culture and Heritage (MCH) on the design of their Cultural Sector Emergency Relief Fund (CSERF) for self-employed people. An information-sharing arrangement with MCH supported the administration of the CSERF - we made checks to help stop double-dipping, as the CSERF and COVID-19 Support Payment were available at the same time and people were not able to get both. If this did happen, we sought repayment on behalf of the Ministry.

We continued to be actively involved in providing advice and input to other agencies on the design of COVID-19 initiatives, even when we did not administer them. We worked with other agencies to ensure communications to customers across government agencies were consistent and coordinated. For example, we included information in the newsletter for businesses published by Hīkina Whakatutuki the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.

#### Sharing what we learnt from business transformation

Inland Revenue has had many requests to share what has been learned in successfully delivering our $1.5 billion transformation programme. We launched a website in July 2021 that provides detail behind our programme to other agencies and organisations.

"This was one of the largest and most ambitious programmes of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere, so it’s not surprising that others want to know what we did right, and what lessons we learned in doing it", says Deputy Commissioner Greg James.

All the tools, plans, and templates used for the programme are on the site and can be downloaded. Each stage of the programme is covered, including insights from projects that ran parallel with the programme such as intelligence and analytics, digital ecosystem and organisational design.

Our transformation has been recognised as a success both in Aotearoa New Zealand and internationally, and this is an effective way we can ensure that new transformation programmes get the chance to benefit from our experience.

#### Changes to the KiwiSaver default scheme

On 14 May 2021, the Government announced changes to the default KiwiSaver scheme providers. Every 7 years, default providers are reviewed. This is the second time a review has been held but the first-time any default providers have lost their status, which meant we were required to transfer members from the exiting default providers. 5 existing providers lost their default status, and 2 new providers were appointed. There are now 6 default providers.

The transfer process began in December 2021. This was a big undertaking, as there were approximately 223,000 members in default schemes, and around $2.3 billion in funds to be re-allocated. We made improvements to the system we use to securely communicate with providers so we could quickly and securely share information. We used this system to let exiting providers know that a transfer had been initiated, and let new/continuing providers know which schemes their new members previously belonged to so they could contact them to arrange a transfer of funds. Once the transfer of funds was completed, the new providers used the system to advise us that the transfer was complete, and the old provider to confirm that the account with them was closed. Our modernised capabilities helped make this a smooth and secure process for providers and members.

The automatic transfer process was a success. By working closely with the exiting providers, and sharing necessary information, we transferred the right members. Most of the transfers were completed by Christmas 2021, with the final transfers completed in April 2022.

95% of KiwiSaver contributions are transferred to scheme providers within 2 days.

Business customers gain value from easy and seamless dealings with government

The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s Better for Business programme researches customer experiences with several government agencies, including Inland Revenue. Its Customer Experience Index (CXI) uses 10 dimensions to generate insights into how government agencies can improve the experience that businesses have when they deal with them.

We scored 62 on the Customer Experience Index.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |Six-monthly Customer Experience Index scores from June 2017 to June 2022.
| Month and year | CXI score |
| --- | --- |
| June 2017 | 66  |
| December 2017 | 63  |
| June 2018 | 63  |
| December 2018 | 66  |
| June 2019 | 62  |
| December 2019 | 55  |

| December 2020 | n/a |
| June 2021 | 63  |
| December 2021 | n/a |
| June 2022 | 62  |

Over the past year, our CXI score has dropped 1 point to 62. This small decrease was due to drops in satisfaction and service performance (the percentage of matters we resolved in 2 contacts), which dropped 5 and 6 points respectively. These changes reflect the effect that ongoing high customer demand has had on Inland Revenue. This high demand is a result of more customers seeking our support when they’ve been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Two of the dimensions improved by 4 points from last year - less frustration or stress and less time spent on day-to-day government requirements. These changes may reflect the 'right from the start' approach we use to educate all our new business customers, and our self-service options that allow customers to get their issues resolved quickly.

Note: in 2020, the survey used to generate information for the Customer Experience Index was put on hold due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on businesses.

New Zealand/Finland Protocol: Addition to the Double Taxation Relief (Finland) Order 1984
=========================================================================================

Archived legislative commentary on the New Zealand/Finland Protocol: Addition to the Double Taxation Relief (Finland) Order 1984 from PIB vol 179 May 1989.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 179, May 1989

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_](/about/about-our-publications)
.

A protocol to the 1984 Finland Double Taxation Convention was signed in Helsinki on 5 December 1986.

The purpose of the protocol is to include a Non-Discrimination Article to prevent discrimination on the grounds of nationality.

Paragraph 1 establishes the principle that for taxation purposes discrimination on the grounds of nationality is forbidden. The paragraph prevents a State from imposing any more burdensome taxation or connected requirement on nationals of the other State than it imposes on its own nationals in the same circumstances.

Paragraph 2 requires non-residents trading through a permanent establishment to be taxed no less favourably than a resident who carries on the same activities.

Paragraph 3 is designed to end a particular form of discrimination resulting from the fact that in certain countries the deduction of interest, royalties and other disbursements, allowed without restriction when the recipient is resident, is restricted or even prohibited when he/she is a non-resident.

Paragraph 4 prevents discrimination against enterprises which are wholly or partly owned by residents of the other State, e.g., a New Zealand subsidiary of a Finland Company. This has no practical effect in New Zealand - we do not discriminate against such enterprises.

Paragraph 5 provides that this Article shall not apply to any provision in taxation laws which:

1.  is reasonably designed to prevent or defeat the avoidance or evasion of taxes; or
2.  is in force in New Zealand and Finland on 5 December 1986 and any subsequent laws which have substantially similar purpose or intent.

Provided that Finland/New Zealand does not give greater benefits to residents or citizens of third countries than to residents or citizens of Finland/New Zealand.

Paragraph 6 ensures that New Zealand may continue to distinguish in its taxation laws between residents and non-residents, e.g., grant to New Zealand residents, rebates and special exemptions which do not extend to non-residents, or impose non-resident withholding tax on dividends paid by a New Zealand Company to a Finnish Company.

Paragraph 7 restricts the scope of the Article to those taxes covered by the Convention.

The protocol entered into force on 8 May 1988 and will have effect in New Zealand for any income year beginning on or after 1 April 1989 and in the case of Finland from 1 January 1989.

Nexus - section DA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004
===============================================

2014 case note - High Court upheld CIR's assessments disallowing the interest deductions as insufficient connection between deductions and income-earning process.

Case

P L Brown Farms Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2014\] NZHC 1601

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2004

### Summary

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") disallowed interest deductions claimed by the appellant, P L Brown Farms Limited, in the 2006 and 2007 income tax years. The Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") and now the High Court have upheld the Commissioner's assessments disallowing the interest deductions due to there being an insufficient connection between the deductions and the appellant's income-earning process.

### Impact of decision

Whether there is sufficient nexus, between the income-earning process and the deductions claimed by a taxpayer, pursuant to section DA 1 of the of the Income Tax Act 2004 ("the Act"), is determined by considering the legal arrangements entered into, not by considering what other arrangements the parties might have entered into.

### Facts

The appellant, P L Brown Farms Limited ("Farms"), appealed the decision of the TRA upholding the assessments made by the Commissioner and dismissing the appellant's challenge to those assessments (_X Ltd (A Farming Company) v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2013\] NZTRA 2).

### Background

There are three relevant companies all ultimately owned by Mr and Mrs Brown. The Court, adopting the terms of the TRA, referred to the appellant as "Farms" and to the other two companies as "Sharemilking" and "Beef".

Farms (a qualifying company) borrowed from a bank on commercial terms and on-lent the borrowed funds to Sharemilking and Beef. One of the terms of this on-lending was that interest would be payable on demand, but in fact no interest was demanded from or paid by either Sharemilking or Beef.

The money was used by Sharemilking and Beef to purchase land now leased to Farms. The land purchase by Sharemilking included the purchase of shares in Fonterra.

Farms claimed deductions in the 2006 and 2007 income years for interest paid to the bank on the money borrowed and on-lent to Sharemilking and Beef. The Commissioner disallowed the deductions on the basis that the expenditure did not satisfy the general permission in section DA 1 of the Act, under which a deduction is allowed for expenditure incurred in deriving assessable income.

### Decision

#### _Nexus_

The appellant submitted that there was a nexus between the interest paid and its assessable income, because the borrowed money on which the interest was paid was used to acquire land that Farms used to carry on its farming business. The Court noted that had this been the case, there would have been an indisputable nexus between the interest expenditure claimed and the income-earning process carried out by Farms. However, the Court found that the land was actually purchased by Sharemilking and Beef and leased to Farms.

The Court noted that the arrangements actually entered into needed to be analysed to determine whether the arrangements established a nexus. The Court found that there was no evidence of any agreement between Farms and either Sharemilking or Beef that made the granting of the leases conditional on receipt by Sharemilking or Beef from Farms of the funds borrowed by Farms.

The Court also held that there was no evidence of any contract or other arrangement between Farms on one hand, and Sharemilking and Beef respectively on the other, to create a nexus between the borrowing and the acquisition of the land by Farms.

The Court held that, on the evidence, the ultimate controllers of all three companies had the ability to achieve, and did achieve, the outcome that the borrowed money was used to buy land which was then leased to Farms. Accordingly, the Court held that this was not a nexus in terms of section DA 1 of the Act.

#### _Barter transaction_

The appellant asserted that it received a reduced rental in exchange for interest-free loans and therefore a barter transaction existed. The Court was not satisfied, on the evidence, that there was any barter arrangement.

#### _Fonterra shares_

The appellant submitted that there is a nexus between the interest payments and the derivation of income because the funds borrowed by Farms were used in part by Sharemilking to purchase the Fonterra shares under which the milk produced by Farms was sold. The Court found that the money borrowed was not used by Farms to acquire the shares - the shares were acquired by Sharemilking.

The Court also held that there was no evidence that Farms derived any income as a direct result of the acquisition of the Fonterra shares, nor was there any evidence of the extent to which Farms or Sharemilking derived dividend income from the Fonterra shares.

No deduction for fines
======================

2008 case note - TRA accepted that there was no nexus to income earning and good policy reasons to disallow fines incurred by a trucking firm – fines, deductibility.

Case

TRA 105/05 Dec 9/2008

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994

### Summary

The TRA accepted that there was no nexus to income earning and good policy reasons to disallow fines incurred by a trucking firm.

### Facts

The taxpayer is a trucking firm which transported timber from forests for processing. In the course of this activity the firm had received fines for overloading its trucks. The firm sought to deduct these fines in the 2000 to 2002 income years inclusive.

A good deal of expert evidence regarding the loading and weighing of trucks was adduced by both sides. The taxpayer argued that while they did not accept the fines could not be successfully challenged in court (on the basis of various statutory defences including a "no fault" defence) it was simply better business to pay the fine than to challenge it \[par 6\]. The Commissioner took the view that the taxpayer had failed to take reasonable steps to avoid the fines \[par 42\]. Noting that the relevant legislation "built in" a five percent tolerance before a truck driver would be fined the Commissioner submitted that the taxpayer was "cavalier" in its attitude \[paragraphs 49 and 57-58\]

### Decision

Barber DCJ concluded that the fines were not deductible.

His Honour reviewed the case law in the area identifying that in major Commonwealth countries (Australia, England and New Zealand) fines were not usually deductible (paragraphs \[71\] to \[104\]). He noted the Canadian case law to the opposite effect was overridden by statute to prohibit the deductibility of fines and penalties (par \[107\].

Despite observing that New Zealand cases were "not clear" upon the issue of whether or not fines and penalties had sufficient nexus to be deductible, his Honour continued:

\[109\] However, it seems to me that a business should operate within the law. The disputant's business of carting logs on large trucks and trailers is able to comply with the law, but there is expense involved in weight-of-load compliance and such non-compliance can involve a relatively modest amount of annual fines. It seems to me to be illogical to seek to deduct fines relating to a breach of the law as if they were a business expense, because they relate to activities which do not conform to the law and so are not within the permitted scope of the business. I consider that a penalty/fine arising from a taxpayer's illegal activities (ie, transporting too heavy a load) cannot have a sufficient nexus with the taxpayer's income earning process so as to create deductibility for that cost of the fine.

He also noted that he was bound by the earlier High Court decision of _Nicholas Nathan Ltd v CIR_ (1989) 11 NZTC 6,213 in which Justice Sinclair held fines were not allowable deductions for reasons of public policy (par \[111\]) :

\[111\] In any case, under the doctrine of precedent I am bound, by the 1989 High Court decision of _Nicholas Nathan Ltd and Anor v CIR_ where Sinclair J held that deductibility of fines should not be allowed on the grounds of public policy. It would be contrary to public policy to allow such fines paid by logging transport companies to be deducted from their revenue earnings. It makes no difference to my reasoning whether the objector company incurred the fines or whether its drivers incurred them but the objector paid them. The public policy approach readily leads to denial of deductibility for fines but the nexus approach is not so easy to apply.

While sympathetic to the taxpayer, the Taxation Review Authority confirmed the assessments.

No deemed acceptance of a late NOPA
===================================

2011 case note - the usual dispute resolution procedures do not apply to a late Notice of Proposed Adjustment where no 'exceptional circumstance' is raised.

Case

Heather Anne Jacobs-Maxwell v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994, Income Tax Act 2004, Income Tax Act 2007 and Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The usual dispute resolution procedures under Part 4A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") (including deemed acceptance under section 89H(2)) do not apply to a late Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) where no "exceptional circumstance" is raised in accordance with section 89K.

### Impact of decision

This decision confirms that a valid timely NOPA is a prerequisite to deemed acceptance under section 89H(2). Deemed acceptance does not occur if the Commissioner fails to reject an invalid late NOPA with a compliant Notice of Response (NOR) within the applicable response period. Nevertheless, the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2011 has now amended the TAA and the new section 89K provides that a taxpayer may challenge the Commissioner's decision to refuse to issue a notice in favour of the taxpayer under the new section 89K(1) by filing proceedings within two months of the notice's issue.

### Facts

The taxpayer appealed against the decision of the Taxation Review Authority (TRA) which was delivered on 11 April 2011. The TRA held that the Commissioner's failure to respond to the taxpayer's late NOPA with a compliant NOR did not amount to a deemed acceptance of her proposed adjustment.

In February 2004, the taxpayer's accountant had sought deductions for a company owned by the taxpayer. The effect of such deductions would have been to reduce the taxpayer's income. That request was declined by the Commissioner. Debt collection proceedings commenced and a meeting between the taxpayer and Inland Revenue was held on 27 November 2009.

The taxpayer claimed that she was invited by the Commissioner to file an out-of-time NOPA at the 27 November 2009 meeting. The taxpayer subsequently filed her late NOPA on 3 December 2009. No application for exceptional circumstances was made by the taxpayer.

On 4 December 2009, the Commissioner issued a letter rejecting the taxpayer's late NOPA on the grounds that it was outside the applicable response period. It was not contended that the Commissioner's letter constituted a compliant NOR.

### Decision

Justice Heath upheld the decision of the TRA and rejected the taxpayer's appeal. His Honour held that section 89K of the TAA is a discrete code designed to deal with late NOPAs and that the usual disputes resolution procedures under Part 4A do not otherwise apply to late NOPAs.

His Honour held that it is only if the Commissioner considers that there has been an exceptional circumstance preventing a taxpayer from providing a NOPA within the applicable response period and the taxpayer sends a late NOPA, that under section 89K(1)(d), the latter is "treated for all purposes under this Part as if it had been given within the applicable response period".

His Honour held that the usual dispute resolution procedures under Part 4A of the TAA (including deemed acceptance under section 89H(2)) did not apply to the taxpayer's late NOPA as no application for exceptional circumstances had been made by the taxpayer.

His Honour also held (consistently with section 138E(1)(e)(iv) of the TAA) that the Commissioner's decision to decline to receive a late NOPA is not subject to challenge.

No exceptional circumstances to allow a challenge outside the response period
=============================================================================

2009 case note – No exceptional circumstances for challenge proceedings - extension of time, accounting error, agent, event/circumstance beyond taxpayer's control.

Case

TRA Decision No 12/2009

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994 sections 3, 113 and 138D

### Summary

The Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") could not allow the taxpayer to commence challenge proceedings after the statutory response period because the exceptional circumstances required by section 138D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") did not exist in this case. The alleged errors of the taxpayer's accountant were not beyond the control of the accountant as the taxpayer's agent, and could have been anticipated. Whether personnel are to be treated as employees or as contractors is a basic element of business, and the error could have been avoided by compliance with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct. The failure of the taxpayer's director to discover the errors in time was also not an event or circumstance beyond the taxpayer's control.

### Impact of decision

The Authority held that a taxpayer may not challenge a decision by the Commissioner to not exercise his discretion in section 113 of the TAA to make an amended assessment; ie a taxpayer may not challenge a decision by the Commissioner to not amend an assessment under section 113 of the TAA. If the Commissioner does make a new assessment under section 113 of the TAA, then the new assessment is amenable to challenge in the usual way notwithstanding section 138(1)(e)(iv) of the TAA.

The decision also illustrates the implementation of the test in the Court of Appeal decision _CIR v Fuji Xerox NZ Ltd_ (2002) 20 NZTC 17,470, on "exceptional circumstances" for allowing a challenge to be filed outside the response period.

### Facts

The Disputant (a company), having filed its returns on the basis that its staff were employees, when faced with liquidation proceedings brought by the Commissioner, sought to amend its assessments to reduce the tax debt upon which the liquidation was based.

The Disputant asserted that its various returns between 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2007 were in error, and that the mistake was occasioned by its external accountants incorrectly treating its staff as employees, when they were allegedly contractors. The Commissioner declined to exercise his discretion under section 113 of the TAA to amend the assessments.

### Decision

There were no "exceptional circumstances" within the meaning of section 138D(2) of the TAA, and as such the Authority did not have jurisdiction and/or discretion to grant the application to file a challenge after the response period (at \[4\] \[13\]).

The Disputant had not clarified the errors which were claimed to be "exceptional circumstances" that caused the challenge to not be filed within time. Hence, the Authority considered the relevant act or omission to be the two alternatives as stated by the Commissioner. The first was the accountant’s alleged ongoing error in treating the staff as employees when they were allegedly contractors. The second was the omission of the director of the Disputant to take timely independent advice despite, on his own evidence, the fact he was aware that there was a taxation problem "over the years from 2003 to 2007".

Applying the test in _CIR v Fuji Xerox NZ Ltd_, the Authority (at \[27\]) reached the view that in respect of the accountant’s error none of the elements of the conditions in section 138D(2) of the TAA were satisfied, when all three must be satisfied together for an agent’s conduct to be an "exceptional circumstance". The acts or omissions were not beyond the control of the accountant, could have been anticipated and the ongoing misunderstanding as to the proper accounting treatment of the staff for tax purposes could have been avoided by compliance with accepted stands of business organisation and professional conduct. The actions or omissions of the accountant (agent) were not beyond the control of the Disputant; the accountant acted at the direction of the Disputant.

In respect of the alternative (ie, that the relevant error was the omission of the director of the Disputant to take independent advice despite becoming aware that there was a taxation problem), that omission was a routine business decision and not an "exceptional circumstance" either (at \[31\]). The Authority further applied _Milburn NZ Ltd v CIR_ (1998) 18 NZTC 14,005, reaching the view that it could not say that the omission by the director was "beyond the control" of the Disputant (at \[32\]).

The Authority considered that section 138E(1)(e)(iv) of the TAA means what it says, and that in this case, there was no right for the Disputant to challenge a decision of the Commissioner to not exercise his discretion in section 113 of the TAA in favour of the Disputant (at \[36\]).

The Authority specifically noted that, to be fair to the accountant, it may be that the accountant has at all times acted competently and properly but that the Disputant is retrospectively attempting to change the status of its employees.

2015 case note – Taxation Review Authority struck out claim on the grounds that the disputes procedure had not been completed therefore they lacked jurisdiction.

Case

TRA 017/12; \[2015\] NZTRA 02

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

This was a decision of the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") striking out the disputant's Notice of Claim ("NOC") on the grounds that the disputes procedure under Part 4A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") had not been completed. Therefore, the TRA lacked jurisdiction to hear and determine the proceeding.

### Impact of decision

This decision reaffirms the decision in _Allen v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2006\] 3 NZLR 1that s 138H of the TAA provides a procedural mechanism for removing from the TRA proceedings that have been improperly commenced because of noncompliance with s 138B of the TAA.

### Facts

The proceeding concerned an application made by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") to strike out the disputant's amended NOC. The application was made on the grounds that the TRA lacked the jurisdiction to hear and determine the proceeding as the disputes procedure under Part 4A of the TAA had not been completed.

The underlying dispute involves a goods and services tax ("GST") refund claimed by the disputant for the period ended 30 July 2009 ("the GST period"). The Commissioner made an assessment on 23 November 2010 disallowing the input credit claimed. On 20 June 2012, the Commissioner issued an amended assessment ("Notice of Assessment") under s 113 of the TAA. The assessment was made pursuant to s 89C(eb) of the TAA, which provides that where the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe the taxpayer has been involved in fraudulent activity, the Commissioner may make an assessment without first issuing a Notice of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPA").

The disputant issued a NOPA, dated 23 September 2012 but received by the Commissioner on 3 September 2012. The Commissioner issued a Notice of Response ("NOR") on 1 November 2012 rejecting the disputant's NOPA.

At the same time as issuing the NOPA, the disputant filed a NOC in the TRA dated August 2012, purporting to challenge the assessment. The amended NOC was filed following a hearing held on 20 December 2012. The Commissioner filed the present application to strike out this claim on 7 March 2013.

The disputant then filed judicial review proceedings in the High Court seeking judicial review of the Commissioner's assessment of the GST period. The Commissioner filed an appearance and objection to jurisdiction and in the alternative, an application to strike out the causes of action against her. The High Court dismissed the causes of action against the Commissioner on the basis that s 109 of the TAA applied and each cause of action could be dealt with in the statutory disputes and challenge process ("jurisdiction decision").

The disputant attempted to appeal the jurisdiction decision but the application for an extension of time to appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal in September 2014 on the basis that the proposed appeal was hopeless and another statutory remedy was available. The Court of Appeal concluded it was not in the interests of justice to extend the time to appeal.

The disputant also had a damages claim running concurrently with the above proceedings. On 6 July 2012, the disputant filed a Statement of Claim ("SOC") seeking damages and/or compensation of $5,113,810.72, as well as an application for summary judgment seeking judgment in the sum of $594,210.48 for withheld GST refunds.

The summary judgment application was dismissed in April 2013 by the High Court. The disputant then filed an amended SOC, which included a fourth cause of action purporting to be a challenge under Part 8A of the TAA to the Commissioner's Notice of Assessment. The Commissioner made an application to strike out this cause of action and in a judgment delivered in July 2014, the Associate Judge granted the application noting that the disputes procedure had not been completed.

The disputant applied to review the strike-out decision and in December 2014 the High Court held the Associate Judge was right to strike out the cause of action.

### Decision

The TRA struck out the challenge proceeding.

#### _Lack of jurisdiction_

Section 138H of the TAA provides that the Commissioner may apply to strike out a challenge commenced by the disputant if the disputant has failed to comply with s 89M or s 138B of the TAA.

The Commissioner argued that completion of the disputes procedure under Part 4A is required before a challenge under Part 8A can be commenced. The statutory disputes process has not been completed and so the TRA lacks jurisdiction to hear and determine the claim. Both parties filed Statements of Position, following which the proper step was to refer these and supporting evidence to the Disputes Review Unit ("DRU").

The dispute had not yet been referred to the DRU. There are currently three similar disputes underway concerning the disputant's GST returns, and the Commissioner believes they should be considered together. This process has been delayed by the various other proceedings in the High Court concerning these disputes.

Section 138B of the TAA sets out the circumstances in which an assessment can be challenged. The disputant relied upon s 138B(1) which sets out the disputes process where the Commissioner has proposed an adjustment. It said that by amending the assessment the Commissioner had proposed an adjustment, and further argued that in the judicial review proceeding the High Court had confirmed that s 138B(1) was the provision under which it should bring its challenge.

The Commissioner relied on s 138B(3) of the TAA, which deals with situations where the disputant has proposed the adjustment. She disagreed with the disputant's interpretation of the judicial review proceeding, and relied on _Allen v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2006\] 3 NZLR 1 as authority that the reference to an "adjustment proposed by the Commissioner" in s 138B(1) was a reference to a NOPA.

Judge Sinclair agreed with the Commissioner and found the disputant initiated proceedings. While the Commissioner issued a Notice of Assessment, this could not be held to be a NOPA for the purposes of s 138B of the TAA. The disputant then issued a NOPA in response to the Commissioner's Notice of Assessment and this initiated proceedings. Section 138B(3) was held to be the applicable subsection.

If the taxpayer has initiated proceedings, and the DRU finds in favour of the Commissioner, a challenge notice pursuant to s 89P of the TAA is issued. Part 8A sets out the process by which a taxpayer may challenge an assessment. To engage in that process the taxpayer must first meet the requirements under s 138B.

Judge Sinclair found that, as the DRU stage had not been completed and no challenge notice issued, the disputes procedure under Part 4A of the TAA had not been completed and the challenge procedure under Part 8A (s 138B) could not be invoked.

#### _Abuse of process_

The Commissioner also submitted that the proceeding was an abuse of process, as the prerequisites for commencing a challenge proceeding had not been met. The disputant had raised the same issues in proceedings before the High Court, and been directed that it had to complete the statutory disputes process before it could issue a challenge.

Judge Sinclair agreed and held the proceeding to be an abuse of process.

#### _Res judicata_

The disputant contended that the issue of which subsection of s 138B of the TAA to apply, was determined in the judicial review proceedings, and so it was res judicata or alternatively the Commissioner was estopped from raising the issue.

Judge Sinclair found the judicial review proceedings did not specifically consider the application of s 138B(1) or apply it to the facts, and so concluded there was no issue with res judicata or estoppel.

#### _Deemed acceptance_

The disputant alleged the Commissioner's NOR was issued out of time and so the criteria of s 138B(3) of the TAA could not be met.

Her Honour stated that this matter had been dealt with in the judicial review proceeding. The High Court and Court of Appeal both concluded that any disagreement about the date each party issued its dispute document is a disputed fact that could be determined in the statutory dispute and challenge procedures.

#### _Other arguments_

The disputant also contended that the Commissioner had acted ultra vires and in breach of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Her Honour found those issues were not relevant to the present application, which turned solely on whether s 138B of the TAA had been complied with so that the challenge procedure had been properly commenced.

There would be no prejudice to the disputant in granting the Commissioner's application. Once the proper disputes procedure has been completed the disputant will still have the opportunity to raise all the substantive issues it wants to before a validly convened hearing authority.

Delay was an irrelevant consideration to the current proceeding, as delay does not affect jurisdiction.

2015 case note – TRA found no jurisdiction where the disputes process has not been completed - statement of position, interlocutory, District Court Rules.

Case

V Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The disputant sought an ordering requiring the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") to issue a disclosure notice and statement of position with respect to its Notices of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPAs") that were part of a dispute progressing through the disputes process. The Taxation Review Authority ("the Authority") held it is necessary for the disputes process to be completed before challenge proceedings can be filed and so it did not have jurisdiction to hear the application. Further, the jurisdiction of the Authority is found in the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994, not the District Court Rules 2014. The Authority also found it did not have the power to direct the Commissioner to issue a disclosure notice and she cannot be compelled to do so. While the Standard Practice Statement may set out what is done “generally” or “usually”, it is only a guideline and there is no obligation on the Commissioner to follow this course.

### Impact

Where there is no assessment or any disputable decision, the disputes process must be completed before a challenge proceeding can be filed.

The Commissioner cannot be compelled to issue a disclosure notice and there is no timeframe in which she must do so.

### Facts

V Limited (“the disputant”) filed an interlocutory application for an order requiring the Commissioner to file a disclosure notice and a statement of position in response to the disputant’s NOPAs dated 22 and 24 July 2015 (“the July NOPAs”). The Commissioner opposed the making of the orders sought.

The Commissioner submitted that the dispute commenced by the July NOPAs was still in the conference stage of the disputes process and therefore the Authority had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the application. She further submitted that the Commissioner could not be compelled to issue a disclosure notice.

The interlocutory application was filed in the context of a challenge proceeding relating to earlier NOPAs issued by the disputant of 1 June 2015 (“the first NOPAs”). The first NOPAs proposed adjustments totalling $138.73 to various GST returns of the disputant. On 3 July 2015, the Commissioner accepted the proposed adjustments and advised the disputant that she was still reviewing the original returns. The Commissioner stated that the accepted adjustments would be reflected in any adjustments made when her review was completed.

On 10 July 2015, the disputant informed the Commissioner that it was disputing the full amount of the original returns and that the Commissioner was required to issue a Notice of Response (“NOR”).

On 22 July 2015, the Commissioner replied stating that the dispute commenced by the first NOPAs was at an end because she had accepted the proposed adjustments and consequently it was not necessary to issue a NOR.

The disputant issued the July NOPAs. The NOPAs issued on 22 July 2015 proposed to amend the refunds claimed to only the amounts accepted by the Commissioner in the first NOPAs. The NOPAs issued on 24 July 2015 stated that these NOPAs were issued in substitution for the NOPAs issued on 22 July 2015 which the disputant purported to withdraw. The 24 July 2015 NOPAs proposed to adjust the original returns to include both the refunds originally claimed and the purported adjustments accepted by the Commissioner.

The Commissioner issued a NOR to the 24 July 2015 NOPAs on 18 September 2015. This was rejected by the disputant on 21 September 2015. By Notice of Claim dated 25 September 2015, the disputant commenced proceedings in the Authority.

### Decision

**_Issue one_**

The first issue was what was the jurisdiction of the Authority to hear the application.

Under Part 8A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”) a disputant is able to challenge assessments and disputable decisions.

The tax positions advanced in the July NOPAs are part of a dispute which is still progressing through the disputes process under Part 4A of the TAA. Presently there is no assessment and nor is there any disputable decision. It is necessary for the disputes process to be completed before a challenge proceeding can be filed. The interlocutory application relates to the July NOPAs which are still subject to the disputes process, and the Authority held it does not have jurisdiction to hear the application.

**_Issue two_**

The second issue was whether the Authority could direct the Commissioner to issue a disclosure notice.

The disputant relied upon the District Court Rules 2014 relating to the hearing of interlocutory applications and in particular upon Rule 7.37, which provides that a Judge may make any interlocutory order or grant any interlocutory relief that the Judge thinks just. The disputant submitted that in the circumstances of this case it was just for the Authority to make an order compelling the Commissioner to issue a disclosure notice so that the dispute could be advanced.

Judge Sinclair found that the District Court Rules set out procedures to enable the effective administration of proceedings but did not confer any jurisdiction.

The disputant also referred to the Commissioner’s standard practice statement _11/06 Dispute Resolution Process commenced by a taxpayer_ (“SPS 11/06”) in support of its application, particularly noting paragraphs 248 and 250.

Judge Sinclair found that SPS 11/06 sets out what is done “generally” and “usually”. It was clear that there is no obligation on the Commissioner to follow this course and that there will be cases where the timeframe in SPS 11/06 was not followed. Importantly this statement was a guideline only.

No timeframe is specified in s 89M(1) of the TAA within which the disclosure notice has to be issued and the TRA did not have the power to direct that the Commissioner must issue one.

The Authority dismissed the disputant’s interlocutory application.

No merit in "slip rule" appeal

2012 case note - The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal by the appellants regarding rule 11.10 of the High Court rules – sealed judgments.

Case

NTH Douglas & Others v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

High Court Rules

### Summary

The Court of Appeal considered the appeal by the appellants from the High Court decision not to invoke rule 11.10 of the High Court rules had no merit and accordingly dismissed the appeal.

### Facts

This was an appeal against a judgment of Courtney J, which was delivered on 8 July 2011. In that judgment Courtney J had declined the appellants' application to invoke rule 11.10 of the High Court Rules to set aside judgments that had been sealed by the High Court against the appellants.

The parties in this proceeding have been engaged in litigation in a number of different courts and over a number of years. The litigation has concerned the validity of assessments made in respect of people who had participated in tax arrangements known as the Russell Template organised by their tax agent, Mr Russell. The Russell Template has been held by the Privy Council to be tax avoidance.

In a February 2009 judgment, Courtney J dealt with issues that remained following an earlier judicial review decision, her interim decisions on a number of appeals by way of cases stated from the Taxation Review Authority (TRA), and the unsuccessful appeals from those decisions (February 2009 judgment).

Courtney J rejected the appellants' submission that the matter ought to be remitted back to the TRA for consideration of further evidence and/or further issues and instead, with the exception of deductions permitted to corporate taxpayers for a consultancy fee charged by Mr Russell, confirmed the amended assessments that had been the subject of the original cases stated to the TRA.

Her Honour made a number of orders to give effect to that decision, including the order that "Judgment made against any of the individual taxpayers may only be sealed upon the filing and service of an affidavit annexing the case stated to the TRA for that taxpayer …".

The affidavits were sworn on various dates from January 2010 but were not filed and served until 14 September 2010.

The Registry sealed the orders on the same day, 14 September 2010, and before service of the affidavits was effected.

The appellants applied to the Court by memorandum of counsel, supported by an affidavit from Mr Russell, seeking orders that the existing judgments were not validly sealed and must not be acted upon by any party.

In a decision dated 8 July 2011, Courtney J accepted that the slip rule could be invoked to amend a Court order to give effect to the intention of the Court. However, her Honour rejected the appellants' submission that in the February 2009 judgment she intended the appellants would have the opportunity to respond to the affidavits filed by the Commissioner. Courtney J held it was perfectly clear from that decision, read as a whole, that there was no intention the appellants would have the right to respond and challenge the affidavits filed by the Commissioner for the purposes of obtaining the sealed judgments. As stated above, her Honour declined to make the orders sought.

### Decision

It was noted by the Court of Appeal that the issue in the appeal was the objective interpretation of the February 2009 judgment. The Court of Appeal considered that when the February 2009 judgment is considered as a whole and in context, its intent is clear, as is the purpose for requiring the respondent to file and serve the affidavits annexing the individual taxpayer's amended assessments.

The Court of Appeal was satisfied that it is clear there was no intention that the appellants would have the right to respond (and the Commissioner then reply) and that there would then be a further hearing to settle the judgment.

The clear intent of the February 2009 judgment was to finalise the long, drawn-out process of litigation. The Court of Appeal considered that it was for that purpose and to enable the sealed judgment to reflect the amended assessments, that the Commissioner was required to file and serve the affidavits annexing the full cases stated to the TRA.

The Court of Appeal considered that the requirement for service of the affidavits was effectively a courtesy and for the information of the appellants only.

The Court of Appeal found that Courtney J was also right to find failure to serve the affidavits prior to sealing the judgment could have made no difference to the appellants' position.

The appellants submitted the argument that the purpose of requiring the Commissioner to file the affidavits was to enable the appellants to consider their position and, as such, was a substitute process for referring the matter back to the TRA. The Court of Appeal considered that this argument ignored and was inconsistent with Courtney J's rejection of the appellants' request for the cases to be remitted back to the TRA.

Similarly, the Court of Appeal considered that the appellants' purported reliance on the fact the TRA reserved leave for the parties to apply with regard to any issues "not covered or consequential" did not assist them. The Court of Appeal considered that Courtney J must have been correct when her Honour noted in the February 2009 judgment that, despite that reservation, no matters had been raised by the appellants pursuant to it and that once the appellants had required the TRA to state a case for the High Court, the reservation of leave was superseded by the appeal.

The Court of Appeal rejected the submission that the appellants had in some way been prejudiced as a consequence of their inability to reply to the affidavits. The Court of Appeal said that if the appellants considered they would have a right to raise the matter again, they were wrong. The Court of Appeal reiterated that it was never intended that the appellants would have the opportunity to reply and concluded that there could be no prejudice.

The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal.

No place to hide overseas income
================================

**19 November 2019**

Inland Revenue says automatic exchange of information with other tax jurisdictions around the world is proving a potent tool in the fight against tax evasion.

IR’s International Revenue Strategy Manager, John Nash, says New Zealand is one of many jurisdictions committed to a global initiative led by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on the automatic exchange of financial account information.

“Using the Common Reporting Standard, all reporting financial institutions have to identify and collect information on accounts held by account holders who are foreign tax residents. In certain circumstances, that also includes entities that are controlled by foreign tax residents.

“New Zealand started this automatic exchange of information in September last year and we’ve received more than 1.5 million records on New Zealand tax residents from 74 jurisdictions.”

John Nash says Inland Revenue is now following up on the information received.

“We’ve been analysing the information against the information we hold in our systems.

“Where we see a mismatch between offshore income disclosed in tax returns and the data we now hold from our tax treaty partners, we’re reaching out to customers to give them an opportunity to provide explanations or submit a voluntary disclosure before we undertake more in-depth reviews and investigations.

“A major advantage in making a voluntary disclosure, rather than waiting for us to find any discrepancies through our investigative process, is that any penalty charged on any related tax shortfall may be significantly reduced. In some cases, this may be up to a 100% reduction.

“Failure to declare offshore income or make appropriate disclosures about international business activities is tax evasion. Coming forward now by way of voluntary disclosure is definitely the better option rather than being found out later.

“Our expectation is that the information we are receiving from overseas will continue to grow. Combined with improved analytics it will make it even easier for Inland Revenue to identify offshore tax evasion.

“Offshore is definitely no longer ‘off limits’ as far as tax compliance is concerned," John Nash says.

No special circumstances justifying appearance by tax agent and District Court debt recovery proceeding is not appropriate forum to dispute assessment
======================================================================================================================================================

2013 case note - no special circumstances justifying the appearance on their behalf of the appellant's tax agent in Court – s 109 Tax Administration Act 1994.

Case

Huston v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

District Courts Act 1947, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

There were no special circumstances justifying the appearance by the appellant's tax agent on the appellant's behalf in the District Court. The effect of section 109 and _Tannadyce Investments Limited v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ is that the District Court debt recovery proceeding is not the appropriate forum for assessment matters to be raised.

### Impact of Decision

This case is a further endorsement of the principles in the decision of _Tannadyce Investments Limited v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2011\] NZSC 158, \[2012\] 2 NZLR 153, namely that under section 109(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, no disputable decision may be disputed in a court or in any proceedings on any ground whatsoever except in objection proceedings under Part VIII or a challenge under Part VIIIA of the Act.

### Facts

This is an appeal against a judgment of the District Court on a claim by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") against the appellant for arrears of tax including some penalties and interest (_Inland Revenue Department v Huston_ DC Manukau CIV-2011-092-000596, 31 October 2012).

While Mrs Huston ("the appellant") did not appear in the District Court, the appellant's tax agent, Mr J G Russell, attended the District Court on her behalf. However, the Court recorded that Mr Russell had no right of audience before the Court.

The central issue sought to be raised on behalf of the appellant in the District Court was that there had been failure by the Commissioner to transfer funds from another taxpayer's account which, it was contended, would have been sufficient to clear the base tax liability.

The Court held that the matter was essentially a tax recovery case where the assessments were not in fact disputed at all and found that the appellant's notice of proposed adjustment ("NOPA") did not relate to a disputable decision. The Court considered that while the appellant may have requested that the tax debt be paid by the appellant's family trust, that in itself did not relieve her of her statutory obligation to pay tax debts when they become due. Accordingly, the District Court entered judgment against the appellant.

### Decision

The issues were considered separately by the High Court.

**_Whether the District Court erred in finding that Mr Russell was not entitled to appear on behalf of the appellant_**

Section 57 of the District Courts Act 1947 provides that except "under special circumstances" a party can only appear in person or through a barrister or solicitor.

The appellant advanced the argument that Mr Russell's detailed knowledge of her tax affairs and his expertise in the field constituted special circumstances for the purposes of section 57.

The Court found that these were not special circumstances and that if they were, it would justify granting leave to appear on behalf of a party in any case where the party engaged a specialised agent. Woodhouse J also considered that it would not have been possible on any proper basis for Mr Russell to not only appear effectively as the appellant's advocate, but also to give evidence on the appellant's behalf (which had been proposed). Further, the Court stated that the District Court's decision involved the exercise of a discretion and that there was no basis on appeal for interfering with the exercise of that discretion in this case.

Given the Court's decision on the right of audience issue, the High Court accordingly held that there was also no basis upon which evidence could have been called by Mr Russell or upon which Mr Russell could have cross-examined the Commissioner's witness.

#### _Whether the District Court erred in finding that there was no disputable decision_

The Court noted that there was unchallenged evidence in the affidavit of the Inland Revenue officer in respect of the assessed tax liability and that there was no challenge to the core assessments for the three years in question. This was expressly acknowledged by the appellant through Mr Russell. The Court considered that the dispute regarding the transfer of money from another taxpayer's account to pay the core tax of the appellant did not bear on the assessment (whether the argument was correct or not). In any event the Court found that it could not be a matter of enquiry in the District Court due to the effect of section 109 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA").

#### _Was the assessment proposed in the NOPA deemed to be correct?_

The appellant argued that as a consequence of a NOPA issued by Mr Russell for the appellant, there was no tax liability. In broad terms, this was because the NOPA proposed credit transfers from a family trust to eliminate the liability. The appellant submitted that as the NOPA was not challenged by the Commissioner in accordance with the statutory procedures under the TAA, the assessment proposed in the NOPA was deemed to be correct.

The High Court was satisfied that the District Court came to the correct conclusion on this point as fundamentally, the contentions on behalf of the appellant could not be a matter of enquiry in the District Court, noting that this was the effect of both section 109 of the TAA and the decision of the Supreme Court in _Tannadyce Investments Ltd v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2011\] NZSC 158, \[2012\] 2 NZLR 153.

In any event, the Court noted that there was a response by the Commissioner to the NOPA by way of letter dated 13 July 2007 advising that a credit in the account of M & J Huston Family Trust had already been used to pay GST arrears (and therefore no funds were available for the transfer).

The High Court also recognised that the current proceeding was issued around four years after the NOPA was issued and therefore could not on any reasonable basis be construed as the equivalent of a statutory response. The Court considered that the Commissioner's claim made it clear that the Commissioner was proceeding on an entirely different basis from that proposed in the NOPA and therefore, the proper response on behalf of the appellant would have been either to seek leave to invoke the challenge proceedings in the TAA out of time for special reasons, or to seek judicial review of the Commissioner's decision to proceed with the claim for tax arrears which the appellant contended were not owing.

The High Court concluded that it is clear that the District Court proceeding for recovery of claimed tax arrears could not be the forum for raising the matters sought by Mr Russell. Accordingly, the Court considered it unnecessary to consider further submissions for the Commissioner as to whether the NOPA gave rise to a disputable decision and that in any event, for reasons already noted, such consideration would appear not to be a matter for enquiry in the current proceeding, whether in the District Court or in the High Court as the Court on appeal. The Court was therefore satisfied that the District Court had made the correct decision and the appeal was dismissed.

No taxable activity
===================

2012 case note - taxpayer objected to its input credit claims being disallowed and being deregistered for GST - taxpayer did not prove it had a taxable activity.

Case

Taxpayer Ltd (in receivership) v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2012\] NZTRA 05

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985

### Summary

The taxpayer objected to its input credit claims being disallowed and being deregistered for goods and services tax (GST). The taxpayer did not prove it had a taxable activity and its other grounds of objection (sham, onus on the Commissioner, bad faith and malicious harassment) were all rejected.

### Impact of decision

This finalises an objection first made in August 1996.

### Facts

This proceeding originally involved two tax types: income tax and GST. The income tax issue was resolved in favour of Taxpayer Ltd ("the objector") thus leaving the GST issues to be determined.

On 1 October 1986, the objector registered for GST on a two-monthly return basis. Later, it changed to a six-monthly basis for periods ending 31 January and 31 July and described its taxable activity as unlicensed moteliers. On 20 February 1987, the objector was placed into receivership.

By October 1995, the objector was the principal in an agency and management agreement within a group of companies. The related agent was a fuel transporting company, F Limited.

In August 1996, the Commissioner reassessed the objector's GST returns (disallowing input tax credit claims) for the periods ended 31 July 1992 to 31 January 1996 inclusive and deregistered.

### Decision

**_Did the objector supply sufficient evidence in support of its GST registration?_**

To qualify for opting to register for GST, the objector must carry on a "taxable activity" or intend to do so from a specific date (section 51(3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985).

Evidence was given on behalf of the Commissioner at the hearing that the objector failed to show that it was carrying on a taxable activity. It was also noted that the objector stopped accounting for sales in 1990 and from then onwards the objector usually had large losses due to interest costs.

The receiver submitted that he was the receiver of the objector and was authorised to give evidence on its behalf. He argued that a taxable activity effectively continues to the end of a receivership. He submitted that as the receiver's costs are incurred in respect of the past taxable activity and the closing down thereof, such receiver's costs are a legitimate claim in respect of the period in which they are incurred.

When asked what the taxable activity of the objector was from October 1988, the receiver's response seemed to be that the objector's inputs were used by F Limited, which had become the principal with the objector as its agent. Accordingly, the objector's activity was purportedly hauling fuel.

Judge Barber found this to be inconsistent with the financial accounts for F Limited, which showed that in 1994 it had ceased receiving any cartage receipts or income. Further, his Honour found that:

1.  the chattels necessary to conduct the taxable activity, which the receiver purports to be continuing, were sold in 1989;
2.  there was an apparent and unexplained lack of sales after 1990, which lines up with the actual cessation of the taxable activity;
3.  no consulting fees to substantiate the objector's submission that an agency and a management agreement existed (between the objector and F Limited) prior to 1994; and
4.  there was no income from any business activities potentially capable of being a taxable activity until 1995.

The receiver's evidence showed that the inputs accounted for by the objector related solely to receivership costs and that the objector had to borrow money to meet those costs.

His Honour held that the taxable activity concluded in 1990 at the latest. He rejected the argument that a taxable activity can be assumed to exist from the mere fact of receivership and held that a taxable activity must still be conducted. The receiver may have entered into a new taxable activity in 1994 (although it is not clear) but any such new taxable activity cannot be part of the cessation of an earlier one.

_**Did the objector justify the failure to account for any output tax during the period it was registered for GST?**_ 

The receiver submitted that output taxes payable by the objector were returned by F Limited as the objector's agent.

Evidence for the Commissioner emphasised that it was unusual for a single GST activity to be split so that one taxpayer accounts for the output and another for the input tax.  
Judge Barber found that the objector had not returned any GST outputs since the date of registration and had only accounted for input credits creating refunds to it.

_**Other grounds of objection**_

The objector invoked a number of non-tax-specific grounds of objection:

1.  Sham must underlie the GST assessments and accordingly it formed a basis of objection.
2.  There is a threshold onus on the Commissioner to show any assessments are not manifestly arbitrary, or demonstrably unfair.
3.  The assessments are motivated by bad faith for the ulterior motive of destroying the receiver's business and that this is an illegal and proper purpose.
4.  The objector has suffered unfair and questionable conduct by the Commissioner as part of malicious harassment of the receiver.

Judge Barber rejected these grounds of objection and found that none of the contentions made by the objector were supported by evidence to establish its position on the balance of probabilities. Accordingly the objection was dismissed and the GST deregistration and reassessments (bar one due to time bar) were confirmed.

Judge Barber specifically noted that he imported into this decision the reasoning in \[2012\] NZTRA 04 issued on the same day, _mutatis mutandis_.

===================

2012 case note - taxpayer objected to its input credit claims being disallowed and being deregistered for GST – taxable activity, deregistration.

Case

Taxpayer Ltd (in receivership) v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2012\] NZTRA 04

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985

### Summary

The taxpayer objected to its input credit claims being disallowed and being deregistered for goods and services tax (GST). The taxpayer did not prove it had a taxable activity and its other grounds of objection (sham, onus on the Commissioner, bad faith and malicious harassment) were all rejected.

### Impact of decision

This finalises an objection first made in August 1996.

### Facts

This proceeding originally involved two tax types, income tax and GST. The income tax issue was resolved in favour of Taxpayer Limited ("the objector") thus leaving the GST issues to be determined.

This case is very similar to the \[2012\] NZTRA 05 decision with the slight variation that the objector in this case is not in receivership and did not enter into the arrangement involving an agency and management agreement. The judgments were issued on the same day, _mutatis mutandis_. The evidence of the parties and Judge Barber's reasoning were imported from the other case.

The objector was incorporated on 29 June 1992 and was registered for GST on 11 June 1992 on a six-monthly return basis and on a payment basis. It described its taxable activity as "financial asset broking service" and remains registered on the New Zealand Companies Office Register. It is neither in receivership nor liquidation.

In August 1996, the objector was reassessed for the GST periods ended 31 March 1993 to 31 March 1996 inclusive and was deregistered.

### Decision

**_Did the objector supply sufficient evidence in support of its GST registration?_**

To qualify for opting to register for GST, the objector must carry on a "taxable activity" or intend to do so from a specific date (section 51(3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985).

It was submitted by the objector's representative that the objector had a taxable activity in respect of transactions which involved trading in shares and securities and was also involved in transactions which earned fees for financial services and interest.

Evidence was given on behalf of the Commissioner at the hearing that the objector failed to show that it was carrying on a taxable activity. In particular, it was noted that there was correspondence between the objector's tax agent and the Commissioner requesting records (particularly in relation to the 31 March 1996 return period) but no documents or other evidence were supplied to demonstrate that the GST registration of the objector was correct and should be maintained.

Judge Barber found that the objector failed to return any taxable supplies for four years and agreed with the Commissioner that the objector provided no evidence to support its contention that its financial asset broking service is a GST taxable activity.

**_Did the objector justify the failure to account for any output tax during the period it was registered for GST?_** 

The objector's representative submitted that the reason why the objector did not return output taxes was because:

*   ... there had been no transactions so far that carried out an output tax liability. However there is a possibility that there will be transactions from time to time that will carry an output tax liability and if and when such occurs then output tax will become payable.

Furthermore, the objector's representative explained that the GST transactions were, in a sense, transactions between various group entities and that, effectively, there would be no loss to the revenue because another group entity returned the output tax while the present objector claimed the inputs. He regarded the overall effect as neutral.

A witness for the Commissioner emphasised the correspondence between the Commissioner and the objector's tax agent, in particular the letter issued on 24 July 1996, which outlined that the objector had returned no outputs since registration in 1992 and that if no substantive evidence or information was provided within 10 days, the Commissioner would cancel the objector's registration and seek to recover input tax refunds paid to the objector.

The objector's representative did not dispute this point, but rather complained (via a letter dated 8 August 1996) of the time frame to provide the requested information and raised questions regarding the Commissioner's actions.

No documents or other evidence were supplied by the objector to demonstrate that the GST registration of the objector was correct and should be maintained.

On the evidence available, Judge Barber found that, over material times, the objector failed to account for output tax and that it was unclear as to what transactions the claimed inputs related to.

**_Other grounds of objection_**

Judge Barber found that the Track C objection by the objector's representative was not sustainable because it was not part of the original objection and in any event it was irrelevant because it was not applied by the Commissioner to the GST.

The objector also invoked a number of non-tax-specific grounds of objection:

1.  There is a threshold onus on the Commissioner to show any assessments are not manifestly arbitrary, or demonstrably unfair.
2.  The assessments were motivated by bad faith for the ulterior motive of destroying the business of the objector's tax agent and that this is an illegal and proper purpose.
3.  The objector suffered unfair and questionable conduct by the Commissioner as part of malicious harassment of the objector's tax agent.
4.  The Commissioner cannot backdate deregistration.
5.  The objector's GST registration was investigated earlier and cannot be revisited.
6.  The time bar applies.

Judge Barber rejected these grounds of objection, found that none of the contentions made by the objector were supported by evidence to establish its position and such evidence as is available supports the Commissioner. Judge Barber also found that the other grounds of objection are ill founded and inapplicable.

Accordingly the objection was dismissed and the GST deregistration and reassessments were confirmed.

No tenable cause of action
==========================

2005 case note - disputant's notice of claim struck out as it disclosed no tenable course of action - interlocutory application, supply, GST Invoices.

Case

TRA No 147/04, Decision No 13/2005

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act

### Summary

The Disputant's Notice of Claim was struck out as it disclosed no tenable course of action.

### Facts

This was an application by the Commissioner to have the Disputant's Notice of Claim struck out or in the alternative for summary judgment against the Disputants.

The Disputants (14 in total) had each entered into an agreement for the purchase of an apartment in respect of which they claimed GST input credits on the deposit paid in the GST period ended 31 December 2001.

Prior to claiming the input credit the contracts for the purchase of the apartments were cancelled.

The Disputants never held a tax invoice in respect of the GST input credits claimed.

The Commissioner refused to invoke section 24(6) of the GST Act to determine that tax invoices were not required on the inputs claimed.  This decision was never challenged by the Disputants in a Notice of Proposed Adjustment.

In October 2004 the Commissioner issued notices of assessment to each of the Disputants disallowing the input credits claimed.

On 16 December 2004 the Disputants filed a Notice of Claim challenging those assessments, on the following grounds.

1.  There was no valid assessment
2.  The supplies the subject of the proceedings had not been cancelled
3.  The Commissioner had failed to require the vendor to produce tax invoices
4.  The Commissioner has "_tacitly or implicitly agreed with the vendor that it need not produce a tax invoice_...."
5.  The Commissioner and the Authority have the power to waive the requirement for the production of a tax invoice
6.  Section 25 of the GST Act does not apply.

### Decision

His Honour decided to grant the Commissioner's strike-out application.  In doing so His Honour decided it was unnecessary and would be unhelpful to deal with what he called the Commissioner's novel application for summary judgment.

In considering the strike-out application His Honour rejected the submission of the Disputants that a Notice of Claim can only be struck out for "procedural reasons".  His Honour noted that this was not supported by authority and was contrary to many cases in which Notices of Claim had been struck out where there had been no tenable cause of action or were otherwise vexatious or frivolous.

In granting the strike-out application His Honour stated it was plain that the contracts were cancelled before the Disputants made their input claims and that from the time of cancellation the Disputants were not entitled to any input credit.  His Honour went on to state that had an input credit been paid the purchaser would have been required to immediately refund it to the Commissioner pursuant to section 25 of the GST Act.

In regards to the Disputants submission that there had been no lawful assessments issued by the Commissioner His Honour stated that such a submission was simply contrary to the facts.

His Honour then dealt with the Disputants submission that the Commissioner's refusal to invoke section 24(6) (to not require a tax invoice) validated the cause of action.  His Honour rejected this proposition and accepted that on the facts of this case (where the input credit would have been immediately refundable) the Commissioner's decision not to invoke section 24(6) was the correct one.

His Honour concluded that the Commissioner had demonstrated that the Disputants had no tenable cause of action and because the Notice of Claim was not capable of amendment it would therefore be struck out.

Non-party inspection of court records and documents
===================================================

2009 case note – High Court granted an application by a non-party to search, inspect and copy statements and transcripts of evidence given by witnesses.

Case

BNZ Investments Ltd & Ors v the Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

High Court Rules

### Summary

The High Court granted an application by a non-party to search, inspect and copy statements and transcripts of evidence given by witnesses in the BNZ structured finance case.

### Impact of decision

Non-parties will have greater access to search, inspect and copy Court documents.

### Facts

On 24 September 2009, Maddocks, an Australian law firm, applied to the High Court under High Court Rule 3.13 to search, inspect and copy statements and transcripts of evidence of eight expert witnesses, forming part of the court file, in the BNZ "structured finance" case. Some of the witnesses had been called by BNZ and some by the Commissioner.  

In support of its application, Maddocks gave the reason that it was undertaking research in respect of a potential case in Australia and while the issues in that case were not identical to those in the BNZ case some similar issues may arise.

The Commissioner did not oppose the application. BNZ indicated that it would abide by the decision of the Court but did not regard Maddocks' reason as particularly compelling.

### Decision

His Honour, Justice Wild, noted that the High Court (Access to Court Documents) Amendment Rules 2009 came into force on 12 June 2009. The amendment to the High Court Rules concerning access to Court documents was precipitated by the Law Commission's June 2006 Report "Access to Court Records", which recommended open justice and freedom of information be cornerstones of future rules on access to Court records. 

Under the new rules Maddocks, a third-party, did not have eligibility to obtain copies of the witness statements: rules 3.7 to 3.9. It was required to seek the Court's permission: rule 3.13. Under rule 3.16 the Court must consider the reasons for an application to access Court documents and take into account certain prescribed matters.

His Honour considered that under the new rules the threshold for a non-party to obtain access to Court documents is now considerably lower for two reasons.

Firstly, the two-step test enunciated in the Court of Appeal decision in_McCully v Whangamata Marina Society Inc_ \[2007\] 1 NZLR 185, has been replaced by a single balancing test. Under the two-step McCully test, an applicant had to first satisfy the Court that he or she had a genuine and proper interest in accessing the Court documents and once made out, the Court had to then have regard to whether other considerations may come into play.

Secondly, the substance of the test has shifted from the nature of the applicant's interest to the nature of the information requested, with the principles of open justice and freedom of information creating an effective presumption of disclosure.

His Honour reviewed the approaches taken in the United Kingdom and Australia and concluded that in both jurisdictions open justice is the paramount consideration in determining access to Court files. His Honour noted that an unintended consequence, although one accepted by the Courts, of making open justice a paramount consideration, instead of focusing on the interest of the applicant, is that it allows applicants acting in their own personal interest, rather than in the public interest, to ride on the coat-tails of "open justice".;

His Honour granted the application. He concluded that while the reason for Maddocks' application was not compelling, because it was entirely one of self-interest, the imperatives of open justice and freedom of information prevail.

Ngā kaikirimana kainoho-tāwāhi Non-resident contractors
=======================================================

A non-resident contractor is a non-resident person, company or entity contracted to provide services, the use of another person’s services, or the use of equipment in New Zealand.

This page is for non-resident contractors who are self-employed.

| Point | About non-resident contractors |
| --- | --- |
| 1   | Employees, non-resident entertainers and sportspeople are not non-resident contractors. |
| 2   | If the contractor provides their services from outside New Zealand and does not have any presence in New Zealand, they are not a non-resident contractor. |
| 3   | Payments made to the non-resident contractor are called schedular payments. Payers must generally deduct tax from these payments and pay it to us on behalf of the contractor. |
| 4   | Some non-resident contractors are exempt from withholding tax or may apply for a tailored rate. |
| 5   | Any tax deducted is a credit if the non-resident contractor needs to file a tax return in New Zealand. |
| 6   | Non-resident contractors who employ staff or subcontractors may have additional obligations in respect of the payments they make. See the Employer's guide - IR335 for more information about these obligations. |

  

[Employer's guide IR335 Nov 2024 (PDF 1MB) Download guide](/-/media/project/ir/home/documents/forms-and-guides/ir300---ir399/ir335/ir335-2024-nov.pdf?modified=20241107235439&modified=20241107235439)

Non-resident contractors with an annual turnover above $60,000 may need to register for GST.

[Registering for GST](/gst/registering-for-gst)

Withholding tax on payments to non-resident contractors
-------------------------------------------------------

Unless there is an exemption, payers must deduct tax on payments made to non-resident contractors.

The rate is usually determined by the type of work performed and whether the contractor has provided a completed IR330C Tax rate notification for contractors. The default rate is currently 15%.

Higher rates are used if the form is not complete. These are called 'no-notification' rates.

[Tax rate notification for contractors IR330C 2019 (PDF 94KB) Download form](/-/media/project/ir/home/documents/forms-and-guides/ir300---ir399/ir330c/ir330c-2019.pdf?modified=20240216012127&modified=20240216012127)

  
You will need an IRD number unless you have full tax relief under a treaty between New Zealand and your country of tax residence.

[IRD numbers for individuals](/managing-my-tax/ird-numbers/ird-numbers-for-individuals)

Exemptions from withholding tax
-------------------------------

The payer does not have to withhold tax in the following situations.

*   You have a certificate of exemption.
*   You meet the 92-day rule under a double tax agreement.
*   The payments you receive are below a $15,000 threshold.

You may still need to file a tax return and pay tax on the payments received despite being exempt from withholding tax.

### Certificate of exemption

You can apply for a certificate of exemption from withholding payments in the following situations.

*   A double tax agreement between New Zealand and your country of tax residence provides an exemption from income tax.
*   You provide a bond or other security to ensure you pay any tax you need to.
*   You've met all your obligations in the last 2 years and will continue to do so.

[Double tax agreements (DTAs)](/international-tax/double-tax-agreements)

### A nominated taxpayer can act on your behalf

A non-resident contractor can have a resident nominated taxpayer act on their behalf to help make the process of meeting non-resident contractor employment obligations much easier.

An non-resident contractor can establish an agreement with an entity that is resident.

The resident entity that has been elected to be the nominated taxpayer advises Inland Revenue in writing of the agreement and provides the name and details of both parties involved. 

The nominated taxpayer will be responsible for filing for both parties included in the agreement. All parties will be joint and severally liable for the tax payable. 

### What the nominated taxpayer needs to do 

The resident nominated taxpayer needs to tell us they are taking over the agreed non-resident contractor’s obligations and have the authority to act for them.

[Let someone act on your behalf](/managing-my-tax/getting-someone-to-act-on-my-behalf/nominated-person/let-someone-act-on-your-behalf)

The resident nominated taxpayer also needs to tell us that they agree to provide compliance history to get an NRCT exemption for the non-resident contractor.

We need a separate NRCT exemption for each contractor. 

### 92-day rule

You do not have to apply for a certificate of exemption from withholding tax if you come from a country that has a DTA with New Zealand and you're eligible for total New Zealand tax relief under that agreement. You must also be present in New Zealand for a total of 92 or fewer days in any 12-month period.

### Payments under $15,000

You also do not have to apply for a certificate of exemption if the total contract payments you receive as a non-resident contractor from all your payers is $15,000 or less in a 12-month period. 

Tailored tax rate certificate
-----------------------------

Non-resident contractors can apply for a tailored tax rate which is higher or lower than would otherwise apply. This might, for example, be relevant when the contractor has other income or losses.

Te tāpae mōhiohio whakawhiwhi mahi a ngā kaituku mahi kainoho-tāwāhi Non-resident employers filing employment information
=========================================================================================================================

If you are a non-resident employer with employees working in New Zealand, you will need to register as an employer with Inland Revenue if: 

*   you have a sufficient presence in New Zealand, or
*   you provide your employees with non-cash benefits or make contributions to their superannuation scheme or fund (unless you agree with the employee that they are responsible – this must be documented) 

You will need to register before you can file your Employment information – IR348.

[Non-resident employers’ obligations to deduct PAYE, FBT and ESCT in cross-border employment situations operational statement](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/operational-statements/2021/os-21-04)

You may need to set up a [shadow payroll](/api/glossary/item?id={900C721C-E780-4B45-AFE8-3A5600E30396})
 before you can file employment information. 

When to file your employer information
--------------------------------------

### Filing on a payday basis

You need to file the employment information within 2 working days of the relevant day if filing electronically, or within 10 working days if filing by paper.

### Employers who use a shadow payroll

You can file according to the payday or twice monthly. The payday is deemed to be 20 days after the payment is made, for example, if the payment is made on 1 November, the payday is 21 November and the due dates would be as follows: 

*   Paper filer (per payday) - 10 working days from 21 November
*   Paper filer (twice monthly) - 10 working days from the end of the month as the payday falls into the 16 November - end of the month period
*   Electronic filer (per payday) – 2 working days from 21 November
*   Electronic filer (twice monthly) – 2 working days from the end of the month as the payday falls into the 16 November- end of the month period 

Pay the deductions to us
------------------------

You need to pay the PAYE and other taxes you deducted from the employee to us. How often you need to pay depends on your gross annual PAYE deductions, including employer superannuation contribution tax deductions (ESCT).

### Gross annual PAYE $500,000 or more

If your gross annual PAYE is $500,000 or more you need to pay us twice a month. If the relevant day is between the 1st and 15th of the month, payment is due by the 20th of the same month. If it is between 16th and the end of the month, payment is due by the 5th of the following month.

### 60-day grace period

If you have not met any tax obligations, you will have a 60-day grace period so that you can meet or fix your PAYE, FBT and ESCT obligations. This grace period applies if you have taken reasonable measures to manage your employment-related tax obligations, and the employee is present in New Zealand for a period during which 1 of the following applies. They: 

*   went over a threshold for exemption under section CW 19 of the Income Tax Act.
*   went over a threshold for exemption under a relevant double taxation agreement.
*   received an unexpected PAYE income payment.  

The 60-day grace period runs from the earlier of:

*   the date the employee went over a threshold or received a payment
*   the date you could reasonably see that the employee would go over a threshold or receive a payment. 

During the 60-day grace period you must make a reasonable effort to make or fix the underpayment of tax.  

### Payers of non-resident contractors: 60-day grace period for late payments of tax

If you're paying a non-resident contractor to work in New Zealand, you must deduct tax from the payments and pay it to us ─ unless an exemption applies.  

[Payers of non-resident contractors 60-day grace period](/employing-staff/payday-filing/non-standard-filing-of-employment-information/payers-of-non-resident-contractors-60-day-grace-period)

### PAYE special arrangements

From 1 April 2024, anyone who employs cross-border workers can apply to us for an annual PAYE agreement. This special arrangement means that PAYE tax can be paid by May 31 after the end of that tax year, instead of after each payday.    
  
To get an annual PAYE agreement as an employer, you need to show us why your special circumstances qualify you to pay PAYE once a year.   
  
Examples of special circumstances could include:

*   [short-term international business travellers](/api/glossary/item?id={F3C26568-3CE0-4156-87D3-A5E42C8F8222})
    
*   [trailing payments](/api/glossary/item?id={8DA4023A-37BD-4615-85B4-078C3EA36C6A})
     such as fringe benefit tax (FBT) benefits or bonus/share payments made to employees who have left New Zealand already. 

Non-resident employers would be required to set up a shadow payroll before they can file an employment information and make payment.    
  
You can make a request through myIR by sending us a message, or by calling us. We will need: 

*   the name and IRD number of the employer 
*   a description of the class of employees that the arrangement relates to
*   the special circumstances relating to the arrangement. 

### Fringe benefit tax (FBT)  

When you pay an employee for services provided in New Zealand and the employee no longer lives or works in New Zealand, there should not be an FBT liability for fringe benefits provided overseas, unless the fringe benefits relate to the time spent working in New Zealand.  

### Foreign super scheme

There is some flexibility around taxing employer contributions to foreign super schemes where those contributions are made for the benefit of a cross-border employee.  

#### How to tax contributions to foreign super schemes 

Contributions to a foreign super scheme usually come under FBT. However, an employer may choose to apply Employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) to cash contributions. This includes contributions to sickness, accident, or death benefit funds in that scheme. Using ESCT means the employer does not have to split the contributions before taxing them.   
  
An employee may also agree that the employer can tax the employer’s superannuation cash contribution as salary or wages using the PAYE rules.

Sarah is an employee of a non-resident company. She’s seconded to New Zealand for 3 months to work for another company. She's paid by her non-resident employer. Sarah expects to go back to her home country before the 92-day exemption ends. However, on day 80, she gets a chance to stay in NZ for another 2 months and learn new skills. Sarah will now go over the 92-day exemption.    
  
Sarah’s employer has 60 days from the day they know Sarah will go over the 92-days (day 80) to meet their obligations before any penalties are applied.

Ngā kaiwhakangahau kainoho-tāwāhi me ngā tāngata hākinakina Non-resident entertainers and sportspeople
======================================================================================================

Special tax rules apply for non-resident entertainers, which includes sportspeople. You may need to consider whether a double tax agreement (DTA) affects how you’re taxed.

Some payments mainly connected with cultural programmes are exempt.

Qualifying as a non-resident entertainer
----------------------------------------

You are a non-resident entertainer if you:

*   are a non-resident taxpayer
*   perform in public or in front of a camera
*   perform in a sporting event or game.

Common examples of non-resident entertainers are:

*   actors, musicians, singers and dancers
*   lecturers and speakers
*   sportspeople.

If you are a crew member who works behind the scenes, you are a non-resident contractor or employee rather than an entertainer.

Tax summary
-----------

The payments you receive are likely to have a withholding tax of 20% deducted by the payer. This is a full and final tax. You do not need to file a tax return in New Zealand if you have no other income from the country but may choose to do so to claim expenses.

You are not entitled to the exemption for personal or professional services provided during a visit of 92 days or less.

You still need to pay tax on payments that are:

*   made to someone else on your behalf
*   made to you from outside New Zealand.

If tax is not deducted, you're liable for this.

A DTA may affect how you're taxed. For example, payments are exempt in New Zealand if you’re a US resident and they’re not more than US$10,000.

[Double tax agreements (DTAs)](/international-tax/double-tax-agreements)
 

  

You need to get an IRD number if you:

*   are paying your tax yourself
*   want to claim expenses
*   are a payer who pays non-resident entertainers or sportspeople.

You may need to register for goods and services tax if you supply goods or services in New Zealand and the value is above $60,000.

Exemptions
----------

Income a non-resident entertainer receives for a performance in New Zealand is exempt in the following situations.

*   You perform under a cultural programme of, or wholly or partially sponsored by the New Zealand government or an overseas government.
*   You perform as part of a programme of a foreign non-profit organisation that promotes a cultural activity.
*   You represent the national body that administers the game or sport in your home country.

The income is also exempt if the payments are received by the person who provides the services of the non-resident entertainer and that person is:

*   the entertainer's employer
*   a company of which the entertainer is an officer
*   a firm of which the entertainer is a principal.

The exemptions are explained in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 7 (August 2019) from page 39, IS 19/03 Income tax – exempt income of non-resident entertainers.

[Remedial items](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-gst-and-remedial-matters-act-2010/remedial-items "Remedial items")

Non-resident seasonal workers
=============================

Amendments to legislation relating to non-resident seasonal workers including a new personal tax rate of 10.5% which applies from 1 Apr 2011.

_Section YA 1, and schedule 2, part A, clause 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007; section 33A of the Tax Administration Act 1994_

As a result of recent changes to personal tax rates, the tax rate that applies to non-resident seasonal workers has been reduced from 15% to 10.5%. In addition, a number of changes have been made to the tax legislation to clarify that non-resident seasonal workers are not required to file a tax return at the end of the year but may do so if they choose to. The measures were introduced by Supplementary Order Paper No. 187 during the passage of the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Bill.

### Background

The Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) scheme was introduced in April 2007. The RSE scheme allows for the temporary entry of overseas workers to work in the horticulture and viticulture industries in New Zealand. The tax legislation was amended in 2009 and now defines a worker under the RSE scheme to be a "non-resident seasonal worker". The rate of tax that previously applied to non-resident seasonal workers that elected the NSW (non-resident seasonal worker) tax code was a flat rate of 15%. The need to review the rate of tax arose as a result of the recent changes to the personal tax rates, particularly from Budget 2010.

### Key features

The changes that have been made to the tax rules for workers under the RSE scheme are:

*   a change to the flat rate of withholding tax that applies to workers under the RSE scheme;
*   changes to correct the current filing requirements for workers under the RSE scheme; and
*   a change to the commencement date of the definition of "non-resident seasonal worker".

### Detailed analysis

#### _Change of rate_

After analysing data from the relevant industry a policy decision has been made for the rate of tax that applies to non-resident seasonal workers that elect the NSW tax code to be reduced from 15% to 10.5%.

From 1 October 2010, the personal tax rate for workers earning up to $14,000 per annum was reduced to 10.5%. The large majority of non-resident seasonal workers have an annual New Zealand income of less than $14,000, therefore a withholding rate of 10.5% is appropriate. It would be more accurate for the new rate to apply from 1 October 2010 (the date that the personal tax rates changed) however, due to compliance costs and the small numbers of workers and wages involved, it was decided that the best date for the new rate to apply from would be 1 April 2011.

#### _Filing requirements_

There has been no change in policy regarding the filing requirements for non-resident seasonal workers. These workers may still file a return at the end of the year but are not required to. Changes have been made to section 33A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to clarify this policy intent.

As the rate that applies to non-resident seasonal workers is now equal to the lowest personal tax rate, from the 2011-12 tax year there will no longer be any benefit to the workers in filing a tax return. That is, due to them having tax withheld at the lowest rate, it will no longer be possible for them to have tax over-withheld during the year. It should be noted that workers may face a tax liability if they choose to file a tax return at the end of the year and have annual New Zealand income of more than $14,001.

#### _"Non-resident seasonal worker" definition_

The commencement date of the definition of non-resident seasonal worker has been changed from 6 October 2009 to 1 April 2008. This change ensures the definition is in force at the earliest date the tax provisions applying to non-resident seasonal workers and the RSE scheme apply from.

### Application dates

There are various application dates for the above changes. The new 10.5% rate of tax will apply from 1 April 2011. The changes correcting the filing requirements apply from the date that they were originally intended to apply from.

[Penalties](/new-legislation/act-articles/2009-34/other-policy-matters/penalties "Penalties")

Not paying employer monthly schedule (EMS) amount penalty
=========================================================

2009 amendments to the EMS penalty which is imposed when an employer files an employer monthly schedule but does not pay some or all of the tax it should.

_**Sections 141ED(3)(ab), (5B) and (5C) of the Tax Administration Act 1994**_

A number of minor amendments have been made to the EMS penalty to ensure that the rules reflect the policy intent. The changes are:

*   A late payment penalty is no longer imposed on the EMS penalty.
*   Employers wishing to enter an instalment arrangement will not be subject to the EMS penalty when they are negotiating an arrangement.
*   If the amount on the EMS changes, the EMS penalty is calculated using the lesser of the corrected figure and the unpaid amount.
*   The legislation now sets out a rule for the application of a payment when an EMS penalty has been imposed.
*   The EMS penalty is not assessed in the same way as the tax to which it relates and the Commissioner does not have to give a notice of assessment to the taxpayer.

### Background

An EMS penalty is imposed when an employer files an employer monthly schedule but does not pay some or all of the tax it should. The penalty was introduced in 2008 and is aimed at encouraging employers to comply by providing an incentive for them to pay tax associated with employer monthly schedules on time. It is imposed each month if the tax is not paid or the employer has not entered an instalment arrangement.

### Key features

##### **_Imposition of the late payment penalty on the EMS penalty_**

A late payment penalty is imposed when taxpayers do not pay their tax, and any previous penalties imposed, on time. It too is imposed each month the amount remains unpaid. Before the amendment, the EMS penalty was also subject to the late payment penalty.

To ensure that penalties do not accumulate too quickly, and are not disproportionate to the non-payment amount, the EMS penalty is no longer subject to the late payment penalty.

The amount of tax not paid will still be subject to late payment penalties as well as use-of-money interest.

##### _Negotiation periods_

Currently, an employer who files an employer monthly schedule but does not pay the tax may be liable to an EMS penalty. Before the penalty is imposed taxpayers are warned that if they do not pay or enter an instalment arrangement a penalty will be imposed in the following month.

To encourage employers to enter instalment arrangements, under the new amendment the EMS penalty will not be imposed when an employer is negotiating an instalment arrangement. If an instalment arrangement is not entered into or payment is not made, the employer will be warned and the EMS penalty will then be imposed.

##### _Corrected amounts_

The EMS penalty was previously imposed on the lesser of the unpaid amount and the amount shown on the EMS when it is filed. Following the amendment, if the employer corrects the schedule, the penalty will be calculated on the lesser of the corrected amount and the unpaid amount.

##### _Ordering rule for payment_

Under the new rule, if an EMS penalty has been imposed and a payment is then made, the payment is first applied to the EMS penalty and then to the core tax owing. If the payment were not applied to the penalty first, there would be an incentive for taxpayers to pay the core tax and allow the penalty to remain outstanding with the risk of the penalty never being paid.

Similar rules apply for late payment penalties and use-of-money interest.

##### _Assessment of the EMS penalty_

Under section 94A(2), a shortfall penalty is assessed in the same way as the tax to which it relates, and under section 111, the Commissioner must give a notice of assessment to the taxpayer. The EMS penalty is a shortfall penalty. However, unlike other shortfall penalties it is imposed each month that an EMS amount is not paid and is therefore more like a late payment penalty.

Before an EMS penalty is applied, the employer is warned. When the penalty is applied, the employer receives another letter and a statement setting out the penalty and the core tax. Therefore it is not necessary to send a separate notice of assessment. Section 94A has been amended to provide that the EMS penalty is not assessed in the same way as the tax to which it relates and the Commissioner does not give a notice of assessment to the taxpayer. This means that the EMS penalty and the late payment penalty are imposed in the same way.

### Application date

The amendments apply to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2008.

Note 1 - Basis of preparation (2023)
====================================

Show all

Reporting entity

Te tari Taake Inland Revenue is a government department as defined by section 2 of the Public Finance Act 1989 and is domiciled and operates in New Zealand. 

The relevant legislations governing Inland Revenue’s operations include the Public Finance Act 1989, and the Public Service Act 2020. 

Inland Revenue is a wholly owned entity of the Crown, whose primary objective is to provide services to the public rather than to make a financial return. Accordingly, Inland Revenue has designated itself as a Public Benefit Entity (PBE) for financial reporting purposes.

Reporting period

The reporting period for these financial statements is for the year ended 30 June 2023. The unaudited forecast financial statements are for the year ending 30 June 2024.

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue, as Chief Executive, authorised these financial statements on 29 September 2023.

Statement of compliance

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Act 1989, which includes the requirement to comply with New Zealand generally accepted accounting practice (NZ GAAP), and Te Tai Ōhanga the Treasury Instructions. 

Inland Revenue has applied the Tier 1 Public Benefit Entity International Public Sector Accounting Standards (PBE IPSAS) in preparing the 30 June 2023 financial statements.

Basis of preparation

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, and the accounting policies set out below and in the notes to the financial statements have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements.

These financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, unless otherwise stated. The accrual basis of accounting has been used.

Functional and presentation currency

These financial statements are presented in New Zealand dollars, and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars ($000). The functional currency of Inland Revenue is New Zealand dollars.

Estimations and judgements

In preparing these financial statements, judgements, estimates and assumptions have been made concerning the future. 

These judgements, estimates and their associated assumptions may differ from the subsequent actual results. Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on experience, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and other factors. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

The main estimates and judgements that are relevant to Inland Revenue’s financial statements are disclosed in note 9 (Property, plant and equipment), note 10 (Intangible assets), note 11 (Debtors and prepayments), note 13 (Employee entitlements) and note 14 (Other liabilities). 

Accounting policies

Significant accounting policies are included in the notes to which they relate. Significant accounting policies that do not relate to a specific note and that materially affect the measurement of financial results, the financial position and/or output statements within the Section on Our Performance, are outlined below.

New standards adopted

PBE FRS 48 Service Performance Reporting replaces the service performance reporting requirements of PBE IPSAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements. Inland Revenue has now applied

PBE FRS 48 with effect on its statement of performance information. This is disclosed here. 

[Disclosure of judgements](/about-us/publications/annual-corporate-reports/annual-report/annual-report-2023/our-performance/disclosure-of-judgements)

We have adopted PBE IPSAS 41 Financial Instruments this year. This standard supersedes the interim Standard PBE IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with similar requirements. As a consequence, there is no significant change in accounting policy. 

Goods and services tax

All amounts in the financial statements, appropriation statements and output statements are exclusive of goods and services tax (GST), except for debtor Crown, net debtors and accounts payable, which are stated on a GST-inclusive basis. Where GST is not recoverable as input tax, it is recognised as part of the related asset or expense.

The net amount of GST owing or due at balance date, being the difference between output GST and input GST, is included in creditors and other payables in the Statement of Financial Position.

Commitments and contingencies are disclosed exclusive of GST.

Income tax

Government departments are exempt from income tax as public service agencies. No charge for income tax has been provided for.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash in transit and funds held in the bank accounts. All cash held in bank accounts is held in on-demand accounts and no interest is payable to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue is only permitted to spend its cash and cash equivalents within the amount, scope and period of its Vote Revenue appropriations.

Foreign currency transactions

Inland Revenue’s activities expose it to the risks of changes in foreign exchange rates. Foreign currency transactions (including those for which forward exchange contracts are held) are translated into New Zealand dollars using the spot exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.

Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised in the financial results.

Comparatives

When the presentation or classification of items in the financial statements change, comparative figures for prior periods are re-stated to ensure consistency with the current period, unless it is impractical to do so. The presentation of some information has changed from the previous period, with prior period balances re-classified to be comparable with current year figures.

Cost allocations

Inland Revenue allocates costs directly to an appropriation where a line of sight exists between an appropriation and a cost centre or a project. Inland Revenue utilises indirect allocation where a cost centre or a project cannot be attributed directly to an appropriation. Indirect allocation rates are derived from the weighting of apportioned direct costs from relevant cost drivers to appropriations.

Budget and forecast figures

The budget, revised budget and forecast figures have been prepared in accordance with NZ GAAP, using accounting policies that are consistent with those adopted in preparing these financial statements.

The budget and forecast figures are not subject to audit.

The budget figures for 2022–23 are those included in The Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the Year Ending 30 June 2023.

The revised budget figures for 2022–23 (refer to the Statement of Departmental Budgeted and Actual Expenses and Capital Expenditure Incurred Against Appropriations) are those included in The Supplementary Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the Year Ending 30 June 2023.

[Statement of Non-Departmental Budgeted and Actual Expenditure Incurred Against Appropriations](/about-us/publications/annual-corporate-reports/annual-report/annual-report-2023/our-performance/appropriation-statements/statement-of-non-departmental-budgeted-and-actual-expenditure-incurred-against-appropriations)

Any significant changes to the forecast included in the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Update 2023 are provided in the footnotes to the Statement of Non-Departmental Budgeted and Actual Expenditure Incurred Against Appropriations.

The forecast financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Act 1989 to communicate forecast financial information for accountability purposes. They are compliant with PBE Financial Reporting Standard 42 Prospective Financial Statements.

Forecast policies

The forecasts have been compiled on the basis of existing government policies and ministerial expectations at the time the statements were finalised. The Commissioner, in his role as Chief Executive of Inland Revenue, is responsible for the forecast financial statements including the appropriateness of the assumptions underlying them and all other required disclosures. The Commissioner approved the forecast financial statements for issue on 18 April 2023. Although Inland Revenue regularly updates its forecasts, it will not publish updated forecast financial statements for the year ending 30 June 2024.

The main assumptions are as follows:

*   Inland Revenue’s main activities will remain substantially the same as for the previous year.
*   Inland Revenue’s transformation programme ceased in 2021–22, with some residual transformation activities post the closure of the programme to occur up to 2023–24.
*   Operating costs are based on historical information and Inland Revenue’s best estimates of future costs to be incurred for the delivery of its services.
*   Estimated year-end information for 2022–23 was used as the opening position for the 2023–24 forecasts.

Any changes to budgets during 2023–24 will be incorporated into The Supplementary Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the Year Ending 30 June 2024.

Variations to forecast

The actual financial results for the forecast period covered are likely to vary from the information presented in these forecasts. Factors that may lead to a material difference between information in these forecast financial statements and the actual reported results include: 

*   changes due to initiatives approved by Cabinet
*   technical adjustments to the budget, including transfers between financial years
*   macroeconomic impacts on estimations, judgements and assumptions
*   the timing of expenditure relating to significant programmes and projects.

The Chief Executive and Commissioner of Inland Revenue authorised these financial schedules on 29 September 2022.

Statement of compliance

The financial schedules have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Act 1989, which includes the requirement to comply with New Zealand generally accepted accounting practice (NZ GAAP) and the Treasury instructions.

Inland Revenue has applied the Tier 1 Public Benefit Entity International Public Sector Accounting Standards (PBE IPSAS) in preparing the 30 June 2022 financial schedules.

Basis of preparation

The financial schedules have been prepared on a going concern basis, and the accounting policies set out below, and in the notes to the financial schedules, have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial schedules.

These financial schedules have been prepared on a historical cost basis, unless otherwise stated. The accrual basis of accounting has been used.

Functional and presentation currency

These financial schedules are presented in New Zealand dollars, and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars ($000). The functional currency of Inland Revenue is New Zealand dollars.

Accounting standard issued and not yet effective

The standard issued but not yet effective, and that has not been adopted early, is:

### PBE IPSAS 41 Financial Instruments

The External Reporting Board issued PBE IPSAS 41 Financial Instruments in March 2019. This standard supersedes PBE IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which was issued as an interim standard. It is effective for reporting periods ending on or before 30 June 2023. Inland Revenue does not intend to adopt PBE IPSAS 41 early. When this standard is adopted, Inland Revenue does not expect any significant changes as the requirements are similar to PBE IFRS 9.

Estimations and judgements

In preparing these financial schedules, judgements, estimates and assumptions have been made concerning the future.

These judgements, estimates and their associated assumptions may differ from the subsequent actual results. Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on experience, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and other factors. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to revenue, and the carrying amounts of receivables and payables within the next financial year, are referred to in the notes. The impact of COVID-19 on estimates and assumptions is also discussed in these notes.

Accounting policies

Significant accounting policies are included in the notes to which they relate. Significant accounting policies that do not relate to a specific note, and which materially affect the measurement of financial results and the financial position, are outlined below.

Expenses

Expenses are recognised in the period to which they relate.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in transit and funds held in bank accounts administered by Inland Revenue. All cash is on demand and no interest is payable to Inland Revenue.

Comparatives

When the presentation or classification of items in the financial schedules are amended or accounting policies are changed, comparative figures are restated to ensure consistency with the current period, unless it is impractical to do so.

Change in accounting policies

There have been no changes in accounting policies since the date of the last audited financial schedules.

All accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the year.

Budget and forecast figures

The budget, revised budget and forecast figures have been prepared in accordance with NZ GAAP using accounting policies that are consistent with those adopted in preparing these financial schedules.

The budget and forecast financial schedules are not subject to audit.

The budget figures for 2021–22 are those included in The Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the Year Ending 30 June 2022.

The revised budget figures for 2021–22 (refer to the 'Statement of non-departmental budgeted and actual expenditure incurred against appropriations') are those included in The Supplementary Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the Year Ending 30 June 2022.

[Statement of non-departmental budgeted and actual expenditure incurred against appropriations](/about-us/publications/annual-corporate-reports/annual-report/annual-report-2022/our-performance-2022/appropriation-statements-2022/statement-of-non-departmental-budgeted-and-actual-expenditure-2022)

The forecast figures for 2022–23 are those included in The Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the Year Ending 30 June 2023.

The forecast financial schedules have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Act 1989 to communicate forecast financial information for accountability purposes. They are compliant with PBE Financial Reporting Standard 42 Prospective Financial Statements.

Forecast policies

The forecasts have been compiled on the basis of existing government policies and ministerial expectations at the time the schedules were finalised and reflect all Government decisions up to 11 April 2022.

While Inland Revenue regularly updates forecasts, updated forecast schedules for the year ending 30 June 2023 will not be published.

The main assumptions are:

*   Estimates for COVID-19 economic impacts and the Government's COVID-19 economic response packages, including:
    *   the reinstatement of a 2% diminishing value depreciation rate for commercial and industrial buildings
    *   increasing the low-value asset write-off threshold to $5,000 for the 2020–21 income tax year
    *   Small Business Cashflow Scheme lending and associated initial fair value write-down.
*   Tax revenue: tax policy changes enacted and announced by the Government will take place as planned and will affect tax revenue and receipts as calculated and agreed between Inland Revenue and the Treasury.
*   Student loans: the fair value of student loans is based on a valuation model adapted to reflect current student loans policy. As such, the fair value over the forecast period is sensitive to changes in a number of underlying assumptions, including future income levels, repayment behaviour and macroeconomic factors such as wages inflation and discount rates. Any change in these assumptions would affect the present fiscal forecast.
*   Estimated year-end information for 2021–22 is used as the opening position for the 2022–23 forecasts.

For other key fiscal forecast assumptions, refer to the 'Budget Economic and Fiscal Update 2022'.

Note 1 - Basis of preparation
=============================

Reporting entity
----------------

Inland Revenue is a government department as defined by section 2 of the Public Finance Act 1989 and is domiciled and operates in New Zealand.

The relevant legislation governing Inland Revenue’s operations is the Public Finance Act 1989.

Inland Revenue is a wholly owned entity of the Crown whose primary objective is to provide services to the public rather than to make a financial return. Accordingly, Inland Revenue has designated itself as a Public Benefit Entity (PBE) for financial reporting purposes.

These non-departmental financial schedules present financial information on funds managed by Inland Revenue on behalf of the Crown.

These non-departmental balances are consolidated into the ‘Financial Statements of the Government of New Zealand for the year ended 30 June 2021’. For a full understanding of the Crown’s financial position and the results of its operations and cash flows for the year, refer to the consolidated ‘Financial Statements of the Government of New Zealand for the year ended 30 June 2021’.

Reporting period
----------------

The reporting period for these financial schedules is for the year ended 30 June 2021. The forecast financial schedules are for the year ending 30 June 2022.

The Chief Executive and Commissioner of Inland Revenue authorised these financial schedules on 29 September 2021.

Statement of compliance
-----------------------

The financial schedules have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Act 1989, which includes the requirement to comply with New Zealand generally accepted accounting practice (NZ GAAP) and the Treasury instructions.

Inland Revenue has applied the Tier 1 Public Benefit Entity International Public Sector Accounting Standards (PBE IPSAS) in preparing the 30 June 2021 financial schedules.

Basis of preparation
--------------------

The financial schedules have been prepared on a going concern basis, and the accounting policies set out below and in the notes to the financial schedules, have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial schedules.

These financial schedules have been prepared on a historical cost basis, unless otherwise stated. The accrual basis of accounting has been used.

Functional and presentation currency
------------------------------------

These financial schedules are presented in New Zealand dollars, and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars ($000). The functional currency of Inland Revenue is New Zealand dollars.

Accounting standard issued and not yet effective
------------------------------------------------

The standard issued but not yet effective, that has not been adopted early is:

### PBE IPSAS 41 Financial Instruments

The External Reporting Board issued PBE IPSAS 41 Financial Instruments in March 2019. This standard supersedes PBE IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which was issued as an interim standard. It is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. Inland Revenue does not intend to adopt PBE IPSAS 41 early. When this standard is adopted, Inland Revenue does not expect any significant changes as the requirements are similar to PBE IFRS 9.

Estimations and judgements
--------------------------

In preparing these financial schedules, judgements, estimates and assumptions have been made concerning the future.

These judgements, estimates and their associated assumptions may differ from the subsequent actual results. Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on experience, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and other factors. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to revenue, and the carrying amounts of receivables and payables within the next financial year, are referred to in the notes. The impact of COVID-19 on estimates and assumptions is also discussed in these notes.

Accounting policies
-------------------

Significant accounting policies are included in the notes to which they relate. Significant accounting policies that do not relate to a specific note, and which materially affect the measurement of financial results and the financial position, are outlined below.

Expenses
--------

Expenses are recognised in the period to which they relate.

Cash and cash equivalents
-------------------------

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash in transit and funds held in bank accounts administered by Inland Revenue. All cash held in bank accounts is held in on demand accounts and no interest is payable to Inland Revenue.

Comparatives
------------

When the presentation or classification of items in the financial schedules are amended or accounting policies are changed, comparative figures are restated to ensure consistency with the current period, unless it is impractical to do so.

Change in accounting policies
-----------------------------

There has been one change in accounting policy since the date of the last audited financial schedules.

From this year, unpaid child support assessments related to the Crown entitlements are recognised on the Schedule of non-departmental assets at fair value in accordance with PBE IPSAS 23 Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions. Previously these were not recognised. This change has resulted in an increase in child support receivables of $155 million. Refer to note 5 for more information.

Other than this change, the accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the year.

Budget and forecast figures
---------------------------

The budget, revised budget and forecast figures have been prepared in accordance with NZ GAAP using accounting policies that are consistent with those adopted in preparing these financial schedules.

The budget and forecast financial schedules are not subject to audit.

The budget figures for 2020-21 are those included in ‘The Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand’ for the year ending 30 June 2021. After the Estimates went to print, the tax forecasts were updated to take account of late-breaking Government decisions, particularly in relation to COVID-19 pandemic relief measures.

The revised budget figures for 2020-21 (refer to the ‘Statement of non-departmental budgeted and actual expenditure incurred against appropriations’) are those included in ‘The Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the year ending 30 June 2021’.

Note 1 - Basis of preparation (2023)
====================================

Show all

Reporting entity

Te Tari Taake Inland Revenue is a government department as defined by section 2 of the Public Finance Act 1989 and is domiciled and operates in New Zealand.

The relevant legislation governing Inland Revenue's operations includes the Public Finance Act 1989, and the Public Service Act 2020. Inland Revenue is a wholly owned entity of the Crown whose primary objective is to provide services to the public rather than to make a financial return. Accordingly, Inland Revenue has designated itself as a Public Benefit Entity (PBE) for financial reporting purposes.

These non-departmental financial schedules present financial information on public funds managed by Inland Revenue on behalf of the Crown.

These non-departmental balances are consolidated into the Financial Statements of the Government of New Zealand for the Year Ended 30 June 2023. For a full understanding of the Crown's financial position and the results of its operations and cash flows for the year, refer to the consolidated Financial Statements of the Government of New Zealand for the Year Ended 30 June 2023.

Reporting period

The reporting period for these financial schedules is for the year ended 30 June 2023. The unaudited forecast financial schedules are for the year ending 30 June 2024.

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue, as Chief Executive, authorised these financial schedules on 29 September 2023.

Statement of compliance

The financial schedules have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Act 1989, which includes the requirement to comply with New Zealand generally accepted accounting practice (NZ GAAP) and Te Tai Ōhanga the Treasury instructions.

Inland Revenue has applied the Tier 1 Public Benefit Entity International Public Sector Accounting Standards (PBE IPSAS) in preparing the 30 June 2023 financial schedules.

Basis of preparation

The financial schedules have been prepared on a going concern basis, and the accounting policies set out below, and in the notes to the financial schedules have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial schedules.

These financial schedules have been prepared on a historical cost basis unless otherwise stated. The accrual basis of accounting has been used.

Functional and presentation currency

These financial schedules are presented in New Zealand dollars, and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars ($000). The functional currency of Inland Revenue is New Zealand dollars.

New standards adopted

We have adopted PBE IPSAS 41 Financial Instruments this year. This standard supersedes the standard Public Benefit Entity-International Financial Reporting Standards 9 Financial Instruments (PBE IFRS 9) with similar requirements.  As a consequence there is no significant change in accounting policy.

Accounting standards issued and not yet effective

There are no relevant new standards that have been issued but are not yet effective.

Critical accounting estimations, judgements and assumptions

In preparing these financial schedules, critical estimates, judgements and assumptions have been made concerning the future.

These estimates, judgements and their associated assumptions may differ from the subsequent actual results. Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on experience, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and other factors. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. Note 2 outlines minor updates which were made to the estimations used in the measurement of income tax during the period.

The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to revenue, and the carrying amounts of receivables and payables within the next financial year, are referred to in the notes. The most significant areas of uncertainties are;

*   Estimation of income tax revenue for other persons and companies–Note 2 outlines the significant uncertainties, assumptions and sensitivities in estimating income tax revenue for companies and other persons for the year ended 30 June 2023. The methodology used to estimate income tax revenue for companies and other persons is based on macroeconomic forecasts. There is implicit uncertainty in the assumptions used in the macroeconomic forecasts.
*   Impairment of tax receivables–Note 3 outlines the significant uncertainties, assumptions and sensitivities in estimating the value of tax receivables and the associated impairment as at 30 June 2023. The impairment of tax receivables is calculated based on expected future repayments. The future repayments are uncertain because of the uncertainty associated with the estimation of the repayment behaviour of debtors.
*   Student loan–Note 6 outlines the significant uncertainties, assumptions, and sensitivities in estimating the fair value of the student loan portfolio as at 30 June 2023. The fair value is based on expected future income levels and debt repayments. The expected future income levels and debt repayments are uncertain because they are dependent on macroeconomic factors and the behaviour of borrowers.

Accounting policies

Significant accounting policies are included in the notes to which they relate. Significant accounting policies that do not relate to a specific note, and which materially affect the measurement of financial results, the Schedule of Non-Departmental Financial Assets, the Schedule of Non-Departmental Financial Liabilities and/or the Statement of Non-Departmental Budgeted and Actual Expenditure Incurred Against Appropriations within the Our performance section, are outlined below.

Expenses

Expenses are recognised in the period to which they relate.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in transit and funds held in bank accounts administered by Inland Revenue. All cash is on demand and no interest is payable to Inland Revenue.

Foreign currency transactions

Inland Revenue does not have any material non-departmental foreign currency exposure. The risk of any material foreign currency exposure is borne by the customer when they enter into the transaction.

Fair value remeasurement

Fair value remeasurement is the change in the value of a loan portfolio over the year. Loans are initially measured at fair value. The changes to fair value between periods are recognised as a gain or loss in the Schedule of Non-Departmental Gains and Losses. More information is provided in note 5 for the Small Business Cashflow Scheme and note 6 for student loans.

Comparatives

When the presentation or classification of items in the financial schedules are amended or accounting policies are changed, comparative figures are restated to ensure consistency with the current period unless it is impractical to do so.

Change in accounting policies

There have been no material changes in accounting policies since the date of the last audited financial schedules.

All accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the year.

Budget and forecast figures

The budget, revised budget and forecast figures have been prepared in accordance with NZ GAAP using accounting policies that are consistent with those adopted in preparing these financial schedules.

The budget and forecast figures are not subject to audit.

The budget figures for 2022–23 are those included in The Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the Year Ending 30 June 2023.

The revised budget figures for 2022–23 (refer to the Statement of Non-Departmental Budgeted and Actual Expenditure Incurred Against Appropriations) are those included in The Supplementary Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the Year Ending 30 June 2023.

The forecast figures for 2023–24 are those included in The Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the Year Ending 30 June 2024. Any significant changes to the forecast included in the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Update 2023 are noted in the footnotes to the Statement of Non-Departmental Budgeted and Actual Expenditure Incurred Against Appropriations.

The forecast financial schedules have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Act 1989 to communicate forecast financial information for accountability purposes. They are compliant with PBE Financial Reporting Standard 42 Prospective Financial Statements.

Forecast policies

The forecasts have been compiled on the basis of existing government policies and ministerial expectations at the time the schedules were finalised. The Commissioner, in his role as Chief Executive of Inland Revenue, is responsible for the forecast financial schedules including the appropriateness of the assumptions underlying them and all other required disclosures. The Commissioner approved the forecast financial schedules on 18 April 2023. Although Inland Revenue regularly updates forecasts, it will not publish updated forecast schedules for the year ending 30 June 2024.

The main assumptions are: 

*   Tax revenue: tax policy changes enacted and announced by the Government will take place as planned and will affect tax revenue and receipts as calculated and agreed between Inland Revenue and Te Tai Ōhanga, the Treasury.
*   Student loans: the fair value of student loans is based on a valuation model adapted to reflect current student loans policy. As such, the fair value over the forecast period is sensitive to changes in a number of underlying assumptions, including future income levels, repayment behaviour and macroeconomic factors such as wage inflation and discount rates. Any change in these assumptions would affect the fiscal forecast.
*   Small Business Cashflow Scheme: the fair value of the scheme over the forecast period is sensitive to changes in borrower repayments and defaults, which are based on volatile factors that are subject to change.
*   Estimated year-end information for 2022–23 is used as the opening position for the 2023–24 forecasts.

For other key fiscal forecast assumptions, refer to the Budget Economic and Fiscal Update 2023 ([https://www.treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2023-05/befu23.pdf](https://www.treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2023-05/befu23.pdf)

.

Any changes to budgets during 2023–24 will be incorporated into The Supplementary Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the Year Ending 30 June 2024.

Variations to forecast

The actual financial results for the forecast period covered are likely to vary from the information presented in these forecasts. Factors that may lead to a material difference between information in these forecast financial schedules and the actual reported results include:

*   changes due to initiatives or legislation approved by Cabinet
*   macroeconomic changes impacting revenue, expenditure and debt levels

Note 10 - Intangible assets (2023)
==================================

Inland Revenue has intangible assets in the form of internally generated software and software licences. All of Inland Revenue’s intangible assets have finite useful lives.

Show all

Internally generated intangible assets

There are 2 types of internally generated intangible assets: computer software and business processes design.

The cost of internally generated intangible assets comprises direct labour, materials purchased and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. These costs are associated with the development of identifiable and unique software controlled by Inland Revenue, which will generate future economic benefits beyond one year.

Expenditure on development activities, where research findings are applied to a plan or design for new or substantially improved processes, is capitalised if the processes are technically and commercially feasible. Any other development costs are expensed.

Costs incurred on research of an internally generated intangible asset are expensed.

Costs of configuring and customising commercial off the-shelf software are capitalised. Costs of configuring and customising software as a service arrangements are expensed. 

Website development costs are recognised as an intangible asset if it can be demonstrated that the website will generate probable future economic benefits. Subsequent costs associated with the development and maintenance of Inland Revenue’s existing websites are expensed unless they meet the capitalisation requirement of PBE IPSAS 31 Intangible Assets. Staff training costs and change management costs are expensed.

Software licences

Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of costs incurred to acquire and be able to use the specific software. Costs associated with supporting and maintaining computer software licences are expensed. The capitalisation thresholds for intangible assets are:

*   Internally generated intangible assets - Over $20,000  
    
*   Software licences - Over $20,000

Additions

Intangible assets are initially recorded at cost and subsequently recorded at historical cost less amortisation and impairment losses.

Amortisation

The carrying value of an intangible asset with a finite life is amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. Amortisation begins when the asset is available for use and ceases when the asset no longer has a recognisable value. The amortisation charge is expensed. The useful lives of major classes of intangible assets have been estimated as: 

*   Internally generated intangible assets - 3 to 15 years
*   Software licences - 3 to 15 years

Assets under construction are recognised at cost less impairment and are not amortised. The total cost of a capital project is transferred to the appropriate asset class on its completion and then amortised.

The assets’ useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each balance date.

The gain or loss arising from the disposal of an intangible asset forms part of the net surplus or deficit.

Impairment

Intangible assets that have a finite useful life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Intangible assets are also reviewed annually for indicators of impairment at each balance date. Assets under construction are tested for impairment at each balance date.

For further details, refer to the policy for impairment of property, plant and equipment in note 9. The same approach applies to the impairment of intangible assets.

Estimating the useful lives of intangible assets

The useful lives of intangible assets are based on:

*   management’s view of the expected period over which Inland Revenue will receive benefits
*   historical experience with similar assets
*   anticipation of future events which may impact their useful lives such as changes in technology or legislation.

There is no restriction over the title of Inland Revenue’s intangible assets, nor are any intangible assets pledged as security for liabilities. Inland Revenue’s intangible assets are mainly related to the core revenue system and supporting infrastructure (START).

Of the $276.252 million carrying value for intangibles, $241.385 million relates to the development of the tax and social policy management system (START) and supporting infrastructure assets. The estimated remaining life of the START assets is 8 years.

Explanation of major variances against budget

Intangible assets are $21.662 million higher than budget. This is mainly due to a lower than budgeted depreciation resulting from reduction of software as a service related intangibles’ depreciation.

Note 10. Intangible assets
==========================

IR has intangible assets in the form of internally generated software and software licences. All of IR’s intangible assets have finite useful lives.

Internally generated intangible assets
--------------------------------------

There are 2 types of internally generated intangible assets: computer software configuration and business process design.

The cost of internally generated intangible assets comprises direct labour, materials purchased and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. These costs are associated with the development of identifiable and unique software controlled by IR, which will generate future economic benefits beyond 1 year.

Expenditure on development activities, where research findings are applied to a plan or design for new or substantially improved processes, is capitalised if the processes are technically and commercially feasible. Any other development costs are expensed.

Costs incurred on research of an internally generated intangible asset are expensed. Where the research phase cannot be distinguished from the development phase, the total cost is expensed.

Costs associated with maintaining internally generated computer software are expensed. Costs of configuring and customising commercial off-the-shelf software are capitalised. Costs of configuring and customising software-as-a-service arrangements are expensed.

Website development costs are recognised as an intangible asset if it can be demonstrated that the website will generate probable future economic benefits. Subsequent costs associated with the development and maintenance of IR’s existing websites are expensed unless they meet the capitalisation requirement of PBE IPSAS 31 Intangible Assets. Staff training costs and change management costs are expensed.

Software licences
-----------------

Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of costs incurred to acquire and be able to use the specific software. Costs associated with supporting and maintaining computer software licences are expensed. The capitalisation thresholds for intangible assets are:

*   Internally generated intangible assets - Over $20,000
*   Software licences - Over $20,000

### Additions

Intangible assets are initially recorded at cost and subsequently recorded at historical cost less amortisation and impairment losses.

### Amortisation

The carrying value of an intangible asset with a finite life is amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. Amortisation begins when the asset is available for use and ceases when the asset no longer has a recognisable value. The amortisation charge is expensed. The useful lives of major classes of intangible assets on initial measurement have been estimated as:

*   Internally generated intangible assets - 3 to 15 years
*   Software licences - 3 to 15 years

Assets under construction are recognised at cost less impairment and are not amortised. The total cost of a capital project is transferred to the appropriate asset class on its completion and then amortised.

The assets' useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each balance date and where appropriate for an individual assts these can be outside of the above ranges on initial measurement.

The gain or loss arising from the disposal of an intangible asset forms part of the net surplus or deficit.

Impairment
----------

Intangible assets that have a finite useful life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Intangible assets are also reviewed annually for indicators of impairment at each balance date. Assets under construction are tested for impairment at each balance date.

For further details, refer to the policy for impairment of property, plant and equipment in Note 9. The same approach applies to the impairment of intangible assets.

Estimating the useful lives of intangible assets
------------------------------------------------

The useful lives of intangible assets are based on:

*   management’s view of the expected period over which IR will receive benefits
*   historical experience with similar assets
*   anticipation of future events that may impact their useful lives such as changes in technology or legislation.

Note 11 - Debtors and prepayments
=================================

Accounts receivable and other debtors transactions are considered to be exchange transactions. Debtor Crown transactions are considered to be non-exchange transactions.

Allowance for credit losses
---------------------------

Debtors and receivables are recorded at their face value, less an allowance for credit losses. Inland Revenue applies the simplified expected credit loss model of recognising lifetime expected credit losses for receivables.

In measuring credit losses, receivables have been assessed on a collective basis as they possess shared credit risk characteristics. They have been grouped based on the days past due.

Short-term receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include the debtor being in liquidation.

| **$17,536** | **Total debtors and prepayments - exchange transactions** | **$16,984** | **$11,122** |

Explanation of major variances against budget
---------------------------------------------

Debtors and prepayments were $5.862 million higher than budget due to the timing of collection on an inter-government agency receivable and the additional prepayment of some maintenance contracts in the transformation programme.

The expected credit loss rates for accounts receivable are based on the payment profile of receivables over the previous periods and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced for that period. The historical loss rates are adjusted for current and forward-looking economic factors, including COVID-19, that might affect the recoverability of receivables.

There have been no changes during the reporting period in the estimation techniques or significant assumptions used in measuring the expected credit loss allowance.

The allowance for credit losses at 30 June 2021 and 30 June 2020 was determined as follows.

|     |     | Expected credit loss rate | Gross carrying amount  <br>($000) | Lifetime expected credit loss  <br>($000) |

Note 13 - Employee entitlements (2022)
======================================

Show all

Current entitlements

Employee entitlements that Inland Revenue expects to be settled within 12 months of balance date are measured at nominal value based on accrued entitlements at current rates of pay. These include salaries and wages accrued up to balance date, annual leave and time off in lieu earned up to but not yet taken at balance date, and retiring and long-service leave entitlements expected to be settled within 12 months.

Inland Revenue recognises a liability for sick leave to the extent that absences in the coming year are expected to be greater than the sick leave entitlements earned in the coming year. The amount is calculated based on the unused sick leave entitlement that can be carried forward at balance date, to the extent that Inland Revenue anticipates it will be used by staff to cover those future absences.

Inland Revenue recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses where it is contractually obliged to pay them, or where a past practice has created a constructive obligation and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made.

Other provisions include an allowance to meet the requirements of the Holidays Act 2003 for former Inland Revenue employees and other operational employee matters.

Non-current entitlements

Employee entitlements that are payable beyond 12 months such as long-service leave and retiring leave, have been calculated on an actuarial basis.

| **$108,832** | **Total employee entitlements** | **$77,252** | **$87,150** |

Explanation of major variances against budget

Provisions for employee entitlements were $9.898 million lower than budget, mainly due to a lower amount of transformation-related termination benefits being necessary as staff could be retained in other positions, a reversal of long-service leave and retiring leave for employees who have left Inland Revenue, and macroeconomic changes to valuation assumptions for long-service leave and retiring leave.

Termination benefits

Termination benefits are payable when an employee's employment contract is terminated before their normal retirement or when an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. Inland Revenue recognises the expense when it is demonstrably committed to either terminate the employment of current employees, according to a detailed formal plan without the possibility of withdrawal, or as a result of an offer for voluntary redundancy.

Termination benefits to be settled within 12 months are reported at the amount expected to be paid. Otherwise, they are reported as the present value of the estimated future cash outflows, where applicable.

Movements in the provisions for termination benefits and other provisions are as follows.

| **Closing balance as at 30 June 2021** | **$27,163** | **$5,378** | **$32,541** |

Measuring retiring and long-service leave liabilities

The actuarial calculations for long-service leave and retiring leave liabilities are based on:

*   employee contractual entitlements
*   years of service accrued to balance date and years remaining to entitlement
*   the present value of the estimated future cash outflows using an applicable discount rate and salary inflation rate.

Sick leave, annual leave and vested long-service leave are classified as a current liability. Non-vested long-service leave and retiring leave liabilities expected to be settled within 12 months of balance date are also classified as a current liability. All other long-service leave and retiring leave is classified as a non-current liability.

The present value of retiring and long-service leave obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis by an independent actuary. Key assumptions used in calculating liabilities are the discount rate and salary inflation. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of the liabilities.

The discount rates used by the independent actuary for the retiring and long-service leave valuations are based on the Treasury published forward rates at 30 June 2022. The forward rates are derived from New Zealand government bonds. The long-term salary inflation assumption is based on the Treasury published rates at 30 June 2022 and after obtaining advice from the independent actuary. The long-term salary inflation assumption used was 4.52% (2021: 2.49%).

COVID-19 impacts are reflected in the assumptions for discount rates and salary inflation. The net effect of these assumptions has resulted in a decrease to the liability. The following section provides a sensitivity analysis of these assumptions.

Sensitivity analysis

The following table shows the effect of changes in forecast discount, salary inflation and withdrawal rates on liabilities for long-service and retiring leave. Each factor is considered separately as if all other factors remained constant.

Explanation of major variances against budget
---------------------------------------------

Provisions for employee entitlements were $16.785 million higher than budget mainly due to the timing of planned transformation restructuring costs (termination benefits), less leave taken by staff during the COVID-19 lockdown period in 2019-20 which has rolled into 2020-21, an additional provision for Holidays Act remediation, offset by the reversal of retiring leave for employees who have left Inland Revenue and macroeconomic changes to valuation assumptions for retiring leave.

Termination benefits
--------------------

Termination benefits are payable when an employee’s employment contract is terminated before their normal retirement or when an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. Inland Revenue recognises the expense when it is demonstrably committed to either terminate the employment of current employees, according to a detailed formal plan without the possibility of withdrawal, or as a result of an offer for voluntary redundancy.

Termination benefits to be settled within 12 months are reported at the amount expected to be paid. Otherwise they are reported as the present value of the estimated future cash outflows, where applicable.

Movements in the provisions for termination benefits and other provision are as follows.

Measuring retiring and long-service leave liabilities
-----------------------------------------------------

The actuarial calculations for long-service leave and retiring leave liabilities are based on:

*   employee contractual entitlements
*   years of service accrued to balance date and years remaining to entitlement
*   the present value of the estimated future cash outflows using an applicable discount rate and salary inflation rate.

Sick leave, annual leave and vested long-service leave are classified as a current liability. Non-vested long-service leave and retiring leave liabilities expected to be settled within 12 months of balance date are also classified as a current liability. All other long-service leave and retiring leave is classified as a non-current liability.

The present value of retiring and long-service leave obligations depend on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis by an independent actuary. Key assumptions used in calculating liabilities are the discount rate and salary inflation. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of the liabilities.

The discount rates used by the independent actuary for the retiring and long-service leave valuations are based on the Treasury published forward rates at 30 June 2021. The forward rates are derived from New Zealand government bonds. The long-term salary inflation assumption is based on the Treasury published rates at 30 June 2021 and after obtaining advice from the independent actuary. The long-term salary inflation assumption used was 2.46% (2020: 2.19%).

COVID-19 impacts are reflected in the assumptions for discount rates and salary inflation. The net effect of these assumptions has resulted in an increase to the liability. The following section provides a sensitivity analysis of these assumptions.

The following table shows the effect of changes in forecast discount, salary inflation and withdrawal rates on liabilities for long-service and retiring leave. Each factor is considered separately as if all other factors remained constant.

Note 19 - Financial instruments - financial instrument risks (2022)
===================================================================

Inland Revenue's activities expose it to a variety of financial instrument risks, including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Inland Revenue has policies to manage the risks associated with financial instruments and seeks to minimise exposure from financial instruments. These policies do not allow Inland Revenue to enter into any transactions that are speculative in nature.

Market risk
-----------

Show all

Currency risk

The risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates is called currency risk.

Inland Revenue purchases fixed assets and services from overseas suppliers, and it is therefore exposed to currency risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily for United States and Australian dollars.

Under its foreign exchange policy, Inland Revenue enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage foreign exchange exposures when single foreign exchange transactions exceed NZ$100,000 or the transaction exposure for an individual currency exceeds NZ$100,000. This policy has been approved by the Treasury and is in line with the requirements of the Treasury's 'Guidelines for the Management of Crown and Departmental Foreign-Exchange Exposure'.

[Guidelines for the Management of Crown and Departmental Foreign-Exchange Exposure – treasury.govt.nz](https://www.treasury.govt.nz/publications/guide/guidelines-management-crown-and-departmental-foreign-exchange-exposure-html)

Sensitivity analysis

Assuming that all other variables remained constant, the impact on the surplus of a 5% increase or decrease in the New Zealand dollar against various other currencies held by Inland Revenue in its foreign currency account at 30 June 2022 would be a $0.118 million decrease and a $0.122 million increase respectively.

Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate, or the cash flows from a financial instrument will fluctuate, due to changes in market interest rates.

Inland Revenue has no interest-bearing financial instruments so it has no exposure to interest rate risk.

Credit risk

The risk that a third party will default on its obligations to Inland Revenue, causing a loss to be incurred, is called credit risk. In the normal course of its business, credit risk from receivables is concentrated with the Crown and other government agencies but not with any individual agencies.

The carrying amount of financial assets recognised in the 'Statement of financial position' best represents Inland Revenue's maximum exposure to credit risk at balance date.

[Statement of financial position 2022](/about-us/publications/annual-corporate-reports/annual-report/annual-report-2022/financial-statements-departmental-2022/statement-of-financial-position-2022)

Inland Revenue does not require any collateral, security or other credit enhancements to support financial instruments with the financial institutions that it deals with, because these entities have high credit ratings. Westpac is Inland Revenue's main bank and has an 'S&P Global Ratings' credit rating of AA–. Inland Revenue enters into foreign currency transactions with Treasury Capital Markets (S&P Global Rating credit rating of AA+). For its other financial instruments, Inland Revenue does not have significant concentrations of credit risk.

The carrying amount of financial assets that would otherwise be past due or impaired whose terms have been renegotiated is not material.

Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that Inland Revenue will encounter difficulty raising liquid funds to meet commitments as they fall due.

As all but an insignificant proportion of funds come from the New Zealand Government and cash is drawn down on a fortnightly basis, Inland Revenue does not have significant liquidity risk. In meeting its liquidity requirements, Inland Revenue closely monitors its forecast cash requirements with expected cash drawdowns from Treasury Capital Markets. Inland Revenue maintains a target level of available cash to meet liquidity requirements.

Note 2 - Revenue (2023)
=======================

Tax revenue
-----------

Tax revenue is a non-exchange transaction.

This means the payment of tax in itself does not entitle a customer to an equivalent value of services or benefits, because there is no direct relationship between paying tax and receiving Crown services and benefits.

Tax revenue is recognised when a taxable event has occurred, the tax revenue can be reliably measured and it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Crown.

Tax is recognised at face value as the fair value is not materially different from the face value.

The New Zealand tax system is based on self-assessment where customers are expected to understand the tax laws and comply with them. Inland Revenue helps customers comply and addresses non-compliant activities. Most people pay their fair share of tax. For the minority who do not, Inland Revenue intervenes and encourages them to do the right thing. However, such procedures cannot be expected to identify all sources of unreported income or other cases of non-compliance with tax laws. Inland Revenue is unable to reliably estimate the amount of unreported tax.

Show all

Income tax

Income tax is recognised on an accrual basis in the period the taxable event occurs. It is deemed to accrue evenly over the period to which it relates.

Where income tax returns have not been filed for the relevant period, accrued income tax revenue receivable or payable has been estimated based on tax payments and/or provisional assessments for that period, or the prior year residual income tax or provisional assessments and payment information.

Tax revenue is recognised proportionally based on the balance date of the customer. The amount of income tax receivable or refundable is not known with certainty until income tax returns for the period have been filed. The filing of terminal tax returns can happen more than a year after the tax year. For example, 2023 income tax returns may not be filed until March 2024 (or after) and 2024 income tax returns may not be filed until March 2025 (or after).

While the majority of customers make provisional tax payments during a year using a 5% uplift under legislation, the income tax revenue estimation process is based on a rebuttable presumption that the forecast of firms’ net operating surplus, from the most recent Treasury forecast, is used as the uplift assumption, unless rebutted for material impacts. The firms’ net operating surplus is a component of Income Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and is designed to measure net profits of businesses. This measure is approximately equal to accounting profit before taxes, dividends and interest, but after depreciation.

The following assumptions have been used in these financial statements:

*   An annual average growth in firms’ net operating surplus for the tax year to 31 March 2023 of 2.41%.
*   An annual average growth in firms’ net operating surplus for the tax year to 31 March 2024 of 0.98%.

These assumptions are directly from the Treasury’s most recent forecast of firms' net operating surplus growth in the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Update 2023, which was finalised on 2 August 2023 and published on 12 September 2023.

The March 2023 tax year assumption is materially consistent with the 2.35% annual growth rate implied by Tatauranga Aotearoa, Stats NZ quarterly national accounts data (income, savings assets and liabilities) released in July 2023.

There is no more up-to-date publicly available information in respect of firms’ net operating surplus for the 2023 and 2024 tax years and, therefore, we have not rebutted the presumption to use the Treasury’s forecast of firms’ net operating surplus growth.

For the 2024 income tax year, which ends on 31 March 2024, the period from 1 April 2023 to 30 June 2023 is included in these financial schedules. The non-March balance dates use a pro-rata calculation of these rates.

The measurement of income tax accruals requires significant estimates, judgements and assumptions and has a number of uncertainties. These include the following:

*   Where customers have chosen to estimate their provisional tax, income tax revenue is recognised based on the most recent estimate provided to Inland Revenue.
*   Where customers subject to the provisional tax regime have not yet filed a terminal tax assessment:
    *   for customers with March balance dates for the 2023 income tax year, revenue is estimated as 102.41% of the prior year residual income tax
    *   for customers with March balance dates for the 2024 income tax year, revenue is estimated as 100.98% of the prior year residual income tax
    *   for all other income tax years, provisional tax assessments are recognised as revenue based on the provisional tax method adopted by the customer. Provisional assessments are based on 105% of the prior year residual income tax.
*   Where customers have made payments for more than the provisional tax assessment submitted, their credit balance is also accrued as revenue.
*   Where customers have made payments to Inland Revenue but have not submitted a provisional tax assessment for the period, an estimate is made based on the payments.
*   For customers who had a receivable or refundable terminal assessment in the prior year but are not subject to provisional tax, the estimation is based on the prior year terminal assessment.
*   For customers who are subject to provisional tax and have not filed their tax return for the previous period, an estimate is made of the tax revenues receivable and refundable at year end based on prior year provisional tax assessments and any prior year payments which were in excess of their provisional assessment.

### Changes in estimations

Updates were made to the estimation basis used in the measurement of income tax during the period. These include:

*   Where customers have made payments to Inland Revenue but have not submitted a provisional tax assessment for the period, an estimate is made based on the payments. The estimation calculation has been updated to align with the provisional tax due dates rather than the number of payments expected for the year, and
*   Where customers have made payments for more than the provisional tax assessment submitted for the prior year, the value of these payments is used as the estimation and an uplift assumption is no longer applied.

The net impact of these changes reduced tax revenue by $480 million, made up of $202 million for companies and $278 million for other persons.

### Significant assumptions and sensitivities

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |The significant assumptions and sensitivities behind the estimation of income tax revenue for companies and other persons are:
| 2022 | Operating surplus and sensitivities | 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 13.37% | Tatauranga Stats NZ average annual growth in net operating surplus–2022 income tax year | n/a |
| 8.01% | Treasury's forecast firms' net operating surplus–2023 income tax year | 2.41% |
| n/a | Treasury's forecast firms' net operating surplus–2024 income tax year | 0.98% |
| **Sensitivities** |     |     |
| $244,000 | Impact on revenue of a 1% increase in firms' net operating surplus ($000) | $245,000 |
| $1,218,000 | Impact on revenue of a 5% increase in firms' net operating surplus ($000) | $1,227,000 |
| $2,436,000 | Impact on revenue of a 10% increase in firms' net operating surplus ($000) | $2,455,000 |
| $(244,000) | Impact on revenue of a 1% decrease in firms' net operating surplus ($000) | $(245,000) |
| $(1,218,000) | Impact on revenue of a 5% decrease in firms' net operating surplus ($000) | $(1,227,000) |
| $(2,436,000) | Impact on revenue of a 10% decrease in firms' net operating surplus ($000) | $(2,455,000) |

Income tax revenue has a high degree of estimation and is therefore uncertain. Application of key assumptions used in estimating income tax revenue may not necessarily reflect actual tax returns when they are filed. The estimation of income tax revenue is challenging because estimation is required so far ahead of the point when a taxpayer is required to file relevant income tax returns. In addition, forecasts of firms' net operating surplus are inherently uncertain and volatile.

Good and services tax (GST)

GST returns are assessed on a 1, 2, 3 or 6-monthly basis and are due the month after the end of the period. At year end, Inland Revenue estimates the amount of GST outstanding as follows:

*   For customers who file a return of GST for the June period, the actual amounts filed are used.
*   For customers who have not filed a return, the estimate is based on customer payments for that return period or the most recently assessed GST return.

Source deductions (PAYE)

Employers are required to file an employment information form for each payday. Revenue is assessed based on these forms. June employment information forms filed by employers in July are accrued at year end.

Non-tax revenue
---------------

Show all

Child support

Child support revenue comprises amounts owed to the Crown (this is called Crown entitlement) and the penalties levied on child support debts owed to both custodial persons and the Crown by parents who pay child support. This revenue is recognised initially at fair value and subsequently tested for impairment at year end. From 1 July 2023, Crown entitlement will no longer be withheld by the Crown and the total liable parent payments will be passed on to receiving carers. As a result, child support revenue will decrease.

Interest unwind - Small Business Cashflow Scheme

Small Business Cashflow Scheme loans are initially discounted to fair value. This predominantly reflects the time value of money. As time moves on, loans become closer to being repaid and are therefore worth more. This increase in value is recognised as interest unwind.

The interest unwind has been calculated using a discount rate appropriate for low-rated commercial and unsecured retail lending.

Interest unwind student loans

Student loans are initially discounted to fair value. This predominantly reflects the time value of money. As time moves on, student loans become closer to being repaid and are therefore worth more. This increase in value is recognised as interest unwind.

The interest unwind has been calculated using the official cash rate plus a risk adjustment calculated by the consulting actuaries.

For the minority who do not, Inland Revenue intervenes and encourages them to do the right thing. However, such procedures cannot be expected to identify all sources of unreported income or other cases of non-compliance with tax laws. Inland Revenue is unable to reliably estimate the amount of unreported tax.

Income tax

Income tax is recognised on an accrual basis in the period the taxable event occurs. It is deemed to accrue evenly over the period to which it relates.

Where income tax returns have not been filed for the relevant period, accrued income tax revenue receivable or payable has been estimated based on tax payments or current provisional assessments or prior year provisional or terminal assessments.

Tax revenue is recognised proportionally based on the balance date of the taxpayer. The amount of income tax receivable or refundable is not known with certainty until income tax returns for the period have been filed. The filing of terminal tax returns can happen more than a year after the tax year. For example, 2022 income tax returns may not be filed until March 2023 (or after) and 2023 income tax returns may not be filed until March 2024 (or after).

While the majority of taxpayers make provisional tax payments using a 5% uplift under legislation, the income tax revenue estimation process is based on a rebuttable presumption that the forecast of firms' net operating surplus, from the most recent Treasury forecast, is used as the uplift assumption, unless rebutted for material impacts. The firms' net operating surplus is a component of Income GDP and is designed to measure net profits of businesses. This measure is approximately equal to accounting profit before taxes, dividends and interest, but after depreciation.

The following assumptions have been used in these financial statements.

*   An annual average growth in firms' net operating surplus for the tax year to 31 March 2022 of 13.37%.

This assumption is derived from Tatauranga Aotearoa Statistics New Zealand's (Stats NZ) quarterly data series released on 14 July 2022. This series was developed for institutional sector accounts, balance sheet and the nominal income measure of quarterly gross domestic product (GDP), to provide more timely data on New Zealand's economy.

Details of the quarterly release can be found on the Stats NZ website.

[National accounts (income, saving, assets, and liabilities): March 2022 quarter - stats.govt.nz](https://www.stats.govt.nz/experimental/national-accounts-income-saving-assets-and-liabilities-march-2022-quarter)

Net operating surplus is delivered from gross operating surplus and gross mixed income less consumption of fixed capital.

This series shows a growth rate 5.34% higher than Treasury's most recent forecast of net operating surplus growth, which was 8.03% for the tax year to 31 March 2022. This was included in the Treasury's economic forecast as part of Budget 2022 in May.

The higher growth rate in Stats NZ's updated data release is consistent with other economic data releases since the Treasury's forecast of net operating surplus was finalised on 25 March 2022.

*   An annual average growth in the firms' net operating surplus for the tax year to 31 March 2023 of 8.01%.

For the March-year 2023, the Treasury's latest forecast of firms' net operating surplus growth of 13.35% was published in Budget 2022. However, using the recently published Stats NZ annual average growth in firms' net operating surplus for the tax year to 31 March 2022 as a starting point, the Treasury's Budget 2022 forecast level of firms' net operating surplus for the year to March 2023 now implies a growth rate of 8.01%.

There is no new forecast information publicly available in respect of firms' net operating surplus for the March 2023 tax year. Therefore, we are unable to rebut the presumption to use the Treasury's forecast of firms' net operating surplus growth of 13.35%, apart from reducing that to 8.01% owing to the upwardly revised 2022 tax year starting point.

The firms' net operating surplus uplift assumption of 8.01% for companies and other persons tax revenue for the 2023 tax year is lower than that of 13.37% for the tax year ended 31 March 2022. This is in line with current economic data, particularly around the weakening real GDP growth and terms of trade, the potential for the tight labour market to erode business profits, and the rising interest rates as Te Pūtea Matua the Reserve Bank considers how best to control inflation. It is also notable that wage subsidy support (2022: $4.860 billion) and COVID-19 Support Payments (2022: $4.257 billion) are not currently forecast to be repeated in 2023. There may be further downside risks. However, 6 months into the 2023 tax year, we are still unable to quantify with any certainty the impact on the firms' net operating surplus for the whole 2023 tax year posed by the recent data releases and economic commentary.

Therefore, at this point in time, we believe the current estimate of the March-year 2023 firms' net operating surplus of 8.01% growth is still relevant as an uplift assumption, albeit it is uncertain. For the financial statements for the year ending 30 June 2022, we take one quarter of the full 2023 income tax estimate as accrued revenue, so in that respect, the uncertainty is limited to a portion of the year.

As a result, the factors applied to the prior year's terminal tax is 113.37% for the 2022 income tax year, which ended on 31 March 2022, and 108.01% for the 2023 income tax year, which ends on 31 March 2023, with the period from 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 included in these financial schedules. The non-March balance dates use a pro-rata of these rates.

The measurement of income tax accruals requires significant estimates, judgements and assumptions and has a number of uncertainties. These include the following.

*   Where taxpayers have chosen to estimate their provisional tax, income tax revenue is recognised based on the most recent estimate provided to Inland Revenue.
*   Where customers subject to the provisional tax regime have not yet filed a terminal tax assessment for:
    *   for customers with March balance dates for the 2022 income tax year, revenue is estimated as 113.37% of the prior year terminal tax.
    *   for customers with March balance dates for the 2023 income tax year, revenue is estimated as 108.01% of the prior year terminal tax.
    *   for all other income tax years, provisional tax assessments are recognised as revenue based on the provisional tax method adopted by the taxpayer. Provisional assessments are based on 105% of the prior year terminal tax.
*   Where taxpayers have made payments for more than the provisional tax assessment submitted, their credit balance is also accrued as revenue.
*   Where taxpayers have made payments to Inland Revenue but have not submitted a provisional tax assessment for the period, an estimate is made based on the payments.
*   For taxpayers who are not subject to provisional tax, an estimate is made of the tax revenues receivable and refundable at year end based on prior year terminal assessments.
*   For taxpayers who are subject to provisional tax and have not filed their tax return for the previous period, an estimate is made of the tax revenues receivable and refundable at year end based on prior year provisional tax assessments.

The net operating surplus figure is based on the relevant methodology adopted for the financial year.

Income tax revenue has a high degree of estimation and is therefore uncertain. Application of key assumptions used in estimating income tax revenue may not necessarily reflect actual tax returns when they are filed. The estimation of income tax revenue is challenging because estimation is required so far ahead of the point when a taxpayer is required to file relevant income tax returns. In addition, forecasts of firms' net operating surplus are inherently uncertain and volatile, particularly with the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy. While we have confidence in the reliability of Stats NZ's quality assurance processes in releasing the quarterly data series, Stats NZ revises previously published data when more information comes to light.

GST (Goods and Services tax)

GST returns are assessed on a 1, 2, 3 or 6-monthly basis and are due the month after the end of the period. At year end, Inland Revenue estimates the amount of GST outstanding as follows.

*   For customers who file a return of GST for the June period, the actual amounts filed are used.
*   For customers who have not filed a return, the estimate is based on the most recently assessed GST return.

Source deductions (PAYE)

Employers are required to file an employment information form for each payday. Revenue is assessed based on these forms. June employment information forms filed by employers in July are accrued at year end.

Child support

Child support revenue is the penalties levied on child support debts owed to both custodial persons and the Crown by parents who pay child support, as well as child support due to the Crown. This revenue is recognised initially at fair value and subsequently tested for impairment at year end.

Interest unwind - Small Business Cashflow Scheme

Small Business Cashflow Scheme loans are initially discounted to fair value. This predominantly reflects the time value of money. As time moves on, loans become closer to being repaid and are therefore worth more. This increase in value is recognised as interest unwind.

The interest unwind has been calculated using a discount rate appropriate for low-rated commercial and unsecured retail lending.

Interest unwind - student loans

Student loans are initially discounted to fair value. This predominantly reflects the time value of money. As time moves on, student loans become closer to being repaid and are therefore worth more. This increase in value is recognised as interest unwind.

The interest unwind has been calculated using the official cash rate plus a risk adjustment calculated by the consulting actuaries.

Fair value remeasurement - Small Business Cashflow Scheme

Fair value remeasurement is the change in the value in the loan portfolio over the year. Small Business Cashflow Scheme loans are initially measured at fair value. The changes to fair value between periods are recognised as a gain or loss in the net surplus or deficit. More information is provided in Note 6.

Fair value remeasurement - student loans

Fair value remeasurement is the change in the value in the student loan portfolio over the year. Student loans are initially measured at fair value. The changes to fair value between periods are recognised as a gain or loss in the net surplus or deficit. More information is provided in Note 7.

Note 3 - Receivables (2023)
===========================

Receivables include general taxes, Working for Families Tax Credits and COVID-19 debt (excluding the Small Business Cashflow Scheme) and any penalties and interest associated with these activities. These are non-contractual sovereign receivables. The interest and penalties charged on receivables are presented as revenue in the Schedule of Non-Departmental Revenue. Receivables for child support, the Small Business Cashflow Scheme and student loans are reported separately in notes 4, 5 and 6 respectively.

Receivables are initially recognised at face value as the fair value is not materially different from the face value. Receivables are subsequently tested for impairment at year end in accordance with PBE IPSAS 26 Impairment of Cash-Generating Assets.

Allowances for amounts that Inland Revenue does not expect to recover are recognised when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. Impairments are included in the Schedule of Non-Departmental Expenditure. Impairment losses can be reversed where there is evidence that the impaired value of the asset has increased.

At the end of the year, receivables are valued by an independent external valuer using predictive models. We provide data to the valuer on receivable balances and repayments. The data is up to 30 June 2023.

To calculate the impairment of receivables, assumptions are applied to future repayment behaviour, as well as economic factors such as discount rates. The key assumptions are explained below:

*   The recoverable amount of receivables is calculated by forecasting the expected repayments based on analysis of historical debt data, deducting an estimate of collection costs and then discounting using an appropriate rate. If the recoverable amount of the portfolio is less than the carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount. Alternatively, if the recoverable amount is more, the carrying amount is increased.
*   Tax pooling funds held in the Crown bank accounts have been netted off against receivables. These funds have been deposited by commercial intermediaries and allow customers to pool tax payments to reduce their exposure to use-of-money interest. Underpayments and overpayments are offset within the same pool.

The gross value of tax receivables at 30 June 2023 is $23.641 billion, an increase of $1.386 billion (6.2%).

Not yet due debt has increased by $433 million (2.4%), reflecting higher income tax revenue this year. However, the main driver of the increase in tax receivables is past due debt which has increased in 2022–23 by $974 million (20.1%) to $5.820 billion. This growth is larger than in 2021–22, when the past due debt increased by $462 million (10.5%).

The increase in overdue tax debt is mainly due to increases in GST, income tax and employer activities debt balances. These debt balances are $415.3 million and $352.2 million and $193.6 million higher respectively than in 2021–22.

| **$4,846,000** | **Total past due debt** | **$5,820,200** |

We are seeing a growing number of customers getting into debt, most likely as a result of the current global economic environment and the unpredictable economic influence of adverse weather events seen earlier in the year.

Despite the increase in past due debt over the last year, the amount of debt collected has been higher than projected in previous valuations. However, this is not expected to continue in 2023–24 and it is expected that defaults on tax debt may increase in the near future. The recent increase in employer activities debt support this, as employer activities debt is typically the first tax type to be repaid by businesses. There has also been an increase in the number of businesses opting to set up instalment arrangements to manage their tax debt. As a result, the valuer has decreased the repayment ratios across all tax types for the 30 June 2023 valuation. For the valuation assumptions, the valuer has used a weighted average of the previous 5 years of repayments.

However, as noted by the valuer, it is not possible to fully assess the implications of global economic uncertainty on the fair value of the tax balances or the economy as a whole (both in terms of length and the degree of impact).

The uncertain and volatile nature of future debt repayments means that there may be significant uncertainty in the estimated value of these receivables. The valuation reflects the increased levels of debt observed in the data up to 30 June 2023. Future repayments of debt will be dependent on the economic conditions our customers face and on the impact of our compliance activities and relief mechanisms such as instalment arrangements.

Overall, the valuation resulted in an impairment of $713 million for 2022–23 and an increase in the average impairment of overdue tax debt from 67.63% to 68.30%.

The fair value of tax receivables at 30 June 2023 is $19.630 billion, an increase of $672 million (3.5%) from 2021–22.

1 Not due receivables comprise estimations or assessments for tax where the tax has been earned but is not yet due to be paid, and returns that have been filed before due date. It also comprises social policy receivables not yet due to be paid.

2 Receivables are classified as past due when they are not received from customers by their due date. Due dates will vary, depending on the type of revenue owing (for example, income tax, GST or KiwiSaver) and the customer's balance date. Past due debt includes debts collected under instalment, debts under dispute, default assessments and debts of customers who are bankrupt, in receivership or in liquidation. Inland Revenue has debt management policies and procedures in place to actively manage the collection of past due debt.

The estimated recoverable amount of this portfolio, and the significant assumptions underpinning the valuation of carrying value receivables, are shown below.

The fair value of receivables is not materially different from the carrying value.

Credit risk

Under the Tax Administration Act 1994, Inland Revenue has broad powers to ensure that people meet their obligations. Part 10 of the Act sets out the powers of the Commissioner to recover unpaid tax.

The Crown does not hold any collateral or any other credit enhancements over receivables which are past due.

Receivables are widely dispersed over a number of customers and, as a result, the Crown does not have any material individual concentrations of credit risk.

Note 4 – Receivables–child support (2023)
=========================================

Child support is money paid by parents who do not live with their child, or who share care with someone else. The money is to help with the cost of raising a child.

Liable parents can manage their child support payments through Inland Revenue by using a formula assessment or voluntary agreement, or they can be arranged through a private agreement with the other parent or non-parent carer.

For child support managed by Inland Revenue, liable parent payments are passed to receiving carers to the extent that the receiving carer has not received a benefit from Te Manatū Whakahiato Ora, the Ministry of Social Development. The withheld amount is the Crown entitlement, and this is legally enforceable. Receiving carer entitlements are not recognised as revenue, and any funds yet to be passed to the receiving carers are recorded in the Child Support Trust Account as presented in the Schedule of Non-Departmental Trust Money.

Penalties are imposed when there are defaults on child support payments.

Child support receivables include the Crown entitlement and penalties. The Crown entitlement and penalties are presented as revenue in the Schedule of Non-Departmental Revenue. Receivables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently tested for impairment at year end in accordance with PBE IPSAS 26 Impairment of Cash-Generating Assets.

Allowances for amounts that Inland Revenue does not expect to recover are recognised when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. Impairments are included in the Schedule of Non-Departmental Expenditure. Impairment losses can be reversed where there is evidence that the impaired value of the asset has increased.

From 1 July 2023, the Crown entitlement will no longer be withheld by the Crown and the total liable parent payments will be passed on to receiving carers. Crown entitlement revenue and receivables is therefore expected to decrease from 2023–24.

Child support valuation model, significant assumptions and uncertainties

At the end of the year, receivables are valued by an independent external valuer using predictive models. We provide data to the valuer on receivable balances and repayments up to 30 June 2023.

To calculate the impairment of receivables, assumptions are applied to future repayment behaviour as well as economic factors such as discount rates. The recoverable amount of receivables is calculated by forecasting the expected repayments based on analysis of historical debt data and then discounting it using an appropriate rate. If the recoverable amount of the portfolio is less than the carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount. Alternatively, if the recoverable amount is more, the carrying amount is increased.

As noted by the valuer, the uncertain and volatile nature of future repayments, as well as the impact of changes in the way Inland Revenue collects payments, means that there is significant uncertainty in the estimate of value.

The fair value of child support receivables at 30 June 2023 is $238 million, a decrease of $60 million from last year.

Child support receivables include the Crown entitlement and penalties. The Crown entitlement and penalties are presented as revenue in the ‘Schedule of non-departmental revenue’. Receivables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently tested for impairment at year end.

[Schedule of non-departmental revenue](/about-us/publications/annual-corporate-reports/annual-report/annual-report-2021/financial-schedules-non-departmental/schedule-of-non-departmental-revenue)

Allowances for amounts that Inland Revenue does not expect to recover are recognised when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. Impairments are included in the ‘Schedule of non-departmental expenditure’. Impairment losses can be reversed where there is evidence that the impaired value of the asset has increased.

Child support valuation model, significant assumptions and uncertainties
------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the end of the year, receivables are valued by an independent external valuer using predictive models. Inland Revenue provided data to the valuer on receivable balances and repayments. The data was up to 31 March 2021. The 30 June 2021 fair valuation is rolled forward from the 31 March 2021 results.

To calculate the impairment of receivables, assumptions are applied to future repayment behaviour, as well as economic factors such as discount rates. Key assumptions are explained below.

*   The recoverable amount of receivables is calculated by forecasting the expected repayments based on analysis of historical debt data and then discounting it using an appropriate rate. If the recoverable amount of the portfolio is less than the carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount. Alternatively, if the recoverable amount is more, the carrying amount is increased.
*   From October 2021, child support services will transition into the START system. This system will automatically set up instalment arrangements for any customers who are employed and have child support debt. This will result in a significant increase in customers with automatic deductions. This change is expected to increase repayments.
*   Recent legislative changes to the Child Support Act 1991 include that liable parents who are employees must have their child support deducted from their salary and wages. This is effective from 1 October 2021. This change is expected to increase repayments.

As noted by the valuer, it is not possible to assess with any certainty the implications of COVID-19 on the value of child support receivables.

There will be an impact on parents and it will affect their ability to repay child support. Repayment assumptions used for the valuation reflect a 3-year average period prior to the pandemic. As economic conditions progress to a post-pandemic normal in the coming years, there is additional uncertainty in our projections of fair value as past experience may not be exactly indicative of the future in a post-pandemic economic environment.

Changes this year
-----------------

There have been a number of changes for child support this year:

*   Unpaid Crown entitlement has been recognised on the ‘Schedule of non-departmental assets’ at fair value in accordance with PBE IPSAS 23 Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions. Previously this was not recognised. This change has increased the carrying value of child support receivables by $155 million (nominal value: $257 million). For the 2019-20 comparative, this is estimated to be $141 million (nominal value: $234 million). The comparatives have not been restated.  
    [Schedule of non-departmental assets](/about-us/publications/annual-corporate-reports/annual-report/annual-report-2021/financial-schedules-non-departmental/schedule-of-non-departmental-assets)
    
*   An independent external valuer was engaged to value the receivable as at 30 June 2021. In previous years, the valuation was conducted by Inland Revenue.
*   A significant number of child support penalties have been written off this year.
*   Incremental penalties will no longer be charged following recent legislative changes to the Child Support Act 1991, effective 1 April 2021.

The fair value of child support receivables at 30 June 2021 is $228.050 million, an increase of $148.492 million from last year. This increase is largely due to the recognition of past due Crown entitlement.

Credit risk
-----------

The Crown does not hold any collateral or any other credit enhancements over receivables for child support which are past due.

Receivables for child support are widely dispersed over a number of customers and as a result the Crown does not have any material individual concentrations of credit risk.

Note 5 - Small Business Cashflow Scheme (2023)
==============================================

The purpose of the Small Business Cashflow Scheme is to assist small-to-medium-sized businesses impacted by COVID-19. It provides loans to businesses employing 50 or fewer full-time equivalent employees for a maximum loan term of 5 years. The loans are administered by Inland Revenue.

Eligible businesses can borrow a $20,000 base amount plus an additional $1,800 per equivalent full-time employee, up to a maximum loan of $110,000. To be eligible for the loans, borrowers need to declare that they are a viable business and that they will use the money for core business operating costs.

New lending for the scheme ends on 31 December 2023. Loans are interest-free for the first 2 years and then an interest rate of 3% per annum applies. Repayments are not required for the first 2 years, but voluntary payments can still be made. After this period, regular principal and interest payments are required to be paid on outstanding balances.

Inland Revenue holds the total nominal debt, administers the initial fair value write-down expense and any subsequent fair value adjustments and is responsible for collecting the loan.

Small Business Cashflow Scheme loans are designated at fair value through surplus or deficit under PBE IPSAS 41 Financial Instruments because it is uncertain when borrowers will make repayments.

The difference between the amount of the loan and the fair value on initial recognition is recognised as an expense.

The initial fair value is lower than the amount of the initial loan for a number of reasons, including that:

*   repayments are not required for the first 2 years
*   the time value of money will erode the value of future repayments because there is no interest charged in the first 2 years
*   the interest rate of 3% charged is lower than the market interest rates for loans to small-to-medium-sized businesses
*   borrowers may default on their obligations.

After loans are issued, an adjustment is made each month to unwind the interest. This adjusts the present value of the write-down over time. We also receive repayments from borrowers.

At the end of the year, actuarial and predictive models are used to compare the carrying value to the fair value of the loan portfolio, and the difference will be recognised in the surplus and deficit of the Financial Statements of the Government of New Zealand. The difference is also shown in the Schedule of Non-Departmental Gains and Losses.

We use the following key terms to help define loan values:

**Fair value**

The market value of loans if they could be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s-length transaction.

Show all

Nominal value

The total amount owed by borrowers at a point in time, including loan principal and interest.

Since the scheme began in May 2020, $2.363 billion has been disbursed and $911 million has been repaid. The nominal and fair value of the loan balance as at 30 June 2023 are $1.478 billion and $786 million, respectively.

Financial instruments–fair value hierarchy disclosures

For those instruments recognised at fair value in the Schedule of Non-Departmental Assets, fair values are determined according to the following hierarchy:

*   quoted market price (level 1)—financial instruments with quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets
*   valuation technique using observable inputs (level 2)—financial instruments with quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets and financial instruments valued using models where all significant inputs are observable
*   valuation techniques with significant non-observable inputs (level 3)—financial instruments valued using models where 1 or more significant inputs is not observable.

The Small Business Cashflow Scheme is valued at 30 June 2023 using significant non-observable inputs (level 3). There are no quoted market prices (level 1) and no observable inputs (level 2).

The next section provides details on the model, and the table below outlines the significant assumptions and sensitivities for the level 3 valuation technique.

Small Business Cashflow Scheme valuation model, significant assumptions and uncertainties

At the end of the year, the Small Business Cashflow Scheme is valued by an independent external valuer using actuarial and predictive models. We provide data to the valuer on borrowing and repayments and data on borrowers such as industry and region. The data is up to 30 June 2023.

The key assumptions in determining the $786 million fair value of Small Business Cashflow Scheme loans as at 30 June 2023 are the timing of principal and interest repayments and the default rates.

The most critical assumption is the default rates which have been explicitly modelled for each industry sector and cross-checked by modelling using market discount rates. An additional cross-check was provided by applying banking capital requirements and a risk-weighted assets assumption to estimate the regulatory capital required for a bank owning these loans. This has enabled a calculation of the hypothetical fair value of the loans to a New Zealand bank.

As noted by the valuer, there are significant uncertainties in estimating the fair value of the scheme. The key uncertainties include:

*   the scheme is new and there is limited data to determine the likely repayment default experience
*   there are limited reference points to determine discount rates for discounting the cashflows
*   there are uncertainties from the ongoing impact of COVID-19, broader geopolitical and economic uncertainties and recent natural disasters on the wider economy and on the specifics of the businesses receiving loans from the scheme
*   the uncertain and volatile nature of the future debt repayments.

The fair value movement at 30 June 2023 is an increase of $241 million (2022: $168 million decrease). This is mainly due to stronger repayments than forecast, which increases the value of the scheme by $238 million.

A breakdown of the fair value remeasurement—Small Business Cashflow Scheme loans reported in the Schedule of Non-Departmental Gains and Losses is set out below:

| $54,000 | Impact on fair value of a 10% decrease in the initial fair value write-down ($000) | $10,000 |

The loan portfolio is exposed to a variety of financial instrument risks, including credit risk and interest rate risk.

Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that borrowers will default on their obligation to repay their loans, causing the scheme to incur a loss. The risk of default has been assumed to be equivalent to a C-grade investment.

The scheme does not require borrowers to provide any collateral or security to support advances made. As the total sum advanced is widely dispersed over a large number of borrowers, the scheme does not have any material individual concentrations of credit risk.

Inland Revenue will use a variety of activities that inform and assist customers to repay their loans and enforce compliance to reduce the risk of non-payment of obligations.

Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in interest rates.

Changes in interest rates impact discount rates. There is a risk that, if interest rates rise, the value of the scheme will significantly decrease as the discount rates applied to the expected future repayments will be higher, decreasing their value.

Changes in interest rates could also impact on the Government’s return on loans advanced. The interest rate attached to the loans is set by the Government.

Note 6 - Small Business Cashflow (loan) Scheme
==============================================

(References to surplus and deficit in this note refer to the surplus and deficit of the ‘Financial Statements of the Government of New Zealand’).

On 12 May 2020, the Government opened the Small Business Cashflow (loan) Scheme to assist small-to-medium-sized businesses impacted by COVID-19. The scheme is administered by Inland Revenue and provides loans of up to $100,000 to businesses employing 50 or fewer full-time equivalent employees for a maximum loan term of 5 years. Eligible businesses can borrow $10,000 plus an additional $1,800 per equivalent full-time employee. To be eligible for the loans, borrowers need to declare that they are a viable business, and that they will use the money for core business operating costs.

On 9 November 2020, the scheme was extended to 31 December 2023 and the interest-free conditions were extended from 1 year to 2 years, including pre-existing loans.

Loans are interest-free if they are paid back within 2 years. Otherwise, the interest rate will be 3% per annum for a maximum term of 5 years.

Repayments are not required for the first two years, but voluntary payments can still be made over this period. During months 25 to 60, regular principal and interest payments are required to be paid on outstanding balances.

Inland Revenue holds the total nominal debt, administers the initial fair value write-down expense and any subsequent fair value adjustments, and is responsible for collecting the loan.

Small Business Cashflow Scheme loans are designated at fair value through surplus or deficit under PBE IFRS 9 Financial Instruments.

The difference between the amount of the loan and the fair value on initial recognition is recognised as an expense.

The initial fair value is lower than the amount of the initial loan for a number of reasons, including that:

*   repayments are not required for the first 2 years
*   the time value of money will erode the value of future repayments, because there is no interest charged in the first 2 years
*   the interest rate of 3% charged is lower than the market interest rates for loans to small-to-medium-sized businesses
*   borrowers may default on their obligations.

At the end of the year, actuarial and predictive models are used to compare the carrying value to the fair value of the loan portfolio and the difference will be recognised in the surplus and deficit of the ‘Financial Statements of the Government of New Zealand’.

We use the following key terms to help us define loan values.

*   **Fair value -** The market value of loans if they could be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s-length transaction.
*   **Nominal value -** The total amount owed by borrowers at a point in time, including loan principal, interest, fees and penalties.

Small Business Cashflow (loan) Scheme valuation model, significant assumptions and uncertainties
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the end of the year, the Small Business Cashflow (loan) Scheme is valued by an independent external valuer using actuarial and predictive models. Inland Revenue provides data to the valuer on borrowing and repayments, and data on borrowers such as industry and region. The data is up to 30 June 2021.

The key assumptions in determining the $921 million fair value of Small Business Cashflow Scheme loans as at 30 June 2021 are the timing of principal and interest repayments and the default rate. The most critical assumption is the default rate of 29.4% which has been explicitly modelled for each industry sector and cross-checked by modelling using market discount rates. An additional cross-check was provided by applying banking capital requirements and a risk-weighted assets assumption to estimate the regulatory capital required for a bank owning these loans. This has enabled a calculation of the hypothetical fair value of the loans to a New Zealand bank.

As noted by the valuer, there are significant uncertainties in estimating the fair value of the scheme. The key uncertainties include:

*   the scheme is new and there is limited data to determine the likely repayment default experience
*   there are limited reference points to determine discount rates for discounting the cashflows
*   there are uncertainties from the impact of COVID-19 on the wider economy or on the specifics of the businesses receiving loans from the scheme
*   the uncertain and volatile nature of the future debt repayments.

The modelling and sensitivity analysis undertaken by the valuer notes a wide range of possible fair values, estimated to be +/- 20% of the fair value.

This can be expressed as a fair value between $600 million and $1.200 billion.

The significant assumptions and sensitivities behind the fair value are:

| 2020 |     | 2021 |
| --- | --- | --- |
|     | **Assumptions** |     |
| 3.00% | Loan interest rate | 3.00% |
| 29.70% | Default rate | 29.40% |
| 15.00% | Discount rate | 13.00% |
|     | **Sensitivities** |     |
| $(285,000) | Impact on fair value of a 20% increase in the initial fair value write-down ($000) | $(60,000) |

| $143,000 | Impact on fair value of a 10% decrease in the initial fair value write-down ($000) | $30,000 |

The loan portfolio is exposed to a variety of financial instrument risks, including credit risk and interest rate risk.

Credit risk
-----------

Credit risk is the risk that borrowers will default on their obligation to repay their loans, causing the scheme to incur a loss. The risk of default has been assumed to be equivalent to a C-grade investment.

The scheme does not require borrowers to provide any collateral or security to support advances made. As the total sum advanced is widely dispersed over a large number of borrowers, the scheme does not have any material individual concentrations of credit risk.

Inland Revenue will use a variety of activities that inform and assist customers to repay their loans and enforce compliance to reduce the risk of non-payment of obligations.

Interest rate risk
------------------

Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in interest rates.

Changes in interest rates impact discount rates. The risk is that if interest rates rise, the value of the scheme will significantly decrease as the discount rates applied to the expected future repayments will be higher, decreasing their value.

Changes in interest rates could also impact on the Government’s return on loans advanced. The interest rate attached to the loans is set by the Government.

Note 6 - Student loans (2023)
=============================

StudyLink (Te Manatū Whakahiato Ora, the Ministry of Social Development) administers the initial capital lending and issues student loans, which are then transferred to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue holds the total nominal debt, administers the initial fair value write-down expense and any subsequent fair value adjustments, and is also responsible for the collection of debt.

Student loans are designated at fair value through surplus or deficit under PBE IPSAS 41 Financial Instruments because borrowers only start repayments if they earn an income above a certain threshold.

The difference between the amount of the student loan and the fair value on initial recognition is recognised as an expense. The initial fair value is lower than the amount of the initial student loan for a number of reasons, including that:

*   some borrowers will never earn enough to repay their loans
*   some overseas-based borrowers will default on their payment obligations
*   because there is no interest charged on New Zealand-based borrowers’ balances, the time value of money will erode the value of future repayments.

After loans are issued, an adjustment is made each month to unwind the interest. This adjusts the present value of the write-down over time. We also receive repayments from borrowers.

At the end of the year, actuarial models are used to compare the carrying value to the fair value of the student loan portfolio, and the difference is recognised in the surplus and deficit of the Financial Statements of the Government of New Zealand. The difference is also shown in the Schedule of Non-Departmental Gains and Losses. Details of the models are provided later in this note.

We use the following key terms to help define student loan values:

### **Fair value**

The market value of student loans if they could be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s-length transaction.

### Nominal value

The total amount owed by borrowers at a point in time, including loan principal, interest, fees and penalties.

The nominal and fair values of student loans are shown in the table below.

Financial instruments–fair value hierarchy disclosures

For those instruments recognised at fair value in the Schedule of Non-Departmental Assets, fair values are determined according to the following hierarchy:

*   quoted market price (level 1)—financial instruments with quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets
*   valuation technique using observable inputs (level 2)—financial instruments with quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets and financial instruments valued using models where all significant inputs are observable
*   valuation techniques with significant non-observable inputs (level 3)—financial instruments valued using models where 1 or more significant inputs is not observable.

Student loans as at 30 June 2023 are valued using significant non-observable inputs (level 3). There are no quoted market prices (level 1) and no observable inputs (level 2).

The next section provides details on the model, and the table below outlines the significant assumptions and sensitivities for the level 3 valuation technique.

Student loan valuation model

At the end of the year, the student loan portfolio is revalued to fair value by an independent external valuer using actuarial models. Tatauranga Aotearoa, Stats NZ collates most of the data for the actuarial valuation model from: Inland Revenue; Te Tāhuhu o Te Mātauranga, the Ministry of Education; and Te Manatū Whakahiato Ora, the Ministry of Social Development. The data is made up of borrowings, repayments, income, educational factors and socio-economic factors. It is current up to 31 March 2022. In addition, supplementary data from Inland Revenue and Te Mana Ārai o Aotearoa, the New Zealand Customs Service, about loan transactions and borrowers’ cross-border movements for the period up to 31 March 2023, is also included. 

The fair value movement, recognised in the Schedule of Non-Departmental Gains and Losses, relates to changes in discount rate and a reassessment of the expected repayments of loans. The fair value movement at 30 June 2023 is an increase of $500 million. This increase incorporates the following changes to the fair value:

*   The discount rate adjustments have increased the value of the scheme by $194 million (2022: $1.670 billion decrease). This is largely due to risk-free rate and risk adjustment changes. The discount rates used for determining the fair value are equal to Te Tai Ōhanga the Treasury’s prescribed risk-free rates for accounting valuations plus a risk adjustment. Since 30 June 2022, risk-free rates have generally increased, which has decreased the fair value of the student loan portfolio by $309 million. Differences in the discount rates applied to interest unwind and initial fair value write-down contributed a further $36 million decrease in fair value. The risk adjustment decreased from 3.08% to 1.71%, which is in line with market data, increasing the fair value by $539 million.
*   Expected payment adjustments related to the impact of COVID-19 have increased the fair value by $135 million (2022: $76 million increase). The 2022 valuation included a provision for a decline in repayments from overseas-based borrowers. Direct COVID-19 impacts are no longer a large contributor to global and domestic economic uncertainty and, as a result, we have released this entire provision.
*   The other expected repayment adjustments have increased the fair value of the student loan portfolio by $142 million (2022: $443 million increase). They are:

*   Updated macroeconomic assumptions have increased the fair value by $48 million (2022: $242 million increase). This can be broken down into 3 components:

*   An increase of $49 million due to higher salary inflation assumptions, resulting in higher projected domestic incomes, domestic borrower obligations and repayments.

*   An increase of $11 million due to higher loan and late payment interest rate assumptions (i.e., more interest collected).

*   A decrease of $12 million due to increases to CPI assumptions meaning lower domestic repayment obligations.

*   The experience variance—this has increased the value by $44 million (2022: $89 million increase), largely due to higher-than-expected repayments and lower-than-expected write-offs.

*   Updates to the expense assumption—these have increased the value by $2 million (2022: $68 million increase).

*   Other modelling changes, including the roll forward of data–these have increased the value by $48 million (2022: $44 million increase).

*   Updates to the cost of loan collection–these have increased the value by $29 million (2022: $38 million increase).

The student loan valuation model reflects current student loan policy and macroeconomic assumptions. The fair value is sensitive to changes in a number of underlying assumptions and judgements, including future income levels, repayment behaviour and macroeconomic factors such as inflation and discount rates. As noted by the valuer, it is not possible to assess with any certainty the implications of the global economic uncertainty on the fair value of the scheme or the economy as a whole, in terms of the length or degree of impact. For these reasons, the valuation has a high degree of inherent uncertainty and there is a significant risk of material adjustment to the fair value in future accounting periods. The key risks are:

*   The proportion of overseas-based borrowers making a repayment is an important metric for the scheme, as the value of the loans for these borrowers hinges on their compliance. We have seen some deterioration in the proportion of overseas borrowers making a repayment in recent data and this has been reflected in the model. There is a risk that the deterioration is underestimated in the valuation.
*   There is uncertainty in the domestic and global economies as economies around the world experience high inflation. Central banks have been responding by increasing interest rates in an attempt to curb inflation, but this may lead to increases in levels of unemployment that would affect repayment rates. There has been no explicit adjustment to the valuation to account for this. However, the fair value includes a risk adjustment, part of which accounts for general uncertainty in the economic outlook. In addition, macroeconomic forecasts used in the valuation take into account the current economic outlook. There is a risk that the fair value of the scheme may decrease at future valuations if the economic outlook worsens.
*   Migration in and out of New Zealand has been severely impacted by the Government response to the COVID-19 pandemic. With the borders fully re-opened in 2022, there is uncertainty around whether net migration will return to pre-pandemic levels for student loan borrowers, or whether there may be a spike in the number of borrowers leaving New Zealand due to pent-up demand. No allowance has been made at this valuation as there is too much uncertainty about future net migration. There is a risk that experience may differ significantly from the assumptions.
*   There is uncertainty around the characteristics and behaviour of borrowers who do not have an income. There is a risk that experience for this group may differ significantly from assumptions.

The student loan portfolio is exposed to a variety of financial instrument risks, including credit risk and interest rate risk.

Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that borrowers will default on their obligation to repay their loans or die before their loan is repaid, causing the scheme to incur a loss. The risk of death or default cannot be quantified.

The Student Loan Scheme does not require borrowers to provide any collateral or security to support advances made. As the total sum advanced is widely dispersed over a large number of borrowers, the Student Loan Scheme does not have any material individual concentrations of credit risk.

The credit risk is reduced by the collection of compulsory repayments through the tax system. This is less effective with overseas-based borrowers. Many New Zealand-based borrowers earning over the income threshold have compulsory deductions from salary and wages to repay their loans. Overseas-based borrowers are required to make repayments twice a year based on their loan balance. Inland Revenue uses a variety of communications and campaigns to reduce the risk of non-payment of obligations.

Loans are written off in the event of death or bankruptcy.

Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in interest rates.

Changes in interest rates impact discount rates. There is a risk that if interest rates rise, the value of the scheme will significantly decrease as the discount rates applied to the expected future repayments will be higher, decreasing their value.

Changes in interest rates could also impact on the Government’s return on loans advanced. The interest rate and the interest write-off provisions attached to student loans are set by the Government.

Note 7 - Student loans
======================

(References to surplus and deficit in this note refer to the surplus and deficit of ‘the Financial Statements of the Government of New Zealand’).

StudyLink (Ministry of Social Development) administers the initial capital lending and issues student loans, which are then transferred to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue holds the total nominal debt, administers the initial fair value write-down expense and any subsequent fair value adjustments, and is also responsible for the collection of debt.

Student loans are designated at fair value through surplus or deficit under PBE IFRS 9 Financial Instruments.

The difference between the amount of the student loan and the fair value on initial recognition is recognised as an expense. The initial fair value is lower than the amount of the initial student loan for a number of reasons, including that:

*   some borrowers will never earn enough to repay their loans
*   some overseas-based borrowers will default on their payment obligations
*   because there is no interest charged on New Zealand-based borrowers’ balances, the time value of money will erode the value of future repayments.

At the end of the year, actuarial models are used to compare the carrying value to the fair value of the student loan portfolio and the difference is recognised in the surplus and deficit of the Financial Statements of the Government of New Zealand. Details of the models are provided later in this note.

We use the following key terms to help us define student loan values.

*   **Fair value -** The market value of student loans if they could be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s-length transaction.
*   **Nominal value -** The total amount owed by borrowers at a point in time, including loan principal, interest, fees and penalties.

For those instruments recognised at fair value in the ‘Schedule of non-departmental assets’, fair values are determined according to the following hierarchy:

*   quoted market price (level 1) - financial instruments with quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets
*   valuation technique using observable inputs (level 2) - financial instruments with quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets and financial instruments valued using models where all significant inputs are observable
*   valuation techniques with significant non-observable inputs (level 3) - financial instruments valued using models where one or more significant inputs is not observable.

Student loan valuation model
----------------------------

At the end of the year, the student loan portfolio is revalued to fair value by an independent external valuer using actuarial models. Stats NZ collates most of the data for the actuarial valuation model from Inland Revenue, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Social Development. The data is made up of borrowings, repayments, income, educational factors and socio-economic factors. It is current up to 31 March 2020. In addition, supplementary data from Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Customs Service, about loan transactions and borrowers’ cross-border movements for the period up to 31 March 2021, is also included.

The fair value movement, recognised in the surplus and deficit, relates to changes in discount rate and a reassessment of the expected repayments of loans.

The fair value movement at 30 June 2021 is an increase of $745 million. This increase incorporates the following changes to the fair value.

*   The discount rate adjustments have increased the value of the scheme by $221 million (2020: $343 million). This is largely due to risk free rate and risk premium changes. The discount rates used for determining the fair value are equal to the Treasury’s prescribed risk-free rates for accounting valuations plus a risk premium. Since 30 June 2020, risk free rates have increased, which has decreased the fair value of the student loan portfolio by $448 million. The risk premium decreased from 2.66% to 1.65%, which is in line with market data, increasing the fair value by $612 million. The market spreads have been gradually reducing back to pre-COVID-19 levels.
*   Adjustments for the impact of COVID-19 increase the fair value by $230 million (2020: $507 million decrease). It is now expected that fewer borrowers will be adversely impacted by COVID-19. Since the 2020 June valuation, more data on overseas repayments has been available to assist with reviewing the COVID-19 allowances. In summary, the New Zealand economy has shown remarkable resilience to date. In terms of unemployment, there are specific regions and industries that have suffered more than others. On aggregate, the previously assumed spike in unemployment has not materialised to date and the Treasury does not expect this spike to happen in the latest forecasts. The Treasury’s expectations around when border restrictions will ease, and when net migration will return to pre-COVID-19 levels, remain unchanged (migration is assumed to return to its normal patterns from 1 April 2022). Finally, for overseas repayments, there is no indication of a decline or any evidence of deterioration in overseas compliance so far. The adjustment includes the following.
    *   Updated modelling assumptions for employment have increased the value by $102 million. The actual experience for the first year of our COVID-19 allowance, which is the period 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021, has been positive, indicating little impact from COVID-19 to date on student loan repayments. The consequence is that fewer borrowers are predicted to be unemployed or underemployed as at 31 March 2021 than originally expected. This in isolation has increased the fair value by $48 million. The explicit allowances in the models have been reduced for a shock to future employment outcomes by 33%, which increased the fair value by $54 million. This impact relates to 1 April 2021 and onwards. The migration allowance and the provision for a potential deterioration in overseas compliance in unchanged.
    *   Updated macroeconomic assumptions have increased the fair value by $128 million (2020: $131 million decrease), of which $106 million relates to updated salary assumptions. Salary inflation assumptions have mostly increased this year, resulting in higher projected domestic incomes, domestic borrower obligations and repayments.
*   Other expected repayment adjustments have increased the value of the student loan portfolio by $80 million (2020: $27 million increase).
*   Other modelling changes, including the roll forward of data, increased the impaired value by $173 million (2020: $16 million).

A breakdown of the fair value remeasurement - student loans reported in the Schedule of non-departmental gains and losses is set out below.

| $31,000 | Expected repayment adjustment | $257,000 |
| **$(97,000)** | **Total fair value remeasurement - student loans** | **$745,000** |

The student loan valuation model reflects current student loan policy and macroeconomic assumptions. The fair value is sensitive to changes in a number of underlying assumptions and judgements, including future income levels, repayment behaviour and macroeconomic factors, such as inflation and discount rates. As noted by the valuer, it is not possible to assess with any certainty the implications of COVID-19 on the fair value of the scheme or the economy as a whole, in terms of the length or degree of impact. There is a small amount of data available to determine the impact of COVID-19 and the modelling adjustments made involve significant judgement and were based on input from the Treasury and other experts. For these reasons, the valuation has a high degree of inherent uncertainty and there is a significant risk of material adjustment to the fair value in future accounting periods. The key risks are as follows:

*   Before COVID-19, there were improvements in overseas compliance. We expect that overseas compliance will deteriorate as a result of COVID-19, but there has been no evidence of deterioration so far. There is a risk that the deterioration is underestimated in the valuation.
*   The model assumes that low-earner borrowers will remain low earners for the same duration in the future as they do currently. There is a risk that this group will increase due to COVID-19 and rising unemployment. If the length of time that borrowers remain low earners increases, a decrease in fair value may result.
*   The proportion of borrowers becoming low earners (that is, earning below $29,600 per annum) continues to be above 50% for those studying lower-level certificates. If this trend continues, long-term earners not in substantive employment will increase and a decrease in fair value may result.
*   The modelling for migration is based on a four-year average of cyclical migration trends rather than current peaks and troughs in migration. This year, explicit modelling has been done for COVID-19. There is a risk that migration trends may be different to what has been modelled and, therefore, impact on the fair value.
*   There have been substantial changes in key data sources used for the valuation model as a result of the implementation of the new START system delivered by Inland Revenue’s transformation programme. A number of data issues were identified and fixed during the valuation process, but there is a risk that additional errors may be identified in the future.
*   The risk premium methodology will be reviewed in 2021-22 (delayed from 2020-21). A change in methodology is a possibility and may have a significant impact on the fair value.

The student loan portfolio is exposed to a variety of financial instrument risks, including credit risk and interest rate risk.

Credit risk
-----------

Credit risk is the risk that borrowers will default on their obligation to repay their loans or die before their loan is repaid, causing the scheme to incur a loss. The risk of death or default cannot be quantified.

The Student Loan Scheme does not require borrowers to provide any collateral or security to support advances made. As the total sum advanced is widely dispersed over a large number of borrowers, the Student Loan Scheme does not have any material individual concentrations of credit risk.

The credit risk is reduced by the collection of compulsory repayments through the tax system. This is less effective with overseas-based borrowers. Many New Zealand-based borrowers earning over the income threshold have compulsory deductions from salary and wages to repay their loans. Overseas-based borrowers are required to make repayments twice a year based on their loan balance. Inland Revenue uses a variety of communications and campaigns to reduce the risk of non-payment of obligations.

Loans are written off on death, for hardship, bankruptcies and in other special circumstances.

Interest rate risk
------------------

Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in interest rates.

Changes in interest rates impact discount rates. The risk is that if interest rates rise, the value of the scheme will significantly decrease as the discount rates applied to the expected future repayments will be higher, decreasing their value.

Changes in interest rates could also impact on the Government’s return on loans advanced. The interest rate and the interest write-off provisions attached to student loans are set by the Government.

Performance of the scheme
-------------------------

A detailed explanation and insight into the performance of the scheme is available in the Student Loan Scheme Annual Report on the Education Counts website.

Note 9 - Property, plant and equipment (2023)
=============================================

Inland Revenue has operational assets that include information technology (IT) equipment, furniture, office equipment, motor vehicles and leasehold improvements. The capitalisation thresholds are:

*   IT equipment - Over $2,000  
    
*   Furniture - Over $2,000  
    
*   Office equipment - Over $2,000  
    
*   Motor vehicles - No threshold  
    
*   Leasehold improvements - No threshold

Certain items of IT equipment, furniture and office equipment, which are low value and high quantity such as chairs and IT monitors, are pooled together. All pooled assets are capitalised.

Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Historical cost is the value of consideration given to acquire or create the asset, and includes any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to working condition for its intended use.

Show all

Additions

The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as an asset if it is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential associated with the item will flow to Inland Revenue beyond 1 year, and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. In most instances, an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised at its cost. Where an asset is acquired through a non-exchange transaction, it is recognised at fair value as at the date of acquisition.

Subsequent costs

Subsequent costs are capitalised when it is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential associated with the item will flow to Inland Revenue beyond 1 year and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All repairs and maintenance are expensed.

Depreciation

Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis on all property, plant and equipment other than assets under construction. The rate of depreciation will reduce the value of the asset to the estimated residual value over the useful life of the asset. The useful lives of major classes of assets have been estimated as:

*   IT equipment - 3 to 5 years   
    
*   Furniture - 3 to 10 years  
    
*   Office equipment - 5 to 10 years   
    
*   Motor vehicles - 3 to 5 years  
    
*   Leasehold improvements - 3 to 10 years

All property, plant and equipment other than motor vehicles are assumed to have no residual value. Motor vehicles are assumed to have a 20% to 40% residual value.

The cost of leasehold improvements is capitalised and depreciated over the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated remaining useful life of the improvements, whichever is shorter, up to a maximum of 10 years.

Assets under construction are recognised at cost less impairment and are not depreciated. The total cost of a capital project is transferred to the appropriate asset class on its completion and then depreciated.

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance date. 

Disposals

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount. These are recognised on a net basis in the net surplus or deficit.

Impairment

Property, plant and equipment that have a finite useful life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Property, plant and equipment are also reviewed annually for indicators of impairment at each balance date. Assets under construction are tested for impairment at each balance date.

An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable service amount. The recoverable service amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use.

Value in use is the present value of the asset’s remaining service potential. Value in use is determined based on either the depreciated replacement cost or the restoration cost, depending on the nature of the impairment and the availability of information.

If an asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable service amount, the asset is considered to be impaired and is written down to the recoverable service amount. The impairment loss and any reversal of impairment loss are recognised in the net surplus or deficit.

Notice - Income tax treatment of unsuccessful software development
==================================================================

Notice that part of the information in 'Income Tax Treatment of Computer Software' (TIB, 1993) is incorrect and cannot be relied on.

_Income Tax Treatment of Computer Software_ was published in an appendix to _Tax Information Bulletin_ Volume Four, No 10 (May 1993) (the TIB item) provides that the cost of unsuccessful software development can be immediately deducted (whether the software is commissioned or developed in house). The TIB item acknowledges that such software is a capital item but allows a deduction on the basis that ss108K of the Income Tax Act 1976 (now s EE39 of the Income Tax Act 2007) applies. The Commissioner considers that this view is incorrect. Therefore, this part of the item should not be relied on.

Section EE 39 applies to items of depreciable property that have previously been, but are no longer, used in a taxpayer's income earning process. It does not apply to items (such as incomplete software) that have never been used in a taxpayer's income earning process.

The principles relating to the deductibility of expenditure incurred in developing or acquiring a capital asset are set out in the interpretation statement [_IS 08/02: Deductibility of Feasibility Expenditure_](/interpretation-statements/is0802-deductibility-of-feasibility-expenditure)
 (published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 20, No 6 (July 2008). The following summary assumes that the taxpayer is developing software for use in an existing business or income-earning activity.

*   Software developed for use in an income earning process will provide the taxpayer with an enduring benefit, and will generally be a capital asset.

*   Expenditure incurred in undertaking feasibility studies to determine whether to develop a capital asset will be prima facie deductible under s DA 1(1) (assuming the asset is to be used in the taxpayer's income earning process). In the context of software development this means that expenditure incurred analysing the feasibility of developing a piece of software for use in a business would be deductible. This is consistent with the position set out in the TIB item, which refers to this as the "pre-development phase".

*   Accordingly, expenditure incurred principally for the purpose of placing a taxpayer in a position to make an informed decision about the development of some software will not generally be expenditure incurred in relation to that software. However, once a decision has been made to proceed with the development, any expenditure incurred beyond that point will relate to the acquisition of the software and/or rights in the software. From that point on, expenditure should be capitalised. The rights in the software (if that is what has been obtained) are then able to be depreciated provided they are “depreciable property” and are used or available for use in the taxpayer’s income earning process.

*   Consequently, it is possible that certain expenditure may never be deductible. This would occur when the expenditure is capital in nature but not depreciable property because the relevant property never came into existence or was never used in the business (see for example _Milburn NZ Ltd v CIR_ (2001) 20 NZTC 17,017 and _Softwood Pulp and Paper Co Ltd v FCT_ 76 ATC 4,438).

The parts of the TIB item that suggest that a taxpayer is allowed a deduction of expenditure on software development where the software is never implemented or used in the taxpayer’s income earning process should hereby be treated as being withdrawn effective from the beginning of the 2011/12 income year. Taxpayers taking a taxpayer's tax position after that date should not rely on those parts of the item.

The remainder of the TIB item should be used with some care. The TIB item applies the Income Tax Act 1976. Legislative changes inevitably mean that some parts of the item will no longer be applicable. If in doubt, Inland Revenue recommends that advice from a tax advisor is sought. Inland Revenue intends to update this item as part of its review of PIBs and TIB items issued before 1996.

Notice of claim struck out for not complying with procedural requirements of Tax Administration Act 1994
========================================================================================================

The Taxation Review Authority upheld an application by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to strike out the disputant’s notice of claim.

Case

TRA 013/17 \[2018\] NZTRA 04

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994 ss 89AB(4)(a), 138B, 138D(1) and (2), and 138H.

### Summary

The Taxation Review Authority (“the TRA”) upheld an application by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") to strike out the disputant’s notice of claim on the basis that the proceedings were not commenced by the disputant within the response period under s 138B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("the TAA"), and that the disputant did not establish exceptional circumstances to allow the disputant to commence the proceedings after the response period pursuant to s 138D(1) of the TAA.

### Impact

This decision confirms that the procedural requirements for commencing challenge proceedings must be strictly adhered to. It also follows the decision of _Muir v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2017\] NZHC 2082 which stands for the proposition that it is not possible to file amending documents where there is no underlying claim.

### Facts

The Disputes Review Unit ("the DRU") sent a letter to the disputant on 13 April 2017 enclosing its adjudication report following determination of the disputant's tax dispute in relation to the 2012 and 2013 income tax years.

On 24 April 2017, the investigator wrote to the disputant's accountant referring to the adjudication report, and stating that the DRU had accepted the disputant's proposed adjustments in part and had directed that a further adjustment be made on the basis of the conclusion in the adjudication report. Enclosed with the letter was a notice of assessment dated 24 April 2017.

The Commissioner's computer-generated notices of assessment dated 10 July 2017 were received on or about 14 July 2017.

The director of the disputant company emailed a completed notice of claim form to the Tribunals Unit on 21 June 2017 ("the initial notice of claim"). In a reply email dated 21 June 2017, the Registry stated it could not accept filing by email and that it would be necessary for the disputant to file 3 copies of the notice of claim and relevant documents by courier or post. Details of the street and postal addresses were provided together with the form to be completed for payment of the fee by credit card.

In an email to the Registry dated 22 June 2017, the director stated that he would not be able to obtain the additional information which was held by his accountant who was overseas and whom he understood would be back on or about 1 or 2 July 2017. The director observed that he would not like to work out what paperwork his accountant had prepared for this claim without his permission. He went on to say:

"I could just go to his office and look through the file and hopefully find it, he had written a (sic) extensive letter for my lawyer to go over before he left but for some reason believed I had more time to reply as no assessments had been loaded on the tax system, I will address this with him on his return."

"My lawyer was the one who rang me on Tuesday night to ask if I was filing a claim for the mistakes in the assessments. I told him I had not received any assessments and that no changes had been made on a tax system to indicate assessments had been issued."

"He informed me that even though no assessments had been forwarded to me nor that they had been loaded on the IRD system, it was the letter dated 24 April that was the time frame I had to act on."

The director stated that he then forwarded the initial notice of claim by overnight courier and included a payment form for payment by credit card. He sent an email to the Tribunals Unit on 23 June 2017 advising the Registry of this and noting that he would send the additional information as soon as he had access to it.

A notice of claim was subsequently filed on 18 September 2017 by the disputant's accountant. The notice was dated "21/6/17 (updated/amended 11/9/17)". This notice of claim was served on the Commissioner.

### Decision

The Judge found that the notice of claim was not filed within the prescribed time in compliance with s 138B of the TAA.

The Judge was satisfied that the Commissioner issued a notice of assessment on 24 April 2017. Accordingly, the two-month period in which the disputant was required to file the proceedings in the TRA started on 24 April 2017 and ended on 23 June 2017.

The Judge noted that it was apparent from the director's email of 21 June 2017 that he was aware that the time period commenced on 24 April 2017. Furthermore, the notice of claim was eventually filed on 18 September 2017 so that even if the two-month period commenced from the date of the computer-generated notices, the proceedings were still commenced outside the requisite two-month period.

The disputant, relying on rr 1.8 and 2.6(2) of the District Court Rules 2014, contended that the initial notice of claim was filed within the prescribed time and that the subsequent filing was an amendment to the original filing. The Judge rejected this argument. Regulation 4 of the Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998 ("the Regulations") states that to the extent that they are not inconsistent with these Regulations, or the provisions of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 or the TAA, the District Court Rules 2009 (now the District Court Rules 2014) apply to the commencement, interlocutory steps and conduct of proceedings in the Authority as if these proceedings were civil proceedings in the District Court.

The Judge noted that the requirements for the filing and service of the notice of claim set out in the Regulations are mandatory. The disputant did not file and serve within the statutory time period three copies of the notice of claim containing the documents required under reg 8, together with payment of the filing fee as required. Furthermore, the initial notice of claim was not served on the Commissioner.

The Judge referred to _Muir v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2017\] NZHC 2082 and stated that it is not possible to file amending documents where no underlying claim in fact exists.

The Judge also found that there were no exceptional circumstances under s 138D(2) of the TAA.

In the disputant's notice of opposition, it asserted that exceptional circumstances existed in that the act or event causing the delay was beyond the control of the disputant. In the director's first affidavit, he referred to "ongoing health issues, accountant away and who also had health issues" as reasons why the disputant could not review the initial notice of claim and presumably ensure that it was properly filed.

In the disputant's submissions, the events or circumstances relied upon were identified as being that the disputant did not have in its possession all the necessary documents to file the claim, the documents being either with the disputant's accountant or withheld by the Commissioner. Further, the disputant's accountant was out of New Zealand at the time of filing and when he returned he had work commitments and health issues.

The disputant contended that the unique feature of this case is that the disputant did commence its challenge within the required time "as best it was able". The director filed an initial notice of claim which he knew would need to be amended. Further, the disputant would have filed the additional documents if they had been in its possession, and accordingly, this provides reasonable justification.

The Judge did not accept that any of these matters amounted to extraordinary circumstances in the context of s 138D (1) and (2) of the TAA. The Judge noted that the events and circumstances relied upon appeared to relate to the period around the end of June 2017 and subsequent. No evidence had been given as to why the notice of claim could not have been filed prior to that time.

The Commissioner's application under s 138H to strike out the notice of claim in its entirety was granted.

2017 case note - guidance on Article 25 of the NZ/Korea double tax agreement – Chatfield, judicial review, justiciability, relevant considerations.

Case

Chatfield & Co Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2017\] NZHC 3289

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994: s 17, Judicature Amendment Act 1972, Double Taxation Relief (Republic of Korea) Order 1983 (SR 1983/5): Schedule 1

### Summary

Chatfield & Co Ltd and Chatfield & Co (“collectively **Chatfield**”) applied to judicially review a decision of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) to issue 15 Notices to Furnish Information under s 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“the TAA”) to it (“the Notices”). A partially successful strike out application left one cause of action (being an alleged failure to take into account the terms of a double taxation agreement between the Republic of Korea (“Korea”) and New Zealand (“NZ”) (“the DTA”)) to proceed to a substantive hearing. The High Court found that cause of action was made out and granted the application for judicial review, quashing the Notices.

Any appeal of the judgment must be brought by 13 February 2018.

### Impact

The judgment provides guidance on the interpretation of Article 25 of the NZ-Korea DTA.

### Facts

The National Tax Service of the Republic of Korea (“the NTS”) asked the Commissioner, pursuant to the DTA, to obtain and provide certain information relating to a number of Companies (“the Companies”) associated with a Korean Taxpayer (“the Taxpayer”).

Information relating to five of the Companies was able to be obtained from the Commissioner’s existing records or publicly available sources. The remaining material was not available through these sources. The Commissioner accordingly proceeded to issue the Notices to Chatfield, the tax agent for the Companies, under s 17 of the TAA, in relation to that remaining material, referencing article 25 of the DTA. The Notices were signed by an Investigations Team Leader.

In May 2015 Chatfield commenced judicial review proceedings challenging the Commissioner’s decision to issue the Notices. They also sought orders for the disclosure of the NTS request and any and all exchanges between the Commissioner and the NTS relating to it.

That application for disclosure was declined. While Ellis J agreed that in principle it was possible to obtain such disclosure, and disclosure is governed by s 81 of the TAA, her Honour ultimately formed the view that the Commissioner was not required to disclose the requested documents pursuant to s 81. This was upheld by the Court of Appeal (on the basis the documents were not relevant to Chatfield’s amended claim) and leave to appeal to the Supreme Court was declined.

### Decision

The Court granted the application for judicial review, declaring that the decision to issue the Notices was invalid and quashing the Notices.

_Section 17 of the TAA, DTAs and Exchange of Information_

The Court accepted s 17 powers may be used for the purposes of gathering information for exchange with a foreign state under the DTA as it forms part of the Revenue Acts.

The Court noted that in an increasingly globalised environment where not all information required to monitor compliance with a taxpayer’s obligations will be available in any one state tax treaties seek to facilitate exchange of information between states.

The Court noted the unique nature of DTAs which have direct effect in NZ’s domestic law once given effect by order in council, and that in the event of any inconsistency with the Revenue Acts s BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides the DTA prevails.

_Justiciability_

The Court rejected the argument that the decision to issue the Notices was not justiciable, finding that:

1.  the case did not question the executive’s decision to enter into the DTA, raise comity issues, nor challenge any act of Korea as a foreign state;
2.  the DTA forms part of NZ domestic law and interpretation of both the TAA and DTA is within the Court’s constitutional competence;
3.  the case did not concern high policy or politically fraught issues;
4.  the Commissioner’s actions in issuing s 17 notices can be the subject of judicial review if the Commissioner exceeds or abuses her powers (and prior authority in the DTA context is to the same effect); and
5.  other checks and balances applicable to DTAs (in particular the OECD’s peer review regime) do not involve curial oversight, focus on individual cases or provide remedies to individual taxpayers.

_Lawfulness of actions_

The parties accepted that faced with the request for the exchange of information from the NTS Mr Nash must be satisfied:

1.  the information sought came within the terms of the DTA and NZ’s tax laws;
2.  the nature of the information sought was (or at the least appeared to be) consistent with the grounds for the request; and
3.  the type of information sought was broadly what would be expected to be necessary for or relevant to any inquiry of the nature indicated.

The Court determined that the word “necessary” in art 25 of the DTA required the competent authority to satisfy himself by clear and specific evidence that all of the information requested was needed or required in relation to an investigation into, or other action being taken by the NTS against a Korean taxpayer and the information was in relation to income tax, corporation tax, inhabitant tax or fiscal evasion. He also had to be satisfied any information exchanged would only be used in relation to those taxes and that the NTS had been unable to obtain the information in Korea.

The Court did not agree it could simply consider the Commissioner’s affidavits (and ask whether there are any errors of a material or substantive nature evident from them), nor rely on Mr Nash’s assurances and infer he had considered all that he was required to.

The Court noted the difficulty caused by the absence of the NTS request letter, any correspondence between Mr Nash and the NTS in relation to the request or file notes from Mr Nash in relation to the matter (the material), (noting Chatfield’s unsuccessful attempts to obtain the material through the Courts) and did not consider an offer to make relevant material available on a confidential basis to be acceptable on the basis that it would be contrary to the rules of natural justice.

The Court had asked the Commissioner to seek NTS views on the release of the material to an amicus curiae to enable the Court to hear opposing argument on the issue. The response was opposition to both the proposed release of the documents to an amicus and the provision of the letter outlining that opposition to anyone other than the Court.

The Court was not satisfied with the information supplied by the Commissioner and found it could not be satisfied that the nature of the information sought by NTS was consistent with the grounds for the request and that the information was of a sort which would broadly be expected to be necessary or relevant to any inquiry of the nature indicated in the request.

The Court noted that while a judicial review applicant bears the burden of proof on the balance of probabilities, the evidential burden will be relatively low where the facts are within the knowledge of the other party, particularly where the Court has to determine whether the relevant facts on which the exercise of the power in issue turns, did or did not exist.

The Court found this to be such a case. Based on the little raised by Chatfield and the limited evidence filed on behalf of the Commissioner, the Court was not satisfied Mr Nash had undertaken the appropriate inquiries.

_Delegation_

The Court considered the argument the Investigations Team Leader who signed the Notices was not a competent authority and had no authority to make any decisions under article 25 of the DTA to be misconceived as nothing in the DTA or TAA requires Mr Nash to personally take the necessary administrative steps to procure information.

_Intensity of Review_

The Commissioner submitted the Court should only intervene if it found the nature of the information sought was such that it could not be potentially necessary to an investigation relating to one or more of the taxes set out in article 2 of the DTA. She also submitted neither the Court nor Mr Nash could be expected to inquire into factual assertions underlying the request nor what is required under Korean law as to do so would amount to a mini trial involving the determination of potentially difficult questions of foreign law.

The Court found there was no need for deference to the Commissioner when inquiring into TAA or DTA requirements and that review in this context can and should be hard-edged, applying a “correctness standard”. The question is whether or not the Court can be satisfied Mr Nash did what he was required to do by law and there was nothing in the facts to support a conclusion that a light touch, deferential or lesser standard of review was required or appropriate.

In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Cabinet Committee on State Sector Reform and Expenditure Control DELIVERING STAGE 1 OF NEW ZEALAND’S FUTURE REVENUE SYSTEM Proposal 1.This paper provides an update regarding Inland Revenue’s progress in preparing for implementation of Stage 1 of New Zealand’s future revenue system, as directed by Cabinet (CAB-15-MIN-0249 refers). I am asking Cabinet to note progress, as outlined in the attached Transformat ion Update dated November 2016. Business transformation is a long-term programme to modernise New Zealand’s revenue system 2.Transformat ion will deliver a modern, digital, revenue system that serves the needs of all New Zealanders. It will improve government’s ability to make policy changes more quickly and cost effectively, contribute to a growing, healthy economy, and create an information asset to deliver improved outcomes. 3.The goal is a revenue system that is simple to comply with, making it easy for customers to get things right and difficult to get wrong. As a result of transformation voluntary compliance will increase, and the effort required by customers to meet their obligations and receive their correct entitlements will reduce. 4.Transformat ion will re-shape how customers interact with government and Inland Revenue, and will include improvements to policy and legislative settings. In the future, most customers will not need to interact with Inland Revenue. Those with less complex needs will use automated, straight-through digital services that take less time and are more efficient. 5.Inland Revenue will put customers at the centre. This means helping customers from the start rather than when things go wrong and making more intelligent use of information. Customers expect government to provide intuitive and personalised services. Organising activities around customers and outcomes and improved analytical capabilities will enable Inland Revenue to generate insights that create better value for customers and government, and make sense of increasing volumes of data. The quality and frequency of the information available to Inland Revenue will improve providing opportunities for broader access to this information when it is needed. 6.In the future earlier, more complete and more accurate information will be available to Inland Revenue which will mean fewer under or over payments for customers. Information will be checked when it is received and errors fixed wherever possible. Increasingly, customers won’t have to do anything as their information will be provided to Inland Revenue 1 Proactive release This document was released by Inland Revenue under section 81(1B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This release supports the purposes of the Official Information Act 1982 by increasing progressively the availability of official information to the people of New Zealand. on their behalf. For those that do, their systems and processes will be integrated with Inland Revenue’s and part of their everyday activities. 7.Inland Revenue will ensure Ministers have on-going visibility of the costs and benefits of transformat ion. High-level design of Stages 2 and 3 is underway as a key input to confirming the costs and benefits of Stage 2. Once detailed design is further advanced Stage 2 costs and benefits will be reported to Cabinet by March 2017 to coincide with the Budget process. Stages 2 and 3 are being considered together given the close linkages between income information and the calculation of social policy entitlements. 8.The timing of transformat ion updates in July and December each year with a report back in March to confirm any inputs required for the Budget process is likely to be a recurring pattern. Through transformation, Inland Revenue is making a significant contribution to Government priorities 9.Transformat ion will make a significant contribution to improving digital interactions with government, the Business Growth Agenda, and achieving Better Public Services Results 9 and 10. Once Stage 1 is implemented customers will be able to use their New Zealand Business Number (NZBN) to identify themselves to Inland Revenue and be able to authenticate their identity to Inland Revenue using RealMe as an option. 10.A key feature of the future revenue system is greater integration between public and private business partners. Inland Revenue has made significant strides in this area. In recent months customers using cloud-based accounting software have been able to integrate tax into their business processes. The GST filing service through accounting software was made available to all MYOB and Xero GST-registered customers in July 2016 - more than 185,000 businesses. 1 From January to 31 October 2016 there were more than 43,000 GST submissions. More than half of these have been received since the end of the pilot in June 2016. The number of submissions received since July 2016 has increased significantly compared to the pilot period. 11.This is posit ively impacting customers’ perceptions of the effort required from them to meet their GST obligat ions. Inland Revenue has recently completed its 2016 survey of compliance costs for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Surveyed customers were very positive about the service. One respondent stated “Using Xero saves a lot of time, so I basically put zeroes to most timing questions”. Another said “Our GST is calculated by our accounting software so the time involved is minor”. 12.Customers estimated in the 2016 survey that the time spent meeting their GST obligations was 14 hours a year. This is down from the estimate of 24 hours each year in the 2013 survey. The time spent complying with income tax obligations was estimated at 6 hours a year in 2016 - reduced from 12 hours a year in 2013. 1 Source: Xero annual meeting presentation, 20 July 2016. MYOB do not publish comparable figures. 2 13.Overall, the customers surveyed felt that compliance costs have reduced due to better service from Inland Revenue, less paperwork, a mo ve to digital filing and improved online services. The survey is the key mechanism for measuring progress in realising the economic benefits of transformat ion. 14.Inland Revenue originally estimated that small and medium businesses would spend approximately 9 fewer hours a year on GST compliance by 2023/24 as a result of the changes being introduced in Stage 1. The steps the department has taken over the last year have already significantly reduced customers’ perceptions of effort for GST, broadly in line with the estimates made. The overall target is to reduce the average hours small and medium businesses spend on meeting their compliance obligations across all tax types by 18-26 hours per annum by 2023/24. Inland Revenue is on track and on budget to successfully implement Stage 1 by the end of April 2017 or earlier if possible 15.Stage 1 is the first step in delivering a digitally-based, highly-automated revenue system that fits seamlessly into people’s lives. New and improved services, reduced compliance costs and better access to information are expected to benefit small/medium enterprises and not-for-profit organisations. 16.Extensive engagement and communication is underway to ready customers and stakeholders for the changes being introduced. In June 2016 Inland Revenue’s Changing for You website went live to raise awareness among small business owners about what dealing with tax might look like in the future. The site had received more than 52,000 unique visits as at the end of October 2016. 17.From June to October 2016, in conjunction with the Minister for Small Business and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), Inland Revenue participated in the “Taking care of business” small business road-shows. The road-shows were an opportunity to talk to local businesses about the initiatives being introduced to make tax simpler and reduce compliance effort, including new GST services and the new Accounting Income Method (AIM) for calculating provisional tax. 18.Engagement with tax agents and other tax professionals is on-going. Inland Revenue is offering webinars and is speaking at a number of conferences. In addition Inland Revenue established a small tax agent group in September 2016. This group acts as a sounding board regarding how informed and ready they and their customers are leading up to Stage 1 go-live. Engagement with the not-for-profit sector is also underway and will continue. 19.On-going engagement with the tax sector, government consultation on policy changes, and the Changing for You campaign all provide New Zealanders with a voice on how tax administration can be simplified for future generations. 20.Direct communication with customers about the changes to GST administration began in October 2016 and will continue up to and following go-live by the end of April 2017 or earlier if possible. Most impacted customers will receive multiple communications that will 3 be supported by information on Inland Revenue’s website and by radio and digital advertising. 2 21.Implementing GST in START 3 will introduce new online services that will enable customers to: •Amend their GST returns and accounts; •Register for GST; •Register as a preparer of tax returns; •Set up payment plans; •Include attachments; and •Track their GST payments and refunds. 22.I n addit ion: •Customers will be able to use their NZBN and RealMe to identify and authenticate themselves to Inland Revenue. •The range of services available through the Companies Office will be enhanced to ensure incorporated entities can continue to be able to incorporate with the Companies Office, get an IRD number, register for GST and register as an employer as part of the same transaction. •New immigrants will be able to digitally register for an IRD number. 23.I am confident that preparations for go-live are well in hand, with the development of START on track, testing well underway, and customer and staff communications in train. Stringent criteria will need to be met before a decision to go-live is made to ensure that services and systems work as expected. The readiness of customers, Inland Revenue, and the programme for go-live will be assessed regularly over the coming months. 24.The July 2017 transformat ion update will provide an overview of the results of the go- live of Stage 1, and include customer uptake of new services if this is available. Rigorous and comprehensive testing, including customer validation of new services, is underway 25.From late August through to November 2016 customer user experience validation of new services being introduced in Stage 1 took place. Inland Revenue checked wit h customers that the new services: •personalise and simplify their interactions with Inland Revenue •provide certainty and assurance that they have met their obligations •minimise the effort required by them to pay and/or receive the right amounts, and 2 As per Cabinet Office Circular CO (15) 4, this expenditure will require the approval of the Minister of Revenue. 3 START stands for simplified tax and revenue technology and is the name chosen by Inland Revenue for the GenTax software provided by FAST Enterprises LLC. 4 • are intuitive, easy to use and enable them to manage their own affairs. 26. In October 2016, customers were involved in validating the accessibility of new services from their own premises using their own devices. Customer involvement will continue right throughout transformat ion. Work on policy and legislative settings continues on a broad range of fronts and is tracking as expected 27. The Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill contains the law changes needed to implement Stage 1, the business tax package announced as part of Budget 2016 and the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI). 4 It also contains the law changes needed to allow transitional regulations and administrative exemptions to resolve any potential issues during the co-existence 5 of FIRST and START. 28. Workshops to design, implement and communicate the new Accounting Income Method (AIM) for calculating provisional tax announced as part of Budget 2016 are underway. Inland Revenue is working wit h a range of key parties including software developers, small business accountants, and the Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand (CAANZ). Regular workshops are planned with CAANZ in the lead up to the implementation of AIM on 1 April 2018. Discussions with software developers about how AIM might be accommodated into software are also underway. 29. An Omnibus Bill is expected to be introduced in February 2017 to implement the policy changes arising from the administration of PAYE and GST, and investment income information. This Bill will also include any critical law changes needed for Stage 2. Legislative amendments are Inland Revenue’s preferred approach with transitional regulations and administrative exemptions limited to issues identified too late for inclusion in a Bill. Transformation is tracking well financially 30. Inland Revenue reports actual versus expected spend for transformation every month as part of its regular reporting to the Minister of Finance and me. Transformation is currently tracking under budget for Stage 1 due to less effort being required to manage co-existence impacts than initially thought, and to timing differences resulting from commercial agreements and enabling technology costs. 31. Customer communications and engagement activity will ramp up in the lead up to Stage 1 and enabling technology costs will be incurred. However the department is forecasting remain under budget for Stage 1. The Minister of Finance and I will discuss the 4 AEOI will enable the discovery of formerly undetected tax evasion. It provides for the exchange of non- resident financial account information with the tax authorities in the account holders’ country of residence. Participating jurisdictions that implement AEOI send and receive pre-agreed information each year, without having to send a specific request. 5 Co-existence refers to the requirement to support both FIRST and START during the transition, as customer information will be split across both systems until all products are administered in START. 5 treatment of any remaining under-spend with Inland Revenue once Stage 1 has gone live. The department has a good track record of returning under-spent funding having returned $5.1 million following the design phase, which was completed in December 2015. 32.Effective cost management has also meant that the majority of the contingency funding set aside has not been required to date. As Inland Revenue has previously advised (CAB-15-MIN-0249 refers), a substantial proportion of the contingency has been allocated to the early stages of transformation. Inland Revenue will seek authorisation from the Ministers of Finance and Revenue (CAB-15-MIN-0249 refers) to move unused contingency funding to later periods. Planning for Stage 2 is well underway as it is significantly bigger in scope and complexity than Stage 1 33.In line with the roadmap attached as an annex and noted by Cabinet (CAB-15-MIN- 0249 refers) a small, separate team within the programme has been working to confirm the scope of Stage 2 and mobilise the resources needed to begin detailed design. This approach has ensured that the majority of the programme can focus their efforts and attention on ensuring successful implementation of Stage 1. 34.The scope of Stage 2 is all tax products including AIM, gaming machine duty 6 and AEOI. Stage 2 will also include enhanced online services for customers for the products in scope and some new contact options such as a possible extension of click-to-chat following a pilot period. 35.In preparation for Stage 3, Inland Revenue has begun engaging with the Minister of Finance and me on the objectives and scope of the proposals to reform the administration of the social policy programmes that the department administers. 36.Transformat ion, combined with the implementation of Budget 2016 measures and other initiatives such as base erosion and profit shifting and foreign trusts, will mean a significant volume of change for customers, staff, other stakeholders, and Inland Revenue. As a result Inland Revenue envisages that re-priorit isation will be required if further initiatives are added. 37.Inland Revenue is continuing to engage widely with other public sector agencies to share its experience and insights. This will continue. Transformation remains inherently high-risk 38.While Inland Revenue is well positioned, transformation is in its early stages and remains inherently high risk. Implementation risk for Stage 1 is being mitigated by starting with a relatively simple tax, keeping technical integration for co-existence to a minimum, and proactively supporting customers and staff to understand and adopt new services. 6 Gaming Machine Duty is a stand-alone duty, not linked to other taxes in Stage 2. However implementing this in stage 2 or 3, should allow the FIRST mainframe to be decommissioned at the end of Stage 3 rather than at the end of Stage 4 as originally envisaged. 6 39.The key risks facing transformation are: •Recruiting and retaining experienced resources of the right calibre. Inland Revenue has developed retention strategies and succession plans to help to mitigate this risk. •Customers and staff must embrace change for the expected benefits to be realised. On-going focus on preparing customers and staff for change and on driving uptake of new services will ensure understanding and adoption. •Government may not be easily able to implement significant policy proposals at short notice as Inland Revenue may not easily be able to accommodate sudden changes in sequencing and priorities. On-going dialogue with Ministers will ensure that changes in priorities are understood and that any implications for costs, benefits or risks are highlighted. 40.Progress and risks will be constantly re-assessed and any new opportunities which arise will need to be balanced against any potential slowing of progress or increase in risk. 41.A robust assurance management plan is in place for transformation incorporating regular independent quality assurance (IQA) and Gateway reviews. KPMG is the department’s IQA provider. The Minister of Finance and I receive copies of all IQA reports and are provided with the opportunity to meet with reviewers. Reviews completed to date have concluded that transformation is being managed and governed well. Next steps 42.The next steps are to: •continue preparations for the implementation of Stage 1 by the end of April 2017 or earlier if possible •begin detailed design for Stage 2 in January 2017 •confirm the costs and benefits of Stage 2 by March 2017 as an input to Budget 2017, and •implement the measures in the business tax package effective from 1 April 2017 that modernise and extend withholding rules, reduce the impact of late payment penalties, and enable greater sharing of information. F inancial implications 43.The proposals in this paper have no financial implications. Human rights implications 44.The proposals in this paper have no human rights implications. Legislative implications 45.The proposals in this paper do not require any changes to legislation. 7 Regulatory impact analysis 46.The proposals in this paper do not require a Regulatory Impact Statement. Publicity 47.I intend to ask Inland Revenue to publish the November 2016 Transformat ion Update and this paper on its website once it has been considered by Cabinet. Consultation 48.A copy of this paper has been provided to the Accident Co mpensat ion Corporation, the Department of Internal Affairs, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Social Development, the New Zealand Customs Service and Statistics New Zealand. Central agencies’ comment (The Treasury, State Services Commission and Government Chief Information Officer) 49.Corporate centre agencies were consulted on this update. 50.S ince the July update, Inland Revenue has progressed into testing and data migration in preparation for stage one go-live. The latest assurance review focussed on the strategy adopted for this process, finding examples of good practice and making recommendations for improvement. Inland Revenue has accepted these recommendations and has actions planned or underway to incorporate them in run-up to go-live. The next Independent Quality Assurance activity will re-review this process and provide assurance over Inland Revenue’s readiness to deploy. 51.Planning for stage two has begun. Stage two will see the remaining tax types Inland Revenue administers migrated to the new platform. As Inland Revenue notes, stage two is significantly larger in scope and greater in complexity than stage one. Minimising changes to the tax types in scope of stage two will be important for controlling risk. From a system perspective we have noted the need to detail in the March update the impact that stage two changes will have on wider central and local government systems, and the Crown’s readiness for these proposals. We will work closely with IR to monitor the impacts of BT stage two on the system. 52.Inland Revenue continues to play an active role in system transformation leadership through their participation in GCIO Partnership Framework. Inland Revenue has a clearer approach to adopting common capabilities including RealMe and ICT capabilities such as IaaS, ECMaaS and TaaS. 7 Inland Revenue has also advanced information sharing through participating in the Gangs Intelligence Hub and working to enable more effective sharing with MSD through the AISA. 8 Further opportunities are inherent in the proposed TAA 7 Infrastructure as-a-Service, Enterprise Content Management-as-a-Service, Telecommunications-as -a-Service. 8 Approved information sharing agreement. 8 reforms and we will continue to work closely with the BT programme to promote these and new opportunities for system improvement. 53.Recruitment for a new programme director is underway. It is not uncommon for programmes of this length to see changes to programme management. The programme has good governance structures in place, which will reduce the impact of this change as recruitment progresses. Recommendations I recommend that the Committee: 1.Note that Stage 1 of Inland Revenue’s transformation is on track for implementation by the end of April 2017 or earlier if possible; 2.Note that customers’ perceptions of the effort required by them to meet their GST obligations has reduced, in part due to the availability of digital filing; 3.Note that the July 2017 transformat ion update will provide an overview of the results of the go-live of Stage 1; 4.Note that the confirmed scope of Stage 2 is all tax products, including the Accounting Income Method for calculating provisional tax, gaming machine duty and the Automatic Exchange of Information; 5.Note that the costs and benefits of Stage 2 will be confirmed by March 2017 once the detailed design of this stage is further advanced.

November 2016 Transformation Update Implementing Stage 1 of the future revenue system N ovember 2016 Ve rsion: FINAL C OMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Proactive release This document was released by Inland Revenue under section 81(1B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This release supports the purposes of the Official Information Act 1982 by increasing progressively the availability of official information to the people of New Zealand.

A modern, digital revenue system will serve the needs of all New Zealanders, improve government’s ability to make policy changes more quickly and cost effectively, contribute to a growing, healthy economy, and create an information asset to deliver improved outcomes. The goal is a revenue system that is simple to comply with, making it easy for customers to get things right and difficult to get wrong. As a result of transformation, voluntary compliance will increase, and the effort required by customers to meet their obligations and receive their correct entitlements will reduce. Business transformation will re-shape how customers interact with government and Inland Revenue. In the future, most customers will not need to interact with Inland Revenue. Those with less complex needs will use automated, straight-through digital services that take less time and are more efficient. Shifts in behaviour are already evident, with more customers using digital services. This has enabled Inland Revenue to realise some early benefits, such as a saving of approximately $1 million to date in printing and postage. Inland Revenue recognises that the revenue system interacts with the social policy, business, education, and justice sectors as well as the private sector. Understanding customers’ broader circumstances will help to deliver positive, personalised, timely and seamless customer experiences. Policy changes will be required to simplify requirements for customers. Inland Revenue will put customers at the centre. This means helping customers from the start rather than when things go wrong; and making more intelligent use of information. Customers expect government to provide intuitive and personalised services. Organising activities around customers and outcomes, and improved analytical capabilities will enable Inland Revenue to generate insights that create better value for customers and government, and make sense of increasing volumes of data. The quality and frequency of the information available to Inland Revenue will improve, providing opportunities for broader access to this information when it is needed. Inland Revenue will also benefit from access to a greater range of information. In the future earlier, more complete and more accurate information will be available to Inland Revenue which will mean fewer under or over payments for customers. Information will be checked when it is received and errors fixed wherever possible. Increasingly, customers won’t have to do anything as their information will be provided to Inland Revenue on their behalf. For those that do, their systems and processes will be integrated with Inland Revenue’s and part of their everyday activities. Opportunities for non-compliance will reduce as core accounting transactions will be provided through accounting software. Stage 1 will deliver significant improvements for customers. Through transformation, Inland Revenue is making a significant contribution to improving digital interactions with government, and to achieving Better Public Services Results 9 and 10. Once Stage 1 is implemented customers will: •be able to use their New Zealand Business Number (NZBN) to identify themselves to Inland Revenue; •have access to an enhanced range of services through the Companies Office; •be able to authenticate their identity to Inland Revenue using RealMe as an option; and •new immigrants will be able to digitally register for an IRD number. Implementing GST in START 1 will deliver further improvements through new online services that will enable customers to: •Amend their GST returns and accounts; •Register for GST; •Register as a preparer of tax returns; •Set up payment plans; •Include attachments; and •Track their GST payments and refunds. 1 START stands for simplified tax and revenue technology and is the name chosen for the GenTax software provided by FAST Enterprises LLC. Commercial in confidence Page 3 Executive summary (page 2 of 2) Inland Revenue has already taken the first steps in changing how customers interact with the revenue system. As at 31 October 2016, more than 43,000 GST submissions have been received through MYOB and Xero accounting software. Customer feedback is positive, with some noting a significant reduction of effort: “Using Xero saves a lot of time, so I basically put zeroes to most timing questions”. Inland Revenue is working with MYOB and Xero to influence customers’ behaviour and drive further uptake. Inland Revenue originally estimated that small and medium businesses would spend approximately 9 fewer hours a year on GST compliance by 2023/24 as a result of the changes being introduced in Stage 1. A recent survey of small and medium businesses indicates that the actions the department has taken over the last year have already significantly reduced their perceptions of effort for GST, broadly in line with the estimates made. Engagement with businesses, tax agents and key stakeholder groups is on-going. During 2016, Inland Revenue has been raising awareness of the changes being introduced in Stage 1 through its published information, road-shows, webinars and presentations. Further activity is planned in the lead up to go-live and in the period immediately after. Most affected customers will receive multiple communications at relevant times. For Inland Revenue people, communication about the changes is underway and training has been scheduled. Inland Revenue intends to go-live with Stage 1 by the end of April 2017 or earlier if possible. All the work required to ensure successful go-live is progressing well: • The development of START is on track. • Customer data has been loaded into the START test environment with less than 5% errors. • The two new data centres supporting START are up and running. • The changes needed to FIRST to enable the two systems to co-exist have been made. • Rigorous and comprehensive testing, including customer validation of new services, is well underway with positive results to date. Stringent criteria need to be met before a decision to go- live is made to ensure that services and systems are working as they should. The readiness of customers, Inland Revenue itself, and the programme for go-live will be regularly assessed, with pre-defined conditions that must be met at key points. Preparations for Stage 2 are underway. The scope of Stage 2 has been confirmed in line with the roadmap noted by Cabinet in November 2015 (CAB-15- MIN-0249 refers). Stage 2 includes all tax products and the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI). 2 The costs and benefits of Stage 2 will be reported to Cabinet by March 2017 once detailed design of this stage is further advanced. Business transformation continually captures lessons learned and is incorporating learnings from Stage 1 into the approach for Stage 2. 2 AEOI will enable the discovery of formerly undetected tax evasion. It provides for the exchange of non-resident financial account information with the tax authorities in the account holders’ country of residence. Participating jurisdictions that implement AEOI send and receive pre-agreed information each year, without having to send a specific request. Commercial in confidence Page 4 Introduction This update outlines the progress being made by Inland Revenue in preparing for Stage 1. The purpose of this update is to enable Cabinet to note the progress being made by Inland Revenue in preparing for the implementation of Stage 1 of business transformation. It has been reviewed by the Treasury and the Government Chief Information Officer (GCIO). Business transformation is a long-term programme to modernise New Zealand’s revenue system. Transformation is far more than just updating existing computer systems: it will simplify how services are delivered and enable government to better leverage its information asset to better understand and meet customers’ circumstances and needs. As a result of transformation, voluntary compliance will increase, and the effort required by customers to meet their obligations and receive their correct entitlements will reduce. Transformation will re-shape how customers interact with government and Inland Revenue. The future revenue system will enable customers with less complex matters to interact with Inland Revenue through digital services. Most customers will not need to interact with Inland Revenue. Systems will be largely automated ‘straight through’ processes that take less time and are more efficient. Shifts in behaviour are already evident, with more customers using digital services. This has enabled Inland Revenue to realise some early benefits, such as a saving of approximately $1 million to date in printing and postage. The revenue system interacts with the social policy, business, education, and justice sectors. Customers have multiple touch points with multiple organisations across these sectors. Inland Revenue will take a holistic view of customers and their situation within the broader government and private sectors. Inland Revenue will engage with and listen to customers and stakeholders to understand their circumstances and deliver excellent customer experiences that are positive, personalised, timely and seamless. Policy changes will be required across a number of areas to simplify requirements for customers. Inland Revenue will put customers at the centre. This means helping customers from the start, rather than when things go wrong, and making more intelligent use of information. Customers expect government to provide intuitive and personalised services. Government has responded through its Better Public Services priorities and open data initiatives. To enable direct, personalised support to customers, Inland Revenue will organise activities around customers and outcomes, rather than products and services. In addition, improved analytical tools and capabilities will enable Inland Revenue to generate insights that create better value for customers and government and to make sense of increasing volumes of data held in multiple and disparate systems. As Inland Revenue enhances its digital services, the quality and frequency of information available will improve, providing opportunities for greater sharing. In the future, information will be exchanged with government and non-government organisations using the data highway. Inland Revenue will benefit from and enable data to be accessed as and when needed, provided appropriate approvals and consents are in place. In the future earlier, more complete and more accurate information will be available to Inland Revenue which will mean fewer under or over payments for customers. Information will be checked when it is received and errors fixed wherever possible. In line with the Government’s focus on unlocking the value of data held by the public sector, transformation will equip Inland Revenue with a scalable and staged solution and new skill sets to enable the department to work in this environment. Positively influencing customers and retaining their trust in the revenue system, including protecting their information appropriately, is essential for increasing voluntary compliance. Inland Revenue is on track to deliver the agreed outcomes and benefits of Stage 1. The activities and outcomes of Stage 1 will make it easier for customers to meet their GST obligations. The transformation roadmap, showing outcomes for all stages, is shown in appendix 1. Inland Revenue intends to implement Stage 1 by the end of April 2017 or earlier if possible. Commercial in confidence Page 5 Delivering new and improved GST services to make it easier for customers Benefits for customers from Stage 1 will be new and improved services that will make it easier for them to meet their obligations, reduce their compliance costs over time, and provide them with better access to information. Those benefiting most in Stage 1 will be small to medium enterprises and not-for-profit organisations registered for GST. Stage 1 will enable these customers to better self- manage using new online services to: • Amend their GST returns and accounts; • Register for GST; • Register as a preparer of tax returns; • Set up payment plans; • Include attachments; and • Track their GST payments and refunds. In addition, they will be able to identify themselves to Inland Revenue using their New Zealand Business Number (NZBN), and receive customised messages and information from Inland Revenue. Since the last update, Inland Revenue has been focusing on raising general awareness of the GST changes being introduced in Stage 1 with customers, intermediaries and stakeholders. Engagement with tax agents, businesses and key industry and stakeholder groups continues. In June 2016, the Changing for You website discussing ideas about future tax for businesses went live. During August and September 2016, radio and newspaper advertising ran to raise awareness among small business owners about what dealing with tax might look like in the future. As at the end of October 2016, the website had more than 52,000 unique visits and more than 350 customer comments. The website has 4 different scenarios about the changes Inland Revenue could make to make tax easier for businesses. The changes include being able to fix mistakes online, having all accounts in one place, being able to use software to register as an employer and submit employee details. Customers are asked whether they agree or disagree with each scenario. Approximately 70% of those who rated the scenarios agreed with them. Feedback from respondents includes: “GST is such a breeze to work with now so PAYE should go in the same direction”. “Great concepts and vision”. During June 2016, more than 1,200 tax agents attended webinars providing a high level preview of Stage 1 changes. These sessions followed presentations made at the Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand (CAANZ) road-show in April and May 2016, and enabled members of other tax professional bodies and independent tax agents to access the information presented to CAANZ members. From June to October 2016, Inland Revenue participated in the “Taking care of business” small business road- shows in conjunction with the Minister for Small Business and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE). The road-shows were an opportunity to talk to local businesses about the initiatives being introduced to make tax simpler and reduce compliance effort, including new GST services and the new Accounting Income Method (AIM) for calculating provisional tax. During July and August 2016, Inland Revenue presented at the Bookkeepers’ Association conference and had a presence at the Xero Accounting Software providers’ roadshow. Participants were positive and engaged about the changes and possible impacts for their business. In August 2016, more than 400 tax agents across four locations in Auckland, Napier and Dunedin, were updated on business tax changes in the first round of Tax Management New Zealand (TMNZ) roadshow presentations. Participants were very interested in AIM and Inland Revenue’s presentation has been posted on the TMNZ website. TMNZ will schedule more road- shows. From August 2016, engagement with the not-for profit sector began. Discussions focused on how not for profit groups could assist in sharing information provided by Inland Revenue with their associations/members. This will include messages relating to how Inland Revenue is making tax simpler, the GST changes being introduced in Stage 1, and a high-level view of Stage 2. In September 2016, Inland Revenue established a small tax agent group to act as a sounding board regarding how informed and ready they and their customers are leading up to Stage 1 go-live. Commercial in confidence Page 6 In addition, the three external reference groups continue to provide advice and insights to Inland Revenue. They are the Transformation Reference Group, the Tax Simplification Panel and the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) reference group. Direct communication with customers has just kicked off. Most affected customers will receive multiple communications, at relevant times, leading up to and after go-live: • From mid-October to mid-November 2016 customers will receive direct communications (for most an email, for some a letter), supported by information on Inland Revenue’s website and newsletters. • Direct communications will continue from mid- January through to April 2017. • Radio and digital advertising (including social media) will run from February to April 2017 to build awareness and support the direct communications. Customers are actively involved in validating that new services meet their expectations. From late August through to November 2016 customer user experience validation of new services being introduced in Stage 1 took place. The intent was to check with customers that the new services: • Personalise and simplify their interactions with Inland Revenue; • Provide certainty and assurance that they have met their obligations; • Minimise the effort required by them to pay and/or receive the right amounts; and • Are intuitive and easy to use and enable them to manage their own affairs. In September 2016, a small, representative group of business customers, tax agents and bookkeepers experienced START online services for GST to check whether they were simple and easy to use. The customers completed a series of tasks including: filing a return, making a payment, checking the status of a refund, enrolling for GST and changing their profile. In October 2016 customers validated the accessibility of new services by completing a series of tasks including changing profile details, filing a return and making a payment. Also in October 2016, compatibility testing was undertaken by customers on a wide range of browsers and devices. Overall, the results were in line with expectations and Inland Revenue is using the feedback provided to refine new services to ensure they meet customers’ needs. Inland Revenue has also worked with a small group of new immigrants to validate the digital registration service. In October 2016, new migrants completed the end-to-end process of applying for an IRD number. Feedback was positive overall with comments including: “Firstly, it’s online. It’s a FANTASTIC THING. It’s easy to use. It’s seven or eight steps, took us a couple mins. Doesn’t take half an hour, There’s enough information there to complete the process”. “I would say it’s great! They now have an online system for applying for an IRD number. It’s really not that complicated”. Inland Revenue intends to absorb as many of the impacts of operating two systems as possible, so that impacts on customers will be minimised. There will be some minor impacts for customers and plans are in place to manage these: • All online services will be accessed through myIR as is the case today; there will be a separate tab for GST, which will redirect customers to START, and a separate tab for other tax types. • Customers may receive information from FIRST and START separately, and in different formats. • Customers will receive earlier and more frequent notifications about GST amounts owing than currently. Intermediaries will need to move between two systems when managing their clients’ accounts for more than one product (i.e. START for GST, and the existing FIRST and myIR systems for all other tax types). Customer involvement will continue right throughout transformation. Inland Revenue intends to seek a wide range of customer views as changes are introduced. A small group of businesses and intermediaries of varying sizes, types and locations will be established to provide Inland Revenue with an early view of customers’ likely response to changes, including any concerns. They will also provide feedback on Inland Revenue’s communications and Commercial in confidence Page 7 engagement activity, including any areas which need more attention or emphasis. A representative sample of customers from across New Zealand will be recruited to provide feedback on customer communications such as notices and on new services. At appropriate points prior to go-live of Stages, focus groups will work with Inland Revenue in a lab environment to test end-to-end services. These groups are likely to be Wellington based. For Inland Revenue people, communication about the changes is well underway and training has been scheduled. Communication within Inland Revenue has increased as the go-live date approaches. Regular newsletters, videos about how START and FIRST will co-exist, and video messages from the Commissioner have ensured that all staff have had the opportunity to read or hear about the changes coming and have been positively received. Leaders and managers are being provided with additional information and support through monthly teleconferences, monthly briefing packs, and twice yearly face to face forums. The training approach and schedule for Inland Revenue people has been confirmed. Following consultation with leaders and managers across Inland Revenue, the number of people requiring training to be able to use the new systems and processes being introduced in Stage 1 is approximately 4,000 people. Four distinct groups require differing levels of training: • Individuals for whom GST is a high-proportion of their work or who work in a specialist team (group 1) - approximately 300 people who need a high level of training and change preparation for go-live. • Individuals for whom GST is a proportion of their work (group 2) - approximately 2,500 people who require a medium to high level of training and change preparation for go-live. • Individuals for whom GST is a small or infrequent proportion of their work (group 3) -approximately 1,000 people who require a low to medium level of training and change preparation, some of which may be delivered following go-live. • All other non-customer facing people who are not directly impacted by Stage 1 (group 4). This group need awareness and communications. Training began in October 2016 and will continue after GST goes live in START. Some training will be delivered online, some in a classroom setting and some through self-directed learning including on the job support and guides. What and when people learn depends on their role, what's changing for them in Stage 1, and on making sure Inland Revenue keeps the organisation running smoothly while preparing for go-live. For the majority of staff in groups 1 and 2 training will consist of 6 hours of pre- learning, a maximum of three days of classroom training; and post go-live training. Training not only includes training for START, but also for managing co-existence, new business processes and new ways of working. In preparing the training plan, Inland Revenue has leveraged FAST Enterprises LLC’s (FAST) extensive library of training materials and toolsets. Later stages will bring more significant changes for Inland Revenue people. Stage 1 will be implemented within existing structures and roles. Significant changes in structures and roles are not expected until subsequent stages of transformation. This has been well signalled to Inland Revenue people. Design of the future Inland Revenue is underway, beginning with the customer facing groups and some of the key capabilities that support them. Implementation or deployment planning is also underway; one of the key criteria guiding this thinking is minimising the impact of any changes within Inland Revenue on customers. A people transition hub has been established and will co- ordinate and facilitate transition processes for Inland Revenue people. The Hub is up and running and already managing some relatively small scale changes to build future capability in the commercial and technology teams. On-going engagement with unions continues. Commercial in confidence Page 8 Changing policy and legislative settings Work on policy and legislative settings continues on a broad range of fronts and is tracking as expected. Consultation with New Zealanders continues. Submissions on the most recent discussion document in the Making Tax Simpler series regarding investment income information closed in August 2016. Just over 60 online comments and 30 written submissions were received. Investment income will support future social policy changes. The submissions largely support the principles behind the proposals, but raise concerns that compliance costs may outweigh any benefits and note the need for a long lead time to allow for large enterprises to make systems changes. Some specific areas of complexity that have been noted include joint account reporting, non-resident investors in portfolio investment entities (PIEs) and the volatility of PIE investment income. Recommendations are being considered by Cabinet in November 2016. Further consultation is planned as shown in the diagram below. The second discussion document relating to the Tax Administration Act is proposed for release in December 2016, subject to Cabinet approval. Work is underway on the individuals’ and social policy discussion documents scheduled for release in 2017. The release date for the individuals’ discussion document has shifted out to early 2017. This change will not impact on the critical path for transformation. Good progress is being made on scoping and researching social policy proposals on Working for Families and Child Support. The discussion document will focus on improving the administration of social policy, not on major social policy reforms. The timing of any future business tax discussion document is to be agreed in consultation with Ministers and does not impact the critical path for transformation. The law changes needed to enable and support the future revenue system are in train. The Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill is before the Finance and Expenditure Committee. The Committee is currently considering the officials’ report analysing submissions. The Bill contains the business transformation law changes needed to: • Implement the changes to business tax announced as part of Budget 2016 to make tax simpler. • Allow transitional regulations and administrative exemptions to be made to resolve any potential issues arising during the period of co-existence of FIRST and START. • Enable and support the implementation of Stage 1. • Implement the G20/OECD standard for AEOI. An Omnibus Bill is expected to be introduced in February 2017 to implement the policy changes arising from the administration of PAYE and GST and investment income information discussion documents. This Bill will also include any critical law changes needed for Stage 2. The Minister of Revenue announced Cabinet’s decisions on the application dates for PAYE and GST proposals at the New Zealand Payroll Practitioners Conference on 3 November 2016. This ensures that software providers, employers and payroll intermediaries have enough lead- in time to make the necessary changes to their products. Planning is underway for any policy and legislative changes needed to support Stage 2. Work is underway to ensure that critical law changes that are appropriate to support and enable Stage 2 are planned for and progressed on a timely basis. Commercial in confidence Page 9 Preparing for the implementation of Stage 1 Implementing GST in START 3 is the first step in changing how businesses and individuals interact and connect with the revenue system. The changes being introduced in Stage 1 and the ability to file returns through accounting software will make it simpler for GST customers to get things right and difficult to get wrong. Cabinet has agreed that GST is the starting point (CAB- 15-MIN-0249 refers) because it is a relatively simple product, big enough to provide experience for Inland Revenue and deliver benefits to customers. Increasing integration with private and public business partners is a key feature of the future revenue system. Increasingly, customers won’t have to do anything as their information will be provided to Inland Revenue on their behalf. For those that do, their systems and processes will be integrated with Inland Revenue’s and part of their everyday activities, and appropriate prompting from Inland Revenue will let them know when they need to do something. Opportunities for non- compliance will reduce as core accounting transactions will be provided through accounting software. In July 2016 Xero released their GST filing service to all their GST-registered customers. MYOB began progressively making this service available to all their customers from April 2016. From January to 31 October 2016, there were more than 43,000 GST submissions through MYOB and Xero accounting software. 3 START stands for Simplified Tax and Revenue Technology and is the name chosen by Inland Revenue for the GenTax software provided by FAST Enterprises LLC. “Using Xero saves a lot of time, so I basically put zeroes to most timing questions”. “Our GST is calculated by our accounting software so the time involved is minor, our accountant calculates our Provisional Tax for us”. Inland Revenue is working with MYOB and Xero to influence customers’ behaviour and drive further uptake. Regular assessment of results will help to determine which activities have been effective and which need to be reviewed. Inland Revenue will make a digital GST submission service available to other software providers as part of Stage 1. The capabilities being delivered in Stage 1 support both Better Public Services and Business Growth Agenda goals. Once Stage 1 is implemented customers operating as incorporated entities will be able to use their NZBN to identify themselves to Inland Revenue, and new immigrants will be able to digitally register for an IRD number when they apply for a visa. Testing of both these new services is underway with MBIE. Inland Revenue has validated the technical feasibility of RealMe and myIR. However there are still some customer experience issues to work through before confirming the deployment date. Implementing a modern technology platform, with GST as the first step, is progressing well. The development of START remains on track and Inland Revenue intends to go-live with Stage 1 by the end of April 2017 or earlier if possible. The technology required to support START is in place. Inland Revenue’s two new data centres have both gone live. The primary centre in Takanini, Auckland hosts essential systems such as START and Inland Revenue’s identity management solution. It mirrors the secondary data centre in Trentham, Wellington, enabling Inland Revenue to store and backup all customer data securely. The new centres provide Inland Revenue with greater scalability, modern security features, and much greater resilience. The current data centres that support FIRST will continue to operate alongside the new centres until 2021, as FIRST and START will co-exist until then. An identity and access management solution has been selected and will enable Inland Revenue to authenticate the identity of users and authorise the appropriate accessing and modification of information. It will provide secure access to applications and online services for customers and staff. Data migration is a key focus, with conversion of data from FIRST to START underway. All the data Inland Revenue holds on customers has now been loaded into the START test environment. This includes all: Commercial in confidence Page 10 • Customer data including names, addresses, contact information, bank accounts, customer and account attributes. • Financial information including all financial transactions and balance information. • Compliance data including billing information, collection cases, instalment agreements, and deductions. • eService logons. Data was verified before being loaded and data quality was better than anticipated, with less than 5% identified as having errors. Mock conversion of data will continue up until go-live to ensure that all records are in the right place and the impacts on customers of having their information split across two systems is minimised. In addition, there are 3 mock go-live runs planned in the lead up to Stage 1 go –live. These include as many of the tasks that will be undertaken during cutover weekend as possible. Inland Revenue has adopted an innovative approach to addressing the challenges of co-existence. Both FIRST and START will need to be supported throughout the life of transformation as products are transitioned. Coexistence of business functions and technical capabilities is complex and is a key risk. The best value for money approach for addressing co- existence while minimising the impacts on customers has been identified. Inland Revenue has confirmed which functions will remain in FIRST and which will be in START; and confirmed that technical integration will be kept to a minimum, with staff managing a series of interim business processes. Accenture has been contracted to deliver the changes needed to heritage systems to enable co-existence, augmented by a team focused on manual interventions where required. This work is on track. For Stage 1, three releases will make the coding changes needed to FIRST. Each release consists of design, build and test. Design, build and testing are complete for all releases. As implementation is product based, some of the impacts of co-existence on customers cannot be mitigated. For example, products may be administered differently depending on whether they have been migrated to START or are still being administered in FIRST. Testing is underway and the results so far are positive. A rigorous and comprehensive testing schedule has been developed. Testing of new systems and processes is a key input into assessing readiness for go-live, and includes a number of phases: • Business system testing involves Inland Revenue staff testing the functionality within START and how START interacts with other systems. • Customer user experience validation involves customers trying out and providing feedback on new services. • Scaled business simulation testing practices the go- live step by step including the migration of data, and processes following go-live such as return filing. • Security testing verifies that solutions conform to minimum security standards. • Performance testing verifies that requirements such as response times and transaction rates have been achieved. • Technical cutover testing tests the full deployment in a technical sense. Rollback is tested as part of this phase to confirm that Inland Revenue could revert to the pre-implementation state if required. The first two phases, business system testing and customer experience validation (refer to page 7), have been completed with positive results. Business system testing for Stage 1 ran from July to October 2016 to thoroughly test every aspect of START and its interactions with Inland Revenue’s other systems. More than 50 subject matter experts from around Inland Revenue were involved, many from outside Wellington. Functionality including customer information, returns, payments, disbursements and eServices were each tested for between two and six weeks using customer scenarios. The failure rate for the scenarios tested was low and failures were resolved quickly. The next phases of testing begin in November 2016 and will continue right up until cutover weekend. Inland Revenue is sharing its approach to testing. Inland Revenue is using an innovative approach to delivering and testing changes – DevOps. DevOps is short Commercial in confidence Page 11 for development operations and establishes an environment where building, testing, and releasing software happens rapidly, frequently, and reliably. This iterative, continuous development approach is relatively new to the public sector. Inland Revenue is using it in the replacement of its “end-of-life” middleware software that transports around 90% of its data, enabling customers to connect with the core tax system and for systems to talk to each other. The New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA), the Ministry of Justice and MSD have been hosted by Inland Revenue in its testing centre to demonstrate the approach in action. Stringent criteria need to be met before a decision to go- live is made. Inland Revenue has developed a comprehensive and robust approach for determining readiness for go-live of Stage 1. A business readiness framework has been developed which uses checkpoints to assess the readiness of customers, business partners and stakeholders. Readiness will be assessed across three major areas: • Customer readiness – are customers sufficiently informed by Inland Revenue to be ready for Stage 1? • Inland Revenue’s readiness – is the business ready to receive Stage 1? • Programme readiness – is the business transformation programme ready to deploy Stage 1? At a more detailed level, there will also be assessments of the readiness of data, processes, infrastructure, applications, policy, quality assurance, support and deployment. Readiness will be regularly assessed through six checkpoints as shown in the diagram below. Each checkpoint has a defined purpose and pre-defined conditions that must be met to provide confidence that the preparations for go-live are on track. The checkpoints will confirm that “Inland Revenue is where it expects to be” at key points. Based on the results of the checkpoints, decisions may be taken to implement contingency options or, in the worst case scenario, to delay go-live. The Ministers of Finance and Revenue will be provided with an overview of the results from checkpoints through existing monthly reports and meetings. Clear accountabilities have been established for making the decision to go-live. A go-live committee has been established to provide governance over checkpoint 4. The committee is chaired by the Senior Responsible Officer (SRO), and membership consists of four deputy commissioners. Its role is to recommend to the Commissioner the deployment of changes into production or to recommend roll-back if cutover criteria have not been met. The Ministers of Finance and Revenue will be notified by the Commissioner if checkpoint 4 results in a decision not to proceed with go-live. Commercial in confidence Page 12 Preparing for Stage 2 Planning for Stage 2 is well underway as it is significantly bigger in scope and complexity than Stage 1. Given this, it will be important to minimise changes to the products in scope other than the business tax package changes. A small, separate team has been working to confirm the scope of Stage 2 in line with the roadmap noted by Cabinet (CAB-1-MIN-0249 refers), and mobilise the resources needed to begin detailed design. This approach has ensured that the majority of the programme can focus their efforts and attention on ensuring successful implementation of Stage 1. The scope of stage 2 includes the following products: • Income tax, including provisional tax; • Imputation tax; • Withholding tax; • Pay-as-you-earn (information collection); • Tax credits – independent earner rebate, payroll giving, payroll subsidy; • Fringe benefit tax; and • Gaming machine duty. 4 Stage 2 will also include AEOI, enhanced online services for customers for the products in scope, and some new contact options for customers, such as a possible extension of click-to-chat following a pilot period. In addition, there will be a wider rollout to Inland Revenue 4 Gaming Machine Duty is a stand-alone duty, not linked to other taxes in Stage 2. However implementing this in stage 2 or 3, should allow the FIRST mainframe to be decommissioned at the end of Stage 3 rather than at the end of Stage 4 as originally envisaged. people of some of the capabilities being introduced in Stage 1, such as enterprise content management. Stage 2 will continue with the co-existence approach established in Stage 1, with functionality split between heritage and new systems. The costs and benefits of Stage 2 will be confirmed by March 2017 once detailed design is further advanced. Given the scale of changes that will be made to systems and processes by Inland Revenue, business partners and customers, Stage 2 is likely to be implemented in a series of releases throughout 2018 and 2019. These will reflect the annual tax cycle, i.e. processes required at the beginning of the tax year will be released first, with end- of-year processes released later. As some of the changes require longer lead-in times for stakeholders, engagement has already begun. Inland Revenue has begun to brief financial institutions on AEOI. In August 2016 briefings in Auckland, Wellington and via audio conference were attended by 65 different entities. These included the “big four” accounting firms; 11 of the registered banks; a range of financial services, tax advisors and law firms; the Reserve Bank of New Zealand; and three industry bodies – CAANZ, New Zealand Bankers’ Association and Co-op Money NZ. A fact sheet explaining the changes has also been published on Inland Revenue’s tax policy website. In August 2016, the first workshop to begin designing the new Accounting Income Method (AIM) for calculating provisional tax was held. The workshop brought together a range of key parties interested in offering AIM, including software developers Reckon, CCH, MYOB, Tax Lab and Xero, small business accountants BDO and Addsmart, as well as CAANZ. Regular workshops are planned with this group to work together on the design, implementation and communication of AIM. Discussions with software developers about how AIM might be accommodated into software are also underway. Talks have also started with selected members of the Corporate Taxpayer Group on the design of a potential AIM scheme for larger corporate taxpayers. Inland Revenue will continue to work across the public sector to achieve better outcomes for New Zealanders. Inland Revenue will continue to work with the Ministry of Social Development (MSD), MBIE and the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA) to improve services for customers. Initiatives being considered as part of Stage 2 include: • A more automated solution, integrated with START, to support the approved information sharing agreement (AISA) between Inland Revenue and MSD will be implemented as part of Stage 2 onwards. An interim solution will be in place by mid-2017 to enable the AISA to be implemented in the heritage environment as the AISA is expected to be in place from June 2017. Commercial in confidence Page 13 • Inland Revenue will recognise customers by their NZBN once MBIE has extended it to non-incorporated entities. This requires Inland Revenue to enhance the NZBN capabilities delivered as part of Stage 1. Inland Revenue and DIA are exploring enabling digital registration and maintenance of customer information for individuals, including birth, marriage, name change and death. This work is at the scoping stage and more information will be provided in the next transformation update in mid-2017. New ways of working are being trialled within Inland Revenue to inform future stages of transformation. To create value from customer insights, and unlock the value of Inland Revenue’s information, new approaches will be trialled with specific customer segments. Implementing a continuous learning loop will enable Inland Revenue to learn through action, adapt quickly to improve results, or stop activity that is not creating enough value. The initial focus will be on tertiary students and small to medium businesses. Customer mapping will help build an understanding of the journey of students from tertiary education to employment and how this impacts their behaviour, and of the factors that contribute to, for example, poor regulatory compliance among start-up businesses. Commercial in confidence Page 14 Procuring the products and services required for transformation All procurement processes continue to be consistent with Government Rules of Sourcing. Since the July 2016 update, Inland Revenue has completed further procurement activity to select the services and products required for Stage 1. Negotiations with Deloitte to supply an identity and access management solution have been completed and a Statement of Work (SoW) agreed. TEAM Asparona (a 50% subsidiary of Deloitte) were selected as the provider of an information and knowledge management solution. TEAM Asparona offered the most cost effective and fit for purpose solution. TEAM Asparona are on the all-of- government (AoG) panel for Enterprise Content Management (ECM)-as-a-Service, and gave Inland Revenue an option to contract outside the ECM panel. Inland Revenue is still negotiating the outcome. However, during contract negotiations agreement was reached that Inland Revenue volumes would contribute to overall government volumes for pricing purposes. This means that other agencies already using this solution will benefit from price reductions resulting from Inland Revenue’s higher volumes, as will any agency that chooses to use this solution in the future. As previously noted, AoG services will be used by Inland Revenue where they are available, support the business outcomes of the revenue system and Inland Revenue, and are cost effective. Inland Revenue has consumed Infrastructure-as-a- Service, Information Technology Managed Services, and Telecommunications-as-a-Service common capabilities, and expects to consume Workplace Technology-as-a- Service. Planning for future procurement activity is underway. In the last update, Inland Revenue advised that a closed request for proposal (RFP) for Workplace Technology-as- a-Service was expected to be issued in mid-2016. This has been deferred as finalising the commercial arrangements needed to support Stage 1 was a higher priority. Inland Revenue is now reconsidering its options for replacement of workplace technology and the optimum timing of any investment. Current arrangements will be supported until 2021. Planning for the products and services needed to support the implementation of Stage 2 is underway. Inland Revenue is working with its existing vendors to agree what services will be required and what deliverables they will be accountable for. Inland Revenue expects some new vendors to be brought on board for Stage 2. For example a provider of web content management services will be required. Vendor management remains a strength. A range of mechanisms support the management of vendors. The performance of seven of the most critical vendors is assessed monthly against a balanced scorecard across a number of areas, and key points are identified and discussed with the vendors concerned. The seven vendors are FAST, Accenture, Unisys, Vodafone, Deloitte, Assurity, and Spark and their subsidiary Revera. Inland Revenue continues to share its commercial expertise with other agencies. As noted in the last update, Inland Revenue has shared lessons learnt with a number of other agencies: the Treasury, the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC), Land Information New Zealand (LINZ), the Earthquake Commission (EQC), HealthAlliance and the Department of Corrections. Inland Revenue is now sharing a deeper level of detail with relevant agencies such as its vendor management processes and the structure of its contracts with vendors. For example, the process Inland Revenue used to select new data centres has been highlighted by the GCIO as a model of best practice. Inland Revenue has shared the processes followed and the outcomes achieved with LINZ, HealthAlliance, and EQC. Commercial in confidence Page 15 Managing and governing transformation Transformation is on track and on budget. The programme is on schedule and expenses are tracking as expected. On-going monitoring arrangements have been agreed with Treasury. Monitoring will focus on delivery progress and realisation of benefits, through key performance indicators (KPIs) and outcome measures. The KPIs will track delivery progress against scope, schedule, delivery partners, risks, issues, resources, financials, benefits, inter-dependences and stakeholder engagement. Progress against each of these areas is regularly reported to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue. The outcome measures will track achievement of the investment objectives and realisation of the agreed benefits. There are three main measures of success: • easier for customers; • reduced time and cost to implement policy (policy agility); and • administrative savings to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue’s will report progress towards achieving these outcomes to Cabinet as part of the regular transformation updates as changes are likely to be gradual and more frequent reporting is unlikely to be of greater value. Inland Revenue and Treasury have agreed measures for reporting against KPIs and outcome measures. Please refer to appendix 2. There has been a recent change in programme management. Recruitment for a new Programme Director is underway. In the interim, the SRO has taken responsibility for the management of transformation. This has ensured minimal disruption in the lead up to Stage 1 go-live. Inland Revenue is fortunate to have built a very experienced and capable leadership team for transformation, which is well supported by governance structures. Transformation remains inherently high risk. While the department is well positioned, transformation is in its early stages and remains inherently high risk. Progress and risks will be constantly re-assessed, and any new opportunities which arise will need to be balanced against any potential slowing of progress or increase in risk. Inland Revenue is mitigating implementation risk for Stage 1 by starting with a relatively simple tax, keeping technical integration for co-existence to a minimum, and proactively supporting customers and staff to understand and adopt new services. The key risks facing transformation are: • Continuing to recruit and retain experienced resources of the right calibre is critical to success. Retention strategies and succession plans help to mitigate this risk. • Customers and staff must embrace change for the expected benefits to be realised. On-going focus on preparing customers and staff for change and on driving uptake of new services will ensure understanding and adoption. • Government may not be easily able to implement significant policy proposals at short notice as Inland Revenue may not easily be able to accommodate sudden changes in sequencing and priorities. On- going dialogue with Ministers will ensure that changes in priorities are understood and that any implications for costs, benefits or risks are highlighted. While risks may become issues from time to time in a programme of this nature, this is not unexpected. Should any opportunities or issues arise that may impact timelines, costs, benefits or risk profile these will be highlighted for Ministers to consider. Commercial in confidence Page 16 Assurance reviews are on-going to provide confidence that transformation continues to be well managed and governed. Inland Revenue undertakes regular independent quality assurance (IQA) and technical quality assurance (TQA) reviews. The outcomes of previous assurance reviews are included in earlier business cases and progress updates. In June 2016, KPMG undertook an IQA4.2 focusing on Inland Revenue’s strategies, approaches and plans for testing and for data preparation and conversion. Although not a focus for this review, KPMG noted that the programme continues generally to be managed in accordance with good industry practice. The key findings were that “The approach to programme management continues generally to be robust and fit for purpose”, “The Programme continues to align the differing methodologies (of providers) effectively” and “The planned timescales for testing are predicated on a risk-based approach”. KPMG recommended some specific areas of focus for testing and data, all of which have been either completed or are under action. Further assurance reviews are planned over the remainder of this year: • In November 2016, a Gateway review will be undertaken. • In October/ November 2016, a fifth IQA and fourth TQA will be undertaken by KPMG. The assurance arrangements for 2017 have yet to be finalised. For each review, the Ministers of Finance and Revenue are offered the opportunity to meet with reviewers and to be briefed by Inland Revenue on the findings once the review is complete. In addition, copies of all assurance reviews and Inland Revenue’s response to any action points raised are provided to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue. Commercial in confidence Page 17 Learning from the experiences of other change programmes Inland Revenue continues to engage with other revenue authorities who have implemented START to learn from their experiences. In August 2016 members of Inland Revenue’s executive leadership team along with senior business managers attended the FAST Enterprises LLC (FAST) revenue administration customer conference 5 and the Federation of Tax Authorities (FTA) 6 conference. As these conferences were held in the United States, visits to three state tax authorities who have implemented FAST’s GenTax product (named START by Inland Revenue) were also undertaken. While every implementation is different, there are some common themes. The key insights Inland Revenue gained from the conferences and site visits were: • The configurable nature of GenTax/START enables more agile implementation of change. For Inland Revenue, agility will increase as implementation progresses. Following Stage 2, government will have much greater agility for tax products. The complex inter-relationships between income and social policy (which will still be on FIRST) will place some limits on agility during Stage 2. Full policy agility will be provided once transformation is complete. 5 FAST’s user conferences provide a forum to share successes, discuss approaches, find out about product updates and innovations, and provide feedback for future product enhancements. 6 The FTA provides research and information exchange, training, and intergovernmental and interstate coordination services to state tax authorities and administrators in the United States. • Any data quality issues should be addressed as early as possible. Inland Revenue began extracting data from FIRST and loading it into START in March 2016, just over a year ahead of the go-live date. • External partners who have systems and processes that need to interact with the revenue administration should be identified as early as possible and provided with as much lead in time for testing as possible. Inland Revenue has identified external parties who will need to interact with the revenue system differently as a result of Stage 1 and testing is underway. • Test early and test often, and involve a wide range of people. Inland Revenue has a comprehensive and robust testing plan, elements of which are already underway. • Plan early for cutover and practice, practice, practice. Inland Revenue will run a series of mock go-lives, and has a detailed plan for cutover weekend. • Staying on the latest version of the software is important to take advantage of improvements in tax administration practice. Inland Revenue is planning for the cost of upgrades and maintenance as new solutions are transitioned to business-as-usual. At the FAST customer conference, Inland Revenue attendees took the opportunity to spend time with the representatives from the Finnish Tax Administration who attended – most of whom are on their Transformation Leadership team. There are similarities of scale, complexity and approach between the Inland Revenue and Finnish programmes. Stage 1 was successfully implemented in Finland in January 2016. Points of note were: • There were the expected small issues/errors to work through post go-live however there was nothing of any real consequence to either the Finnish Tax Authority or their customers. • The largest challenge resulted from creating “customer master data” 7 in the new system at the outset. This is proposed to be included in Stage 2 for Inland Revenue once all tax products have been migrated to START. • An opportunity to learn from Finland’s testing approach was identified and Inland Revenue’s test lead for transformation has been in contact with the Finland team to discuss their experiences. Overall, feedback from other FAST customers was that they had been able to deliver significant improvements in serving citizens. 7 Master data management is the collection, aggregation, matching, consolidation, and quality-assurance of data, and how it is made available throughout an organisation. It ensures consistency and control in how data is maintained and used.

Child support and the upgraded version of myIR continue to run very smoothly, with no major issues raised or areas of concern. 11. New systems and processes are more efficient. This can be seen, for example, with the automated population of case information being sent to Services Australia for child support cases managed under the reciprocal agreement. The monthly schedule we send to Australia outlining payments we have collected on their behalf can now be produced automatically in a matter of minutes. P reviously it could take up to two days to produce and was highly manual. 12. Payments now get to carers faster. From November 2021 onwards, child support payments are passed on by the 23 rd of the same month, as long as the liable (paying) parent has paid on time. Previously, payments were made on the 7 th of the month following the due date. In addition, we can now make payments directly to overseas bank accounts. P reviously we sent cheques and, once we stopped using cheques, had to use a series of work arounds to release funds overseas. 13. We now automatically notify employers or the Ministry of Social Development when deductions need to be made from income or a benefit to pay a liable parent’s child support. Since go -live we have automatically set up over 6,000 deductions from income that would previously have been done manually and taken longer. These are deductions for newly liable parents, parents already paying by deduction and whose source of income has changed, and parents who have defaulted on their payments. 14. In early November 2021, some of our early life support forums reduced their meetings to twice weekly as a result of the release running so smoothly. The frequency has since reduced further to once a week for some meetings. In previous large releases, there have been daily meetings throughout the hyper care period. We are on schedule to exit hyper care as planned on 3 December 2021. This is the initial, heightened period of extra support provided following a release. Early life support is scheduled to continue until 31 January 2022. Our customers 15. Feedback from our post go-live surveys of customers using the upgraded myIR shows that: • Over two thirds of individual customers feel confident, reassured and know what to do next. Customers like the key information being visible in one place; the clear, simple layout, and that myIR is easy to use and it’s easy to find the information required. Not unexpectedly, customers with more complex circumstances are finding the changes more challenging. • Around eight in ten business customers are finding it quite or very easy to do what they need to do. • Around two thirds of intermediaries are finding it quite or very easy to do what they need to do. As high users of myIR, intermediaries will have been very familiar with the previous version. Our people 16. As our people grow more confident our key users are noticing less support is needed and some key users are returning to their substantive roles. 17. Booster training sessions are available to help our people provide the right support to customers. 5 IR2021/583: Transformation status update: November 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Technical/operational 18. Following each release, we carry out testing and checks to identify issues before they impact our customers. Of the planned 316 tasks we will complete, such as testing and checking future filing and payment dates, we have successfully completed 129 so far and 61 are currently in progress. Other updates Payroll 19. The relocation of our payroll system (SAP) to a cloud-based solution successfully went live on 15 November 2021. We have had minimal issues since go-live. Decommissioning 20. Our heritage core processing system, FIRST, was decommissioned on 30 November 2021 as planned. FIRST has been our core processing system since the early 1990s. 21. The next steps are. • From 1 December 2021 until early April 2022, we will shut down old heritage systems, archive any data that is to be retained, and then remove the systems and databases. • In April 2022, once all the systems have been removed, the network connections and supporting services will be shut down, and the process of dismantling and disposing of the infrastructure will begin. Each piece of equipment that can store data will be sanitised and, if not being reused, destroyed. • We are on track to e xit our heritage Unisys data centres by 30 June 2022. Sharing information with other agencies 22. We have developed a site for other government agencies holding the key frameworks, tools and templates we have built through transformation. We are presently preparing information to support this material to provide context for thos e accessing it. Final progress update for Cabinet 23. As agreed (IR2021/309 refers), the final progress update will be provided to Cabinet in February 2022. We will provide the draft paper to the Minister of Revenue in early February 2022. Key risks and issues 24. The transformation programme’s risk profile has improved to light amber this month, with a future trend of light amber. A light amber profile means that risks and mitigations are defined and understood and the mitigations are expected to be successful. 25. We are actively managing one new issue (a risk that has been realised). The issue relates to Vodafone being unable to provide the support needed to move a heritage application from our heritage Unisys data centre to the cloud before Christmas due to resource availability. We are working through the options with Vodafone to determine whether there are any alternatives available. 6 IR2021/583: Transformation status update: November 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 26. The issue relating to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the delivery of the programme has been closed. Despite the disruption caused by the pandemic, the final release went live as planned. 27. As of November 2021, the programme has a total of 25 open risks 1 , of which 4 are reported to the Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC). 28. Four risks previously reported to the PGC were closed during the month as a result of the final release successfully going live on 28 October 2021: • The risk relating to possible changes in payments once child support is moved to new systems and processes has been closed. All planned preventative measures have been taken to mitigate this risk. • The risk relating to organisational design changes impacting the delivery of the final stage did not eventuate. • The risk relating to a delay in completing cutover of products to START did not eventuate. • The risk relating to the scope, timing and priorities of the programme changing as a result of external factors did not eventuate. 29. One risk previously reported to the PGC was transferred to its enduring home in our new organisation design. The risk relating to realising the benefits we committed to deliver in the timeframes indicated has been transferred to the team responsible for enterprise planning, performance measurement, reporting and investment. 30. The status of one risk reported to the PGC improved during the month. The current rating of the risk relating to on-going reliance on SAP after 30 June 2022 preventing full decommissioning of our heritage data centres improved from high to medium. This likelihood of this risk occurring has improved from unlikely (a 3% to 10% chance of occurring) to rare (a less than 2% chance of occurring). Implementation plans are in place which support the overall reduction in risk likelihood. 31. There has been no change in the status of any of the other risks reported to the PGC since the last report. 32. The remaining transformation risks reported to the PGC relate to the need to move off all our heritage applications by 30 June 2022 so that we can fully decommission our heritage data centres. Coming up in the next two months 33. Key activities over the next two months include: December 2021 • Continuation of early life support. January 2022 • Completion of early life support. 1 During November 2021, 16 programme risks were closed, including 4 reported to the PGC. One risk reported to the PGC was transferred from the programme to its enduring home.

NZ joins global child support initiative
========================================

**27 November 2019**

Foreign-based parents who avoid their child support obligations in New Zealand are being targeted in a change that will make it easier for Inland Revenue to collect money owed.

Revenue Minister Stuart Nash is in the Netherlands where he has today signed the Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance.

“Our tax system must be fair,” Mr Nash says. “It is patently unfair when some parents wriggle out of their child support obligations simply by living in countries where it is harder to enforce the payments.

“This initiative will see more New Zealand children and caregivers receiving their rightful child support. It will help Inland Revenue find liable parents living overseas and recover payments which till now could only be enforced via a court order in those countries.

“There are approximately 16,700 overseas-based parents with support obligations to New Zealand children. The vast majority, about 12,500 live in Australia where we have had good reciprocal arrangements for collecting these payments for almost 20 years.

“However about 4,200 parents who owe child support do not live in either New Zealand or Australia and we rely on them to voluntarily comply with their obligations. Voluntary compliance is low. Around $7.7 million in child support is currently outstanding.

“We have limited ability to find and keep in touch with people living in other countries. This agreement will improve that if the parent lives in one of the 42 countries which has signed the Hague Convention.

“Where a liable parent is living in a member state we can seek help from that country to find them. It is unclear how many liable parents are in these countries. Around 500 parents are believed to be affected. The location of a further 3,200 liable parents is unknown but it is considered likely that some are in Hague Convention states. 

“Those member states will be able to give information to Inland Revenue to allow it to assess the liable parent for child support, taking into account their circumstances. The support will then be collected by that state government on our behalf.”

“It will also mean that New Zealand can play its part by helping ensure that liable parents here pay child support for their children living in other member states. This means New Zealand can meet more of its obligations as a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child,” Mr Nash says. 

The next steps require a Parliamentary Select Committee to consider the measure, report to Parliament, and for the Convention to then be ratified by an Order in Council. It is expected come into force in April 2021.

Oamaru embraces AIM
===================

**19 September 2019**

An Oamaru accountant is an enthusiastic advocate of Inland Revenue’s new provisional tax option, the Accounting Income Method (AIM).  
   
Adair Craik has more than 50 clients signed up for AIM, which requires small businesses to make provisional tax payments only when they’re making a profit.  
   
“I’m a keen supporter,” she says. “I’ve got retailers, manufacturers, panel beaters, moteliers, professional athletes and a hot rod restorer all using AIM and it’s proving to be a real advantage for them.  
   
“My clients always know where they stand and can make better decisions about how to manage their money rather than having to estimate how much to keep aside to cover the provisional tax bill. AIM takes away that element of surprise and my clients like that.”  
   
AIM is currently provided through three accounting software providers as part of their package. This means provisional tax calculations can be made using real-time financial information.  
   
“It’s great for instilling financial discipline and it’s helping my clients stay on top of their debts and have a better view of their cashflow,” says Adair Craik.  
   
Her client Marty Winders, the hot rod restorer, agrees. “(AIM) has freed up our working capital so we know our cashflow is our cashflow. It just takes the sting out of it.

\[embed width="480" height="270" class="leftAlone" thumbnail="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2m9gLdT-mDM/hqdefault.jpg?r"\]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m9gLdT-mDM\[/embed\]

  
   
“AIM has been a huge reliever of stress for me. I have a bit more freedom – the freedom to focus on the things that I really love doing. I can’t believe that everyone’s not doing it.”  
   
Richard Owen, the small business segment leader at Inland Revenue says the experience of Adair Craik and Marty Winders in Oamaru will be familiar to small businesses elsewhere in the country.  
   
“More businesses are opting to take the guesswork out of provisional tax in favour of the greater certainty that AIM provides.  
   
“That’s particularly useful when a business is growing fast and needs to know where they stand.  
   
“We recommend any business finding they don’t have the cash to meet their provisional tax obligations should talk with their tax professional about whether AIM can make life easier,” says Richard Owen.

October 2021 saw our final changes for customers
================================================

Inland Revenue's transformation is one of the biggest change programmes of its kind. Delivering our transformation of tax and social policy services successfully was always about understanding what customers wanted and managing changes carefully through staged rollouts. We left the changes to child support until this year because this service is complex, and we wanted to get it right for our customers. We also made a major upgrade to myIR, the secure online service our customers use.

Show all

We've made child support services simpler and fairer

In October 2021, we moved child support to our new system to make it easier for customers to keep track of their obligations and payments. Customers can now do more for themselves in myIR such as applying for payments. It's quicker and easier as we now pre-populate much of the information needed. Previously, customers had to fill in a form or call us to apply.

Carers now receive child support payments 14 days faster.

Parents who are new to paying child support, and those re-entering the scheme, now have their payments automatically deducted by their employer. This helps customers stay on track with their payments and avoid getting into debt.

Penalties for late payments of child support are now fairer. Parents who are new to the scheme have more time before penalties are charged if they are late with their payments. We also no longer charge incremental penalties on overdue payments. These changes were made to encourage paying parents to pay the right amounts, on time.

Shortly after we made these changes, some carers told us they were struggling to find their payment information in myIR. We quickly made some improvements and we're continuing to embed the changes and help customers get used to them. Before, fewer than 50% of our customers said it was easy to find information, whereas 60% now say it is easy.

"It's all right there when you log in."  
"I like the fact that you can see what payments you are due and how much."  
Inland Revenue customers.

Supporting children's wellbeing
-------------------------------

*   163,323 children are covered by the Child Support Scheme (as at 30 June 2022).
*   Carers who receive child support and parents who pay it want certainty around payments.
*   84% of liable parents who earn salary and wages are paying child support by employer deductions.

Read more about how we've performed in administering child support services.

Services to process obligations and entitlements

We now collect child support from more paying parents living overseas

On 1 November 2021, New Zealand joined the 2007 Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance. This allows us to support more children living here and overseas, as we can now make more international assessments and get assistance from other Hague member countries to collect child support. We can work with over 40 countries under the Convention. Before, New Zealand only had a reciprocal agreement with Australia.

With a team dedicated to helping families and children get the support they’re entitled to, we're already seeing some great results locating liable parents overseas. Some parents are paying their outstanding amounts in full, and families have received child support after many years of missed payments.

We've upgraded the online services our customers use

We know how important myIR is to our customers so we're always looking for ways to improve it. Customers had 60 million user sessions in myIR this year. Its use has grown 140% between 2019 and 2022. myIR makes it easier for customers to check their tax and payments when it suits them. They can see all the information we hold about them and send messages when they need our help.

In October, we upgraded myIR to give it a more modern look and feel and make it easy to use on different devices. Customers can now see what they need to do all in one place. They get alerts to let them know they need to do something, and when it's due.

When we asked customers about the refreshed myIR, most liked the changes although some would have liked more help to get used to them.

"I've just logged into myIR for the first time since its big overhaul. It's really great, clearly structured and things are much easier to find and do than before. Fantastic improvement."  
"Need a tutorial for those who find change difficult. What has changed and where to find it."

At 8am on 28 October 2021, we officially re-opened our customer facing channels after successfully moving child support to new systems and processes and upgrading the online services customers use and the START software our people use. 9. Our systems started to come back up on 27 October 2021 and myIR was available to customers during the day. We had 70,421 logins to myIR on the 27 th , including 1,300 applications for the Resurgence Support Payment. Our customers 10. We are not seeing anything of significant concern from our customers at this stage. As expected, customers are taking time to get used to the new look and feel of myIR and child support services. 11. Some customers have needed help to find their way around the new-look myIR, as they struggle to locate specific information in the new layout. Others have sought reassurance about their COVID-19 support applications, particularly those who had issues applying for the fourth Resurgence Support Payment when this opened on 29 October 2021. We have started to survey individual customers about the myIR changes and over the next couple of weeks we will also survey businesses, intermediaries and child support customers. 12. The number of issues we are experiencing are within the levels we expected this early in the release. As we have for all previous releases, there are some areas we are working through to see if we can make improvements. For example, we are seeing some dissatisfaction with some of the functionality of myIR from our larger tax agents and employers which we are working to improve. 13. Day 1 packs were sent to intermediaries, businesses and employers on 28 October 2021. These are also available on our website. 14. The filing and payment dates for GST and income tax have been extended from 28 October to 4 November 2021 (IR 2021/413 refers). As at 2 November 2021, 71 % of GST returns had been filed and filing volumes are similar to what they were in 2020. Our people 15. Our people are providing support to each other and becoming more familiar with the changes and learning new things. We are looking at providing some extra support to our people who are not currently working in an office. 16. As has been the case for previous releases, Key Users are providing valuable support to our people as they get used to the changes. 17. We have been consulting with our people on the proposed design for C ustomer and Compliance Services Planning Design and Delivery (PDD) and Compliance Strategy and Innovation. Consultation on the proposed design for these groups ran from 13 October to 4 November 2021. The feedback provided is now being considered, with final decisions expected to be announced at the end of November 2021. Technical/operational 18. Following each release, we carry out testing and checks to identify issues before they impact our customers. We are off to a good start, with 32 tasks currently in progress and 42 successfully completed. In total, we will test and check 315 tasks. Examples of tasks we test and check ahead of time are future filing and payment dates. 5 IR2021/507: Transformation status update: October 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Other updates Payroll 19. In March 2021, the Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC) decided to relocate our payroll system (SAP) to a cloud-based solution (IR2021/105 refers). Delivery has proceeded very well. Testing is now complete and a full reconciliation between the current and new system has been completed with no errors. We remain on track to cut over to the new system as planned on 15 November 2021. The back-up date, if needed, is 29 November 2021. Decommissioning 20. Now that all the products we administer are running on new systems and processes, we must shut down and remove all our heritage applications (more than 400) and equipment. This includes FIRST (our heritage core system) which has provided us with more than 30 years of service. Analysis of the heritage systems and supporting physical infrastructure has been completed to a very detailed level. 21. As at October 2021, approximately 63% (264) heritage systems have been decommissioned and 20% of the infrastructure components have been removed from the data centres. 22. Key milestones include: • An archive solution for FIRST will be in place by 15 November 2021. • FIRST will be switched off on 30 November 2021 to enable commencement of FIRST decommissioning on 1 December 2021. • Heritage data archiving will be completed by 31 March 2022. • All heritage systems are planned to be decommissioned by 30 April 2022. • All networking and infrastructure are planned to be decommissioned by 30 June 2022. Please note that Unisys undertake the bulk of physical switch off and ethical destruction, overseen by Inland Revenue. Key risks and issues 23. The transformation programme’s risk profile remains amber, with a future trend of amber. An amber profile means that risks and mitigations are reasonably defined and understood, and support is needed from senior leaders to actively manage specific issues in some areas. 24. We are actively managing one issue (a risk that has been realised). This issue relates to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the delivery of the programme and continues to be monitored closely. There are no concerns to report at this time. 25. The issue raised last month regarding transferring historic child support suspense account balances to START has been resolved and is now closed. 26. As at October 2021, the programme has a total of 42 open risks 2 , of which 9 are reported to the PGC. 27. One risk previously reported to the PGC was closed during the month. 2 During October 2021, three programme risks were closed, including one reported to the PGC. 6 IR2021/507: Transformation status update: October 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 28. The risk relating to the potential for a delay in go-live of the October 2021 release due to the Asteron building closure has been closed. Accommodation has been secured for the Wellington-based team and on 18 October 2021, the go-live committee approved the move into cutover for the final release. 29. The status of one risk reported to the PGC improved during the month. The current and residual 3 ratings of the risk relating to organisational design changes impacting the delivery of the final stage improved from high to medium. This risk is now unlikely (a 3% to 10% chance) to occur as the majority of organisational design changes have been completed and the remaining changes are unlikely to cause any disruption to the programme. 30. There has been no change in the status of any of the other risks reported to the PGC since the last report. 31. The top three risks for transformation are: • Realising the benefits we committed to deliver in the timeframes indicated. • Possible changes in payments once child support is moved to new systems and processes. • The scope, timing and priorities of the programme may change as a result of external factors. Coming up in the next two months 32. Key activities over the next two months include: November 2021 • Early life support. • Migration of Inland Revenue’s payroll solution to the cloud. • Switch off FIRST. December 2021 • Continuation of early life support. 3 The predicted level of risk once all proposed actions have been implemented.

Ngā tāngata kei tāwāhi e utu ana i te RLWT Offshore people who pay RLWT
=======================================================================

There are different types of offshore people who pay RLWT. Check if you're in the category for paying residential land withholding tax.  

Offshore RLWT person - individual
---------------------------------

You are an individual who is an offshore RLWT person when any of the following apply.

*   You're a New Zealand citizen and you've been overseas for the last three or more years continuously (and you are not currently in New Zealand).
*   You have a permanent resident visa or a resident visa granted by Immigration New Zealand and have been overseas for the last 12 or more months continuously (and you are not currently in New Zealand).
*   You are not a New Zealand citizen and you do not have a New Zealand residence class visa granted by Immigration New Zealand (you can be in or out of New Zealand).

Offshore RLWT person - non-individual
-------------------------------------

You are non-individual who is an offshore RLWT person if you are:

*   incorporated or registered outside New Zealand
*   constituted under foreign law.

Refer to the next sections to see how the rules apply to non-individuals that are incorporated or registered in New Zealand.

Company and incorporated societies
----------------------------------

Your [company](/api/glossary/item?id={606B371A-333E-4086-A47F-EAFD55E0A1A4})
 or incorporated society is an offshore RLWT person if either of the following apply:

*   more than 25% of its directors are offshore RLWT person(s)
*   more than 25% of the shareholder decision making rights are held or controlled by offshore RLWT person(s).

Look-through companies (LTCs)
-----------------------------

For your look-through company to be an offshore RLWT person, more than 25% of the effective interest(s) in it must be held or controlled by offshore RLWT person(s).

Trusts and estates
------------------

Your trust or estate can be an offshore RLWT person when any of the following apply.

*   More than 25% of the trustees are offshore RLWT person(s).
*   More than 25% of people (generally the settlors or trustees) who have the power to appoint or remove trustees or amend the trust deed, are offshore RLWT person(s).
*   All individual beneficiaries, including individual discretionary beneficiaries, are offshore RLWT person(s).
*   All beneficiaries, including discretionary beneficiaries are offshore RLWT person(s).
*   Any individual beneficiary, including an individual discretionary beneficiary who is an offshore RLWT person, has received a distribution from the trust in any of the 4 years immediately before the current disposal of residential land, and the total distributions to that beneficiary in one of the four years totalled more than $5,000.
*   Any non-individual beneficiary, including a non-individual discretionary beneficiary (eg, a company) who is an offshore RLWT person has received a distribution from the trust in any of the four years before the current disposal of residential land.
*   Any beneficiary, including a discretionary beneficiary, is an offshore RLWT person and the trust has disposed of residential land within the four years before the current disposal of residential land.

### Trustees that are not offshore RLWT people

These trustees are not offshore RLWT people:

*   Trustees Executors Limited
*   AMP Perpetual Trustee Company NZ Limited
*   PGG Trust Limited
*   New Zealand Permanent Trustees Limited
*   The New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited.

Limited partnerships
--------------------

Your limited partnership is an offshore RLWT person if either of the following apply:

*   more than 25% of the general partner(s) are offshore RLWT person(s)
*   more than 25% of the partnership shares are held or controlled by offshore RLWT person(s).

Partnership
-----------

For RLWT purposes we do not look at the partnership as an entity (unlike the definition of an offshore person for IRD number application purposes).

Instead, each partner in the partnership determines if they're an individual offshore RLWT person. If they are, they will be liable for RLWT on their share of the property sale income.

Any partner who determines they are not an individual offshore RLWT person will not be liable for RLWT on their share of the property sale income.

Unincorporated clubs and societies
----------------------------------

Members of an unincorporated club or society are treated the same as the partners in a partnership. This means they'll need to determine if they are an individual offshore RLWT person.

If they are, they will be liable for RLWT on their share of the property sale income.

Any member who determines they are not an individual offshore RLWT person will not be liable for RLWT on their share of the property sale income.

Offshore Tax Transparency Compliance Focus
==========================================

**29 June 2022**

Inland Revenue has released its compliance focus on offshore tax transparency, together with guidance to assist tax agents in complying with the international rules.

The compliance focus highlights the extensive international exchanges of information taking place as well as the new intelligence tools being used in tracking down people who don’t pay their fair share of tax.

Inland Revenue spokesperson John Nash says New Zealand tax residents are generally required to pay tax on their worldwide income, regardless of any withholding tax deducted overseas or whether the income has been repatriated to New Zealand.

“New Zealanders have become increasingly involved in overseas investment. They’re taxed on their worldwide income including things like rental income from a property overseas, interest from an offshore bank account, and returns from a portfolio of overseas shares.

“We tackle international tax compliance by making it easy for people to get things right, hard for them to get it wrong, and costly for those who are determined to avoid their obligations.

“The vast majority of taxpayers do voluntarily meet their offshore tax obligations, but there are always some who look for ways to evade or avoid paying.”

“That’s where the new tools and New Zealand’s wide network of tax treaty partners come into their own. Our improved intelligence capability means we are only in the lives of those customers who deserve further inquiries and interventions.”

John Nash says with the increasing complexities of global investment, such as new challenges arising from the gig/sharing economy and crypto assets, Inland Revenue will continue to actively participate in international solutions.

“Inland Revenue will also continue to run compliance campaigns to verify and facilitate compliance by New Zealand tax residents in returning their offshore income.

“We have an ongoing monitoring programme to ensure people return their overseas income as they should, and we’ll verify customer records against additional information received from treaty partners for later years.”

Inland Revenue launched the offshore tax transparency package earlier this week and the documents are available online - [Compliance Focus for Individuals (ird.govt.nz)](https://www.ird.govt.nz/international-tax/individuals/compliance-focus-for-individuals)

This information supports the foreign investment fund (FIF) calculator and should not be read on its own.

Fair dividend rate (FDR) and comparative value (CV)
---------------------------------------------------

To get an FDR and CV calculation, you must complete all the FDR and CV input fields. If you do not, you will only receive an FDR calculation.

The FDR method can only be used if you are able to confirm the market value of the share at the beginning of the income year. If the market value at the start of the year can only be obtained by independent valuation, you must instead use the cost method.

FDR cannot be used if:

*   The share is a fixed rate share.
*   The share is a non-participating redeemable share.
*   The share involves a non-conditional obligation for a person to provide the investor an amount that is more than the issue price.
*   We have determined that the FDR is not applicable.
*   The share is in a non-resident company whose assets comprise 80% or more New Zealand dollar denominated financial arrangements (debt instruments).
*   The share is in a related non-resident that is not a foreign PIE equivalent or it is part of a structured arrangement and the non-resident is able to deduct dividends paid on the share.

In any of these circumstances, you will need to use the CV method.

You must use the deemed rate of return method instead of the CV method if you are unable to confirm the market value of the share at the income year.

#### Note:

"Cherry picking" is not permitted for investments where FDR and CV methods are both available. You must apply the same method to all foreign investments where your shareholding is less than 10%.

For dividends received, make sure the dividend date is the date that the dividend is **declared** and not the date you actually receive the money.

Comparative value (CV)
----------------------

Use this method if you have a guaranteed return investment for which the FDR calculation method is not allowed.

This is only for the following types of guaranteed investments:

*   Fixed-rate share investments in a foreign company.
*   Non-participating redeemable share investments in a foreign company.
*   A share which involves a non-conditional obligation for a person to provide the investor an amount that is more than the issue price.
*   We have made a determination that the fair dividend rate method is not available for the share.
*   The share is in a non-resident company whose assets comprise 80% or more New Zealand dollar denominated financial arrangements (debt instruments).
*   The share is in a related non-resident that is not a foreign PIE equivalent or it is part of a structured arrangement and the non-resident is able to deduct dividends paid on the share.

You must use the deemed rate of return method instead of the CV method if you are unable to confirm the market value of the share at the end of the income year.

Cost method
-----------

To get a cost calculation, you must complete the relevant cost input fields. If this is the first year of investment ownership, please enter the fields that refer to the current year and the valuation/revaluation field.

Use this method if you are unable to confirm the market value of the share at the beginning of the income year. You may need an independent valuation of your share before using the cost method calculation.

For dividends received, make sure that the dividend date is the date that the dividend is declared and not the date that you actually receive the money.

Commissioner’s operational position on professional directors and board members incorrectly registered for GST - WITHDRAWN
==========================================================================================================================

The Commissioner has released three Public Rulings concerning the GST treatment of fees paid to directors and board members:

*   BR Pub 23/01 “Goods and Services Tax – Directors’ Fees”;
*   BR Pub 23/02 “Goods and Services Tax – Fees of Board Members not appointed by the Governor-General or Governor-General in Council”; and
*   BR Pub 23/03 “Goods and Services Tax – Fees of Board Members appointed by the Governor-General or Governor-General in Council”.

This Operational Position gives guidance on how these rulings will be applied.

[Tax Information Bulletin - Vol 35 No 3, April 2023](/tib/volume-35---2023/tib-vol35-no3)

### Withdrawn

This operational position has been withdrawn and replaced by [OP 23/02: Commissioner’s operational position on professional directors and board members incorrectly registered for GST](/operational-positions/2023/op-23-02)
.

In the Commentary to public ruling BR Pub 23/01 “Goods and Services Tax – Directors’ Fees” the Commissioner has expanded on the view taken in the previous equivalent ruling (BR Pub 15/10 “Goods and Services Tax – directors’ fees”) and concluded that a person who provides only directorship services is not eligible to be registered for GST.  (A similar treatment applies to board members covered by public ruling BR Pub 23/02 “Goods and Services Tax – Fees of Board Members not appointed by the Governor-General or Governor-General in Council”.)  While this treatment of professional directors and board members is not a change in the Commissioner’s view it is the first time that this view has been published in respect of this issue.

The Commissioner is aware that some professional directors[1](#footnote)
 are registered for GST, having incorrectly taken the view that they are carrying on a taxable activity. The Commissioner will not require these taxpayers to _retrospectively_ deregister. However, those professional directors who are not carrying on a taxable activity must deregister with effect from 30 June 2023, or such other date as may be determined by the Commissioner. 

On deregistration a taxpayer may be required to return GST on the market value of any goods and services that they retain that had form part of their taxable activity (s 5(3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985). 

Professional directors who may be affected by BR Pub 23/01 “Goods and Services Tax – Directors’ Fees” will likely come within one of the following categories:

1.  Professional directors who are registered but should never have been registered. This group includes people who never had a separate taxable activity (consulting activity, law practice, accounting practice etc) but notwithstanding this were registered for GST.
2.  Professional directors who are registered and were appropriately registered at that time because they carried on a separate taxable activity aside from their directorships but who have subsequently ceased to carry on that other activity and whose only “taxable supplies” are from their directorship fees and so should now be deregistered.
3.  Professional directors who are registered and were appropriately registered at that time because they carried on a separate taxable activity under which they included their directorship income, and who still carry on that separate taxable activity. This group can continue to remain registered for GST and continue to operate on that basis. However, if the turnover of their “non-directorship income” falls below the registration threshold they may choose to deregister consistent with category 2 above.

This operational position does not apply to professional directors who are registered and were appropriately registered at that time because they carried on a taxable activity separate to their directorships (for example, as an accountant), and who still carry on a separate taxable activity (whether above or below the registration threshold) and wish to remain registered for GST.

Any professional director who should be deregistered because of the Commissioner’s interpretation (or who wishes to deregister based on category 3 above) should utilise the “cancel your GST registration” process in myIR or complete an IR315 business cessation form.

Any professional director who wishes to discuss their situation with Inland Revenue should send a web message through myIR by first selecting “GST” as the subject from the drop-down menu, and then referencing BR Pub 23/01 to enable analytics to identify these messages. Please outline in the web message the circumstances you would like to discuss.

1 References in this Operational Position to professional directors should also be treated as applying to board members in an equivalent position under BR Pub 23/02.

Commissioner’s operational position on professional directors and board members incorrectly registered for GST
==============================================================================================================

The Commissioner has released three Public Rulings concerning the GST treatment of fees paid to directors and board members:

*   BR Pub 23/01 “Goods and Services Tax – Directors’ Fees”;
*   BR Pub 23/02 “Goods and Services Tax – Fees of Board Members not appointed by the Governor-General or Governor-General in Council”; and
*   BR Pub 23/03 “Goods and Services Tax – Fees of Board Members appointed by the Governor-General or Governor-General in Council”.

This Operational Position gives guidance on how these rulings will be applied.

This item replaces [OP 23/01: Commissioner’s operational position on professional directors and board members incorrectly registered for GST](/operational-positions/2023/op-23-01)
.

In the Commentary to public ruling BR Pub 23/01 “Goods and Services Tax – Directors’ Fees” the Commissioner has expanded on the view taken in the previous equivalent ruling (BR Pub 15/10 “Goods and Services Tax – directors’ fees”) and concluded that a person who provides only directorship services is not eligible to be registered for GST.  (A similar treatment applies to board members covered by public ruling BR Pub 23/02 “Goods and Services Tax – Fees of Board Members not appointed by the Governor-General or Governor-General in Council”.)  While this treatment of professional directors and board members is not a change in the Commissioner’s view it is the first time that this view has been published in respect of this issue.

On deregistration a taxpayer may be required to return GST on the market value of any goods and services that they retain that had form part of their taxable activity (s 5(3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985).

However, if the turnover of their “non-directorship income” falls below the registration threshold they may choose to deregister consistent with category 2 above.

This operational position does not apply to professional directors who are registered and were appropriately registered at that time because they carried on a taxable activity separate to their directorships (for example, as an accountant), and who still carry on a separate taxable activity (whether above or below the registration threshold) and wish to remain registered for GST.

Also, directors and board members operating through personal services companies (therefore not in their personal capacity) will often be able to register the personal service company as long as the personal service company’s level of activity is sufficient to be a taxable activity as defined in section 6(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. This is because the supply of directorship services is distinct from the supply of personally being a director.

Any professional director who should be deregistered because of the Commissioner’s interpretation (or who wishes to deregister based on category 3 above) should utilise the “cancel your GST registration” process in myIR or complete an IR315 business cessation form.

Any professional director who wishes to discuss their situation with Inland Revenue should send a web message through myIR by first selecting “GST” as the subject from the drop-down menu, and then referencing BR Pub 23/01 to enable analytics to identify these messages.

Commissioner’s operational position on the GST treatment of landlords supplying properties for use as transitional housing
==========================================================================================================================

The Commissioner has released three public rulings on the GST treatment of supplies of properties by landlords to organisations for use in the Transitional Housing Programme of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD): BR Pub 24/01, 24/02 and 24/03 (the Rulings).

This Operational Position gives guidance on how the Commissioner will apply the technical view set out in the commentary to the Rulings where landlords have taken incorrect tax positions in previous GST periods.

In brief:

*   Where previous supplies made by landlords were incorrectly treated as taxable supplies (but were exempt supplies), the Commissioner does not expect assessments to be corrected to reverse input tax deductions if the landlord is subsequently making taxable supplies because of the organisation’s new arrangements.Doing so would only result in input tax deductions in a later period because under the arrangements covered by the Rulings there will have been a permanent change in use from making exempt supplies to making taxable supplies.
    
*   In other situations, landlords should consider how the GST legislation applies to their individual circumstances and contact Inland Revenue (by sending a message in MyIR with “transitional housing” in the subject line) or their tax advisor to determine if they may have taken incorrect tax positions.Depending on the situation, several provisions of the GST legislation could be relevant, as referred to below.

**The Rulings and Commentary on the Rulings**

The Rulings concern the GST treatment of supplies made by landlords to organisations who have entered a Transitional Housing Services Agreement with HUD from 1 July 2023 (the new THS Agreement).  These supplies may or may not be exempt supplies depending on the type of property and what is offered to occupiers of the properties.

The commentary to the Rulings also discusses matters that will be relevant to determining whether the supply by landlords will be an exempt or taxable supply generally, not just for arrangements involving the new THS Agreement.  The commentary is therefore relevant to other situations. It is possible that the supplies of properties to organisations for use in providing transitional housing may be either taxable or exempt.  The exemption is for supplies of leasing for the purpose of accommodation in a dwelling (under s 14(1)(cb) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act)).  It will sometimes be difficult to determine whether something amounts to a “dwelling” and what the purpose of the leasing was.

Possible incorrect tax positions include landlords deducting input tax for acquisition or development costs for buildings that are dwellings.  In this situation, leasing the building to organisations should have been treated as an exempt supply.  Another possibility is landlords may have acquired buildings in transactions which were incorrectly zero-rated as the buildings were not intended to be used to make taxable supplies.

**The Commissioner’s operational approach**

Following publication of the Rulings, the Commissioner expects landlords to comply with the Commissioner’s view of the law as set out in the commentary when taking tax positions.  This will mean where BR Pub 24/02 and 24/03 apply (ie there is no exempt supply involved), supplies of properties by landlords to organisations should be treated as taxable supplies (where the organisation has not chosen to provide the Household with the relevant quiet enjoyment rights in their Housing Agreement).  Output tax and input tax should be accounted for on that basis going forward.

Some landlords may have taken incorrect positions in previous periods on whether or not supplies were exempt under s 14(1)(cb) of the GST Act.

One thing that many will need to consider is the application of s 21FB.  This would apply where use of the building has changed completely from making exempt supplies to making taxable supplies (or from making taxable supplies to making exempt supplies).   Amending assessments to correct tax positions taken in earlier periods may not result in material change for landlords who are making taxable supplies rather than exempt supplies.  This means that, for example, where landlords have completed GST returns on the basis that they were making taxable supplies of property when in fact they were making exempt supplies but they make taxable supplies going forward, reversing input tax deductions for property acquired would be followed by the need to make adjustments for a permanent change of use of the property in the first GST adjustment period in which the property is used for making taxable supplies.  This is the effect of s 21FB. 

In those circumstances, taking action to reverse input tax deductions would result in similar amounts of input tax deductions being allowed in a subsequent period.  Therefore, although the assessments for prior GST periods might not be correct technically, the Commissioner will not be devoting resources to identifying incorrect returns and amending such assessments for previous GST periods to correct input tax deductions or incorrectly returned output tax.

For other similar arrangements, not covered by the Rulings, landlords should discuss the situation with Inland Revenue or their tax advisor to determine if they may have taken incorrect tax positions.  To contact Inland Revenue, send a message in MyIR putting “transitional housing” in the subject line so that it will be answered by the personnel familiar with the issues in this area.

For some situations, a voluntary disclosure may be a suitable option to reduce the risk of penalties.  This would include where landlords have not returned output tax on what should have been treated as taxable supplies (including disposals of property) because they assumed the supplies to have been exempt.

**Relevant GST Act sections**

How the GST Act applies to individual circumstances will vary.  The following provisions may be especially relevant where landlords have taken incorrect input tax deductions for acquisition or development costs for a building:

*   s 21FB – where the use of a building in making taxable supplies, as a percentage of total use, permanently changes, an adjustment according to a formula should be made.  This can result in an adjustment equal to 100% of the total input tax for the building.

*   s 5(23B) – if a building was acquired in a zero-rated transaction, and after applying the guidance in BR Pub 24/01 the landlord becomes aware that the transaction should not have been zero-rated, the landlord may be deemed to make a taxable supply of the building (for market value consideration) on the date when this error was discovered.

*   ss 5(16), 5(16B) and 5(16C) – the sale of a building may be treated as a taxable supply if input tax was deducted on acquisition or its acquisition was treated as zero-rated, and it is not being used in a taxable activity when it is sold, or its non-taxable use has increased and s 21FB has been applied in contemplation of sale.

*   S 91 – an election made before 1 April 2025 to pay output tax equal to inputs incorrectly deducted will mean the sale of a building will not be a taxable supply if the building was not acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies and has not actually been used for making taxable supplies.

The information in this document was current at the time of publication. Please refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. ird.govt.nz April 2023 Operational process summary Overview The High-Wealth Individuals Research Project is an evidence-based research project carried out by Inland Revenue. It calculates the effective tax rates of just over 300 of the wealthiest tax-resident New Zealanders and their direct household family members, for the income years 2016-2021. The Project, and resulting report, was the subject of specific funding in the 2021 Budget. The main goal has been to improve the evidence base on the fairness and efficiency of the tax system in New Zealand. The report does not make recommendations concerning future tax policy initiatives. Population The group studied are among those tax residents of New Zealand with the highest net worth in the years under study. The initial threshold for inclusion was estimated net worth in excess of $50 million or net worth over $20 million if other factors were met. These people were identified using tax administrative data and public records, within certain criteria. Some families initially identified who did not meet the net worth threshold or tax residency requirements were subsequently excluded from the research. Throughout the process, we received a high level of responsiveness from the high-wealth individuals, as well as their advisors, resulting in an overall response rate of approximately 90%. This resulted in a final group of 311 individuals, and their immediate families, who are in the aggregate figures presented in the report. Information collection The Project has relied heavily on both tax administration data and public data sources, but it was important to supplement that with additional data from the group itself. Information was collected from the high-wealth families through 3 survey-stages in 2021 and 2022: Stage 1 – Family collection – this was to enable us to understand who was in the family – the Project looks at economic income at the family as well as the individual level. Stage 2 – Entity collection – this was to ensure we were able to identify all the companies, trusts and partnerships which had substantially contributed to a family's economic income for the Project period. By requesting this data, we were able to access Inland Revenue’s internal data for these entities, which reduced the information required from these individuals. Stage 3 – Financial collection – finally there were a number of supplementary questions we needed to ask relating to financial information about individuals and entities that we do not hold, to make our overall data as accurate as possible The information in this document was current at the time of publication. Please refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. ird.govt.nz The information requested was designed to help measure key sources of economic income (that is, all income sources including taxable ones) to calculate the effective tax rates of the individuals and families. Information was only sought if it was not otherwise reasonably available to Inland Revenue. Dedicated resources were used to support customers, and agents’, queries during the information collection stages. Our authority to collect this information At each stage information was requested from individuals using section 17GB of the Tax Administration Act 1994, a new provision that allows the Commissioner to collect information for tax policy purposes. Information collected for the Project under section 17GB will not be used to reassess anyone’s current or future taxable income. Privacy Inland Revenue has made preservation of individual privacy a key element of the Project. The report does not disclose data on specific individuals. After discussions with the Privacy Commissioner, Inland Revenue’s Privacy Officer and with stakeholders, internal rules and processes were put in place to ensure that the additional information sought from the group would not be able to be used by Inland Revenue in its operational activities. Furthermore, the raw data collected under section 17GB, that may identify individuals, will be disposed of when the Project is completed. A Privacy Impact Assessment has been published and is available for review under the document library section of the High-Wealth Individuals Research Project web page. Project Governance The Project was led by Inland Revenue’s Policy and Regulatory Stewardship group. A dedicated Project team was established. Further, a Project governance group was established to oversee the operation of the Project. Membership of the governance group was made up of senior officials from across Inland Revenue. Further details about the governance group can be found in the Privacy Impact Assessment. External Input External input was provided through a Methodology Advisory Group who provided comment on the methodology as it developed. The report was subject to peer-review by two academic reviewers. Models and data analysis were subject to review by specialist data consultancy firms.
1 Operational Statement 18/01 Commissioner’s statement on using a kilometre rate for business running of a motor vehicle INTRODUCTION All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007. This Operational Statement (the Statement) updates and replaces Operation Statement OS 09/01 Commissioner’s statement on use of a kilometre rate for expenditure incurred for business use of a motor vehicle, issued in May 2009. This Statement explains how the kilometre rates are to be applied and also sets the rates for the current year. Future rates will be set each year as third party data becomes available. This Statement is made up of two parts. Part One deals with deductions for the business use of a motor vehicle. Part Two deals with the tax treatment of reimbursement payments made by an employer to an employee where the employee uses their private motor vehicle for employment purposes. Both Parts are followed by examples and a flowchart that sets out the process that applies to each. PART ONE - D eductions for business running of a motor vehicle using a kilometre rate Where a person intends to claim an expense deduction for a motor vehicle that is used partly for business purposes and partly for other purposes they must calculate the proportion of business use using either a logbook or actual records. Under section DE 2, a person may use one of two methods to calculate the deduction for that proportion of business use, namely:  A cost method based on actual costs; or  A kilometre rate method. Section DE 12(4) requires the Commissioner to set and publish kilometre rates that taxpayers may use to calculate the expenditure or loss on a motor vehicle that represents the proportion of business use of a motor vehicle. This Statement sets out how the kilometre rates are applied. APPLICATION The kilometre rates apply from the 2017/2018 income year. 2 OPERATIONAL PRACTICE Summary 1. A person must determine the business use of a motor vehicle against the total kilometres travelled by that motor vehicle. A logbook 1 , diary, calendar or other suitable method may be used for this purpose. This information will be used to calculate the income tax deduction. 2. A deduction can be made in respect of the business portion of their actual motor vehicle costs. This is known as the cost method. Alternatively, a person may use the section DE 12 kilometre rates set annually by the Commissioner for each vehicle type. This is known as the kilometre rate method. 3. A person wishing to use the kilometre rate method must make an (irrevocable) election to use this method. That election will apply until the vehicle is disposed of. 4. The election must be made on a vehicle by vehicle basis and be made in the year the vehicle is acquired or first used for business purposes. The election to use the kilometre rate method is made by using this method in the person’s return of income. If no election is made to use the kilometre rate method the person is deemed to have elected to use the cost method. In either case, the election is irrevocable. 5. An election may also be made for any vehicle used for business that is held at the beginning of the 2017/2018 income year except where that vehicle is disposed of during that income year. 6. The kilometre rates will be set by the Commissioner by reference to industry figures that represent the average cost of operating a motor vehicle. 7. The various rates for selected vehicle types will be made up of two Tier rates. 8. The Tier One rate is a combination of the vehicles fixed and running costs. The Tier One rate applies for the business portion of the first 14,000 kilometres travelled by the motor vehicle in a year. After which the Tier Two rates which includes only the running costs, applies for the business portion of any travel in excess of 14,000kms. 9. The following are the rates per kilometre that will apply for the 2017/2018 income year: 2017/2018 Kilometre Rates Vehicle Type Tier One Rate Tier Two rate Petrol or Diesel 76 cents 26 cents Petrol Hybrid 18 cents Electric 9 cents 10. A person wishing to use the kilometre rate method will be required to keep a record of all travel undertaken by the vehicle. This requirement may be met through the use of a logbook in accordance with sections DE 6 to DE 11, or some other recording method such as a diary. Paragraphs 19 to 22 of this Statement 1 Refer paragraph 19 which explains the use of log books 3 contain more information on logbooks. Note that although not all travel (non- business as well as business travel) needs to be recorded, a person who uses the kilometre rate method will need to be able to show whether, and when, the vehicle exceeds the 14,000 annual kilometres. 11. The cost method must be used for any vehicle type not included in the above table. 12. The 5,000 kilometre limit to deductions of motor vehicle expenditure using the section DE 12 kilometre rates set out in OS 09/01 no longer applies. 13. There is no depreciation deduction or recovery of depreciation where a person has elected to use the section DE 12 kilometre rate method for a motor vehicle. 14. Close companies may now use the section DE 2 cost method or kilometre rate method as an alternative to paying FBT where a motor vehicle is provided to a shareholder employee, so long as that close company’s only non-cash benefit is the availability of a motor vehicle for the private use of the shareholder. The close company must make an irrevocable election to use section DE 2 to calculate the amount of their deduction. 15. The election by a close company to make deductions under section DE 2 instead of applying the FBT rules must be made within the time for filing the company’s return of income in which the election is made. Elections are only available for vehicles acquired or first used for business purposes on or after 1 April 2017. 16. Where a close company elects to use subpart DE to calculate the cost of business use of a motor vehicle, any interest deductions are to be included in those calculations. This means that a close company applying subpart DE will need to ensure that any interest deduction under sections DB 7 or 8 does not relate to a motor vehicle. Detailed Discussion Recent legislation changes 17. The Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017 introduced a number of amendments that allow a person to use a simplified method of calculating deductions for motor vehicles that are used for both business and other purposes, such as for private purposes. These changes came in to effect from the 2017/2018 income year and are explained in detail in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 4, May 2017. This can be viewed on Inland Revenue’s website here . 18. Without completely restating that explanation, the key features in respect of claiming motor vehicle expenses where a vehicle is used for both business and other purposes are as follows:  Instead of making a claim for the business use of a motor vehicle based on the actual costs, a taxpayer may elect to have a deduction for the business use portion based on a kilometre rate method.  In respect of the kilometre rate method, the Commissioner will set rates by reference to industry figures that represent the average cost of using average motor vehicles.  There is no longer a 5,000km limit restricting the use of these rates.  The rates will be divided into two Tiers – 4 o The first Tier will provide for deductions based on the recovery of both the vehicle’s fixed costs and it’s per kilometre running costs; o The second Tier will provide for the recovery of the vehicle’s per kilometre running costs only.  The Tier One rate is limited to the first 14,000 kilometres (total kilometres in each income year) as the fixed costs of the vehicle ownership would be over deducted with increasing usage if a single rate were used. The Tier Two rates apply for any use above 14,000 kilometres.  The election to use the kilometre rate method applies on a per vehicle basis and is irrevocable (section DE 2B(3) refers), so a person may not switch back and forth between methods for the same vehicle.  The election is made by using this method in a tax return for the year in which the vehicle is acquired or first used for business purposes.  For a vehicle held at 1 April 2017, the election must be made in the return of income for the 2017/2018 income year unless the vehicle is disposed of during that year. Note, there are different rules that apply to close companies wishing to adopt the kilometre rates instead of paying FBT for shareholder employees. This is further explained below.  If a person uses a vehicle for dual purposes (business and other purposes) but does not make an election to use the kilometre rate method, they are deemed to have made an irrevocable election to use the cost method (section DE 2B(3) refers).  There is no depreciation deduction or recovery of depreciation for a motor vehicle where a person has elected to use the section DE 12 kilometre rate method for that motor vehicle.  Where a close company’s only non-cash benefit is the availability of a motor vehicle for the private use of a shareholder, that close company may use section DE 2 as an alternative to paying FBT provided that close company also makes an election to apply the kilometre rate method to calculate the amount of their deduction.  The election by a close company to make deductions using section DE 2 instead of applying the FBT rules must be made within the time for filing the company’s relevant return of income.  Where a close company uses section DE 2 to calculate the cost of business use of a motor vehicle, any interest deductions are to be included in those calculations. This means that there is no separate interest deduction in respect of that vehicle under sections DB 7 or 8. Use of logbooks 19. Sections DE 6 to DE 11 provide the rules for establishing the proportion of business use of a motor vehicle. These rules provide that a person may keep a logbook for a test period of at least 90 consecutive days. 20. That logbook test period is used to establish the average proportion of travel by the vehicle for business purposes during the logbook term (up to three years). This proportion may be used for deductions using the cost method or where the taxpayer has elected to use the kilometre rate method. 21. The logbook must record:  The start and the end of the 90 day test period; and  The vehicle’s odometer readings at the start and end of the test period; and  The distance of each business journey; and  The date of each business journey; and 5  The reason for each business journey; and  Any other detail that the Commissioner may require. 22. In the absence of a logbook (or actual records), section DE 4(2) limits any deductions to a maximum of 25% as a proportion of business use of a motor vehicle, assuming, of course, that such a percentage can be justified. Record of total kilometres travelled each income year 23. A person who has elected to use the kilometre rate method must record their odometer reading every balance date for each vehicle covered by an election so that they can determine whether the vehicle has travelled 14,000 kilometres (business and non-business) for the year. This is because the deduction for the kilometre rate method is based on a two Tier approach where the Tier One rate is only available for the first 14,000 total kilometres. Examples of kilometre rate method to calculate deductions: Example one – Greater than 14,000 kms travelled – log book maintained: The taxpayer uses their Holden Commodore 3.6 litre petrol car for both business and private purposes. The previous log book test period calculates that 60% of the travel is for business purposes. The car travelled a total of 20,000 kilometres for the 2017/2018 income year. Deduction: Tier One 14,000 x $0.76 x 60% = 6,384.00 Tier Two 6,000 x $0.26 x 60% = 936.00 Total deduction $7,320.00 Example two – Greater than 14,000 kms travelled- no log book: The taxpayer uses their Holden Commodore 3.6 litre petrol car for both business and private purposes. No log book breakdown or other record of motor vehicle use is maintained. However, it is known that the car travelled a total of 20,000 kilometres for the 2017/2018 income year and at least 25% of this travel was for business purposes. Deduction: Tier One 14,000 x $0.76 x 25% = 2,660.00 Tier Two 6,000 x $0.26 x 25% = 390.00 Total deduction $3,050.00 6 Is vehicle used for both business and private? Made election to use kilometre rate method? Are full records or is a logbook maintained? Are full records or is a logbook maintained? If all business, full claim using cost method; or If all private, no claim. Maximum 25% claim using cost method. Use Tier One for first 14,000 total kilometres and Tier Two rates after that. Tier Two rates are based on vehicle type. Use Tier One rate for first 3,500 business kilometres, and Tier Two rates after that. Tier Two rates are based on vehicle type. Cost method applies. Yes Yes Yes No No No No Claim proportion of actual expenses. Yes 7 PART TWO - Employee reimbursement for business running of an employee’s motor vehicle using a kilometre rate Introduction 24. This Part explains the acceptable method to establish the tax exempt portion of an amount paid to an employee as reimbursement of expenditure incurred by that employee where the employee uses their private motor vehicle in the employer’s business. 25. Employers may reimburse their employee based on the actual expenditure incurred by that employee. Alternatively, section CW 17(3) provides that an employer may make a reasonable estimate of expenditure likely to be incurred by an employee or group of employees. It is acceptable to use third party data to assist in making such an estimate. 26. In OS 09/01 the Commissioner accepted that the mileage rate set under that statement could be regarded as being a reasonable estimate of expenditure under section CW 17(3). That general position has not changed except that the method of calculating the kilometre rate method for business deductions has changed and this has necessitated a review of the calculation of using the kilometre rate method for employee reimbursements. OPERATIONAL PRACTICE Employee reimbursement 27. Where the employee maintains a logbook, or other evidence that establishes the proportion of employment use for an income year, the calculation of the exempt portion of reimbursement may be based on the kilometre rate set by Inland Revenue. The Tier One rate can be applied for the business portion of the first 14,000 kms (total) travelled by the vehicle in each income year, after which the Tier Two rates will apply. Note that even where the employee records a logbook test period in accordance with the rules in section DE 6 to DE 11, the annual kilometres travelled must still be monitored so that it is known whether the 14,000 figure is reached each year. 28. However, where no logbook or other records are maintained, the use of the Tier One rate to calculate the exemption for employee reimbursement is limited to the first 3,500 kilometres travelled for employment purposes. The Tier Two rates may be used for kilometres travelled for employment purposes above the 3,500km figure. 29. The 3,500 kilometres is based on 25% of the average annual expected (14,000) kilometres travelled for each motor vehicle. 25% is the maximum percentage allowed for business deductions where no logbook is maintained. 30. The changes to the business deductions take effect for the 2018 income year onwards and require a different approach and calculation of those rates. It is accepted that the changes with regard to employee reimbursement will always be subject to a time lag using those figures. As such, for the 2018/2019 income year employers may reimburse employees using the new Tier one rate of 76 cents per kilometre from the date of this Statement. However, the two tiered rates as set out above must be used for the 2019/2020 and subsequent income years. 8 31. The following are the rates per kilometre that will apply for the 2019/2020 income year: 2017/2018 Kilometre Rates Vehicle Type Tier One Rate Tier Two rate Petrol or Diesel 76 cents 26 cents Petrol Hybrid 18 cents Electric 9 cents The following are examples using kilometre rate method to calculate employee reimbursement for the 2019/2020 income year: Example three – Greater than 14,000 kms travelled – Logbook maintained: The employee uses their Holden Commodore 3.6 litre petrol car for both employment and private purposes. The previous logbook test period calculates that 60% of the travel is for employment purposes. The car travelled a total of 20,000 kilometres for the 2019/2020 income year. Deduction: Tier One 14,000 x $0.76 x 60% = 6,384.00 Tier Two 6,000 x $0.26 x 60% = 936.00 Total amount exempt $7,320.00 Example four – Greater than 14,000 kms travelled – No logbook: The employee uses their Holden Commodore 3.6 litre petrol car for both business and private purposes. The journey’s related to their employment equated to a total of 16,000kms. Exempt calculation: Tier One 3,500 x $0.76 = 2,660.00 Tier Two 12,500 (kms in excess of 3,500) x $0.26 = 3,250.00 Total amount exempt $5,910.00 9 Agreed to reimburse using kilometre. rate. Are full records or is a logbook maintained? Yes No Use Tier One for first 14,000 total kilometres and Tier Two rates after that. Tier Two rates are based on vehicle type. Use Tier One rate for first 3,500 business kilometres and Tier Two rates after that. Tier Two rates are based on vehicle type. Reimbursements should be based on the cost method or some other appropriate method. Reimbursement must be supported by evidence. No Yes 10 This Operational Statement is signed on 4 July 2018.

Other ways to do this

Sometimes employees opt into KiwiSaver through a scheme provider. This means they've chosen their own scheme and joined KiwiSaver through them.

If your employee opts in with a scheme provider, we’ll write to you to let you know:

*   they’ve opted in with a scheme provider
*   your employee’s IRD number
*   the rate by which they want you to deduct KiwiSaver contributions from their pay.

Optional adjustment to assets under thin-cap rules
==================================================

2012 Canterbury Earthquake related legislation provides an optional adjustment to how group assets are measured for the purposes of the thin-capitalisation rules.

_Section FZ 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

New section FZ 7 provides an optional adjustment to how group assets are measured for the purposes of the thin-capitalisation rules. The adjustment mitigates a timing problem that arises because insurance proceeds are recognised at a later date than damage caused by the Canterbury earthquakes.

### Background

The thin-capitalisation rules are based on accounting measures of assets. For accounting purposes, damaged assets are immediately impaired or derecognised. In contrast, insurance proceeds cannot be recognised until they are reasonably expected (for example, can be given a confirmed value).

Section FZ 7 is designed to mitigate this timing difference by allowing certain taxpayers to carry-back known insurance proceeds to the date on which an asset was impaired or derecognised as a result of damage caused by the Canterbury earthquakes. The amount that can be carried back is limited to the lesser of the amount of damage or the related insurance proceeds.

### Key features

Before a person can choose to use the optional adjustment, they must first satisfy the conditions in section FZ 7(1).

These conditions are that:

*   an asset of the person's New Zealand group has been damaged as a result of the Canterbury Earthquakes;
*   the asset has been impaired or derecognised under generally accepted accounting practice as a result of that damage; and
*   insurance for the damage has been recognised at a later date under generally accepted accounting practice.

In such cases, the New Zealand group is able to choose to carry-back the insurance amount and regard this as an asset. The amount that can be carried back is limited to the lesser of the amount of damage or the related insurance proceeds. For impaired assets the damage is measured as the amount the asset has been impaired (as long as the impairment was a result of the earthquake damage rather than other reasons). For derecognised assets the damage is the amount of the derecognised asset (again, as long as the asset has been derecognised as a result of earthquake damage).

Section FZ 7(2) provides for this additional asset to exist for a temporary period beginning on the day that the relevant asset is impaired or derecognised and ending on the day that the corresponding amount of insurance is recognised for accounting purposes.

Section FZ 7(3) requires that if a person chooses to use section FZ 7(2) to increase the assets of their New Zealand group they must also increase the assets of their worldwide group by the same amount for a corresponding period. This ensures the worldwide group test continues to operate on a consistent basis.

A person could receive insurance pay-outs for several different events. In such cases, each insurance pay-out is treated separately and can only be carried back to the date of the related damage.

##### Example

A company has $1 million of impairment as a result of an earthquake that occurred during its 2010-11 income year. In its 2011-12 income year there is a further $500k of impairment relating to a different earthquake. It receives $1.5 million of insurance pay-outs for both events in the 2011-12 income year. The company would only be able to claim an asset of $1 million in the 2010-11 income year.

Under generally accepted accounting practice the insurance may be recognised all at once if it is for a certain amount. Alternatively, if the person is entitled to reimbursement of costs actually incurred in repairing an asset, then the insurance revenue could be recognised gradually as the repair costs are incurred.

In cases when the insurance is recognised gradually, the amount that is available under the provision should also be reduced gradually, at the same time that the insurance is recognised.

##### Example

A company has $2 million of impairment, $500k of which is repaired and reimbursed by insurance in 2011-12 and the remaining $1.5 million is repaired and reimbursed in 2012-13. In 2011-12 the company can claim $1.5 million of additional assets under section FZ 7 ($2 million - $500,000 = $1.5 million) and in 2012-13 all the impairment has been met by insurance so section FZ 7 no longer applies ($2 million - $2 million = 0).

#### Notification requirement

Section FZ 7(4) requires a person who chooses to use section FZ 7(2) to inform the Commissioner that they are applying this rule and to provide some information on its effect, including:

*   notice to the Commissioner that section FZ 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 has been applied;
*   the amount of income that would arise under section CH 9 of the Income Tax Act 2007 in the absence of section FZ 7; and
*   the amount of income that arises under section CH 9 by applying section FZ 7.

This information should be e-mailed to [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#74171b19041100111a005a1501001c1b061d000d341d06105a131b02005a1a0e)
 by the later of 30 November 2012 or the day that the person is required to make a return of income for the corresponding tax year.

### Application date

Section FZ 7 applies for income years ending after 4 September 2010 and before the 2016-17 income year.

Orders for discovery
====================

2008 case note - General discovery by each party was ordered but confined to a particular forestry partnership.

Case

TRA decision number 03/08

Legislative References

Taxation Administration Act, 1994; District Court Rules; Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998; Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994

### Summary

General discovery by each party was ordered but confined to a particular forestry partnership.

### Facts

The Commissioner had sought an order for discovery. At the Directions Hearing the taxpayer sought an order that the general discovery sought by the Commissioner should not be made and if one is to be made, then the taxpayer also seeks discovery from the Commissioner.

The substantive proceedings concern an alleged tax avoidance arrangement involving a forestry partnership.

**Taxpayer's Submissions:**

*   The Commissioner's application for discovery is an interlocutory application and therefore the onus is on the Commissioner to establish that the order is justified. (Regulation 12(5) of the Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998 (TRAR)). This has not been established.
*   A discovery order in the context of a dispute which has been fully subject to Part IVA procedures is inconsistent with section 138G (Evidence exclusion rule) of the Tax Administration Act (TAA).

**Commissioner's Submissions:**

*   The scheme and purpose of the legislation supports the litigant's entitlement to general discovery.
*   Section 138G (Evidence exclusion rule) does not affect the Commissioner's right to general discovery.
*   There is no onus of proof in respect of whether the Commissioner is entitled to general discovery as it is a matter of law.

### Decision

The TRA agreed with the Commissioner and ordered general discovery by each party but confined it to one partnership as agreed between the parties.

Discovery is essential to ensuring that the necessary evidence is before the Authority. If any tax legislation sought to remove a litigant's right to discovery this intention would have been expressed clearly and not left to inference.

It is inconsistent with the encouragement of openness in the TAA not to order discovery. This is particularly so as the Commissioner is entitled to establish what documents are in the possession of the taxpayer and whether the taxpayer was forthcoming and open during the disputes process.

To understand the impact of the evidence exclusion rule on discovery a distinction needs to be drawn between particular discovery and general discovery. Particular discovery allows a party to obtain a court order for discovery of specified documents or a class of documents. The evidence exclusion rule needs to be taken into account when making such an order. With regard to general discovery the evidence exclusion rule is not a bar to obtaining this. No court order is required for general discovery and no requirement that discovery must be necessary prior to a party having discovery obligations.

Under the District Court Rules 1991, the defendant has the right to require general discovery. The requirement of necessity, which applies to particular discovery does not apply to general discovery unless an order is sought under R 319. The evidence exclusion rule is therefore not applicable to routine general discovery under the Rules.

His Honour stated that for the evidence exclusion rule to operate in the manner envisaged in the TAA general discovery is required. This is because, as it is not possible for the party receiving general discovery to know what documents are going to be discovered, in the ordinary course the application of the evidence exclusion rule cannot be ascertained. General discovery is therefore necessary before the application of s138G can even be determined. General discovery is entirely consistent with full disclosure as it enables an assessment of whether there has been such full disclosure.

General discovery being allowed is consistent with the purpose of a Commission of Inquiry, being to establish the correct position from the available evidence.

General discovery is essential to achieve the purpose of the TRA, being to determine challenges in accordance with the law and taking into account all available and admissible evidence.

There is nothing in TRA regulations or in any other statutory provision which makes general discovery before the TRA an interlocutory application.
