Since the early 1990s, New Zealand has progressively introduced a self-assessment system by using modern administrative practices and by legislating various administrative functions to help taxpayers undertake self-assessment. One such measure is our binding rulings system. 1.2 The binding rulings system was introduced in 1992 following the recommendation of the 1989–90 Tax Simplification Consultative Committee. The recommendation reflected the need for businesses to ensure that the tax consequences of a transaction are clear and, if Inland Revenue has given advice, that the advice will not change. This is particularly important when a business enters a complex tax arrangement. 1.3 The need for certainty is ongoing and is particularly relevant in the current economic climate. 1.4 This issues paper focuses on legislative concerns with the current binding rulings system that are of a clarifying or remedial nature. A number of possible solutions are suggested, aimed at ensuring that the legislation as far as possible supports, or at least does not impede, the timely delivery of binding rulings. Purpose and background 1.5 In broad terms, a binding ruling will set out how Inland Revenue will apply tax laws to a particular arrangement. Taxpayers are not required to follow the ruling. However, if the taxpayer chooses to follow the ruling, Inland Revenue must apply the tax laws as set out in the ruling. 1.6 There are two principal benefits for taxpayers in obtaining a binding ruling: • greater certainty about the tax implications of their business decisions; and • assistance in knowing how to comply with the tax law. 2 1.7 The current binding rulings system has been reviewed by government from time to time and this has resulted in some minor legislative changes over the years. There is no indication that the system requires a fuller review or overhaul at present. However, several commentators have raised questions relating to the time it takes Inland Revenue to issue a binding ruling. These questions have been about administrative rather than legislative matters, and are currently under discussion between Inland Revenue and representatives of the legal, accounting and business sectors. This paper focuses on certain legislative matters involved in Inland Revenue issuing binding rulings. 1.8 This issues paper has been prepared by officials from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue and from the Treasury, as part of a consultation process. It seeks readers’ views on how the law might be changed to achieve this result, and on the workability of the solutions explored here. Submissions will be taken into account when we make formal recommendations to the Government on the final form of the changes, with any amendments included in the next available tax bill. Summary of suggested options Scope of binding rulings (Chapter 3) Replace the current general prohibition on ruling on questions of fact (contained in section 91E(4)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994) with a more limited list of factual matters on which the Commissioner cannot rule. They would include: • A person’s intention or purpose – for example, in relation to the acquisition of land. (This would not include the purpose of an arrangement under anti- avoidance legislation.) • A determination of the value of anything – other than under the transfer pricing provisions, which are specifically excluded from the ambit of section 91E(4)(a). • What “commercially acceptable practice” is for the purpose of any provision of subpart EW (the financial arrangements rules) that refers to commercially acceptable practice. This exception would clarify the application of section 91E(4)(j) which could consequentially be removed. An alternative option is to give the Commissioner a discretion not to rule in relation to questions of fact (accompanied by a limitation to the scope of commercially acceptable practice). 3 Charging for binding rulings (Chapter 4) Introduce a more flexible fee-waiver provision based on what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances. Allow only one consultation period or one conference for the provision of, or a request for, additional information. Reduce the fees for binding rulings supplied to non-residents outside New Zealand by 1/9th if the supply is zero-rated. Mass-marketed and publicly promoted scheme rulings (Chapter 5) Allow promoters of arrangements, or those with a similar interest to that of a promoter, to apply for a product ruling for prospective arrangements. Require promoters to declare the correctness of the information they provide and/or be automatically subject to the promoter penalty in certain cases. Other matters (Chapter 6) Clarify the Commissioner’s discretion not to rule on matters before the courts by: • limiting its application to cases involving identical or substantially similar arrangements, facts or issues; or • basing the exercise of the discretion on factors such as the need for consistency in relation to specific common issues, integrity of the tax system and compliance and administrative cost reduction. Provide an exception to the prohibition on ruling if the arrangement involves two or more tax types and is the subject of a notice of proposed adjustment. Clarify that if a ruling is made on two or more tax types, and the ruling fails for one tax type, it will still be binding on the Commissioner for the other type or types. Remove the requirement to notify the making and withdrawal of public and product rulings in the Gazette and require that Inland Revenue publish notification in a suitable format. Providing rulings and other forms of advice (Chapter 7) Clarify that if the taxpayer has relied on official advice from Inland Revenue, the “unacceptable tax position” penalty and use-of-money interest cannot apply. 4 How to make a submission 1.9 Officials invite submissions on the matters raised in this issues paper. Submissions should be made by 28 August 2009 and be addressed to: Binding rulings review C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Or email policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Binding rulings review” in the subject line. 1.10 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for Inland Revenue and Treasury officials to contact those making the submission to discuss the points raised, if required. 1.11 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those making a submission who consider there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under the Act should clearly indicate this. 5 Chapter 2 THE BINDING RULINGS SYSTEM 2.1 In its review of 1989–90, the Tax Simplification Consultative Committee expressed concern that Inland Revenue could change its opinion without any formal procedure, leaving taxpayers unsure that their actions were based on decisions that would hold. The Committee also considered it unacceptable that taxpayers should be expected to file returns over a number of years with technical issues on those returns remaining unresolved. 1 2.2 The committee recommended resolving these concerns through a binding rulings regime which, in addition to providing much needed certainty, would have the following advantages: • a reduction in disputes and litigation; • increased consistency between Inland Revenue offices; • increased awareness and knowledge for Inland Revenue staff; and • improved relations between Inland Revenue and taxpayers. 2.3 The 1994 organisational review, in recommending an impartial adjudication process for Inland Revenue, also stressed the importance of impartiality by Inland Revenue in providing binding rulings. 2 To better achieve this, it recommended a specialist adjudication and rulings unit within Inland Revenue which would provide top-flight technical expertise. 3 (The adjudication and rulings functions are now performed by Inland Revenue’s Office of the Chief Tax Counsel.) 2.4 In the same year, the release of a government discussion document, Binding Rulings on Taxation, proposed that Inland Revenue be able to issue rulings on the interpretation of tax law which would bind Inland Revenue but not the taxpayer. The discussion document outlined most of the content of the current rulings process, which was enacted with effect from 1 April 1995. 2.5 In 1999, a post-implementation review of the binding rulings regime resulted in a number of legislative refinements, covering matters such as the impact on a ruling of legislative change and the consequences of an assumption included in a binding ruling proving to be incorrect. 1 Tax simplification final report of the consultative committee, 1990, Chapter 3. 2 Organisational review of the Inland Revenue Department, 1994, paragraph 16.1.2. 3 Ibid paragraph 17.2. 6 Outline of the current rules 2.6 A binding ruling sets out how Inland Revenue will apply tax laws to a particular arrangement. Taxpayers are not required to follow the ruling but, if they do so, Inland Revenue must apply the tax laws as set out in the ruling. 2.7 Inland Revenue can issue four types of binding ruling: • Public rulings: which give an interpretation on how a tax law applies to any type of taxpayer or type of arrangement. • Private rulings: which give an interpretation of the tax law as it applies to a specific taxpayer and a particular arrangement (either a one-off or recurring arrangement). • Product rulings: which set out Inland Revenue’s interpretation of the tax law as it applies to a particular “product”, which is an arrangement that is likely to be entered into by a number of people. A product ruling is only issued if: – Inland Revenue is satisfied that a private ruling cannot be made because it is not practicable to identify the taxpayers who may enter the arrangement; and – the characteristics of the taxpayers who may enter the arrangement would not affect the content of the ruling. • Status rulings: which set out Inland Revenue’s view of whether an amendment or repeal of a taxation law has changed the way that the law applies in a private or product ruling. 2.8 Inland Revenue can make private or product binding rulings on current and/or completed arrangements and on proposed arrangements that are “seriously contemplated” by the parties involved. 2.9 The legislation sets out the circumstances when Inland Revenue cannot rule – for example, if the application for the ruling would require Inland Revenue to determine questions of fact. It also sets out the circumstances in which Inland Revenue can decline to rule – for example, if the matter on which the ruling is sought is subject to an objection, challenge or appeal. 2.10 Private, product and status rulings are made upon application by the taxpayer. Inland Revenue is required to charge an hourly rate of $155 for considering these rulings as well as an application fee of $310. 2.11 Unlike other types of rulings, taxpayers cannot apply for public rulings. Instead, Inland Revenue issues public rulings on suitable topics, subject to available resources. Taxpayers can nominate issues that they consider should be the subject of a public ruling. 7 2.12 Public rulings, product rulings and status rulings on public and product rulings are published in the Gazette, in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin and on Inland Revenue’s website. Private rulings are not published, as they are specific to the taxpayer and the facts of the arrangement. Disclosure requirements 2.13 Applications for private or product binding rulings must comply with certain disclosure requirements. For private and product rulings, the application must: • identify the applicant; • disclose all relevant facts and documents relating to the arrangement for which the ruling is sought; • state the taxation laws in respect of which the ruling is sought; • state the propositions of law (if any) which are relevant to the issues raised in the application; and • provide a draft ruling. 4 2.14 For product rulings, the application must also explain: • why it is not practicable to seek a private ruling; and • why the characteristics of the taxpayers who may enter into the arrangement are not relevant to the content of the ruling. 5 2.15 Disclosure is required to ensure that Inland Revenue has all of the relevant information on which to make the ruling. It also provides a degree of protection to the applicant by ensuring that Inland Revenue is focused on the relevant issues as set out in the application. If the disclosure requirements are not complied with, the Commissioner can decline to rule. Consultation 2.16 Before private, product and status rulings are issued, Inland Revenue must consult with the applicant if the content of the proposed ruling differs from that requested. 6 This consultation gives the applicant an opportunity to comment on the interpretation adopted by Inland Revenue before the ruling is issued. 4 Sections 91ED and 91FD of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 5 Ibid section 91FD(1)(c). 6 Ibid sections 91EG, 91FG and 91GE. 8 Chapter 3 SCOPE OF BINDING RULINGS Current scope 3.1 The 1994 discussion document which outlined the design of the binding rulings regime made recommendations on the ambit of the regime in the form of a number of specific exclusions and a number of circumstances in which the Commissioner would have the discretion not to rule. The ambit of the current rules is based on those recommendations, although in most cases expressed largely in the form of specific exclusions which prohibit the Commissioner from issuing a ruling, rather than in the form of a statutory discretion. 3.2 The specific exclusions as they affect the process for private rulings are contained in section 91E(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, and apply if: • the application for the ruling would require the Commissioner to determine questions of fact; • the person to whom the ruling is to apply is not seriously contemplating the arrangement for which the ruling is sought; • the application is frivolous or vexatious; • the matter on which the ruling is sought concerns a duty or levy that is due and payable or is being/should be dealt with under the competent authority provisions of a double tax agreement; • a private ruling already exists in relation to the relevant arrangement and person that covers the timeframe in question; • an assessment has been made for the relevant arrangement, person and timeframe; • Inland Revenue is auditing or investigating how the taxation law applies to the relevant arrangement, person and timeframe; • the application relates to an arrangement that is the subject of a notice of proposed adjustment; • the Commissioner’s opinion is that insufficient information has been provided following a request for further information; • the Commissioner’s opinion is that it would be unreasonable to make a ruling in view of the resources available; • the application for the ruling would require the Commissioner to form an opinion on generally accepted accounting practice or commercially acceptable practice. 9 3.3 Similar exclusions apply to the process for obtaining a product ruling. Question of fact 3.4 One of the key exclusions, section 91E(4)(a), applies when the application for the ruling would require the Commissioner to determine questions of fact. This exclusion is the predominant focus of this chapter. The discussion document, Binding Rulings on Taxation, explained the rationale for the exclusion in the following terms: A rulings system is intended to provide certainty on the Commissioner’s view of the law. There are established common law principles as to what constitutes a “question of fact”, although the application of these principles can be difficult in practice. Determining whether an application gives rise to a question of fact will depend on the particular circumstances of each case. Nevertheless, the discretion is important because the Commissioner cannot be expected to give rulings on whether facts supplied by taxpayers are correct. 7 3.5 Determining what constitutes a “question of fact” as opposed to a question of law is notoriously difficult. This chapter suggests how this boundary could be clarified in the binding rulings context so that certainty over whether a ruling can be provided is improved for both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. The problem 3.6 An underlying principle of the binding rulings legislation is that the Commissioner should not have to determine whether facts provided by an applicant for a ruling are correct. This is because the Commissioner’s role is to rule on the application of the law to the facts in the arrangement outlined by the applicant. This legislative intent is supported by the fact that the rulings legislation applies to prospective transactions. 3.7 That said, on a more literal interpretation, section 91E(4)(a) could be argued to prohibit a ruling being made when doing so would expressly or implicitly require particular facts to be found to exist. In that case, the Commissioner may be unable to rule on fact-dependent issues such as the application of section BG 1 or other anti-avoidance provisions. This limitation could also apply to a consideration of the capital/revenue boundary or whether the taxpayer was carrying on a business. 3.8 Such an interpretation would be inconsistent with the understanding and application of the binding rulings provisions by taxpayers, tax practitioners and officials. It would also be inconsistent with the policy intent of binding rulings, which was clearly to allow determinations about tax avoidance to be made. 7 Paragraph 6.11. 10 3.9 To remove the scope for such interpretations clarification of the circumstances in which a ruling application would require the Commissioner to determine questions of fact would therefore seem to be warranted. 3.10 We note, incidentally, that, in a similar way to the intended policy in New Zealand, the Australian legislation allows private rulings to be given on the basis of assumptions for which the relevant information has not been provided to the Commissioner provided those assumptions are brought to the attention of the applicant. 8 Rulings can also be made on an ultimate conclusion of fact that relates to a tax law – for example, on whether an activity is a hobby or business. 9 Generally accepted accounting practice/commercially acceptable practice 3.11 The last exception in section 91E(4) – paragraph (j) – provides that a ruling may not be made if the application for the ruling would require the Commissioner to “form an opinion as to a generally accepted accounting practice or to form an opinion as to a commercially acceptable practice”. 3.12 The reason for the exclusion for generally accepted accounting practice is self-evident in that opinions on accounting practices are likely to fall outside the Commissioner’s specific sphere of expertise in administering the taxation laws. 3.13 The exclusion for commercially acceptable practice was provided for the same reason. However, its scope is unclear. We consider that its application was intended to be, and should be, limited to those provisions in the tax legislation such as the financial arrangements rules in which it is explicitly used. Without this limitation paragraph (j) could possibly be interpreted to mean that any matter concerning commercially acceptable practice, including the application of section BG 1, which we have noted turns on questions of fact, could not be ruled on. This would be inconsistent with the policy noted above that rulings on section BG 1 ought to be able to be made. Possible solutions 3.14 Possible legislative solutions for dealing with the uncertainties around questions of fact and commercially acceptable practice are: • to list specifically the questions of fact on which the Commissioner cannot rule; or • to give the Commissioner a discretion not to rule in relation to questions of fact (accompanied with a limitation to the scope of commercially acceptable practice). 8 Schedule 1, section 357-110 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953. 9 PS LA 2003/3, Precedential ATO view, at paragraph 26. 11 Legislated criteria for when not to rule 3.15 The first option would involve an amendment listing the specific questions of fact on which the Commissioner may not rule. These specific questions of fact would include: • A person’s intention or purpose – for example, in relation to the acquisition of land. (This would not include the purpose of an arrangement under anti-avoidance legislation.) • A determination of the value of anything – other than under the transfer pricing provisions, which are specifically excluded from the ambit of section 91E(4)(a). • What commercially acceptable practice is for the purpose of any provision of subpart EW (the financial arrangements rules) that refers to commercially acceptable practice. This exception would in effect clarify the application of section 91E(4)(j), which could consequentially be removed. 3.16 The intention or purpose of the taxpayer (as opposed to the intention or purpose of the arrangement) may be difficult to determine based on the facts provided by the applicant without incurring significant further administration costs and, for the applicant, compliance costs, including fees. Exclusion therefore seems warranted. The value of anything or what is commercially acceptable practice would be excluded because the Commissioner has limited expertise in these matters. 3.17 Specifically listing the matters on which the Commissioner may not rule will ensure that rulings can be issued for significant matters, such as whether an arrangement involves tax avoidance and the determination of the capital/revenue boundary. As is currently the case, the Commissioner, in making a binding ruling, would accept the facts as provided by the applicant. If the arrangement is entered into based on the binding ruling, the arrangement may be audited at a later stage. If there are any material differences between the facts in the ruling and the actual arrangement, the ruling would not apply. 3.18 This approach is also consistent with taxpayers self-assessing their tax liability, as broad legislative provisions in a tax system based on self- assessment may not provide taxpayers with adequate certainty. 3.19 On balance, this is the option officials prefer. We would welcome submissions on any other matters that should be included in the suggested list. 12 3.20 If the preferred option were adopted, a further amendment would be made to clarify that rulings will be based entirely on the facts advised to the Commissioner by the applicant and that, where any such facts are stated in the ruling, the Commissioner will not be treated as accepting those facts. This would further assist in addressing the seeming underlying difficulty with a ruling determining questions of fact. 3.21 A regulation-making power could also be introduced to allow for expansion of the matters to be excluded from being able to be ruled on. This flexibility would deal with any matters that may arise resulting from the changing business environment. Commissioner discretion 3.22 An alternative option would allow the Commissioner not to rule if the application for the ruling would, in the Commissioner’s opinion, require the determination of questions of fact. Paragraph (j) would simply be amended by limiting the formation of an opinion on commercially acceptable practice to the provisions in the tax legislation that used that term. 3.23 This approach assumes the Commissioner is best placed to determine what can and cannot be ruled on as the Commissioner is able to take into account all relevant factors. The approach is also consistent with the observation of the 1994 discussion document on binding rulings that “if the operation of the rulings regime indicated that taxpayers were requesting rulings for the purposes of tax avoidance, the regime would have to be amended to guard against such abuse, perhaps by introduction of an additional discretion to decline to rule”. 10 3.24 On the other hand, a discretion in relation to questions of fact could lead to uncertainty and may require guidelines on when the discretion would be likely to be exercised. A concern is that views on the application of the guidelines might differ and further “grey areas” would develop. 10 Paragraph 6.29. 13 Summary of suggested options Replace the current general prohibition on ruling on questions of fact (contained in section 91E(4)(a)) with a more limited list of factual matters on which the Commissioner cannot rule. They would include: • A person’s intention or purpose – for example, in relation to the acquisition of land. (This would not include the purpose of an arrangement under anti- avoidance legislation.) • A determination of the value of anything – other than under the transfer pricing provisions, which are specifically excluded from the ambit of section 91E(4)(a). • What commercially acceptable practice is for the purpose of any provision of subpart EW (the financial arrangements rules) that refers to commercially acceptable practice. This exception would clarify the application of section 91E(4)(j), which could consequentially be removed. An alternative option is to give the Commissioner a discretion not to rule in relation to questions of fact (accompanied by a limitation to the scope of commercially acceptable practice). 14 Chapter 4 CHARGING FOR BINDING RULINGS 4.1 Private, product and status binding rulings all incur fees that are based on recovering the cost of providing the ruling. The fees include an application fee of $310 which covers the costs of receiving and reviewing the ruling application and a fee of $155 per hour spent by Inland Revenue considering the application. This includes time spent consulting with the applicant. Any costs incurred by Inland Revenue in consulting with external professionals to obtain independent advice are also passed on to the applicant. 4.2 Upon receipt of a binding ruling application, Inland Revenue estimates the time it will take to produce the ruling, and therefore the cost, and advises applicants accordingly. If the estimate proves to be too low, Inland Revenue re-estimates the cost and advises applicants before continuing work on the ruling. 4.3 The rationale for charging fees is that the applicant receives the benefit of certainty about how Inland Revenue will apply the tax laws in relation to their situation. If no fee were charged, taxpayers in general would effectively fund the benefit received by the applicant. 4.4 Charging a fee also ensures that applications for straightforward, everyday transactions, are limited and tend instead to relate to more complex transactions. If Inland Revenue received large volumes of applications for simple transactions, resources would need to be diverted from other areas of Inland Revenue to process them. 4.5 Binding rulings may also provide a second opinion or an additional degree of comfort to advice provided by tax professionals. In that context, assuming the rulings system is operationally effective, charging fees is regarded as justifiable. Fee waiver 4.6 Currently, Inland Revenue may in exceptional circumstances, at the Commissioner’s discretion, waive in whole or in part any fee payable by an applicant. This provision, Regulation 6 of the Tax Administration (Binding Rulings) Regulations 1999, is similar to other provisions that allow Inland Revenue to waive fees – for example, for financial arrangement determinations and depreciation determinations. 15 The problem 4.7 There is a concern that the current waiver provision does not provide sufficient direction over the circumstances in which binding rulings fees should be waived. 4.8 Inland Revenue staff involved in considering rulings applications will have different skill and experience levels but there is a risk that waiving fees for different levels could be too frequent an occurrence to be treated as an “exceptional circumstance”. However, a lower level of expertise will frequently result in more time being spent on a ruling application and application of the fee waiver may be justified in these cases. 4.9 Another problem arises when a significant amount of time is spent researching an issue and the research is, or will be, relevant to a number of different rulings. In some cases it would be inequitable to charge all of the time to the first ruling that considers the issue. In other instances this may be perfectly reasonable. Possible solutions 4.10 We suggest that the waiver provision in the Tax Administration (Binding Rulings) Regulations 1999 be amended so that it takes into account what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances. 4.11 On the issue of differing skill and experience levels, we considered whether, as often happens in private firms, differential rates should be applied according to the relative skill and experience levels (as reflected in the job description) of the staff. On balance, we concluded that this would add more complexity to the system than is worthwhile as the rates would need to be benchmarked and regularly reviewed. However, what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances could have regard to the skill and experience levels of staff handling rulings applications. 4.12 If the binding rulings waiver provision is amended, consideration should be given to amending similar provisions in the financial arrangement determination and depreciation determination regulations. Closing ruling applications and consultation 4.13 Before private, product and status rulings are issued, Inland Revenue must consult with the applicant if the content of the proposed ruling differs from that requested. 16 4.14 This consultation gives the applicant an opportunity to comment on the interpretation adopted by Inland Revenue before the ruling is issued. It also allows further information to be obtained about the implications of the ruling. The problem 4.15 Despite its benefits, consultation is one of the factors that contributes to the delay in issuing binding rulings. Providing additional information, and/or possible changes to the arrangement itself to “make it fit” the requested ruling, can add significantly to the time taken. This is particularly so if Inland Revenue has indicated that a negative ruling may be given. In this event the applicant may often choose to amend the arrangement to obtain a favourable ruling. Possible solution 4.16 The Australian Tax Office (the ATO) treats any revision of an arrangement or the submission of additional information, even if at the request of the ATO, as a fresh application for a ruling. 11 This approach may increase the incentive for applicants to provide all of the relevant information to the tax authority in the first instance. 4.17 The approach is more difficult to justify in New Zealand where rulings are charged for. Delays in issuing rulings may be reduced if the legislation specified a requirement for just one consultation period or one conference, and for any further information to be provided or requested during or at that consultation period or conference. We are interested in submissions on the workability of this approach. 4.18 While the opportunity for the applicant to provide additional information would be limited if this suggestion were implemented, we note that in cases where the arrangement already exists at the time of application, there is little opportunity to change the nature of the arrangement. If the application is for a proposed arrangement, the arrangement needs to be seriously contemplated. To meet this condition, it could be argued that only limited opportunity for changes to the arrangement could be contemplated. GST and binding ruling fees 4.19 Under Regulation 7 of the Tax Administration (Binding Rulings) Regulations 1995 the fees charged for binding rulings are inclusive of any goods and services tax. 11 Schedule 1, section 359–65 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953. 17 The problem 4.20 The fees assume a GST rate of 12.5% and do not take into account the fact that binding rulings issued to non-residents outside New Zealand may be zero-rated under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Therefore, any binding ruling issued to a New Zealand resident is in effect cheaper than if that same ruling were supplied to a non-resident. This is because the New Zealand resident, if registered for GST, can generally claim an input tax credit for the GST cost of acquiring the binding ruling. The non-resident, on the other hand, is unlikely to meet the requirements for registration or input tax credit entitlement. Possible solution 4.21 We recommend amending the Tax Administration (Binding Rulings) Regulations 1995 to allow fees for binding rulings supplied to overseas non- residents to be reduced by 1/9th if the supply is zero-rated. This would bring the regulations in line with existing GST policy. Summary of suggested options Introduce a more flexible fee-waiver provision based on what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances. Allow only one consultation period or one conference for the provision of, or a request for, additional information. Provide that the fees for binding rulings supplied to non-residents outside New Zealand are reduced by 1/9th if the supply is zero-rated. 18 Chapter 5 MASS-MARKETED AND PUBLICLY PROMOTED SCHEME RULINGS 5.1 A product ruling sets out Inland Revenue’s interpretation of how the tax law applies to an arrangement that is likely to be entered into with a number of people on identical terms. The product ruling is intended to be available when a private ruling cannot be made because it is not practicable to identify all the taxpayers that may enter into the arrangement. The problem 5.2 One of the conditions when applying for a product ruling is that the applicant must intend to be a party to the proposed arrangement (section 91FC(1A)). This means that the promoter of an arrangement may not be able to apply for a product ruling. This position followed a legislative clarification in 1999 intended, among other things, to ensure that rulings applications were limited to “seriously contemplated” arrangements. 5.3 In contrast, in Australia, product binding rulings can only be applied for by the promoter of a scheme or by persons involved as principals carrying out the arrangement. Participants or investors in the scheme cannot apply for a product ruling. 12 5.4 There are advantages to investors, promoters and Inland Revenue in issuing binding rulings on schemes. Prospective investors could make their investment decision in full knowledge of the tax effects of the arrangement which would also assist investors voluntarily complying with their tax obligations. The promoter of the scheme could use the binding ruling to market the scheme as a means of demonstrating that the scheme is sound from a tax perspective. For Inland Revenue, the advantage is that it becomes aware of the arrangement at an early stage and administrative costs in auditing the scheme will be reduced or eliminated. 5.5 Encouraging (or at least not discouraging) promoters of schemes to apply for product rulings could result in these applications becoming standard practice. If this occurred, arrangements that were not supported by a product ruling would start to become the exception and be seen as more risky than those with Inland Revenue clearance. This could help in securing a tax-compliant environment. 12 PR 2007/71 The Product Rulings System, at paragraphs 55 and 56. 19 Possible solution 5.6 We consider that the requirement for the applicant to be a party to the scheme should contain an exception for promoters. This would apply either when the applicant who is not a party to the scheme is a promoter of the scheme or is another person with a similar interest to that of a promoter. This could be achieved either within the existing product ruling legislation or by creating a further special category of ruling. 5.7 Consistent with the objectives of providing certainty in investment planning and maintaining tax compliance, ruling applications by promoters and similar persons would be limited to prospective arrangements. As with all rulings on prospective arrangements, the arrangement would have to be seriously contemplated. 5.8 A concern that would have to be addressed in designing this type of ruling is the possible incentive for promoters of arrangements to omit relevant information or misrepresent the arrangement to obtain a favourable binding ruling. This incentive could be provided by the applicant not being a party to, and therefore not having a financial interest in, the arrangement. 5.9 One option for dealing with this concern would be to require the promoter of the scheme to make a declaration that the material provided in the application is correct. Another option could apply in cases where the arrangement, once begun, gives rise to an abusive tax position shortfall penalty for the investors. In that case, if the applicant for the ruling had omitted or provided false information, the promoter penalty could be automatically applied. Submissions on these alternatives are welcome. Clarification of the “seriously contemplated” requirement 5.10 The Commissioner may not make a product ruling if the person to whom the ruling applies is not “seriously contemplating” the arrangement at the time the ruling is applied for (section 91F(4)(b)). If, as suggested in this chapter, persons that are not party to the arrangement are able to apply for a product ruling, the ruling may be given before any prospective investors are aware of its existence. In that case the “seriously contemplated” requirement would not be met. 5.11 We consider that the requirement should remain as it serves to appropriately limit the number of rulings applications made to Inland Revenue. However, we consider that the legislation should be amended to remove the requirement that the person to whom the ruling is to apply is seriously contemplating the arrangement and replace it with a requirement that the applicant is seriously contemplating that the arrangement will be proceeded with. 20 Summary of suggested options Allow promoters of arrangements, or those with a similar interest to a promoter, to apply for a product ruling for prospective arrangements. Require promoters to declare the correctness of the information they provide or be automatically subject to the promoter penalty in certain cases. 21 Chapter 6 OTHER MATTERS Ability to rule when the matter is subject to a case before the courts 6.1 Under section 91E(3)(b), the Commissioner “may decline to make a private ruling if the matter on which the ruling is sought is subject to an objection, challenge or appeal, whether in relation to the applicant or to any other person”. 6.2 The 1994 discussion document explained the policy rationale for the discretion in the following terms: In the Government’s view, a discretion not to rule for questions before the courts should be available in New Zealand. The purpose of a binding rulings system is to provide a timely decision as to how the Commissioner will interpret the legislation, but in cases where a court decision on a question of law is pending it would be inappropriate for the Commissioner to provide a ruling on the issue. Inland Revenue will notify the applicant that the issue is before the court and what Inland Revenue’s position is. 13 The problem 6.3 The purpose of the discretion to decline to rule was not outlined in detail at the time of introduction but application of the discretion would seem to have these advantages: • It helps ensure that the application of the law by the Commissioner is consistent across taxpayers in similar circumstances. • It ensures that taxpayers cannot take undue advantage of a lack of clarity in the law that is in the process of being addressed by the courts. • It reduces administrative and compliance costs. 6.4 Section 91E(3)(b) is expressed in general terms and the scope of the provision, particularly the term “matter” is unclear. The provision does not allow for an unduly narrow interpretation such as requiring an identical transaction and the same or associated taxpayer. At the other extreme, it would be inappropriate to apply it to all instances where an issue arises that is commonly determined in a transaction – for example, the application of section BG 1 – as that would allow the Commissioner to turn down any ruling application on that issue. (We noted earlier that it was clearly intended that the Commissioner be able to rule on section BG 1.) 13 Paragraph 6.15. 22 6.5 Such broad discretions do not fit well in a tax system based on self- assessment as taxpayers may be uncertain about how the Commissioner will exercise the discretion and may feel unable to confidently enter into legitimate business arrangements. 6.6 Even though section 91E(3)(b) is expressed in discretionary terms, we consider that greater clarity needs to be provided to guide taxpayers on when the discretion might be exercised. Otherwise, a taxpayer could apply for a binding ruling on an issue, unaware that the same “matter” is being considered by the courts, and Inland Revenue could decline to rule. This could result in significant costs to the taxpayer in not obtaining the certainty needed and in making the unsuccessful ruling application. In cases when the decision to decline to rule is made part-way through the rulings process – for example, because a new matter is before the courts – similar costs could arise. Possible solution 6.7 Officials suggest that the ambit of section 91E(3)(b) be clarified by having regard to more explicit factors that would narrow the application of the discretion. These factors would be based on the need for consistency in relation to specific common issues, integrity of the tax system and reduced compliance and administrative costs. Our suggestion is to refer to: • an identical or substantially similar arrangement; and/or • an arrangement that concerns the same, or substantially similar, facts and issues. 6.8 This approach to the application of the discretion could preclude rulings being given for taxpayers involved in the same arrangement as that being considered by the courts (for example, as parties to a mass-marketed scheme) and taxpayers involved in a different arrangement with substantially similar characteristics to that being considered by the courts. 6.9 A key advantage of this approach is that it would remove any suggestion that the discretion can be applied when the similarity arises purely from a commonly considered tax issue such as the application of section BG 1. 6.10 An alternative option would be to base the exercise of the discretion on the objectives we have outlined – the need for consistency in relation to specific common issues, integrity of the tax system and compliance and administrative cost reduction. 6.11 Both of these options will raise issues of interpretation and we seek comments on this concern. 23 Declining to rule when the arrangement is the subject of a dispute 6.12 Under section 91E(4)(ga), the Commissioner may not make a private ruling if the application relates to an arrangement that is the subject of a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA). This criterion was added in 1999 to clarify the policy intent that there should be no overlap between the existing disputes resolution process and the binding rulings regime. This is necessary to ensure that certainty for the taxpayer about the Commissioner’s position is maintained. 6.13 If a NOPA relates to only one aspect of the arrangement, the Commissioner cannot rule on other aspects which may not be related to the issue being disputed. For example, consider an arrangement which has both income tax consequences and GST consequences. Even if the NOPA relates only to the GST aspects of the ruling, a taxpayer cannot obtain a ruling in relation to the income tax aspects of the arrangement. Possible solution 6.14 Officials suggest that the section be amended to allow the Commissioner to make a binding ruling if the arrangement is the subject of a NOPA but the application for the ruling relates to a different tax type from that in the NOPA. 6.15 For example, if the NOPA relates to GST aspects of the arrangement only, the Commissioner would be able to make a binding ruling in relation to the income tax consequences of the arrangement. However, if the NOPA relates to the tax treatment of an income stream under the arrangement, a binding ruling would not be able to be made if the ruling application concerns an expenditure stream under the arrangement as in this case the issues may overlap. 6.16 While we suggest that rulings should be able to be made if the matter involves a different tax type to that in the NOPA, there may be circumstances in which an issue concerning GST affects an income tax issue – for example, an issue involving a common definition such as that for a group of companies. A further qualification on the ability to rule would therefore be necessary to ensure that the matter in dispute, and that for which the ruling was sought, were sufficiently separate. A ruling which fails in part 6.17 A similar question arises over whether a binding ruling application that fails in part should continue to apply in relation to the other part. For example, if a ruling relates to both GST and income tax and the GST part is taxpayer- negative should the income tax aspects of the binding ruling continue to apply? 24 Possible solution 6.18 Consistent with the previous issue, if the binding ruling is made for two or more tax types, the part or parts of the ruling which do not fail, and that concern separate tax types, should be treated as binding on the Commissioner. This would again be subject to the qualification of the different parts of the ruling being sufficiently separate. Publication of notification of binding rulings in the Gazette 6.19 The binding rulings legislation requires Inland Revenue to notify the making and withdrawal of public and product rulings in the Gazette. Public and product binding rulings are also published in full in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin (TIB). The TIB is available on Inland Revenue’s website and a paper copy can be requested. The question is whether Inland Revenue should continue to be required to notify taxpayers in the Gazette. Possible solution 6.20 Given that these types of rulings are publicly available, and the only information published in the Gazette is notification that the ruling is being made or withdrawn, we consider that the requirement to publish in the Gazette should be removed. 6.21 However, to ensure that information on public and private rulings remains publicly available, we suggest the legislation be amended to require Inland Revenue to notify the making or withdrawal of such rulings in a suitable format. Self-assessment 6.22 Under section 91E(4)(f), the Commissioner may not make a private ruling if an assessment has been made relating to the person, the arrangement, and a period or a tax year to which the proposed ruling would apply, unless the application is received by the Commissioner before the date an assessment is made. 6.23 As noted earlier, taxpayers are required to self-assess their tax liability. A recent “Question we have been asked” (QWBA) raised the issue of whether section 91E(4)(f) applies in cases when the taxpayer self-assesses before a private ruling application has been received by Inland Revenue. 14 It concluded that the section does apply and a binding ruling may not be made. 14 QB 08/01 Tax Information Bulletin Volume 20, No. 5, June 2008. 25 6.24 The QWBA notes that: 2. The rationale behind section 91E(4)(f) is that if a transaction has been the subject of an assessment, then any dispute over the correct tax treatment of that transaction should be resolved under the tax disputes resolution procedures (Inland Revenue Department, Binding Rulings on Taxation: A Discussion Document on the Proposed Regime, June 1994). 6.25 As the rulings regime was introduced before self-assessment was legislated, the question has been raised whether the rulings regime ought to apply to allow the Commissioner to rule when the taxpayer had self-assessed. 6.26 The QWBA also notes that: 21. The rulings regime exists primarily for prospective transactions to enable taxpayers to obtain certainty, and thus comply with their tax obligations. When a taxpayer has already filed their return and made an assessment, the disputes resolution process is available to the taxpayer, should the Service Delivery Group disagree with the assessment. There was a clear legislative policy that the disputes resolution process would be available to ensure that disputes were resolved in these situations, and that the rulings regime would generally be available for situations that were contemplated or occurred before assessment. 6.27 Taxpayers who self-assess their tax liabilities have an obligation to determine the correct tax position in relation to an arrangement before taking it and, as the QWBA notes, the disputes process is available to the taxpayer should the taxpayer or the Commissioner seek to change that position. The conclusion reached in the QWBA is consistent with self-assessment and the clear separation between the disputes resolution process and the binding rulings regime. We consider that the policy in these areas remains sound and that no change to the legislation is warranted. Summary of suggested options Clarify the Commissioner’s discretion not to rule on matters before the courts by: • limiting its application to cases involving identical or substantially similar arrangements, facts or issues; or • basing the exercise of the discretion on factors such as the need for consistency in relation to specific common issues, integrity of the tax system and compliance and administrative cost reduction. Provide an exception to the prohibition on ruling when the arrangement involves two or more tax types and is the subject of a notice of proposed adjustment. 26 Clarify that if a ruling is made on two or more tax types, and the ruling fails for one tax type, it will still be binding on the Commissioner for the other type or types. Remove the requirement to notify the making and withdrawal of public and product rulings in the Gazette and require that Inland Revenue publish notification in a suitable format. 27 Chapter 7 PROVIDING RULINGS AND OTHER FORMS OF ADVICE 7.1 A binding ruling application typically requires that Inland Revenue give thorough consideration to the variety of tax issues pertinent to the arrangement. Particularly in the case of an application for a private binding ruling, the Commissioner must rule on all the issues raised in the application unless one of the specific statutory exceptions applies. 7.2 At times this need for comprehensiveness may be at odds with the commercial needs of taxpayers – that is, taxpayers may require a quicker response than Inland Revenue’s decision-making process allows. However, as the decision as outlined in the ruling is binding on Inland Revenue, all matters need to be fully considered to ensure the response is robust and the revenue base is not adversely affected. 7.3 As outlined in chapter one, Inland Revenue is working with the affected sectors to improve the timeliness of the rulings process. However, given the need for Inland Revenue to manage its resources and to protect the revenue base, it cannot provide binding advice in response to all requests. For more general queries, a response may be provided in other formats such as guides or booklets for those completing tax returns. 7.4 In whatever format the Commissioner provides advice, taxpayers should be able to rely on that advice. 7.5 Concerns have been expressed regarding the possible imposition of penalties and interest when taxpayers have relied on advice provided by Inland Revenue other than in the form of a binding ruling. Unacceptable tax position penalties and use-of-money interest 7.6 A shortfall penalty for taking an unacceptable tax position can be imposed when a taxpayer’s tax position fails to meet the standard of being “about as likely as not to be correct”. The penalty applies when the tax position involves a significant amount of tax. 7.7 Use-of-money interest imposed on a taxpayer is charged when tax is underpaid and compensates the Crown for not having the use of its money. 7.8 It is possible that an unacceptable tax position penalty and/or use-of-money interest may apply if the taxpayer has underpaid their tax, even if this is as a result of having relied on advice provided by Inland Revenue. 28 7.9 Under the legislation the Commissioner’s ability to remit use-of-money interest is very limited, applying only if the remission would be consistent with the Commissioner’s duty to collect the highest net revenue over time as practicable within the law (section 183D of the Tax Administration Act). The Commissioner’s practice, as set out in SPS 05/10 Remission of penalties and interest, is that interest will be remitted in limited circumstances such as when an Inland Revenue officer has given incorrect advice to the taxpayer, and that advice has directly resulted in the non-compliance. However, this is not the only situation when interest may be remitted. The Commissioner will consider each case on its own merits. 7.10 One of the aims of the tax system is to encourage voluntary compliance and, although it may seem to be stating the obvious, a critical means of achieving this is by taxpayers following the advice provided by Inland Revenue. Officials therefore recommend that the legislation be clarified to ensure that, if the taxpayer has relied on the advice of Inland Revenue, the unacceptable tax position penalty cannot apply. While the current provisions allow use-of- money interest to be remitted, we also consider that the legislation should specifically allow for the remission of use-of-money interest if the taxpayer has relied on the advice of Inland Revenue. The taxpayer would remain liable to pay the underlying tax in either case. 7.11 The advice relied on would need to be provided by Inland Revenue as the official position of the Commissioner or in specific advice to taxpayers. In the first instance it should be clear that the advice was applicable to the taxpayer in the circumstances, and in the second instance it should be clear that all relevant facts were provided by the taxpayer and the advice provided by an appropriately authorised person in Inland Revenue. The advice to be taken into account would generally need to be written although oral advice of a standard nature in relation to a common issue (which in limited cases may include advice provided by a call centre) could also be considered. 7.12 The Commissioner would retain the discretion to determine whether the taxpayer had relied on Inland Revenue’s advice. Summary of suggested option Clarify that if the taxpayer has relied on official advice from Inland Revenue the unacceptable tax position penalty and use-of-money interest cannot apply.

For most people, financial considerations play a large role in the decision. 1.2 Introducing some form of income splitting for tax purposes has been suggested as one way of enabling parents to have greater choice in their work and caring roles. It could help to alleviate the financial constraints on parents being able to stay at home, and give them more choice around their work and home life balance. 1.3 UnitedFuture has proposed the introduction of income splitting, which “recognises that the spouse or partner who has chosen to work part-time or has opted out of the paid workforce in order to raise children is making a vital contribution to our society.” Over 300,000 families (around 60 percent of families with a dependent child) could benefit from this additional financial assistance. 1.4 In the confidence and supply agreement between National and UnitedFuture, National agreed to support “appropriate income splitting legislation” to First Reading in Parliament. The present consultation is a direct result of that agreement. The consultative process 1.5 This issues paper is the second stage in a process of public consultation on the possible introduction of an income splitting system. It follows on from the April 2008 government discussion document, Income splitting for families with children. That discussion document looked at the merits of introducing income splitting as a way of providing additional support to families with children. It also asked whether there were better ways for the government to provide this support than by means of income splitting. A total of 205 submissions were received, with the majority from individuals who supported the introduction of some form of income splitting. 2 An income splitting tax credit 1.6 The approach to income splitting set out in this issues paper would involve an annual tax credit to eligible families, to be calculated by Inland Revenue. For the purposes of calculating the tax credit a couple’s combined taxable income would be split equally, and the progressive tax rates would then be applied to each partner’s share of the total. The total tax calculated on this notional basis would be compared with the couple’s actual combined tax liability and the difference would be paid out by Inland Revenue as an “income splitting tax credit”. Link with Working for Families tax credits 1.7 Couples wishing to receive the income splitting tax credit would need to register online through the system used to deliver Working for Families tax credits. Using this existing process would minimise costs for both recipients and Inland Revenue. Annual cost 1.8 We estimate that the income splitting tax credit described in this issues paper would cost in the order of $450 million a year. 1.9 Inland Revenue would incur additional administrative costs in implementing and administering the income splitting tax credit. These would include an initial capital cost in the order of $2 or $3 million and annual operating costs averaging in the order of $3 or $4 million in the first five years. Increased contacts with taxpayers would represent about half of the operating costs. 1.10 An alternative to the 18-year age limit for income splitting would be to limit the tax credit to couples with a dependent child up to the age of six. This would reduce the annual revenue cost to approximately $230 million and also reduce administration costs. What’s in the issues paper 1.11 The main focus of the issues paper is on how an income splitting tax credit might work, the eligibility requirements and the calculation of the proposed tax credit, rather than the arguments for and against introducing such a credit. 3 How the income splitting tax credit could work Who would be eligible A couple would be eligible for the income splitting tax credit if, for the relevant tax year, they are: • spouses, civil union partners, or de facto partners; • New Zealand residents; and • primarily responsible for the day-to-day care of a dependent child or children aged 18 years or under. Registration Couples registered for Working for Families assistance would be automatically registered. Other couples who are eligible would need to register online through the system Inland Revenue uses to deliver Working for Families tax credits. How it would be calculated Inland Revenue would calculate the income splitting tax credit using the income details from the couple’s individual tax returns, or from other sources (such as the employer monthly schedule) if no tax return is required. The couple’s combined taxable income would be split on a 50/50 basis. Inland Revenue would carry out the following calculation: Step 1: combine the total taxable incomes of both partners. Step 2: equally split the total income between the partners. Step 3: apply the personal tax rates to each income calculated under step 2. Step 4: calculate the difference, if any, between the tax payable before income splitting and that payable under step 3. Example Spouse A’s taxable income: $60,000; tax is $12,850 Spouse B’s taxable income: $10,000; tax is $1,250 Taxable income of the couple before income splitting: $70,000 Tax liability of the couple before income splitting: $14,100 Step 1: total taxable income for couple: $70,000 Step 2: spouse A: $35,000 and spouse B: $35,000 Step 3: spouse A and B’s tax on $35,000: $6,160 each or $12,320 total Step 4: $14,100 – $12,320 = $1,780 The income splitting tax credit of $1,780 would be paid to the primary caregiver of the child. 4 Additional features The income splitting tax credit would not generally affect, or be affected by, other entitlements or obligations administered by Inland Revenue, such as the payment of provisional tax, the independent earner tax credit, child support, or student loan repayments. When it would start The income splitting tax credit would begin in the tax year beginning 1 April 2012. Submissions 1.12 Submissions are welcome on the workability of the proposed approach to income splitting. In particular, we are interested in hearing about any views on the submission points raised at the end of chapters 3 and 4. How to make a submission 1.13 Submissions should be made by 5 February 2010 and addressed to: Income splitting tax credit C/- Deputy Commissioner Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 Wellington 6140 1.14 Or email: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Income splitting tax credit” in the subject line. 1.15 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for officials from Inland Revenue to contact those making submissions to discuss their submission, if required. 1.16 Submissions could be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which could result in their publication. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, would be determined in accordance with that Act. Accordingly, those making a submission who think that any part of it should be properly withheld under the Act should indicate this clearly. 5 Chapter 2 THE POLICY PROCESS TO DATE 2.1 This chapter summarises the content of the April 2008 government discussion document, Income splitting for families with children and the submissions received. Although this issues paper is focused on the details of how an income splitting system would work, it is useful to recap the wider considerations around income splitting because they could influence the final design of the income splitting tax credit. Criteria used to assess income splitting 2.2 The earlier discussion document considered the extent to which income splitting would meet the objective of providing choice to families with children. The document also assessed income splitting against the criteria of fairness, efficiency, simplicity and administrative costs. These criteria are taken into account by government as part of the development of tax policy. Giving families greater choice 2.3 Income splitting was proposed as a way of enabling parents to have greater choices in their work and caring roles. Couples often face a choice between both parents working full-time, often using paid childcare, or one parent staying at home at least part-time to care for a child or children. Income splitting could help to alleviate the financial constraints on a parent’s ability to stay at home and give parents more choice around their work and home life balance. On the other hand, the discussion document noted that income splitting might not be the best targeted measure to provide this choice, since the benefit of income splitting rises with primary earner income. 2.4 For families with lower incomes, for whom the financial constraints might be greater, income splitting would provide only small amounts of support. For example, a one-earner family receiving $40,000 would gain only $1,190 a year from income splitting, while a one-earner family on a single income of $100,000 would gain $8,450 a year. Fairness 2.5 The discussion document explored the question of whether introducing income splitting for families with children would lead, at a reasonable fiscal cost, to a fairer outcome for families than is currently the case. 2.6 The decision to tax on a family basis by allowing income splitting could increase perceived fairness in some areas at the expense of others. Whether taxing on a family basis is a good thing would depend on the relative weightings given to different goals. 6 2.7 With individual taxation, as at present, a one-earner family would pay more tax than a two-earner family when the two have the same total family income. This might be seen as unfair, particularly when considered in light of the Working for Families package. 2.8 Working for Families uses the family, rather than the individual, as its basis for determining the appropriate level of assistance for families. As such, it provides equal support to families in similar circumstances that have the same total family income (and the same number, and age, of children). However, while those families are treated equally for Working for Families purposes, some families would still end up worse off and others better off because income tax liabilities are calculated on an individual basis. 2.9 Income splitting for families with children would mean that a couple with a child would pay less tax than a couple without a child even though both had the same combined income. Income splitting could be said to be a way to recognise the contribution of stay-at-home parents, when the current individual system of taxation does not. 2.10 On the other hand, family income might not always accurately capture a family’s ability to pay tax, and so may not be the fairest means of determining tax liability. It might be considered unfair for different couples with different work arrangements and the same combined income to face different tax burdens. Different work arrangements might result from one partner’s ability to earn a high hourly wage. If one partner is not in paid employment he or she would have additional time available for valuable activities at home, such as childcare. 2.11 It might be perceived as unfair that the benefit from income splitting increases as primary earner income increases, providing more benefit to couples with higher incomes. This is shown in table 2 in chapter 4. Efficiency 2.12 The discussion document explored whether income splitting would bias people’s decisions to produce, consume, work, save and invest. It explained that the introduction of income splitting would lead to a decrease in effective marginal tax rates of some primary earners and an increase in the effective marginal tax rates of some secondary earners. 2.13 The lower effective marginal tax rates for primary earners would improve their incentives to work and to invest in their skills and move to better paid jobs. This is likely to boost labour productivity. In contrast, the increased effective marginal tax rates for secondary earners would reduce their work incentives, which could adversely affect their employment prospects and future productivity. 7 2.14 Evidence suggests that once people have been outside the workforce for more than a year their skills might begin to atrophy, resulting, in the long term, in a less productive workforce. 1 This could have an impact on economic growth. Furthermore, empirical evidence suggests that secondary earners, especially women, are more responsive than primary earners to changes in their after-tax incomes. 2 Simplicity and administrative costs 2.15 The discussion document also noted that income splitting could be complex to implement. Consequently, in designing the details of an income splitting system there should be careful attention to providing a system that is easy to understand and fits with the rest of the tax system. 2.16 By implementing income splitting through the existing Working for Families tax credits system, income splitting would likely be relatively simple for people to comply with, and would restrict costs to an extent. What readers were asked to comment on 2.17 The discussion document asked for readers’ views on the following detailed policy design questions, if they were in favour of income splitting as the best way to provide additional support for families with children: • whether family incomes should be split on a 50/50 basis, a 70/30 basis or in some other way; • how a “family” should be defined; • what restrictions should be placed on the children’s ages for a family to be eligible; and • whether income splitting should be optional or compulsory. What they said 2.18 The discussion document attracted 205 submissions from individuals and a variety of organisations, including the Families Commission, the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions and the Child Poverty Action Group. 1 See, for example, Jaumotte, F., (2003) “Female labour force participation: past trends and main determinants in OECD countries”, OECD Economics Department working papers No. 376; Fagan, C. and Walthery, P. “The role and effectiveness of time policies for reconciliation of care responsibilities”, paper presented to the OECD Conference on Life Risks, Life Course and Social Policy, Paris, 31 May – 1 June 2007. 2 See, for example, Blundell, R. and McCurdy, T. (1999) “Labour supply: A review of alternative approaches”, in O Ashenfelter and D Card (eds.), “Handbook of Labour Economics”, Volume 3, North Holland, Amsterdam. 8 Supporters of income splitting 2.19 Ninety percent of those who responded, mostly individuals, were in favour of some form of income splitting. Many of these people argued that income splitting would recognise the contributions of full-time parents to their families and communities, with some arguing that income splitting would strengthen the family unit. Other benefits cited included balancing the assistance to parents in the workforce, reducing incentives to emigrate, and reducing the impact of fiscal drag. Opponents of income splitting 2.20 Those who opposed the income splitting proposal included most of the institutions that made a submission. Their concerns included: • the inequities and distortions arising from different family structures – some eligible, some not – and no account being taken of family size; • the potential disruption to family life as primary earners could have an incentive to work longer hours; • the potential for abuse, with sole parents entering arrangements with higher earners for mutual gain; and • the fact that the fiscal cost is likely to be transferred to other taxpayers. 2.21 Of those who opposed the proposal, three noted that they would prefer that any additional assistance for families be targeted to assist those in need. Responses to specific questions 2.22 Respondents generally supported limiting the eligibility for income splitting to “families” consisting of married couples, civil union partners and de facto couples who have dependent children up to 18 years of age. Most wanted to align the definition of “family” with the definition used for the Working for Families tax credits. 2.23 Most considered that income splitting should be optional and that income should be split on a 50/50 basis. Development of the current proposal 2.24 Following the 2009 general election, the National government and UnitedFuture entered into a confidence and supply agreement. The agreement included commitments by National to support the introduction of legislation on income splitting through to its First Reading in Parliament. 2.25 Table 1 explains the reasoning behind some of the key features of the proposed income splitting tax credit. 9 Table 1: Key features of the tax credit Key feature Reasons for proposing this feature The income splitting tax credit would be based on the couple’s total income for the year, split 50/50 between the partners. Supported by 70 percent of submissions. Minimises complexity and avoids disadvantaging any couples, which could occur with any other income splitting ratio such as 30/70. An eligible couple must consist of either a married couple, civil union partners or de facto partners. Supported by 60 percent of submissions. Consistent with other legislation dealing with couples, including Working for Families. An eligible couple must have a child or children aged 18 years of age or under. Supported by 63 percent of submissions. Consistent with Working for Families and would provide support to all couples with dependent children. Chapter 1 notes the lower cost of an alternative age limit of six years. The decision to split income for the purposes of receiving the tax credit would be optional. Supported by 70 percent of submissions. Consistent with the objective of providing choice. No need for compulsion. The income splitting tax credit would be paid on an annual basis, rather than in periodic payments throughout the tax year. This would reduce the complexity of the system. A tax credit paid at regular intervals during the year based on estimated income would require an end-of-year square-up and recovery of any overpaid amounts. An eligible couple and their dependent child must be New Zealand residents for tax and immigration purposes for the whole of the relevant tax year. This requirement is similar to those for the Working for Families rules. It is also consistent with the objective of assisting New Zealand families and avoids complexities in relation to when and where income was earned. Couples would register for the tax credit through the system used to deliver Working for Families tax credits. This would minimise compliance costs for taxpayers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue. In particular, income splitting at source, through employers, would greatly increase compliance and administration costs. The rules for determining whether a child is dependent would be consistent with similar rules for Working for Families tax credits. This would make it easier for all involved. There would need to be a good reason to diverge from the established Working for Families rules. The tax credit would not generally affect or be affected by other obligations and entitlements administered by Inland Revenue. The objective is to split income for tax purposes only. This would also minimise complexity. 2.26 The government would need to make decisions on the final policy design before the introduction of legislation. The submissions received on this issues paper would help that decision-making. 10 Chapter 3 WHO WOULD BE ELIGIBLE 3.1 This chapter outlines the eligibility criteria for a couple to receive an income splitting tax credit. 3.2 In broad terms, a couple would be eligible if, for the relevant tax year, they are: • spouses, civil union partners, or de facto partners; • New Zealand residents; and • primarily responsible for the day-to-day care of a dependent child or a child aged 18 years or under. 3.3 Eligible couples would need to register online with Inland Revenue for an income splitting tax credit. The registration process would link in with the current system for registering for Working for Families tax credits. The “whole-year” requirement 3.4 To qualify for an income splitting tax credit, the couple, whose combined income would determine the amount of the income splitting tax credit, would need to have been spouses or civil union or de facto partners for the whole of the relevant tax year. This whole-year requirement would reduce the complexity of the system by removing any need for apportionment if the status of a couple’s relationship changed during the tax year. Residence 3.5 For the whole of the relevant tax year, the couple and the dependent child or children being cared for would need to be resident in New Zealand for both immigration and tax purposes. In the case of a dependent child born or adopted during a tax year this requirement would apply from the date of birth or adoption. This requirement is similar to those for receiving Working for Families tax credits. 11 Dependent child 3.6 A dependent child is a child whose care is primarily the responsibility of the couple and is: • 18 years of age or younger; and • financially dependent on the couple. 3.7 Children aged 18 would need to be attending secondary school or tertiary education and not be financially independent. Children that the couple support financially and who work more than 30 hours a week, or receive a student allowance, a benefit or other government assistance would not be considered “dependent” for purposes of the tax credit. Change in status of dependent child 3.8 The income splitting tax credit would be reduced in years in which the status of the youngest dependent child changed. This means that the couple would be eligible for an income splitting tax credit up until the end of the calendar year (31 December) in which the child turns 18 or until the child becomes financially independent, whichever is the earlier. Likewise, a couple would become eligible for a tax credit on the day their first dependent child is born or adopted. 3.9 Treating children as independent from the end of the calendar year they turn 18 is in line with similar rules for receiving Working for Families tax credits. Example 1 – a child who turns 18 during the calendar year Joanna and Paul have a daughter, Sophie, who is 17 when she starts university in February 2013 and is financially dependent on her parents. They will be eligible for an income splitting tax credit (provided they meet the other eligibility criteria) for part of the 2013–14 tax year (which begins on 1 April 2013). Sophie turns 18 in May 2013, so their eligibility will cease at 31 December 2013. Example 2 – a child who becomes financially independent during the year Simon and Clare have one child, Robert, aged 16, who begins a full-time job on 5 July 2012 and moves away from home. Simon and Clare will be eligible for an income splitting tax credit for the 2012–13 tax year from 1 April until 5 July, the day Robert started working. 12 Shared care arrangements 3.10 When a shared care arrangement is in place between parents who have separated, both parents (if in new relationships) could be entitled to receive an income splitting tax credit. This entitlement would arise if the shared care arrangement was intended to be in place for four months or more and the child was in both parents’ care for at least one-third of the tax year. Over a year, this is at least 122 days a year or five days every fortnight. 3.11 The amount of the income splitting tax credit in the case of shared care would be reduced in proportion to the amount of time each parent cares for the child. 3.12 This feature of the proposed tax credit links in with the Working for Families rules around shared care arrangements. It relies on the family providing Inland Revenue with the correct information on their shared care arrangement. Example 3 – when both partners are entitled to an income splitting tax credit in a shared-care arrangement Andy and Catherine have six-year-old twins and then separate. They will not be entitled to an income splitting tax credit for the tax year in which they separated. Each then enters into a relationship with another person. For the whole of the following tax year, Andy and Catherine care for the children in alternate weeks. As they each care for their children for at least one-third of the time, they will each be entitled to an income splitting tax credit based on the proportion of the time that they look after the twins (in this case, 50 percent of the time). The calculation of the tax credit when there is a shared-care arrangement is set out in example 5 in chapter 4. Example 4 – when one partner is entitled to an income splitting tax credit in a shared- care arrangement Julie and Scott, who have a 10-year-old child, have separated, and each has a new partner. Scott picks up the child from Julie’s place at 9am each Saturday morning and drops him back at 7pm on the Sunday evening. As Scott is not caring for the child for at least one-third of the time, he will not be entitled to an income splitting tax credit. Registration 3.13 Couples would need to be registered for an income splitting tax credit so that Inland Revenue knows who they are and whether they are eligible for the tax credit. Couples would need to provide the following information to Inland Revenue: 13 • details of both partners or spouses, including IRD numbers and residence details; • details of a child in the primary care of the couple, aged 18 years or under during the tax year, and any shared care arrangements; and • confirmation that the couple’s relationship existed for the entire tax year. 3.14 As the income splitting tax credit would build on the rules and systems developed for the Working for Families tax credits, the couple would need to be registered online through the Working for Families system. However, paper forms would be available if a family did not have access to a computer or reliable internet. 3.15 A large number of families are currently registered either through Inland Revenue or the Ministry of Social Development for Working for Families. These families would be automatically registered for an income splitting tax credit (but could opt out if they wished). Inland Revenue generally has sufficient information about these couples and their children to assess their eligibility. 3.16 Other couples who are eligible for an income splitting tax credit, although not entitled to Working for Families assistance, would need to register online using the system Inland Revenue uses to deliver Working for Families tax credits. 3.17 Registration would be permitted up to 18 months after the end of the relevant tax year. Registration would remain in place for the following year, provided that Inland Revenue’s information indicates that the couple remains eligible. Couples would be required to notify Inland Revenue of any change that could affect their eligibility, such as the end of their relationship. Submission points 3.18 We welcome submissions on: • requiring registration for income splitting online through the system used to provide Working for Families tax credits; • whether the rules that would be used to determine eligibility for income splitting are appropriate; • whether couples should be required to confirm their eligibility for an income splitting tax credit through an annual declaration; • whether a couple should be ineligible for the tax credit if they or their child do not meet the residence requirement for the full tax year, or if the couple's marriage, or de facto or civil union relationship does not exist for the full tax year; 14 • whether a couple with shared care of a child should be eligible for income splitting if they have care of a child for at least one-third of the tax year; • whether a couple’s entitlement to an income splitting tax credit should, as proposed, end at 31 December in the calendar year the child turns 18 or when the child becomes financially independent (whichever occurs earlier); and • alternative rules for determining a couple’s eligibility for an income splitting tax credit. 15 Chapter 4 CALCULATION AND PAYMENT OF THE INCOME SPLITTING TAX CREDIT 4.1 This chapter covers how an income splitting tax credit would be calculated and paid. 4.2 The income splitting tax credit would be calculated by Inland Revenue. A couple’s eligibility to receive the tax credit would not affect, or be affected by, other entitlements or obligations administered by Inland Revenue, such as child support and student loans. The calculation would be based on the couple’s total income for the year, split 50/50 between the partners. The information required 4.3 The income splitting tax credit would be calculated for eligible couples using information provided by the couple in registering for Working for Families and from their personal tax information. 4.4 Inland Revenue would need the correct income details of each partner before calculating the income splitting tax credit. This would result in some additional administrative and compliance costs because some couples who would be eligible do not receive a personal tax statement or file a tax return. 4.5 If Inland Revenue is aware that a tax return is required from either partner the calculation would not occur until the return has been filed. Otherwise Inland Revenue would calculate the tax credit from around 15 July after the end of the tax year. 4.6 The need for Inland Revenue to have the necessary information before calculating the tax credit means that couples would receive their tax credit as a single payment on an annual basis. This would reduce the complexity of the system. A tax credit paid at regular intervals during the year based on estimated income would require an end-of-year square-up and recovery of any overpaid amounts. 16 How the calculation would be done 4.7 The calculation would consist of the following steps: Step 1 The taxable incomes of both partners (not the adjusted net income of the family used for Working for Families tax credits) would be combined. Step 2 The combined taxable income for the couple, as calculated at step 1, would then be divided equally between the partners. Step 3 Personal tax rates would be applied to each income calculated under step 2 to determine the couple’s notional income tax liability for the year. Step 4 The standard income splitting tax credit would be equal to the difference between the couple’s combined tax payable before income splitting, and the tax they would pay if it was calculated on an income splitting basis. Step 5 Tax year of birth or adoption In the year that an eligible couple’s first dependent child or children are born or adopted, the income splitting tax credit would be calculated according to the following formula: (number of days from date of birth or adoption to 31 March) ÷ 365 multiplied by the amount calculated at step 4 Reaching 18 years of age If an eligible couple’s youngest dependent child turns 18 before 31 December in the relevant tax year, the income splitting tax credit would be calculated according to the following formula: 275 (number of days from 1 April – 31 December inclusive) ÷ 365 = 0.75 multiplied by the amount calculated at step 4 17 Becoming financially independent If an eligible couple’s youngest child has become financially independent during the tax year, the income splitting tax credit would be calculated according to the following formula: (number of days from 1 April until the date the child becomes financially independent ÷ 365) multiplied by the amount calculated at step 4 Shared-care situations In a shared-care situation, the amount of the income splitting tax credit would be reduced based on the proportion of time that a couple had a dependent child in their care during the tax year. Example 5: Calculating the income splitting tax credit in a shared-care arrangement To return to Andy and Catherine in the earlier example 3 (in chapter 3), the couple separate in December 2012 and each enters into a new relationship in March 2013. Both are entitled to an income splitting tax credit for the 2013-14 tax year as they look after their twins week-on, week-off. Andy is in full-time employment and earns $100,000, on which $27,550 is paid in tax. His new partner is not employed. Catherine’s new partner earns $60,000, on which $12,850 is paid in tax, but she is not employed. Splitting Andy’s and his new partner’s combined taxable income of $100,000 in half gives $50,000. Tax on taxable income of $50,000 is $9,550. If each were to pay this amount, their combined total would be $19,100 in tax paid. The difference between both partners’ tax on combined taxable income and the tax they would pay under income splitting is: $27,550 – $19,100 = $8,450. As Andy cares for the children only half the time, he and his new partner are entitled to an income splitting tax credit of only half of this amount, which is $4,225. As for Catherine and her new partner, splitting their combined taxable income of $60,000 in half gives $30,000. Tax on taxable income of $30,000 is $5,110. If this was paid by each, they would pay a total of $10,220 in tax. The difference between their tax on combined taxable income and the tax they would pay under income splitting is: $12,850 – $10,220 = $2,630. As Catherine cares for the twins only half the time, she and her new partner are entitled to an income splitting tax credit of only half this amount, which is $1,315. 18 Amount of the income splitting tax credit 4.8 The annual payment to couples with various combinations of primary and secondary earner incomes is set out in table 2. For example, if the primary earner’s income is $40,000 and the secondary earner’s is $10,000, the amount of the income splitting tax credit would be $340. Table 2: Income splitting tax credit per couple (per tax year) 3 Secondary earner income ($000) $0 $10 $20 $30 $40 $50 $60 $70 $0 0 $10 0 0 $20 510 340 0 $30 1,190 340 0 0 $40 1,190 340 0 0 0 $50 1,430 580 240 240 240 0 $60 2,630 1,780 1,440 1,440 960 0 0 $70 3,830 2,980 2,640 2,160 960 0 0 0 $80 5,530 4,680 3,860 2,660 1,460 500 500 0 $90 7,230 5,900 4,360 3,160 1,960 1,000 500 0 $100 8,450 6,400 4,860 3,660 2,460 1,000 500 0 $110 8,950 6,900 5,360 4,160 2,460 1,000 500 0 $120 9,450 7,400 5,860 4,160 2,460 1,000 500 0 Primary earner income ($000) $130 9,950 7,900 5,860 4,160 2,460 1,000 500 0 $140 10,450 7,900 5,860 4,160 2,460 1,000 500 0 3 The income splitting tax credit amounts calculated in this table are based on the tax rates from 1 April 2009. 19 Payment of the entitlement 4.9 The income splitting tax credit would ordinarily be paid in full into a bank account of the primary caregiver unless the couple chose for each partner to receive half of the tax credit each. 4.10 In some cases Inland Revenue might withhold part or all of the tax credit. These could include when: • the couple has been overpaid social assistance under the Working for Families system; • one of the partners has an overdue tax debt or student loan repayment; and • one of the partners has a history of non-compliance with tax laws and has not filed a tax return or confirmed their taxable income with Inland Revenue. Impact of tax credit on other payments and tax credits 4.11 The income splitting tax credit would not generally affect, or be affected by, other entitlements or obligations administered by Inland Revenue, such as the independent earner tax credit, child support, or student loan repayments. In particular, provisional tax would continue to be assessed and payable on an individual basis. The effect on recipients of the minimum family tax credit would, however, need to be considered in the detailed design of the credit. Submission points 4.12 We welcome submissions on: • the process for calculating the income splitting tax credit; • using income splitting tax credits to offset Working for Families overpayments or other liabilities, such as tax liabilities; • continuing to calculate any provisional tax of each partner on an individual basis, without reference to the income splitting tax credit; • the value to couples of the proposed annual income splitting tax credit, compared with a tax credit paid at regular intervals during the year based on estimated income, which would require an end-of-year square-up; and • alternative ways of providing for income splitting for couples with dependent children.

Introduction 1.1 The Government announced in April that it intends to clarify the law to ensure that bonus issues of shares distributed under profit distribution plans (PDPs) are taxed in the same way as shares issued under other dividend reinvestment plans (DRPs). Because PDPs make use of a different form of transaction that is not explicitly covered by the tax rules, shareholders investing under PDPs may, in certain cases, have a tax advantage over those investing under DRPs. 1.2 As pointed out in the Government’s announcement, there is no clear reason why one form of dividend reinvestment plan should be tax-advantaged over the other. 1.3 The intention is to confirm that distributions of bonus shares to shareholders under both plans would be taxable as dividends. 1.4 This issues paper has been prepared by officials from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue and from the Treasury, as part of the consultation process. We want to ensure that the proposed law changes work effectively and fairly from a compliance and company law perspective and that the principles of the imputation system are adhered to. We are particularly interested in hearing of any practical difficulties that the proposed change might create for affected companies or their shareholders. Submissions will be taken into account when we make formal recommendations to the Government on the final form of the change. How to make a submission 1.5 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for officials from Inland Revenue and the Treasury to contact you about your submission to discuss the points it raises. Submissions should be made by 7 August 2009 and be addressed to: The Taxation of Profit Distribution Plans C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Or e-mail policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “PDPs” in the subject line. 2 1.6 Submissions may be the source of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. If you think any part of your submission should properly be withheld under the Act, you should indicate this clearly. 3 2. The different tax treatments under DRPs and PDPs How dividend reinvestment plans work 2.1 Under a dividend reinvestment plan (DRP), the company provides shareholders with the option of reinvesting their cash dividends in shares of the company. This can be advantageous for the company, allowing it to maintain a dividend payment policy, while providing an opportunity to increase cash retentions. DRPs are also convenient for shareholders, offering a convenient method for them to reinvest their cash dividends in a company, at a lower cost and effort than purchasing shares on the market. There appear to be two types of DRPs. Standard DRPs 2.2 Under a standard DRP, when a dividend is declared, shareholders are offered the option of receiving a cash dividend or receiving a bonus issue of shares. The option is generally exercisable before the dividend is paid. In the standard case, a cash dividend is paid unless the shareholder opts otherwise. Receipt of cash is the default option. 2.3 Distributions of cash or shares under a DRP are treated as a taxable dividend in the hands of the shareholder. If a shareholder chooses to receive a bonus issue of shares instead of a cash dividend the issue is treated as a “bonus issue in lieu”, which is a dividend for tax purposes. Imputation credits may be attached to distributions under a DRP. PDPs 2.4 A PDP reverses the priority of these options. Under a PDP, the company formally issues shares to all dividend recipients. However, shareholders are able to elect, before the dividend is paid, to have their shares immediately repurchased by the company, for an amount equal to the cash value of the dividend. If the shareholder does not make an election, the default option is to receive shares. 2.5 PDPs have proven successful in New Zealand for obtaining reinvestment rates between 60 to 90 percent of dividends declared. This rate is very high compared to that achieved under DRPs. This result is particularly attractive to companies in the current economic and financial environment as it increases cash retention and reduces the need for companies to raise external financing to fund operations and investment programmes. 4 2.6 The tax treatment of distributions under a PDP was the subject of a specific Inland Revenue product ruling in 2005. 1 The ruling held that a distribution of shares under a PDP is treated as a non-taxable bonus issue and consequently does not constitute a dividend in the hands of the shareholder. This ruling was made subject to certain conditions – in particular, that the company making the bonus issue has sufficient credits in its imputation credit account to have fully imputed a cash dividend equal to the bonus issue not redeemed. Lack of certainty and consistency 2.7 Taxpayers have expressed concern about the uncertainty in relation to the tax treatment of PDPs under current tax law. The uncertainty arises because PDPs do not appear to be explicitly covered by the legislation. 2.8 There appears to be a lack of consistency between the two types of share issues. Under standard DRPs, shareholders choose between receiving cash dividends or shares. Both are taxed as dividends in the shareholders’ hands, and imputation credits can be attached. 2.9 PDPs, on the other hand, make use of a different form of transaction, to provide shareholders with the option of receiving shares or cash. In this case, when the shareholder chooses to retain shares the retention of the shares may not be taxable as a dividend. For certain taxpayers, this may provide a tax advantage relative to those investing under standard DRPs. Shareholders on higher tax rates would face a lower tax impost than that applied to other dividend reinvestment plans. Adherence to the rules underpinning the imputation system 2.10 The imputation system is based upon a number of rules applying to the taxation of income that is earned by a company and then distributed to shareholders. The rules are: • As far as possible, taxing income derived through companies at the tax rates of the shareholders who own the company at the time the income is derived. • Ensuring that New Zealand source-basis taxation is retained – that is, taxing non-residents on the income that is derived through their investments in New Zealand. • Providing no credit for income that has not been subject to company tax (unimputed income), so that the full amount of the underlying income is subject to shareholder level tax. 1 A Product Ruling was issued to SkyCity Consolidated Group in December 2005. See Tax Information Bulletin (Volume 18, Number 2). 5 • Ensuring imputation credits attached to dividends reflect the proportionate share of income earned by the company on behalf of the shareholder. A series of rules are provided to ensure that imputation credits cannot be “streamed” to taxpayers who can make the greatest use of them. 2.11 The appropriate taxation of DRPs, including PDPs, should reflect these principles. 6 3. The proposed solution 3.1 Concerns about uncertainty and inconsistency in the taxation of PDPs should be resolved by ensuring that the legislation clearly treats distributions to shareholders under PDPs in the same way as distributions to shareholders under a standard DRP. It should also ensure that the tax treatment of PDP distributions is consistent with imputation principles. Consequently, the proposed solution would treat a distribution of shares under a PDP as a taxable dividend. How the law could be amended 3.2 Current law includes the concept of a “bonus issue in lieu”, a taxable dividend. In essence, a bonus issue in lieu arises when a shareholder is explicitly given a choice between receiving a “bonus issue” or a cash dividend. 3.3 The reason for deeming a bonus issue in lieu to be a taxable dividend is because of concerns about potential opportunities for imputation credit streaming. Specifically, if a bonus issue in lieu was not taxable there is concern that shareholders who are able to use imputation credits would choose to receive a cash dividend, with imputation credits attached, while those shareholders who cannot use the imputation credits would choose a non-taxable bonus issue. 3.4 The proposed legislative amendment would include the issue of bonus shares within the definition of “bonus issue in lieu” when shareholders can opt for the company to repurchase those shares. 3.5 One concern about this amendment is that treating the issue of shares under a PDP as a bonus issue in lieu and, consequently, as a taxable dividend could lead to double taxation for a shareholder who chooses to have those shares repurchased immediately by the company. That could happen if the repurchase of the shares by the company did not satisfy the “bright-line tests” set out in income tax law. 2 If that happened, the repurchase proceeds would also be treated as a taxable dividend. 3.6 In such cases double taxation could be eliminated by excluding the repurchase from the dividend definition. We are also considering how the rules would work when a company held the bonus shares as treasury stock. 3 2 If a distribution on the repurchase of a share is to be sourced from subscribed capital and not be deemed a dividend, the distribution must exceed certain thresholds or “brightlines” contained in section CD 22 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Different thresholds apply depending on whether the distribution occurs in a pro rata cancellation or as a result of a repurchase from selected shareholders. 3 Treasury stock is a purchase by a company of its own shares where the company determines not to cancel the shares. A company may not apply this treatment to more than 5% of its shares. 7 3.7 We are particularly interested in hearing about any difficulties the proposed solution might give rise to – whether in relation to company law, administration or compliance. Legislative detail 3.8 The current definition of “bonus issue in lieu” in section YA 1 is as follows: “Bonus issue in lieu” means a bonus issue made, on or after 1 October 1988, under an arrangement conferring on shareholders of a company an election whether to receive – (a) a bonus issue; or (b) money; or (c) money’s worth, other than money’s worth that is a bonus issue. 3.9 The definition of “bonus issue in lieu” in section YA 1 could be amended along the following lines: “Bonus issue in lieu” means a bonus issue made, on or after EFFECTIVE DATE, under an arrangement conferring on shareholders of a company an election whether to receive – (a) money; or (b) money’s worth, other than money’s worth that is a bonus issue; in lieu of or in exchange for – (c) the subsequent repurchase of the bonus issue; or (d) the right to receive the bonus issue. Date of application 3.10 The proposed legislative amendment would have prospective application. Given there is no necessity for this amendment to operate from the beginning of an income year, officials suggest that the amendment apply to distributions from a fixed date on or after the date of enactment. Questions for submissions 3.11 Does the proposed legislative solution ensure consistency with the rules that underpin New Zealand’s imputation system? 3.12 Would it create any difficulties in relation to company law or compliance? If so, please specify what they are and how they could be dealt with, in your view. 8 3.13 In practice, is double taxation likely to occur as a result of the proposed amendment? If so, please specify how this concern could be dealt with, in your view.
International treaty examination of the Convention between New Zealand and Australia for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income and Fringe Benefits and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion Report of the Finance and Expenditure Committee Contents Recommendation 2 Appendix A 3 Appendix B 4 CONVENTION BETWEEN NZ AND AUSTRALIA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 2 International treaty examination of the Convention between New Zealand and Australia for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income and Fringe Benefits and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion Recommendation The Finance and Expenditure Committee recommends that the House take note of its report. The Finance and Expenditure Committee has examined the Convention between New Zealand and Australia for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income and Fringe Benefits and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion. The National Interest Analysis for the treaty is appended to this report. This convention will replace the earlier agreement on double taxation with Australia, which is now 14 years old. It will implement new withholding rates that reflect those recently agreed with the United States, and ensure that New Zealand’s agreement with Australia is up-to-date in terms of treaty practice by including provisions for arbitration and non- discrimination. It will also correct specific trans-Tasman problems, such as the treatment of pensions (by ensuring that pension benefits are exempt in the country of residence to the extent that they would be exempt in the country of source) and the way income from employment is taxed where the employee is on a short-term secondment to an organisation in the other country (income from secondments that do not exceed 90 days will not be taxed in the country to which the person is seconded). CONVENTION BETWEEN NZ AND AUSTRALIA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 3 Appendix A Committee procedure The International treaty examination of the Convention between New Zealand and Australia for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income and Fringe Benefits and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion was referred to us by the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee on 12 October 2009. We met on 18 and 25 November and 9 December 2009 to consider the convention, and heard evidence from the Inland Revenue Department. Committee members Craig Foss (Chairperson) Amy Adams David Bennett John Boscawen Brendon Burns Charles Chauvel (to 18 November 2009) Hon David Cunliffe Aaron Gilmore Raymond Huo (from 18 November 2009) Rahui Katene Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga Stuart Nash Dr Russel Norman CONVENTION BETWEEN NZ AND AUSTRALIA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 4 Appendix B Convention between Australia and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income and Fringe Benefits National Interest Analysis Executive summary The Convention between Australia and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income and Fringe Benefits (“the new DTA”) has been negotiated to replace an existing agreement with Australia (“the existing DTA”) that dates back to 1995. The new DTA updates the existing DTA to reflect changes in each country’s treaty policy and provides solutions to particular trans-Tasman taxation issues that have been identified. The new DTA will provide greater certainty in the taxation of cross-border investment income, reduce compliance costs and reduce withholding tax rates on dividends and royalties (the withholding tax rates are the same as those used in the recent Protocol amending the Convention between New Zealand and the United States of America for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (“the Protocol to amend the New Zealand/United States DTA”)). Given the significance of the economic relationship between New Zealand and Australia, and the importance of trans-Tasman investment, it is essential that arrangements governing double taxation between New Zealand and Australia are kept up to date. Accordingly, the new DTA commits both countries to consult each other at least once every five years with a view to determining if further revisions would be appropriate. Date and nature of proposed binding treaty action It is proposed that the new DTA be signed as soon as practicable after Cabinet authorisation is issued. Subsequent to signature and satisfactory completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, it is proposed that the new DTA be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council, and brought into force, in accordance with Article 30 of the new DTA, through an exchange of diplomatic notes that confirm completion of all necessary domestic procedures for entry into force in each country. In the case of New Zealand, the provisions of the DTA that relate to withholding taxes will have effect from the first day of the second month following entry into force. Otherwise, the DTA will apply to income years beginning on or after 1 April following entry into force. (In the case of Australia, the date of effect for withholding taxes is the same as for New Zealand. However, the DTA provisions relating to fringe benefits have effect from 1 April following entry into force, and otherwise the DTA will have effect from 1 July following entry into force.) CONVENTION BETWEEN NZ AND AUSTRALIA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 5 As a provision of the new DTA comes into effect in accordance with Article 30(1), the equivalent provision of the existing DTA will cease to have effect. The existing DTA will terminate once all of its provisions cease to have effect. Reasons for New Zealand becoming party to the treaty New Zealand’s DTAs are bilateral international treaties that are principally designed to encourage growth in economic ties between countries. They do this by reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment. More specifically, they provide greater certainty of tax treatment, eliminate double taxation, reduce withholding taxes on cross- border investment returns and exempt certain short-term activities from income tax in the host state. DTAs also enable the tax administrations of each country to assist each other in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and evasion. DTAs do this primarily by establishing a mechanism for exchanging information between the two tax authorities. New Zealand’s existing DTA with Australia (concluded in 1995) is, in comparison with many of our other DTAs, relatively new. It is, however, New Zealand’s most important tax treaty. Around half of all direct investment from New Zealand goes into Australia, as does about a quarter of total outbound investment. Similarly, about half of all direct investment into New Zealand, and almost a third of total inbound investment, comes from Australia. The new DTA is intended to ensure that the arrangements governing double taxation between New Zealand and Australia are up-to-date and that they will provide the maximum possible levels of certainty and protection for tax residents of the two countries who choose to enter into cross-border transactions or who otherwise derive income from the other country. The new DTA also provides solutions to particular trans-Tasman taxation issues that have been identified. Finally, it includes lower withholding tax rates, mirroring those already agreed with the United States (in the Protocol to amend the New Zealand/United States DTA, signed on 1 December 2008). Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty entering into force There are several important ways in which the new DTA is different from the existing DTA:  it includes some non-standard DTA provisions designed to provide solutions to particular trans-Tasman problems;  it reduces withholding tax rates, mirroring those rates that New Zealand has already agreed with the United States;  it limits source taxation and reduces compliance costs on certain short-term activities;  it improves co-operation between tax authorities; and  it deals with numerous technical issues to ensure the arrangements governing double taxation between New Zealand and Australia are up-to-date and provide certainty for taxpayers. CONVENTION BETWEEN NZ AND AUSTRALIA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 6 We consider that the overall package represents a definite improvement on the existing DTA. Further details on the advantages / disadvantages of specific changes are outlined below. The new DTA is expected to reduce New Zealand tax revenues by around $10m per annum. This is largely attributable to the lower withholding tax rate on royalties. The existing DTA currently provides adequate double taxation arrangements for New Zealand and one option could be to leave the existing DTA in place. However, there are a number of troublesome issues, such as double taxation of pensions (see below for more details), that exist under the existing DTA and are addressed in the new DTA. Furthermore, given the level of economic integration with Australia it is very desirable to ensure that double taxation arrangements between our two countries remain up-to-date so that they provide the maximum level of protection and certainty for investors. Otherwise New Zealanders who invest or carry out activities in Australia could face higher compliance costs or harsher tax treatment than comparable investors from other countries. Solutions to trans-Tasman issues Due to the close relationship with Australia, the new DTA text includes some non- standard DTA provisions designed to provide solutions to particular trans-Tasman problems – specifically the allocation of taxing rights for pension payments, income from secondments and income derived by sportspersons. In all of these areas New Zealand’s high degree of labour mobility and economic integration with Australia can create compliance costs that are not commensurate with the risks to the tax base. The new DTA takes a more flexible approach on these issues in order to reduce these compliance costs. Pensions (Article 18) The new DTA includes a trans-Tasman tailored solution to the issue of double taxation of pension benefits. Normally, New Zealand has a preference for residence taxation of pensions in DTA negotiations. If a resident of a DTA partner moves to New Zealand, we prefer to preserve our right to tax their pension under the DTA. The quid pro quo is that when a recipient of a New Zealand pension moves to the jurisdiction of a DTA partner, that country reserves its right to tax the New Zealand pension. Accordingly, under the existing DTA, when a New Zealander moves to Australia, benefits received from a New Zealand pension scheme are subject to Australian tax. If, however, the person had stayed in New Zealand, no tax would be payable when they receive their pension benefit. This means that a person who has paid into a pension scheme in New Zealand and moves to Australia will be worse off than a person who stays in New Zealand. This amounts to double taxation (as New Zealand has already taxed the income as it accrued in the pension scheme) and Australian pensioners that move to New Zealand face the same problem. In recent years a number of groups that represent pensioners, as well as individual New Zealand pensioners resident in Australia, have argued that this result is unfair. CONVENTION BETWEEN NZ AND AUSTRALIA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 7 Because of the unique trans-Tasman relationship between New Zealand and Australia, it is particularly important to resolve this issue. The new DTA will resolve the economic double taxation of pensions by providing that pensions that would be exempt in the home country remain exempt in the country to which the recipient has retired. Lump sum pension benefits will be taxed only in the state where the pension is sourced, and not in the country to which the recipient has retired. These new rules will ensure better outcomes for New Zealand and Australian pensioners who move across the Tasman. However, it is not intended to change our preferred DTA policy (residence taxation of pensions) more generally. While there may be some risk that the new DTA with Australia will create an adverse precedent for future DTA negotiations, we consider this to be manageable, partly because the trans-Tasman relationship is unique, and partly because the rule is most appropriate where both countries tax pensions on a similar basis (unlike New Zealand and Australia, many countries do not exempt pension benefits). The new rules for pension benefits will also apply to ACC payments. Secondments (Article 14(4) and (5)) The new DTA reduces compliance costs for short-term secondments. Under the existing DTA salaries and wages from secondments are taxable in the country in which the service is performed. There are large numbers of short-term secondments across the Tasman, in both directions. Imposing source taxation on these secondments creates significant compliance costs for Australian and New Zealand businesses while producing little net revenue for either country. The new DTA will address this issue by providing that secondments that do not exceed 90 days in a twelve month period will not be taxed in the country to which the person is seconded. Sportspersons (Article 17) Sportspersons can earn large amounts of income in very short periods of time. Accordingly, tax treaties typically provide that such income always remains taxable in the country in which the service is performed. To reduce compliance costs this rule does not currently apply to trans-Tasman sporting leagues such as the National Rugby League. The new DTA extends this exclusion to Australian and New Zealand teams participating in competitions that also involve teams from outside Australia and New Zealand (such as the Super 14 Rugby competition). The exclusion does not apply to national representative teams competing in international competitions such as the rugby world cup. Existing domestic law provisions exempt foreign national representative teams competing in New Zealand. Reductions in withholding tax rates (Articles 10, 11 and 12) The new DTA introduces reductions in withholding taxes, consistent with the broader strategy on treaty withholding tax rates. The main objective of that strategy is to reduce withholding taxes on foreign non-portfolio dividends received by New Zealand residents. CONVENTION BETWEEN NZ AND AUSTRALIA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 8 This will reduce tax barriers for New Zealand businesses with direct investments offshore, making it less costly to repatriate foreign profits back to New Zealand where they can be reinvested or distributed to shareholders. Lower rates for foreign withholding tax on inbound dividends will complement the proposed international tax reforms, which are also intended to facilitate offshore investment by New Zealand businesses. Those reforms include exempting the active income of foreign companies controlled by New Zealand residents and exempting most foreign dividends received by New Zealand companies. Together, these changes will bring New Zealand’s domestic law and treaty network more closely into line with international norms. This will help New Zealand firms to compete on more equal terms in foreign markets. It will also improve the competitiveness of the New Zealand tax system, reducing incentives for firms to migrate to other jurisdictions. The standard withholding tax rate on dividends remains at 15% in the new DTA. However, this rate is reduced from 15% to 5% if the investor is a company that has at least a 10% shareholding in the company paying the dividend, and from 15% to 0% if the investor is a company that has an 80% or higher shareholding and satisfies certain other requirements. The new DTA also lowers withholding tax rates for interest paid to financial institutions and for royalties. This is less attractive from New Zealand’s perspective since these taxes provide some protection against companies shifting their profits out of New Zealand in order to reduce their tax liabilities. However, some lowering of these rates is acceptable as part of the wider package. The potential impact on the New Zealand tax base is mitigated by two factors. First, a positive rate (5%) has been retained for withholding tax on royalties. Second, the new DTA allows New Zealand to retain its approved issuer levy for borrowers paying interest to an Australian financial institution - although this does effectively “lock in” the approved issuer levy and cap it at 2% with respect to Australian financial institutions. The new DTA amends the definition of royalties so that it now excludes payments for leased equipment. This means that New Zealand would no longer be able to tax lease payments for Australian-owned equipment used in New Zealand unless the lessor has a permanent establishment in New Zealand. This change limits New Zealand’s ability to tax equipment lease payments, but is not unprecedented and is acceptable in the context of the wider package. Again, the change is reciprocal. Limits on source taxation to reduce compliance costs Compared to the existing DTA, the new DTA reduces New Zealand’s ability to tax income earned by Australians which carry out certain short-term activities here. This will reduce business compliance costs but may have a small revenue cost at the margins. Because the changes are reciprocal there may be some offsetting savings to the extent to which New Zealand businesses perform short-term activities in Australia. The fiscal impact either way is not expected to be significant. CONVENTION BETWEEN NZ AND AUSTRALIA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 9 Deemed Permanent Establishments (Article 5) In line with international norms, our double tax agreements only allow us to tax activities carried on in New Zealand by an enterprise of the other Contracting State if that enterprise has a “permanent establishment” here. (This principle applies reciprocally.) Typically, certain activities are deemed to give rise to a permanent establishment (assuming one does not already exist) – including the exploration for or exploitation of natural resources and the operation of substantial equipment. Under the existing DTA such activities were deemed to be permanent from the first day of an enterprise’s operation. The new DTA with Australia introduces minimum time periods that must pass before a permanent establishment is deemed to exist. In future, the exploration for or exploitation of natural resources or standing timber will only give rise to a deemed permanent establishment if activities are carried on for more than 90 days. The operation of substantial equipment will only give rise to a deemed permanent establishment if carried on for more than 183 days. Similar time limits are already a standard feature of our other tax treaties and help to minimise compliance costs for firms by ensuring that short-term or transitory activities in another country do not trigger a taxable presence there. Personal Services (Article 14(2)) The new DTA also reduces the circumstances in which New Zealand can tax services performed by a visiting Australian individual. The existing DTA allows a State to tax personal services if an individual from the other State is present there for more than 183 days in a 12 month period, regardless of whether they have a “permanent establishment” there. The new DTA only allows the State to tax personal services if the 183 limit is exceeded and certain other requirements are met, namely that either:  more than 50 per cent of revenue from the business activities of the enterprise are from the services performed in the State through the individual, or  the services are performed for the same or connected projects through one or more individuals present in the other State. There is an exception to the provisions governing tax on personal services in the new DTA which applies to irregular, infrequent periods of presence of not more than 5 days. This is designed to reduce compliance costs for trans-Tasman businesses. These irregular, infrequent periods will not count towards the 183 day limit. Non-discrimination (Article 24) The new DTA includes a non-discrimination article (Article 24) that prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality, situs of an enterprise, ownership of capital, and (in limited circumstances) residence. The existing DTA has a more limited non- discrimination article based on an alternative provision, preferred by New Zealand, which only requires that non-residents are treated in a comparable manner to other non-residents, rather than as New Zealand residents. Compared to the existing DTA, the new DTA provides greater certainty for foreign investors that they will not be treated more harshly than other taxpayers. However, the CONVENTION BETWEEN NZ AND AUSTRALIA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 10 increased certainty for foreign investors comes with an increased risk to the New Zealand government of legal challenge for an alleged breach of the non-discrimination provision of the new DTA. The risk of legal proceedings under the non-discrimination article is minimised by carve outs for:  Laws designed to prevent the avoidance or evasion of taxes (including rules preventing thin capitalisation and dividend stripping, plus transfer pricing, controlled foreign company and foreign investment fund rules);  Specific regimes covering the transfer of assets offshore, consolidation rules for companies, transfers of losses within group companies, tax rebates, credits in relation to dividends and research and development expenditure deductions; and  Anything otherwise agreed by the Contracting States. These carve-outs are broad enough to protect our existing tax regimes, while also allowing some flexibility for future policy-making and base protection measures. They provide significant protection against the risk of legal challenge for an alleged breach of the non- discrimination provision of the new DTA . Improves co-operation between Tax Authorities The new DTA will improve the already strong working relationship between Australian and New Zealand tax authorities by:  allowing tax information from the other country to be used for any important purpose authorised by domestic law (such as, for example, data matching with other Government agencies) (Article 26);  allowing taxpayers to request arbitration in cases brought under the DTA where New Zealand and Australian tax authorities have been unable to reach an agreement to resolve the case within two years of the case being presented to the competent authorities (the competent authority for New Zealand is the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, although the role is usually delegated) under the mutual agreement procedure (Article 25); and  requiring both countries to consult each other at least once every 5 years, with a view to ensuring that the DTA remains up to date (Article 29). Further detail on these changes is outlined below. Exchange of Information (Article 26) Article 26 on the Exchange of Information enables tax authorities of the two countries to exchange certain types of information for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax avoidance and evasion. An additional paragraph has been added that potentially extends the purposes for which exchanged information can be used. The paragraph provides that information can be used for such other purposes as are permitted under the laws of both States if (and only if) the competent authority of the supplying State authorises such use. CONVENTION BETWEEN NZ AND AUSTRALIA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 11 This paragraph is an optional provision suggested by the OECD. New Zealand does not usually include this paragraph in its tax treaties. However, given the particularly close relationship with Australia, it was considered appropriate in this case. The paragraph will allow tax authorities to use information exchanged under the new DTA for any important purpose authorised by domestic law (such as, for example, data matching with other Government agencies), but in each case will be required to obtain specific approval from the competent authority of the country that supplied the information. Arbitration (Article 25(6) and (7)) The new DTA is the first DTA for either country to include an arbitration provision. The provision will allow taxpayers to request arbitration in cases brought under the DTA where New Zealand and Australian tax authorities have been unable to reach an agreement to resolve the case within two years from the presentation of the case to both competent authorities under the mutual agreement procedure. The provision prevents a case being submitted to arbitration if a decision on the issue has already been reserved or rendered by a tribunal of either Contacting State. In practice, given the strong working relationship between the Australian and New Zealand tax authorities, and the carve outs from the non- discrimination Article, arbitration is unlikely to be required very often, if at all. Arbitration is taxpayer favourable. It provides certainty for business that any cases of double taxation will be resolved in a timely and efficient manner. It takes place at the taxpayer’s request. If a person directly affected does not agree with the outcome, it does not prevent them from pursuing domestic legal remedies. Arbitration also has certain benefits from a government perspective. It provides an independent mechanism for ensuring tax on cross-border transactions is shared fairly between relevant jurisdictions. This is likely to favour countries, such as New Zealand, that already seek to apply best international practice in the application of their tax treaties. There are potential costs to the government from including arbitration in the new DTA – although, in practice, these are not expected to be significant. These include:  The administrative cost of arbitration proceedings. Such costs are likely to be modest since very few cases are likely to go to arbitration. In New Zealand’s experience, only a small number of mutual agreement cases have been brought by taxpayers under our DTAs (11 in the last 3 years 1 ), and the average time to resolve a case was less than six months, well within the two years that must elapse before a case can be sent to arbitration.  The revenue cost of adverse decisions. Arbitration might produce a decision on a specific case that was unfavourable to New Zealand, at a fiscal cost. Taxpayers are already able to seek legal redress against Inland Revenue through the courts. The fiscal risks here are analogous. 1 Statistics were not kept prior to 2006, but there were no outstanding cases at the beginning of 2006. CONVENTION BETWEEN NZ AND AUSTRALIA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 12 Opportunity to update the DTA every 5 years (Article 29) Given the significance of the economic relationship between New Zealand and Australia, and the importance of trans-Tasman investment, it is essential that arrangements governing double taxation between New Zealand and Australia are kept up to date. Accordingly, the new DTA commits both countries to consult each other at least once every five years with a view to determining if further revisions would be appropriate (Article 29(1)). Technical Clarifications The new DTA clarifies numerous technical aspects to ensure the arrangements governing double taxation between New Zealand and Australia are up-to-date and provide certainty for taxpayers. The main technical changes are explained below. Fiscally Transparent Entities (Articles 1(2) and 23(3)) The new DTA includes new provisions clarifying its application to fiscally transparent entities. Similar provisions were also included in the Protocol to amend the New Zealand/United States DTA. A fiscally transparent entity is one that is disregarded for tax purposes, with tax imposed directly on the owners or shareholders, as happens with general partnerships . The appropriate treatment of such entities under a double tax agreement is not always obvious, particularly when the two Contracting States classify them differently for domestic law purposes. New Zealand’s policy is to deal with such entities in accordance with international norms as laid down by the OECD in its 1999 report, The application of the OECD model tax convention to partnerships. Articles 1(2) and 23(3) of the new DTA are consistent with the policy in that report. Residence (Articles 1(1) and 4) Article 1 provides that the treaty only applies to persons who are residents of one or both of the Contracting States. Entitlement to benefits under the new DTA therefore depends on being resident in at least one country. Residence is determined in accordance with rules set out in Article 4 of the new DTA. Those rules have been modernised to make them more relevant to the current business environment and also to clarify that political entities are entitled to benefits under the new DTA. The application of the rules for determining residence can result in a person being a resident of both countries. In such cases, Article 4 contains additional rules for determining how to “break the tie”. (That is, for determining sole residence to one or other of the two countries.) There are separate tie-breaker rules for individuals and for non-individuals. The tie-breaker rules for individuals have been modernised, although the basic tests remain the same. There are four tests, each of which is to be applied in turn until one is found that is determinative. The tests look successively at where the person has their permanent home, centre of vital interests, habitual abode and, finally, citizenship. In our DTAs with other countries, dual-residence is usually resolved within the first two tests, and the third test, habitual abode, is seldom reached. In the New Zealand-Australia context (with freedom of movement across the Tasman), the habitual abode test is more relevant. However, this can be problematic as there are no clear guidelines as to what “habitual CONVENTION BETWEEN NZ AND AUSTRALIA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 13 abode” means. In the negotiations, officials agreed in principle that the better interpretation of “habitual” is “normal” rather than “more usual”. That is, the place a person comes back to out of choice rather than where they spend the bulk of their time (which can be dictated by factors such as work requirements.) It was also agreed that, in the unlikely event that dual-residence of individuals remains unresolved after the application of all four steps, it remains open to the two sides to settle the issue by mutual agreement under the Mutual Agreement Procedure Article of the new DTA (Article 25). The tie-breaker rules for non-individuals (that is, for entities such as companies) have been updated, both for additional clarity and also to address concerns that dual residence can be manipulated for tax avoidance purposes. The general test of determining where the entity has their place of effective management remains the same. However, as this is not always determinative, recourse to a second step of resolving the matter by mutual agreement has been added. Where either country is concerned that difficulties in resolving dual-residence arise from deliberate attempts to manipulate residence in order to gain a tax advantage, the two sides may fail to reach mutual agreement. In such a case, the new DTA specifically provides that the entity is not entitled to any benefits under the new DTA. Dual listed companies (Article 4(6)) The new DTA includes a separate provision for settling the residence of companies which are listed on the stock exchanges of both companies (“dual-listed companies”). Rather than applying the ordinary “tie-breaker” rules referred to above, dual-listed companies are deemed to be resident in the country in which they are incorporated (so long as they have a primary stock exchange listing in that country). This clarification will provide more certainty for dual-listed companies. Transitional Residents (Article 4(4)) Under New Zealand domestic law, transitional residents (i.e. new migrants) are exempt from tax for four years on certain income that they earn offshore. The new DTA clarifies that transitional residents will not get relief from Australian tax in respect of this exempt income. Australia has a similar exemption for individuals on temporary residence visas. However, New Zealand does not have the same DTA policy of denying treaty protection in this circumstance. Accordingly, the provision in the new DTA is unilateral. Managed Investment Trusts (Article 4(7)) Article 4 is amended so that Australian managed investment trusts (MITs) are treated as “individual” residents of Australia for the purposes of the new DTA. This amendment clarifies that, subjection to meeting certain ownership conditions, an Australian MIT will qualify for protection under the new DTA in respect of its investments in New Zealand. However, it has the status of an individual resident in Australia. Accordingly, it only qualifies for the same benefits of an Australian resident individual. This is important for determining the relevant rate of non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) that New Zealand is entitled to withhold under Article 10 of the new DTA. MITs are widely-held ‘flow-through’ vehicles that distribute virtually all their income at regular intervals to their investors, with distributions being taxable only in the hands of CONVENTION BETWEEN NZ AND AUSTRALIA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 14 individual investors and not at the entity level. Without this amendment, it is not clear that MITs would be entitled to the benefits provided by the new DTA. While individual Australian investors would be entitled to claim these benefits, there are major practical difficulties in any individual investors claiming benefits under the new DTA in relation to their underlying investments in New Zealand entities made through the MIT. The extension of benefits to MITs under the new DTA is in line with emerging OECD treaty guidance on the treatment of collective investment vehicles which recognises the difficulty that individual residents face in claiming tax treaty benefits and suggests that there is often a good case for these to be claimed at the entity level. Making it explicit that only MITs that are at least 80% Australian-owned are entitled to treaty benefits provides the New Zealand tax base with a reasonable level of protection against treaty shopping. The amendment to Article 4 deals only with Australian MITs. There is no equivalent flow through collective investment vehicles in New Zealand. Providing symmetrical treatment would have caused confusion about the scope of the provision. It is expected that Australia would agree to make the provision reciprocal if New Zealand did introduce widely held flow through investment vehicles like Australia’s MITs. Income from real property (Article 6) New Zealand tax treaty practice generally follows Article 6 of the OECD Model by allocating taxing rights to all income derived from real property to the state in which the property is situated (i.e. the source state). Australia has a long-standing tax treaty policy of not following the OECD Model with respect to business income from real property. Australia’s standard tax treaty practice is to make business income from real property subject to the principles of Article 5 (permanent establishment) and Article 7 (business profits) of the new DTA, not comprehensive source taxation under Article 6 of the OECD Model. Article 6 of the new DTA reflects a compromise between the New Zealand and Australia positions. Under the new provision, source taxation will apply to all income from real property earned by an enterprise of the other Contracting State. In particular, Article 6 is consistent with New Zealand’s tax treaty preferences in that business income from fishing, agriculture and forestry are within its scope. Also important to New Zealand, both naturally-occurring forests and plantation timber are subject to source-based taxation. However, in line with Australian tax treaty policy the new Article provides that certain principles relating to business profits under Article 7 are also applicable. These principles are that the enterprise’s profits from real property will be calculated on an arm’s length approach (as if it were separate from the enterprise’s other operations) and that taxation will be on a net basis. In practice, it is unlikely that these deviations from the OECD Model will make a significant difference to how income from real property is currently taxed. There is a risk that this departure from our usual tax treaty practice will create a precedent going forward. However, this risk is manageable given that Australia’s position on the treatment of income earned from real property is a departure from the OECD Model. We also note in this regard that the text of Article 6 of the existing DTA with Australia also CONVENTION BETWEEN NZ AND AUSTRALIA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 15 differed from the OECD Model provision. Yet virtually all of our other treaties are consistent with the OECD Model (the other exception is the 1998 DTA with Thailand). Shipping and Air Transport (Article 8) The wording of Article 8 has been modernised in the new DTA, and clarification has been added to provide greater certainty in respect of certain leasing arrangements and the use of containers. However, in substantive effect the Article is unchanged. Obligations which would be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position for reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms DTAs do not impose requirements on taxpayers. The obligations they impose are on the Contracting States. The obligations that will be imposed on New Zealand by the new DTA with Australia are in substance the same as under the existing DTA. These are:  to limit taxing rights, on a reciprocal basis with Australia, in accordance with the rules set out in the DTA;  in cases where the DTA permits both countries to impose tax, to relieve double taxation by means of a foreign tax credit mechanism, in accordance with the rules set out in the DTA;  to provide assistance to the Australian Taxation Office, on a reciprocal basis, by exchanging tax related information and collecting unpaid taxes from absconding taxpayers;  to enter into consultation with the Australian Taxation Office, as appropriate, with a view to attempting to resolve disputes;  to agree to arbitration where disputes cannot be mutually resolved by the two tax administrations (but only in relation to issues of fact or other issues specified in an exchange of diplomatic notes between the two countries). The new DTA will not (and cannot) require the imposition of a tax that is not already imposed under domestic law. That is, where the DTA allocates New Zealand a taxing right, New Zealand needs to have a corresponding taxing provision under domestic law before it can take up that taxing right. A DTA can therefore only restrict taxing rights. It cannot extend them. When income is derived from one country (“the country of source”) by a tax resident of the other country (“the country of residence”) the country of residence generally always retains taxing rights. The main impact of a DTA is to restrict the ability of the country of source to tax the income in certain circumstances. Where both countries are permitted to tax the income, a DTA requires the country of residence to provide a credit for the tax imposed by the country of source. With the exception of the new withholding tax rates, the rules for allocating taxing rights under the new DTA are substantively unchanged from the existing DTA. They provide as follows: Income from real property will generally be taxed in the country where the property is situated (Article 6 refers); CONVENTION BETWEEN NZ AND AUSTRALIA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 16 Business profits will generally be taxable only in the country where the business is resident. However, the profit attributable to a permanent establishment situated in the other country may be taxed in that country. A permanent establishment generally exists in the country in question when there is a fixed place of business where the business of an enterprise is carried on (Articles 5 and 7 refer); Profits of an enterprise of a country from the operation of ships or aircraft shall be taxable only in that country, subject to various rules applicable in specific situations (Articles 7 and 8 refer); Dividends, interest and royalty payments made between New Zealand and Australia may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country from which the payment originates cannot impose tax at a rate exceeding an agreed withholding tax rate which differs depending on whether the payment is a dividend, interest or royalty. The other country, where the payment is received, must reduce its own tax on the payment to compensate for any withholding tax imposed on the payment in the payment’s country of origin. This enables both countries to tax the payment, whilst ensuring the payment is not excessively taxed.  The maximum withholding tax rate that each country can impose on dividends received by a resident of the other country is:  0% if it is paid to a company in the other country that owns (directly or indirectly) 80% or more of the shares in the company paying the dividend and meets certain other requirements;  5% if paid to a company in the other country that owns (directly or indirectly) 10% or more of the shares in the company paying the dividend;  15% in all other cases. (Article 10 refers);  The maximum withholding tax rate that each country can impose on interest received by a resident of the other country is:  0% if the interest is paid to a lending or finance business, provided in the case of interest that originates in New Zealand that the 2% approved issuer levy is paid;  10% in all other cases. (Article 11 refers);  The maximum withholding tax rate that each country can impose on royalties received by a resident of the other country is 5% (Article 12 refers); Specific rules apply to the taxation of income, profits or gains derived from the sale of property. In the case of real property the profits are taxable where the property is situated (Article 13 refers); Income from employment will be taxable only in the country where the employee is resident, unless the employment is performed in the other country. In this case, the country where the employment is performed may also tax the income, if the employee is present for at least 183 days and various conditions are met. Specific exemptions apply for short- term secondments (Article 14 refers); CONVENTION BETWEEN NZ AND AUSTRALIA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 17 Directors’ fees may be taxed in the country where the relevant company is resident (Article 15 refers); Entertainers and sportspersons may be taxed in the country in which the activities of the sportsperson or entertainer take place (Article 16 refers); Pensions are taxable in the country where the recipient is resident. An exemption applies to pensions that would have been exempt in the country where the pension is sourced. Alimony or maintenance payments are only taxable in the country where the payment was made. Lump sums will only be taxable in the source country (Article 17 refers); Salaries and wages for services to a Government of one country are generally exempt from tax in the other country (Article 18 refers); Students are generally not taxed on payments received from outside the country when those payments are for the maintenance and education of the student (Article 19 refers); Measures which the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including specific reference to implementing legislation Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. Section BH 1 provides that DTAs will then override the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982, the Privacy Act 1993, although generally only in relation to income tax. (The only exceptions are for exchange of information and collection assistance, which may relate to taxes other than income tax.) The override of the Inland Revenue Acts is necessary to give effect to the terms of a DTA, given that the Australian DTA requires New Zealand to forego some taxing rights imposed under those Acts. The Official Information Act is overridden to ensure that communications with other states during DTA negotiations are not disclosed. The Privacy Act is overridden to ensure that information can be exchanged regarding natural persons under the exchange of information provisions of the new DTA. Subject to satisfactory completion of Parliamentary treaty examination, the Order in Council will be promulgated and will come into effect 28 days after being published in the Gazette. Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty entering into force and the treaty not entering into force The main economic effect of the new DTA will be to increase certainty of tax treatment and reduce compliance costs for New Zealand businesses that operate in Australia and vice versa. The new DTA will also reduce withholding taxes on dividends and royalties. This will increase New Zealand’s attractiveness as a location for internationally-focused firms. No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Were the new DTA not to enter into force, the existing DTA would remain in place and the status quo position would be maintained. CONVENTION BETWEEN NZ AND AUSTRALIA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 18 Costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty The new DTA is expected to reduce New Zealand tax revenues by around $10 million per annum. This cost is largely attributable to the lower withholding tax rate on royalties. Based on 2005 to 2008 data, the static fiscal cost of halving the rate of withholding tax on royalties is estimated at $8 million. Other fiscal impacts, which cannot be quantified precisely, are:  the increased incentive for companies with non-resident shareholders to use deductible royalty payments to shift profits offshore. We expect a modest behavioural response, with some impact on the company tax base;  the amended definition of royalties (that means that payments for leased equipment will no longer face royalty withholding tax).  some reduction in revenue from changes that limit source taxation on certain short- term activities.  the potential administrative and revenue costs from any proceedings brought under the new non-discrimination article or the new arbitration provision. These costs are not expected to be significant as very few mutual agreement procedure cases are likely to go to arbitration and the carve-outs to the non-discrimination article mean there is only a very remote risk of legal proceedings. The new DTA also reduces the rates of withholding tax on non-portfolio dividends and interest paid to financial institutions. The fiscal cost associated with those changes is expected to be negligible because equivalent relief is already available under domestic law. Completed or proposed consultation with the community and parties interested in the treaty action Submissions were sought prior to negotiating the new DTA. 29 Submissions were received. These were taken into account when negotiating the new DTA. The Treasury and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been consulted on and agree with the proposed treaty action. Subsequent protocols and/or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects The new DTA includes a treaty obligation for both countries to consult at least once every 5 years, with a view to ensuring that the DTA remains up to date. At this stage, no specific future amendments are anticipated. If the need to amend the new DTA arises, this can be achieved by means of a Protocol. New Zealand would consider proposed amendments on a case-by-case basis and any decision to accept an amendment would be subject to the normal domestic approvals and procedures. CONVENTION BETWEEN NZ AND AUSTRALIA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 19 Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty Article 31 of the new DTA provides that, after the expiration of a period of five years from the date of entry into force, either New Zealand or Australia may terminate the DTA. Notice of termination is to be made through diplomatic channels and must be given at least six months before the end of the calendar year in which it is made. Adequacy statement Inland Revenue has prepared this extended NIA and has assessed it as adequate in accordance with the Code of Good Regulatory Practice.

International treaty examination of the Protocol amending the Convention between New Zealand and The United States of America for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income Report of the Finance and Expenditure Committee Contents Introduction 2 Benefits of the protocol 2 Costs of the protocol 3 Overall impact of the protocol 3 Recommendation 3 Appendix A 4 Appendix B 5 PROTOCOL AMENDING THE US–NZ CONVENTION FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 2 International treaty examination of the Protocol amending the Convention between New Zealand and The United States of America for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income Introduction The Protocol amending the Convention between New Zealand and The United States of America for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income seeks to reduce withholding taxes on dividend, interest, and royalty payments made between New Zealand and the United States. It also updates the convention to reflect developments in treaty practice since the convention was signed in 1982. We have conducted an international treaty examination of the Protocol amending the Convention between New Zealand and The United States of America for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, and do not consider that the protocol raises issues that should prevent the Government continuing with its proposed action in respect of the protocol. The National Interest Analysis for the protocol is appended to our report. This quantifies the costs of the protocol, but provides only a qualitative assessment of the benefits. Benefits of the protocol The protocol would reduce withholding taxes on dividends paid between New Zealand and the United States. As a result, it would lower tax barriers for New Zealand businesses investing in the United States and vice versa, and would make it less costly for New Zealand businesses to repatriate their profits from the United States to New Zealand. It is expected that the protocol would make New Zealand a more attractive location from which businesses might invest or expand into the United States. In particular, it is expected to reduce incentives for firms to migrate to Australia. It is almost eight years since Australia signed a protocol with the United States introducing equivalent cuts to their bilateral treaty on withholding tax rates. We asked the Inland Revenue Department to quantify the probable economic benefits for New Zealand companies investing in the United States. However, the department told us that it could not do so because it did not have data on non-portfolio dividends from the United States. The department also commented that it often cannot make a quantitative assessment of the costs and benefits of a treaty as a whole, even when the relevant data is available, because such costs and benefits are dynamic, complex, and very difficult to PROTOCOL AMENDING THE US–NZ CONVENTION FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 3 measure. While acknowledging the difficulties of quantification in this case, we believe that a more detailed assessment would be desirable. Costs of the protocol We were told by the Inland Revenue Department that the protocol is expected to reduce New Zealand tax revenues by about $20 million per annum. This is largely because it will reduce the withholding tax rate on royalties. The Inland Revenue Department has been unable to quantify precisely some of the potential costs associated with the amendments introduced by the protocol. For example, because of the lower withholding tax rates, companies with non-resident shareholders would have more incentive to use deductible royalty payments and unimputed dividends to shift profits or gains offshore. This is expected to increase the pressure on the domestic company tax base, but the department cannot estimate the associated cost. Overall impact of the protocol We were told by the Inland Revenue Department that the potential benefits of the protocol are likely to outweigh the loss of tax revenue, and that the protocol is not expected to have any social, cultural, or environmental effects. However, as the department cannot quantify the protocol’s economic benefits and some of its cost components, we are unable to assess its net effect on New Zealand. We encourage the Government to monitor closely the impact of the protocol on New Zealand businesses, once it is ratified and implemented. Recommendation We recommend that, to assist us in examining treaties in the future, departments should attempt to assess the costs and benefits of each treaty in quantitative as well as qualitative terms. In cases where quantitative assessment is difficult, more detailed attempts to set out a methodology and a basis for estimates would be useful. PROTOCOL AMENDING THE US–NZ CONVENTION FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 4 Appendix A Committee procedure We met on 1, 8, and 29 April 2009 to consider the Protocol amending the Convention between New Zealand and The United States of America for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income. We received evidence from the Inland Revenue Department. Committee members Craig Foss (Chairperson) Amy Adams David Bennett John Boscawen Brendon Burns Hon David Cunliffe Raymond Huo Rahui Katene Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga Stuart Nash Dr Russel Norman Chris Tremain PROTOCOL AMENDING THE US–NZ CONVENTION FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 5 Appendix B National Interest Analysis Executive summary 1 The United States and New Zealand have finalised the text of a protocol (“the US Protocol”) to amend the existing double tax agreement between New Zealand and the United States (“the Convention”). The main purpose of the US Protocol is to reduce withholding taxes on dividend, interest and royalty payments made between New Zealand and the United States. The protocol also makes certain other changes to the existing Convention and updates several technical aspects to reflect developments in treaty practice since the Convention was signed in 1982. Date and nature of proposed binding treaty action 2 It is proposed that the Protocol amending the Convention between New Zealand and the United States of America for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (“the US Protocol”) be signed at the next available signing opportunity. Subsequent to signature and satisfactory completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, it is proposed that the US Protocol be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council, and brought into force, in accordance with Article XVI, through an exchange of notes through diplomatic channels, confirming completion of all necessary domestic procedures for entry into force. The US Protocol will enter into force on the date of the later note. Reasons for New Zealand becoming party to the treaty 3 New Zealand currently has 35 Double Tax Agreements (DTAs) in force. They are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border investment, but also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. 4 One way in which DTAs facilitate investment is that they limit the rate at which each country can impose withholding tax on dividend, interest or royalty payments to a person resident in the other country. The primary purpose of the US Protocol is to reduce the rates of withholding tax that apply under the existing double tax agreement between New Zealand and the United States (“the Convention”). The withholding tax rates in this Convention are no longer considered optimal now that New Zealand firms are becoming more internationally-focused. 5 High withholding taxes can reduce economic efficiency by making it more costly for New Zealand businesses to source offshore finance or repatriate income earned by their foreign operations. Double tax agreements provide an opportunity for countries to negotiate reciprocal reductions in withholding taxes that benefit both countries. PROTOCOL AMENDING THE US–NZ CONVENTION FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 6 Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty entering into force and not entering into force 6 The main advantage to New Zealand of the US Protocol entering into force is that it will reduce withholding taxes on dividends paid between New Zealand and the United States. More specifically, the US Protocol will reduce the rate of withholding tax on dividends from 15% to 5% if the investor is a company that has at least a 10% shareholding in the company paying the dividend or 0% if the investor is a company that has an 80% or higher shareholding and satisfies certain other requirements. This reduces tax barriers for New Zealand businesses investing into the United States and vice versa. It makes it less costly for New Zealand businesses to repatriate their US profits back to New Zealand where they can be reinvested or distributed to shareholders. The lower dividend rates will complement the proposed international tax reforms, which are also intended to facilitate offshore investment by New Zealand businesses. Those reforms include exempting the active income of foreign companies controlled by New Zealand residents and exempting most foreign dividends received by New Zealand companies. 7 More broadly, the US Protocol creates a favourable template for reducing withholding taxes in DTAs with other countries. As the new rates are applied to more DTAs they will increase New Zealand’s attractiveness as a location for internationally- focused firms. Our Convention with the United States is a key treaty in this regard. 8 The protocol also lowers withholding tax rates for interest paid to lending or finance businesses and for royalties. This is less attractive from New Zealand’s perspective since these taxes provide some protection against companies shifting their profits out of New Zealand in order to reduce their tax liabilities. However, some lowering of these rates is acceptable as part of the wider package. Moreover, the potential impact on the New Zealand tax base is mitigated by two factors. First, a positive rate (5%) has been retained for withholding tax on royalties. Second, the protocol allows New Zealand to retain its approved issuer levy for borrowers paying interest to US lending or finance businesses. However, it does effectively “lock in” the approved issuer levy and cap it at 2% with respect to US lending or finance businesses. For instance, if New Zealand were to repeal the approved issuer levy no withholding tax would be payable on interest paid to an unrelated US lending or finance business under the treaty. 9 The US Protocol is expected to reduce New Zealand tax revenues by around $20m per annum. This is largely attributable to the lower withholding tax rate on royalties. 10 The protocol also makes certain other changes to the existing treaty. In particular, it deletes Article 14 (Independent Personal Services) of the existing Convention. The deletion means that New Zealand can only impose income tax on a US individual that performs services in New Zealand if that person has a permanent establishment (broadly, a fixed place of business) here. At the moment, New Zealand can tax personal services if the US person has been in New Zealand for 183 or more days in a 12 month period. The provision is reciprocal, so it may also limit US taxing rights in certain circumstances, to the benefit of New Zealand. 11 The protocol also amends the definition of royalties, excluding payments for leased equipment. This means that New Zealand would no longer be able to tax lease payments for US-owned equipment used in New Zealand unless the lessor has a permanent PROTOCOL AMENDING THE US–NZ CONVENTION FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 7 establishment in New Zealand. This change limits New Zealand’s ability to tax equipment lease payments, but is not unprecedented and is acceptable in the context of the wider package. Again, the change is reciprocal. 12 Not signing or otherwise progressing the US Protocol to entry into force is an option. However, in that case the potential benefits to New Zealand in terms of increased investment and international competitiveness will be forgone. These advantages are likely to outweigh the loss of tax revenues that would result under the protocol. 13 On balance, it is considered to be in New Zealand’s interest to conclude the US Protocol. Legal obligations which will be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position for reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms 14 The US Protocol will not impose requirements on taxpayers. The obligations it imposes are on the Contracting States, restricting their taxing rights under domestic law on a reciprocal basis. The US Protocol will not require the imposition of a tax that is not already imposed under domestic law. 15 The US Protocol will amend the existing Convention between New Zealand and the United States. As a result each country will be required to comply with the following rules when imposing tax on residents of either country: • Dividends, interest and royalty payments made between New Zealand and the United States may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country from which the payment originates cannot impose tax at a rate exceeding an agreed withholding tax rate which differs depending on whether the payment is a dividend, interest or royalty. The other country, where the payment is received, must reduce its own tax on the payment to compensate for any withholding tax imposed on the payment in the payment’s country of origin. This enables both countries to tax the payment, whilst ensuring the payment is not excessively taxed. • The maximum withholding tax rate that each country can impose on dividends received by a resident of the other country is: • 0% if it is paid to a company in the other country that owns (directly or indirectly) 80% or more of the shares in the company paying the dividend and meets certain other requirements. • 5% if paid to a company in the other country that owns (directly or indirectly) 10% or more of the shares in the company paying the dividend. • 15% in all other cases. (Article VI refers); • The maximum withholding tax rate that each country can impose on interest received by a resident of the other country is: • 0% if the interest is paid to a lending or finance business, provided in the case of interest that originates in New Zealand that the 2% approved issuer levy is paid. PROTOCOL AMENDING THE US–NZ CONVENTION FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 8 • 10% in all other cases. (Article VII refers); • The maximum withholding tax rate that each country can impose on royalties received by a resident of the other country is 5% (Article VIII refers). • Article 14 (Independent Personal Services) of the existing Convention is deleted. (Article X refers). The deletion means that New Zealand can only impose income tax on US individuals that perform services in New Zealand if the US individual has a permanent establishment in New Zealand. At the moment, New Zealand can tax personal services if the US person has been in New Zealand for 183 or more days in a 12 month period. The change is reciprocal so it also limits the United States’ ability to tax services performed by New Zealanders. 16 Finally, the protocol updates several technical aspects of the double tax agreement to reflect developments in treaty practice since the Convention was negotiated in 1983. These updates include: • Extending the application of the treaty so that it applies to US citizens in third countries, but excludes former US citizens or former long-term US residents. (Article I refers). • A new provision that clarifies that the treaty applies to fiscally transparent entities. A fiscally transparent entity is an entity that is disregarded for tax purposes, with tax imposed directly on the owners or shareholders, as happens with general partnerships. This is a standard US provision and is consistent with international norms. (Article I refers). • A revised limitation of benefits article (Article XI). This tightens access to treaty benefits in order to prevent residents from a third country from unduly exploiting the benefits of the Convention (i.e. treaty shopping). Again, this is a standard US provision. • An updated non-discrimination article (Article XIII). This prevents New Zealand from taxing US residents more harshly than New Zealand residents in equivalent circumstances and vice versa. • An updated exchange of information article (Article XV). This article allows tax authorities in the United States and New Zealand to work together to prevent tax evasion. The new Article reflects the OECD standards on information exchange introduced in 2004. The key difference for New Zealand is that the Article now permits the exchange of information in relation to all taxes, rather than just income tax. This will mean, for example, that New Zealand will be able to request information from the United States to assist in auditing assessments for GST as well as income tax. 17 The US Protocol doesn’t allow for reservations, and doesn’t change the dispute settlement procedures under the existing Convention. Under the existing convention a mutual agreement procedure can be triggered if a US or New Zealand person considers the actions of either the United States or New Zealand results in taxation that is not in accordance with the convention. If the person’s case is justified and can’t be remedied by their own country, US and New Zealand tax authorities will endeavour to agree on a satisfactory solution. In addition, US and New Zealand tax authorities must endeavour to PROTOCOL AMENDING THE US–NZ CONVENTION FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 9 resolve any issues as to the interpretation or application of the Convention by mutual agreement. Measures which the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including specific reference to implementing legislation. 18 The US Protocol will need to be implemented domestically by Order in Council in accordance with section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 enables new DTAs and changes to existing DTAs (such as the US Protocol) to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that DTAs will override the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1993 in relation to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of a DTA, since they allocate taxing rights. This means that New Zealand foregoes some taxing rights available under the Inland Revenue Acts in certain circumstances. The Official Information Act is overridden to ensure that communications with other states during DTA negotiations are not disclosed. The Privacy Act is overridden to ensure that information can be exchanged regarding natural persons under the exchange of information provision (Article XV of the US Protocol). 19 Subject to satisfactory completion of Parliamentary treaty examination, the Order in Council will be promulgated and will come into effect 28 days after being published in the Gazette. Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action 20 The main economic effect of the protocol is that it will reduce tax barriers for New Zealand businesses investing into the United States and vice versa. This will increase New Zealand’s attractiveness as a location for internationally-focused firms. No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty 21 The US Protocol is expected to reduce New Zealand tax revenues by around $20m per annum. This is largely attributable to the lower withholding tax rate on royalties. Completed or proposed consultation with the community and parties interested in the treaty action 22 The Treasury and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been consulted on and agree with the proposed treaty action. Subsequent protocols and/or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects 23 No future amendments are anticipated and the US Protocol makes no provision for amendments. However, if the need to further amend the Convention with the United States arises, this can be achieved by means of another Protocol. New Zealand would consider proposed amendments on a case by case basis and any decision to accept an amendment would be subject to the normal domestic approvals and procedures. PROTOCOL AMENDING THE US–NZ CONVENTION FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 10 Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty 24 Article 28 of the Convention provides that either New Zealand or the United States may terminate the DTA by giving 6 months notice of termination, through diplomatic channels.

The new rates for individuals will be 12.5%, 21%, 33% and 38%, depending on their income. The bill introduces a new default rate of 38% for people who do not elect an RWT rate with their bank. This default rate will apply to accounts opened from 1 April 2010. The bill proposes a transitional period for people who have an existing bank account at 1 April 2010 and who are on the current RWT default rate of 19.5%. They will be automatically shifted up to a 21% rate for a year from 1 April 2010. They will then have a year in which to either confirm with their bank that 21% is their correct rate or to select one of the other RWT rates. If they neither confirm the 21% rate nor elect another rate, their RWT rate will then go up to 38% from 1 April 2011. The changes to the default rate are being made to motivate people to use the RWT rate that aligns with their marginal tax rate for the interest they receive from their financial institution. This has proved to be the most controversial matter in the bill. The bill aligns the tax rates on portfolio investment entities (PIEs) with the new personal tax rates, so that PIE rates will be 12.5%, 21% and 30%, and makes a number of similar consequentials to other withholding tax rates. Other amendments include removing the current requirement for Inland Revenue to issue personal tax summaries, clarifying the Commissioner’s discretion to allow taxpayers who have made minor errors in a return (involving $500 or less in tax) to correct them in a subsequent return, making the requirement to pay tax in dispute a non-disputable decision and clarifying the meaning of ‘dividend’ under the dividend stripping rules. Thirteen submissions were received on the bill. Submitters were generally supportive of the main purpose of the bill, which is to align rates. However, several submitters had significant concerns regarding the proposal to change the default rate to 38% for all taxpayers using the 21% rate on 1 April 2011. During consultation with officials, submitters suggested an alternative proposal which targets taxpayers who use the incorrect rate. Officials support the alternative proposal. Several submitters raised significant issues that were not directly related to the changes in the bill. These included issues relating to dividend RWT, PIEs and government superannuation allowances. Officials are sympathetic to several of the issues raised, but there has not been sufficient time to address these issues given the timeframe. In any case it is difficult to deal with extraneous policy matters in the context of the select committee bill process. 2 3 Significant policy matters 4 5 RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX (RWT) Clauses 45, 51 and 60 Issue: Support alignment of RWT rates Submission (3 – New Zealand Bankers’ Association, 10 – KPMG, 6 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 8 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 11 – Ernst & Young) Submitters support the consequential alignment of resident withholding tax (RWT) rates on interest income with the new personal tax rates. Comment Officials welcome the general consensus in favour of aligning RWT rates with the personal tax rates that are now in place after recent tax cuts (12.5%, 21%, 33% and 38%). Alignment will ensure that compliance costs for taxpayers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue are reduced, as individuals will be able to select the RWT rate that corresponds with their marginal tax rate. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Default RWT rate Submission (3 – New Zealand Bankers’ Association, 10 – KPMG, 6 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The default RWT rate that applies where an interest recipient does not elect a rate should be 21%. This is because it will ensure the greatest accuracy in terms of taxing the highest proportion of individuals at the correct rate and ensure the lowest compliance costs. (KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Corporate Taxpayers Group) 12.5% is not an appropriate default RWT rate. (KMPG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) At the most, the default RWT rate should be 33%. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) 6 The New Zealand Bankers’ Association supports the default rate of 38% for new accounts. However, the proposed 38% default rate should only apply to new accounts that are opened after 1 April 2010. The proposed shift to 38% on 1 April 2011 should not take place. Instead, a legislative requirement should be imposed for deposit account holders to elect an RWT rate that aligns with their marginal tax rate. The deposit account holder should be required to change their RWT rate where the rate no longer reflects the account holder’s marginal tax rate. Such an approach could be supplemented with the proposed requirement for banks to remind customers to ensure that their RWT rate is aligned with their marginal tax rate on annual resident withholding tax certificates and work by Inland Revenue. (New Zealand Bankers’ Association) Comment Default rate for new bank accounts Officials maintain that the default rate for new bank accounts that are opened from 1 April 2010 should be 38%. The rationale for this approach is that it provides an incentive to taxpayers to select the RWT rate that is appropriate given their marginal tax rate. Shift of existing bank accounts to 38% default rate from 1 April 2011 Officials agree with submitters that existing bank accounts should not be shifted to a 38% default rate from 1 April 2011. This is because of the substantial number of contacts that banks will have within a short period of time as a result of moving a large number of customers to the new default rate on 1 April 2011. Additionally, Inland Revenue expects that a large number of extra personal tax summaries and contacts will arise from this proposal. Furthermore, a number of individuals who will be shifted to the 38% default rate would be permanently over-taxed under the current proposal, as they will in fact have a lower marginal tax rate (i.e. 12.5%, 21% or 33%). Officials instead support an alternative proposal that arose from consultation with submitters. This would involve a more targeted approach with respect to taxpayers who should be on the 38% RWT rate but are on a lower rate. This would involve Inland Revenue identifying individuals who are on the 21% RWT rate but who should be on 38% and instructing interest payers (initially, the major banks) to shift those individuals to the appropriate rate. This would work by the banks providing Inland Revenue with information on customers’ tax file numbers and elected RWT rates. Based on information about taxpayers from employer monthly schedules, Inland Revenue would send back “amended” information to the banks on an annual basis. Inland Revenue would also send letters to affected individuals, informing them of this action. As with the current proposal, individuals who are shifted up to 38% would still retain the ability to elect down to a lower rate. A similar approach is already used by Inland Revenue in relation to secondary tax codes, where it may instruct employers to use a particular PAYE tax code for an individual taxpayer. 7 Recommendation That the submission be accepted subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Electing RWT rates Submission (11 – Ernst and Young) Individuals should retain their ability to freely choose between the 21%, 33% and 38% rate and not be required to choose a “correct rate”. Comment Individuals who are shifted up to a higher RWT rate due to Inland Revenue notifying their interest payer under the alternative proposal would still have the ability to subsequently elect another rate. However, officials note that individuals who do elect back down will likely be identified by Inland Revenue as being on an inappropriate rate the next year and again shifted up to the RWT rate that corresponds with their marginal tax rate. Recommendation That the submission be accepted subject to officials’ comments. 8 PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT ENTITIES (PIES) Clause 49(10) Issue: Taxable + PIE thresholds Submission (4 – University of Auckland – Retirement Policy and Research Centre) The thresholds for taxable + PIE income should be the same as the threshold for taxable income. Comment The changes in this bill simply amend the existing thresholds to take account of the recent tax cuts and threshold changes. They do not change the existing policy that the threshold for taxable + PIE income is higher than the threshold for taxable income. The reason for this policy is to ensure that investors whose income is entirely or mostly from PIEs are not overtaxed on their PIE income. The problem of over- taxation for these people arises because PIE tax is a final, flat rate. An example of the problem that would arise is where an investor earns $20,000 of only PIE income. In the absence of the higher threshold for taxable + PIE income, every dollar of their income would be taxable at 21% – even though the majority of it should be taxable at 12.5%. The policy underlying the PIE rules is that PIE investors should not be disadvantaged compared to other investors. When the PIE rules were introduced, each threshold for taxable + PIE income was raised to the next threshold. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 9 Issue: Threshold for 30% rate for 2009-10 income year Submission (7 – Barry Preddle) The thresholds at which the 30% rate applies did not rise at the time of the tax cuts. This means that, for the 2009-10 income year, people earning between $38,000 and $48,000 had to elect the 30% rate for their PIE income, whereas a direct investor would have been able to use 21%. Affected taxpayers should be given a tax credit or rebate. Comment It was not possible to make changes to the PIE rates until 1 April 2010 due to the time needed to consult with PIE managers. A credit or rebate to this group of investors for the 2009-10 income year would be extremely complex and expensive to administer, particularly given that it would apply only to a single transitional year. Officials also note that PIE tax treatment is still concessionary for this group in a number of respects. In particular, PIE income is not taken into account for determining social policy entitlements or obligations, and the threshold for taxable and PIE income is higher than the threshold for taxable income. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 10 PERSONAL TAX SUMMARIES Clauses 62(2), 63 and 64 Issue: Support for proposal Submission (10 – KPMG) The submitter supports the change to allow Inland Revenue flexibility in issuing personal tax summaries (PTSs). However, taxpayer perception should be noted, especially since the selective issue of income statements may lead to taxpayers not receiving refunds they are otherwise entitled to. Comment These changes relate only to categories of people to whom Inland Revenue automatically issues a PTS. Nothing in the proposals will affect the taxpayer’s ability to request a PTS in order to receive a refund. Officials note that taxpayers who automatically receive a PTS showing they have tax owing must pay that tax. On the other hand, taxpayers who are not automatically sent a PTS (or who are not required to request a PTS) can first check to see whether they will receive a tax bill or a refund. Individuals can do this by requesting a summary of earnings from Inland Revenue and checking the online refund calculator. If the calculation shows that they would receive a tax bill, they do not need to request a PTS and therefore do not need to repay under-withheld tax. If it shows that they would receive a refund, they can then request a PTS. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 11 Issue: Proposal is unnecessary Submission (5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposal is unnecessary because the submitter cannot foresee situations where Inland Revenue should be using its discretion to exempt taxpayers from filing tax returns. Comment Currently, Inland Revenue is required to issue a PTS to several categories of individual taxpayers. Categories of taxpayers who must automatically receive a PTS include those who have had insufficient tax withheld on $200 or more of income, or who have earned employment income using certain tax codes. However, issuing a PTS is unnecessary for categories of taxpayer who are no more likely to have had the incorrect amount of tax withheld than any other category. These include spouses of Working for Families recipients and people who have student loans. It is not administratively sustainable to continue to automatically send unnecessary PTSs. If Inland Revenue is to continue to meet government and public service expectations within likely budgetary limits it needs to be able to make sensible business decisions that are risk-based. Non-discretionary statutory requirements as to when interventions are required are inconsistent with this approach. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 12 MINOR ERRORS IN RETURNS Clause 66 Submission (5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 6 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 8 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 10 – KPMG, 11 – Ernst & Young) The $500 threshold should be raised. Submitters suggest a range of increased thresholds from $1,000 to $100,000 (or 2% of turnover, if less). (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Corporate Taxpayers Group, PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, Ernst & Young) There should be a maximum error, rather than a maximum tax effect of the error. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The threshold should be $500 per adjustment, rather than $500 per return. (KPMG) Comment Officials consider that $500 per return is a reasonable margin of error for individuals and SMEs, and large taxpayers should have systems in place to prevent large oversights. Over time, further consideration to the threshold may be able to be considered depending on how the proposal works in practice. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 13 REWRITE OF THE INCOME TAX ACT: DIVIDEND ARISING UNDER DIVIDEND STRIPPING RULES Clause 53(1) Issue: Dividend in dividend stripping rules Submission (11 – Ernst & Young, 6 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The addition of reference to the dividend stripping rules to schedule 51 (which lists intended rewrite changes) should be amended. Section GB 1(3) should be amended to deem the amount to be assessable income without characterising it as a dividend. (Ernst & Young) Dividends that result from the dividend stripping rules should not be subject to RWT and NRWT. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Schedule 51 should not confirm the drafting change in the dividend stripping rules as an intended policy change. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment Clause 53(1) confirms that the minor wording change in the dividend stripping rules is an intended drafting outcome in rewriting them. The Rewrite Advisory Panel had concluded that the rewritten rule in section GB 1(3) contained an unintended change in outcome that clarified the law to reflect the Commissioner’s view that the provision has always been subject to withholding tax rules. However, officials note that whether the withholding tax regimes apply to a dividend arising under the dividend stripping rules has been a long-standing policy and interpretation issue. Officials now consider that there are practical difficulties in applying the resident withholding tax rules to the company distributing the dividend, for the following reasons: • The company treated as paying the dividend may not have knowledge of the circumstances of the person treated as deriving the dividend that result from dividend stripping. • Other dividends arising under other anti-avoidance rules are treated as dividends paid, for which a payer can be identified are explicitly excluded from the resident withholding tax rules. 14 Officials note that if the payer of the dividend is not required to withhold resident withholding tax, the recipient of the dividend remains liable for the tax and any associated penalties and interest, under the normal assessment process. Officials consider this is the appropriate policy outcome. However, officials consider that if a dividend arising from the dividend stripping rules is derived by a non-resident, the non-resident withholding tax rules remain relevant. Normally, a non-resident deriving a dividend from New Zealand is not required to file a tax return, and the NRWT withheld from the payment is a final tax. However, the NRWT rules provide that if the payer does not withhold NRWT, or does not withhold the correct amount of NRWT, the recipient must file a return of income and pay tax under the normal assessment process. While the same practical difficulties relating to establishing a withholding obligation exist for the payer of the section dividend arising from the dividend stripping rules, officials consider the NRWT rules should continue apply to the recipient. That outcome would be consistent with the recommended effect for a resident who derives a dividend arising from the dividend stripping rules. Officials have also considered the submission that a dividend arising from the dividend stripping rules should not be treated as a dividend, with particular reference to the application of the memorandum account rules. The memorandum account rules provide for the benefit of corporate tax to be attributed to shareholders on payment of a dividend (for example, by way of imputation credits). Officials agree with this submission, as this would ensure that: • The amount of the dividend does not affect the determination of the ratios for the benchmark dividend rules; and • The paying company is not required to issue a shareholder dividend statement retrospectively; and • The paying company would not attach imputation credits (or other memorandum account credits) to the dividend. This outcome is consistent with the policy of the imputation rules that imputation credits cannot be streamed to any particular shareholder, and ensures that the taxation obligation is imposed on the recipient of the dividend. Recommendations That the submission relating to schedule 51 be declined, but should not refer to withholding tax obligations. That the submission be accepted that no withholding obligation be imposed on the company treated as paying a dividend arising from the dividend stripping rules. That the submission that the dividend stripping rules should give rise to assessable income (not a dividend) be declined. That the submission that memorandum account rules in Part O do not apply in relation to a section GB 1(3) dividend be accepted. 15 TAX IN DISPUTE Clause 67 Submissions (5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 10 – KPMG) This submission opposes the proposed amendment. It removes an ability of a taxpayer to challenge a decision of the Commissioner that can have dire circumstances. Not being able to challenge such a decision gives the Commissioner unfettered power to enforce payment from taxpayers, whether that payment is correctly due or not. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The Committee should ensure that this additional power is required and will be used as intended. (KPMG) Comment Section 138I of the Tax Administration Act 1994 concerns payment of tax in dispute. Before 2003 the legislation required that half the tax being disputed be paid in all cases. This requirement was repealed as the justification for requiring the payment was significantly diminished by the introduction of use-of-money interest. When the general requirement was repealed, the Commissioner was given the ability to require that a disputant pay all of the tax in dispute if the Commissioner considers that there was a significant risk that the tax in dispute would not be paid if the disputant’s challenge was not successful (section 138I(2B)). This discretion is exercised in exceptional circumstances only – for example, when the Commissioner considers there is a flight risk or a substantial risk of assets being alienated. The delegation for this discretion is set at a high level. It was never the policy intention that the exceptional/rare event would itself be disputable. Full dispute rights are still available for the substantive dispute. Officials continue to support the amendment as introduced. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 16 17 Other issues raised in submissions 18 19 RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX (RWT) Issue: Casual interest payers Submission (6 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The RWT rules should be clarified as to how they apply to non-banking scenarios, especially in one-off transactions. In particular, there should be separate rules for “casual interest payers” (interest payers outside of the major financial institutions). This should include a special default rate of 33% for casual interest payers and 30% for companies. This would apply where the casual interest payer has not been supplied with a tax file number. Comment This is a matter that does not arise specifically from the proposals contained in the bill but is an issue that arises more broadly with respect to the application of the RWT system that we have not been able to consider in the time available. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: RWT on interest and dividends Submission (6 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) As an alternative to the submission above, all fully imputed dividends paid by widely- held companies to resident shareholders should be subject to a final tax of 30%. Tax on all interest paid between unrelated parties should be capped at 30%. Comment This is a substantive proposal that is outside the ambit of the bill and has not been considered. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 20 Issue: RWT on dividends Submission (5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 6 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 8 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 10 – KPMG, 11 – Ernst & Young) The RWT rate on dividends should be reduced from 33% to 30% to align with the company tax rate. (PricewaterhouseCoopers, Corporate Taxpayers Group) The RWT rate on dividends should be reduced to 30% if paid to companies or PIEs. (Ernst & Young) Companies should not have to deduct an additional 3% RWT on payment of fully imputed dividends. However, this could remain as an option if a company wished to do so. (KPMG) The RWT rate on dividends should be reduced to 30% for a dividend paid to an associated person of a closely-held company. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment This issue is that 30% will not be a final tax to any recipient (all 30% taxpayers have an obligation to file a tax return) whereas 33% will be final to some individuals. The question is one of compliance cost trade off between the dividend payer and the recipient. Further, this is a substantive proposal that is outside the ambit of the bill and, in the time available, has not been able to be fully considered. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 21 PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT ENTITIES (PIES) Issue: Top rate of 30% Submission (4 – University of Auckland – Retirement Policy and Research Centre) PIE income should be subject to the same marginal tax rates as ordinary income. In particular, PIE tax should not be capped at 30%. Comment This is outside the ambit of the proposals in the bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: PIE income should be included for social policy purposes Submission (4 – University of Auckland – Retirement Policy and Research Centre) PIE income should be taken into account for the purposes of state entitlements and obligations. This should also apply to income that is subject to fringe benefit tax, employer scheme contribution tax, and fund withdrawal tax. Comment This is outside the ambit of the proposals in the bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 22 Issue: PIE tax rate for non-residents Submission (10 – KPMG) There should be a 0% PIE tax rate for foreign-sourced income of non-resident investors. Comment This matter is outside the ambit of the bill. Note that it is currently being considered by the Government as one of the issues resulting from the Prime Minister’s Job Summit. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 23 GOVERNMENT SUPERANNUATION ALLOWANCES Submission (13 – Dr DE and Mrs SE Wright) The tax rate of government superannuation allowances should be reviewed. Comment We understand that the issue raised relates to defined benefit payments paid by the Government Superannuation Fund (a now-closed superannuation scheme for government employees). In 1990, payments from the scheme were made tax-exempt and were reduced by the amount of tax that would have been payable at the time had the pension been a recipient’s only source of income. We understand that the submitter requests that these payments be increased to take account of the recent tax rate reductions. This is a complex issue that would require significant changes to current policy settings and cannot be addressed in the time available. Further, this does not fall within the ambit of legislation administered by Inland Revenue. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 24 25 Minor policy and technical issues 26 27 MINOR POLICY AND TECHNICAL ISSUES This section of the report deals with submissions on a range of technical matters and policy details. The material is presented in tabular form to make it easier to deal with. 28 No Issue Submitter Submission Offici als’ recommendation and comment 1. Support for size and scope of bill 6 – Corporate Taxpayers Group The submitter supports the size and scope of this bill. Note. 2. Commentary 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants The commentary should have highlighted certain aspects of the rewrite remedials and provided further explanation of these technical changes. Note. Officials will consider this point for future commentaries covering rewrite remedial changes. Further information will be contained in the Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) following on from the new legislation. 3. Remedial Unit 6 – Corporate Taxpayers Group A remedial unit should be established within Inland Revenue to deal with remedial tax matters on a day to day basis. Decline. There is already a pr ocess for dealing with remedial matters. Resident Withholding Tax (RWT) Clauses 45, 51 and 60 4. 12.5% rate: reasonable expectation test unnecessary 6 – Corporate Taxpayers Group A “reasonable expectation” test for the 12.5% rate is not necessary. Decline. Officials consider that the test is necessary to manage the risk of individuals on higher marginal tax rates electing the 12.5% RWT rate. 5. 12.5% rate: onus of reasonable expectation test 10 – KPMG The onus should be on the interest earner, not the interest payer, to comply with the reasonable expectation test. Note. Officials agree that the onus should be on the interest earner, and consider that this is clear in the legislation. 6. 12.5% rate: consequences of incorrect election 6 – Corporate Taxpayers Group The conseq uences of incorrectly electing the 12.5% rate should be clarified. The only consequence should be that the person has to file a return at year-end. Note. The legislation is clear that for most people the only consequence of electing the wrong rate is that the person must request a personal tax summary at year-end and pay the additional tax if the amount of interest they have earned is $200 or more (or include the interest in their tax return if they are required to file a return). However, penalties may apply if a person knowingly elects 12.5% without a reasonable expectation that their income will be $14,000 or under. This will be covered in the Tax Information Bulletin . 29 No Issue Submitter Submission Offici als’ recommendation and comment 7. 12.5% RWT rate: Trustees Officials’ submissi on It is not clear whether trustees may access the 12.5% rate on interest income. The 12.5% rate should be available only where the minor beneficiary rules do not apply because of the testamentary trust exception in section HC 37. Accept. The 12.5% rate is inapprop riate for the majority of trusts given the minor beneficiary rules. 8. Consequential amendment for 12.5% rate Officials’ submission Section 33A of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which deals with thresholds for personal tax summaries, should be consequentially amended to take account of the new 12.5% rate for RWT. Accept. This will ensure that the rules for people in this category operate as intended. 9. Reminder requirement 3 – New Zealand Bankers’ Association, 6 – Corporate Taxpayers Group , 11 – Ernst & Young The reminder requirement proposed is inappropriate given that interest recipients are able to choose an RWT rate of 21%, 33% or 38%. (New Zealand Bankers’ Association, Ernst & Young) Inland Revenue should provide taxpayers with information on the new RWT rates as part of its role instead of the proposal for interest payers to remind interest recipients to el ect an appropriate rate. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Accept, subject to officials’ comment s. Officials consider that the wording of the reminder notice should explain that the consequence of a taxpayer electing an RWT rate that is inconsistent with their marginal tax rate is that the person may need to file at the end of the year. Officials consider that the reminder notice should only be required to be included on an annual RWT certif icate, where one is required to be issued. This almost totally removes the compliance cost of this requirement. 10. Reminder requirement 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants If a recipient fails to respond to a reminder notice, their current RWT rate election should continue and they should not be moved to the non-declaration rate. Accept, subject to officials’ comme nts. Officials agree that the current rate should continue to apply if the recipient does not respond to a reminder notice. However, officials note that under the proposed new approach, Inland Revenue will have the ability to instruct an interest payer to use a particular rate where an individual taxpayer is on an RWT rate that is inconsistent with their marginal tax rate. 11. Reminder requirement 6 – Corporate Taxpayers Group There should be clarifica tion of the reminder notice: • “for each year” • what if recipient is a company? • words “consistent with the rate of tax applying to their taxable income” Note. This submission has been superseded by the recommendation in 9. 30 No Issue Submitter Submission Offici als’ recommendation and comment 12. Company rate 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants , 8 – PricewaterhouseCoopers , 11 – Ernst & Young The submitters support the proposal to have a 30% RWT rate available for payers of interest to companies for the 201 0-11 income year. Note. 13. Non-declaration rate 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants The submitter supports changing the 39% RWT rate for taxpayers who do not supply a tax file number from to 38%. Note. 14. RWT rates should be in schedule 1 6 – Corporate Taxpayers Group It seems co nvoluted and not best practice to specify RWT rates in both the substantive legislation and schedule 1 – all rates should be in schedule 1. Decline 15. Threshold for monthly accounting for RWT 6 – Corporate Taxpayers Group The thresh old at which RWT must be accounted for on a monthly basis should be increased from $500 to $5000. The current rules should be simplified if monthly liability for RWT is less than $5000. This could be done by requiring that RWT be paid covering 6 monthly periods to 30 September and 31 March. Decline. This is outside the ambi t of the bill and is potentially a substantive matter. In the context of this bill there is insufficient time to consider this. 16. Threshold for liability to deduct RWT 6 – Corporate Taxpayers Group The threshold under which there is no liability to deduct RWT should be increased from $5000 to $100,000 of interest per year. Decline. This is outside the ambi t of the bill and is potentially a substantive matter. In the context of this bill there is insufficient time to consider this. 17. Operational review 6 – Corporate Taxpayers Group An op erational review of RWT collection mechanism should be undertaken. Note. This is likely to be considered as part of Inland Revenue’s work to modernise the tax administration. Portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules Clause 49(10) 18. Rate alignment 6 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 9 – Investment Savings & Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 10 – KPMG, 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 7 – Barry Preddle The submitters support the alignment of PIE rates with personal marginal tax rates. Note. 31 No Issue Submitter Submission Offici als’ recommendation and comment 19. 19.5% rate 4 – Retirement Policy and Research Centre – University of Auckland The submitter supports removing the 19.5% PIE rate, because 19.5% was the correct rate only for taxpayers earning under $38,000 with only investment income. Note. 20. Trusts: prescribed investor rate 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants Trusts should be able to elect a rate of 12.5% or 21%. Accept in part. Trustees should be able to elect 21%. The 12.5% rate should be available only where the minor beneficiary rules do not apply because of the testamentary trust exception in section HC 37, given that the 12.5% rate is inappropriate for the majority of trusts given the minor beneficiary rules. 21. Transitional rule for prescribed investor rate (PIR) 9 – Investment Savings & Insurance Associations of NZ Inc, 6 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 10 – KPMG The drafting of the transitional rule for investors currently using the 19.5% PIR should be amended to achieve the intended policy. This clause can currently be interpreted to mean that a person who has elected 19.5% prior to 1 April 2010 will always be entitled to elect the 21% rate. Accept. The intention of this prov ision to ensure that the rate for an individual who elects a 19.5% rate before 1 April 2010 will change to 21% on 1 April 2010. It is not intended to override other rules that determine when the 30% rate must be used. 22. Prescribed investor rate 11 – Ernst & Young Paragraphs (b), (c) and (e) of the “prescribed investor rate” definition should be clarified. This is a drafting point to be considered. 23. Prescribed investor rate 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 10 – KPMG The re-drafted definition of “prescribed investor rate” should specify a 30% rate for non-resident investors. Accept. 24. Prescribed investor rate 6 – Corporate Taxpayers Group For consistency, prescribed investor rates should be included in schedule 1, as with RWT rates and other rates, instead of in the substantive legislation. Decline. 25. Extension of time from 2 to 4 years to become a portfolio listed company 1 – Deloitte Companies that elect to become a portfolio listed company have two years from the date of election to list on a recognised exchange. The period should be extended by a further two years. Accept. 26. Application date of PIE tax rate changes 10 – KPMG The application date of the PIE tax rate changes should be changed to income years beginning on or after 1 April 2010, not the 2010-11 income year. Accept. 32 No Issue Submitter Submission Offici als’ recommendation and comment 27. Application date of PIE tax rate changes 10 – KPMG The NZ dollar hedging arrangements in respect of FDR equities should be excluded from the scope of the financial arrangements rules. Decline. This is outside the ambi t of the bill and is potentially a substantive matter. In the context of this bill there is insufficient time to consider this. 28. Remedial matters 10 – KPMG A number of minor technical amendments to the PIE rules should be made to ensure that they achieve their policy intent. Accept. The submitter raises a nu mber of useful minor drafting points that officials consider sh ould be incorporated into the current PIE rules to ensure they achieve their intended effect. Retirement Scheme Contri bution Tax (RSCT) Clauses 49(12), 51(2) and 61 29. Alignment of RSCT rates 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants The submitter supports the alignment of the Retirement Scheme Contribution Tax (RSCT) with personal marginal tax rates. Note. RWT on taxable Maori authority distributions 30. RWT on taxable Maori authority distributions 8 – PricewaterhouseCoopers RWT on taxable Maori authority distributions should be amended to reflect the new personal tax rate structure. In particular, the current 19.5% rate that applies to taxable distributions made by a Maori authority that do not meet the requirements for the 39% rate should be reduced to 12.5%. The existing 39% rate which applies where a Maori authority does not have the tax file number of the recipient and the distributions are more than $200 should be reduced to 38%. Accept in part. The existing 39% default rate should be reduced to 38% to reflect the highest marginal tax rate, which has now reduced from 39% to 38%. However, with respect to the 19.5 % rate, officials believe that the appropriate RWT rate will depend on whether a change is made to the tax rate for Maori authorities, which is currently 19.5%. This is a matter that requires further consideration. Secondary codes Clauses 52(1), 58, 59 and 62(1) 31. New 12.5% secondary code 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants The submitter supports the introduction of a 12.5% secondary tax code. Note. 32. Operation of secondary code rules 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants Clause 43(3) and (4) should be clarified to ensure that they achieve the policy intent. Decline. Clause 43(3) and (4) is not related to the introduction of the 12.5% secondary code. The purpose of this provision is to more accurately tax extra pays earned in a job where a secondary tax code is used. 33 No Issue Submitter Submission Offici als’ recommendation and comment Personal tax summaries (PTSs) Clauses 62 and 64 33. Requirement to file 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants The submitter supports the proposal that when a taxpayer has secondary employment tax deducted at the correct rate, the taxpayer does not need to file a tax return. Note. However, this is generally the situation under existing law. 34. Consequential amendment for WfF spouses Officials’ submission The Tax Administration Act 1994 should be consequentially amended to ensure that spouses of Working for Families ( WfF) recipients are not automatically sent PTSs. Accept. 35. Consequential amendment for student loan borrowers Officials’ submission The Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 should be consequentially amended to ensure that a PTS is not automatically issued when a student loan assessment is issued to a borrower. Accept. This is a consequential drafting amendment related to the policy discussion on pages 10-11. Extra pays Clauses 43 and 52(2) 36. 12.5% rate 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants The submitter supports the proposal to make a 12.5% rate available for extra pays. Note. 37. Extra pays where secondary tax code used 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants The submitter supports the new rule to tax extra pays in a job where a secondary tax code is used. Note. 38. Election of 21% rate 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants The submitter supports the new option for an employee to elect a 21% rate for extra pays. Note. 39. Extra pays: Election of 21% rate 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants The legislation does not s eem to achieve the policy intent to allow employees to elect a 21% rate for extra pays. Decline. This change is simply a consequential of existing policy, which allows individuals to elect a rate for extra pays so long as it is not the lowest rate. 34 No Issue Submitter Submission Offici als’ recommendation and comment Minor errors in returns Clause 66 40. Minor errors in returns 10 – KPMG, 11 – Ernst & Young, 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants The proposed threshold for errors should not rely on the Commissioner’s discretion; errors within the threshold should automatically qualify to be corrected in the next return. Note. However, it is currently anticipated that Inland Revenue will release a standard practice statement after enactment to clarify when the Commissioner will exercise his discretion. 41. Minor errors in returns 11 – Ernst & Young Draft section 113A(2) is in sufficient because it only refers to returns of income, whereas s113A(1)(a) refers to liability for income tax, FBT and GST. Accept. 42. Minor errors in returns 8 – PricewaterhouseCoopers The discretion should apply to all tax types and not be limited to income tax, GST and FBT. Decline. Officials consider that the proposed changes will effectively target the vast majority of tax payable (and, therefore, errors made) by taxpayers, and SMEs in particular. To increase the scope of this provision to all taxes is likely to increase the compliance cost of administration for the Commissioner, without sufficient corresponding benefit to the majority of taxpayers. RWT and intermediaries Clauses 44, 48 and 81 43. RWT and intermediaries 9 – Investment Savings & Insurance Associations of NZ Inc, 11 – Ernst & Young Additional amendments are required to ensure that the taxpayers are also deemed to be deriving resident passive income in order to be able to claim the relevant tax credits. Accept. Officials agree that th e amendment proposed for section RE 10B should clarify that the distribution is treated as resident passive income for the purpose of the provisions listed in draft RE 10B(2)(a). 44. RWT and intermediaries 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants The amendments should clar ify the application of the tax credit and the RWT rules for intermediaries or agents acting on behalf of New Zealand residents with foreign investment fund (FIF) interests. Accept. 35 No Issue Submitter Submission Offici als’ recommendation and comment Electronic communication Clause 57 45. Electronic communication 8 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 10 – KPMG, 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants Inland Revenue should communicate with taxpayers electronically. (PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG) Inland Revenue should be allowed to communicate electronically with taxp ayers for all purposes. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Note. Officials are working on identifying and removing legislative and operational barriers to communicating electronically with taxpayers as part of Transform Inland Revenue. 46. Guidelines for electronic communication 8 – PricewaterhouseCoopers Inland Revenue should provide guidelines on how the proposed change to communicate with taxpayers electronically will work in practice. Inland Revenue should consider the following practical matters: • how taxpayers will be notified that they will receive electronic communi cations from Inland Revenue; • what information/documents will be communicated electronically; • how Inland Revenue will ensure that it has the correct email address to communicate with a taxpayer. Inland Revenue could include an extra line on the income tax return form for taxpayers to confirm or correct their email address; • how this change will apply to matters subject to statutory deadlines. Accept, subject to officials’ comments. As part of Transform IR, Inland Revenue is looking at ways to increase and standardise electronic communications with taxpayers and tax agents. This will include consideration of the operational issues raised by the submitter. Officials will consider how taxpaye rs will be notified that they will receive electronic communicati ons from Inland Revenue, and what information and documents will be communicated electronically on an i ssue-by-issue basis. Inland Revenue is also looking at how to obtain taxpayers’ correct email addresses, and will also need to consider to what extent this change should apply to matters subject to statutory deadlines. Officials will also consider whether it is appropriate to publish guidelines on electronic communication on these matters, and what form such guidelines should take. 47. Consistency of electronic communication 10 – KPMG There should be st andard criteria for communicating with taxpayers electronically which are consistently applied by all areas of Inland Revenue. Note. As Inland Revenue intends to deliver as many services as possible via electronic means in th e future, officials agree that, long-term, electronic communication should be applied consistently across Inland Revenu e. However, in the transition period before this occurs, there will be some areas where electronic communications have not yet been fully implemented. 36 No Issue Submitter Submission Offici als’ recommendation and comment 48. Designated email address 11 – Ernst & Young Organisations should be able to agree what the designated email address s hould be and to provide a back-up email address. This is because it is possible that if a person in an organisation does not open their email (because they are ill for example), no-one else may be able to access that email. Therefore consent should still be required for non-individuals. Note. The proposed rule will allow organisations to agree what the designated email address should be and to provide a back-up email address. This is because where a taxpayer has specifically instructed Inland Revenue to use a particular email address, Inland Revenue would not, in general, have reasonable grounds to believe that the taxpayer will recei ve communications if Inland Revenue uses a different email address. Permanent Forestry Sink Initiative (PFSI) Clauses 49, 54, 82 and 83 49. Permanent Forestry Sink Initiative 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants The submitter supports the amendment which makes it clear that expenses incurred by a person deriving PFSI emission units are treated as forestry business expenses. Note. 50. Permanent Forestry Sink Initiative Officials’ submission PFSI foresters should also be eligible to use the income equalisation account mechanism. Accept. Tax recovery Clauses 56 and 68 51. Tax recovery 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants The submitter does not oppose the amendment, but notes that is not approp riate for New Zealand to collect tax for other jurisdictions where objection rights have not expired. Note. Timing of beneficiary income Clause 18 52. Beneficiary income 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 8 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 10 – KPMG 11 – Ernst & Young The submitters support the extension of the time period within which income may be beneficiary income. Note. 53. Beneficiary income 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 10 – KPMG Trusts should be able to elect income as trustee or beneficiary income. Decline. The present system is well understood and works. 37 No Issue Submitter Submission Offici als’ recommendation and comment 54. Beneficiary income 8 – PricewaterhouseCoopers The Commissioner of Inland Revenue should grant an extension of time for the filing of the beneficiary’s income tax return when problems arise for beneficiaries to file their income tax return by the due date. Note. This is a pre-existing probl em that, in practice, does not seem to be causing issues. 55. Beneficiary income 11 – Ernst & Young The issue of how allocated, attributed or notional taxable income derived through trusts can be treated for income tax purposes should be clarified in the income tax legislation. Decline. This is outside the ambi t of the bill and is potentially a substantive matter. In the context of this bill there is insufficient time to consider this. GST waste disposal Clause 71 56. GST waste disposal 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants The submitters support the clarification of this levy as subject to GST. Note. Cost of timber Clauses 11, 49, 77 and 81 57. Cost of timber 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 11 – Ernst & Young The removal of the generally accepted accounting practice (GAAP) requirement should be reconsidered. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The submitter agrees with removing the references to GAAP. (Ernst and Young) Decline New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants’ recommendation on the basis that if GAAP must be satisfied for a person to be allowed this deduction, a person who is not required to satisfy GAAP would be denied a deduction. Note the submission from Ernst and Young. 58. Cost of timber 11 – Ernst & Young There is no need to change the Income Tax Act 2004 as well as the Income Tax Act 2007. Decline. The international fina ncial reporting standards (IFRS) changes apply, at their earliest, fr om 1 Jan 2005 and at their latest, to balance dates falling on or after 1 January 2007. The 2004 Act requires amendment to validate the deduction for taxpayers complying with IFRS. 59. Cost of timber 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 11 – Ernst & Young The definition “cost of timber” should not be replaced with “expenditure relating to disposal of timber”. Accept, subject to officials’ comments. Officials consider the term “cost of timber” should explicitly exclude provisions for future expenditure (for example, provisions for environmental restoration expe nditure), but note this can be addressed in the definitions so that the term can be retained in the 38 No Issue Submitter Submission Offici als’ recommendation and comment text of the provisions. Officials also recommend that the definition of “cost of timber” clarify that it applies to certain expenditures incurred up to the time of harvest. Research & Development and generally a ccepted accounting principles (GAAPs) Clause 74 60. R&D and GAAPs 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants The reference to paragraphs of International Accounting Standard 38 should be to paragraphs 54 to 67. Accept. Associated person (AP) defi nition in GST for charities Clause 70 61. AP definition in GST for charities 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants The proposed amendment may sanction charitable bodies making distributions outside of their charitable purposes. Decline. Officials do not cons ider that the proposed amendment would appear to sanction charitable bodies making distributions outside their charitable purposes. In both cases, the amendments require that the supply is made in, or enables, the carrying out of the charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes. 62. AP definition in GST for charities 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants The amendments should be expanded to section 2A(1)(g) to similarly not associate a trustee and a settlor of a trust where the settlor is a charity or non-profit body. Decline. Officials have not been presented with any evidence that the current treatment of a supply from a settlor to a trustee, where the settlor is a charity or non-profit body, may cause any problems in practice. 63. AP definition in GST for charities 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants In the future, there should be a review of the GST associated persons rules in conjunction with the draft income tax legislation in the area of associated persons. Decline. The GST associated pe rsons rules were reformed in 2000 and are considered appropriate for GST purposes. Binding rulings Clause 65 64. Binding rulings 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants The submitter supports the amendment to allow Inland Revenue to issue a binding ruling in relation to the Income Tax Act 2004 despite having received the application for the ruling after the beginning of the 2008-09 income year. Note. 39 No Issue Submitter Submission Offici als’ recommendation and comment 65. Binding rulings 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants An amendment should be made to provide similar treatment for rulings applied for after 1 April 2005 on an arrangement entered into before the commencement of the In come Tax Act 2004. Accept. Attribution rule and company intermediaries 66. Attribution rule and company intermediaries 6 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants The current wording of section GB 27(4)(a) should be broadened in order to achieve the policy objective of relief applying when the company’s only activity was the one from which the income has been attributed. Note. This is outside the ambit of the bill and is potentially a substantive matter. In the context of this bill there is insufficient time to consider this Rewrite: Timing of ICA debits – loss of shareholder continuity Clauses 41 and 53 67. Timing of ICA debits – loss of shareholder continuity 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 6 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 11 – Ernst & Young The provisions for imputation credit continuity should be restored to those in the 2004 Act. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The changes proposed in clause 41 and clause 53(3) of the bill should be deleted and replaced by amendments to each of the relevant sections in the ITA 2007 so as to refer to the time at which shareholder continuity is lost rather than to the day or the start of the day or on which shareholder continuity is lost. (Ernst & Young) The timing of the debit for loss of continuity should revert to the Income Tax Act 2004 treatment. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Accept. Officials agree with Ne w Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants and Corporate Taxpayers Group that recent case law has rendered the original rationale for the rewrite drafting changes redundant. As the Commissioner has decided not to appeal the decision of the High Court in CIR v Albany Food Warehouse Ltd , CIV-2008-485-1444, Wellington Registry, the 2004 Act approach should be restored. 40 No Issue Submitter Submission Offici als’ recommendation and comment 68. Timing of ICA debits – loss of shareholder continuity 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 10 – KPMG If a timing rule is desired for a continuity breach it should apply at the end of the day (continuity is lost) rather than the start of the day (continuity is lost). (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The debit to the imputation credit account should arise at the end of the day on which shareholder continuity is lost for any of the balance at the end of the previous day which is unused during the day (continuity is lost). (KMPG) Note. Accepting the submissions to restore the effect of the 2004 Act provisions makes these submissions redundant (see recommendation 67 above). 69. Timing of ICA debits – loss of shareholder continuity 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 2 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts If the timing rule is retained as drafted, section OB 41(3) (and other similar memorandum account rules) should be amended retrospec tively to clarify that the time of the imputation deb it arising from a breach of shareholder continuity is the beginning of the day of loss of shareholder continuity. This would clarify the relationship between the proposed amendments to schedule 51 and the substantive provisions. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Rather than only including a clarification reference in schedule 51, the 2007 Act debit date provisions themselves should also be amended from the date of Royal assent of the Taxation (Consequential Rate Alignment and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 to provide that the debit arises at the beginning of the day on which shareholder continuity is lost. (Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Note. Accepting the submissions to restore the effect of the 2004 Act provisions makes these submissions redundant (see recommendation 67 above). 70. Timing of ICA debits – loss of shareholder continuity 2 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts Section OZ 18(3) should be amended to follow the wording used in the 2004 Act and therefore it should read: ‘The debit arises at the time at which shareholder continuity is lost’ Note. Accepting the submissions to restore the effect of the 2004 Act provisions makes these submissions redundant (see recommendation 67 above). 41 No Issue Submitter Submission Offici als’ recommendation and comment Rewrite: Meaning of settlor for certai n employee shareholder purchase schemes Clauses 19, 20, and 53 71. Meaning of settlor for certain employee shareholder purchase schemes 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants The amendments are unnecessary as there is a presumption against double taxation when income is derived by a trustee in their representative fiduciary capacity ( C of T v Luttrell \[1949\] NZLR 823 ). Decline. A benefit from a share pu rchase agreement is treated as income from employment for inco me tax purposes, not as a distribution from a trust. Further, as set out in a TIB item (TIB Vol 1/5, Trusts – appendix), the effect of the Luttrell decision has been expressly overridden in rela tion to certain distributions from non-complying trusts and foreign trusts. 72. Meaning of settlor for certain employee shareholder purchase schemes 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 11 – Ernst & Young The provision should apply to employee share purchase schemes which do not give rise to an assessable benefit. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The term “employee share purchase scheme” should be defined or the paragraph HC 27(3B)(b) should be deleted. (Ernst & Young) Accept. Officials agree that it is unnecessary for the proposed provision (section HC 27(3B)) to apply to a share purchase scheme that does not give rise to an assessable benefit. 73. Meaning of settlor for certain employee shareholder purchase schemes 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants There is a potential timi ng difference between the year in which a trustee is deemed to have income from a deductible settlement and the year in which the benefit may arise. This should be fixed as it means income is not harmonised to the extent it arises in the same income year. Decline. The timing difference be tween the income of the trustee and the employee’s benefit being income is irrelevant. The purpose of this rule is to prevent double taxation where a deductible settlement by the employer gives rise to both income of the trustee (section HC 7(3)) and income from employment (section CE 1(d)). 74. Meaning of settlor for certain employee shareholder purchase schemes 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants The income derived under section CE 1(d) is not likely to be equal as the proposed section HC 27(3B)(b) implies and this should be remedied. Accept. Officials agree that it is not necessary for the income of the employee to be equal to the deductible payment, but the income should be limited to (cannot exceed) the amount of the deductible payment of the employer. 75. Meaning of settlor for certain employee shareholder purchase schemes 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants The proposed provisions of sections HC 27(3B)(b) and (c)(ii) are in conflict as income does not arise under section CE 1(d) when a share purchase scheme is approved under section DC 12. This should be remedied. Accept. 42 No Issue Submitter Submission Offici als’ recommendation and comment 76. Meaning of settlor for certain employee shareholder purchase schemes 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants Clause 19(2)(a) should refer to the period from 2 October 2007 if the intention is to refer to a day that is the first day of the 2008-09 income year. Accept. Rewrite 77. Dividend under dividend stripping rules Clause 53 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants The savings provisions should refer to 2 October 2007. Accept. 78. Natural resources and non-resident withholding tax Clause 47 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants The amendment should appl y to section RF 2(1)(b) by amending the definition of “royalty”. Decline. Officials disagree that the definition of “royalty” should be amended. Officials agree to review whether the drafting of the proposed RF 1(3) should provide a clearer relationship with other provisions in subpart RF. 79. Nominal settlements Clause 50 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants A person who makes a nominal settlement on a trust should not be treated as a nominee for the purposes of the Act. Decline. Officials consider that a person who is acting “at the request of another person” (old law), to settle a nominal amount on trust, is “acting on the other person’s behalf” (new definition of “nominee”). The amendment clarifies the point for the avoidance of doubt. 80. Election to use simplified method for determining income interests in a FIF Clauses 15 and 79 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants The grandparenting of existing provisions should be by reference to income years. Accept. 81. Capital gain amounts Clauses 5 and 73 5 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 11 – Ernst & Young The cross-references in the proposed amendments are incorrect and should be fixed. Accept in part. The amendment is intended to clarify that section CD 44(7)(c) overrides the effect of section CD 44(11). Officials agree with the submission of Ernst & Young, but do not agree that the amendment should refer to section CD 26 as submitted by New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants. Officials recommend that this submission be accepted to the extent that the submission is that the cross-references should refer to section CD 44(7)(c). 43 No Issue Submitter Submission Offici als’ recommendation and comment 82. Cross referencing in YA 1 Officials’ submission The cross references contained in the definitions of lease, lessor, and lessee in section YA 1 should be corrected. Accept. 83. Life insurance consequential Clause 37 9 – Investment Savings & Insurance Associations of New Zealand Inc The amendment to section IT 1 in this bill should be deleted because it is to be repealed by the life insurance tax provisions of the Taxation (International Tax, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Bill. Decline. The repeal of section IT 1 is to apply on or after 1 July 2010. The amendment in this bill will apply from the beginning of the 2008-09 income year, until the repeal takes effect. This ensures that the 2007 Act is corrected for the unintended change in law, to apply to periods falling before the repeal of section IT 1. Life insurance 84. Group life policies – employer sponsored group policies 9 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc, 12 – Sovereign Limited, Tower Limited and AXA New Zealand The transitional rules require life insurers to distinguish between employee members of an employer sponsor group scheme that joined before 1 July 2010 and those that joined after that date. A different tax treatment wo uld then apply to each group of employee members. The requirement to separately identify start dates for employee member is not practical or feasible for two reasons: • Difficulties in obtaining information from employers or scheme administrators; and • The costs incurred in obtaining that information is prohibitive contrasted to the tax benefit provided by the transitional rule. Accept in part. We recomm end the following solution: • Extend the scope of the grandparenting rules to cover lives insured after 1 July 2010 in limited situation when the policyholder is either an employer or union and the policy compulsorily covers employees and union members respectively and the premium is paid by the employer or union. • The grandparenting period be shortened to 3 years from 1 July 2010 (instead of the current 5-year). This reduced period of time is a trade-off for allowing lives to be taxed under the old rules after 1 July 2010 and ensures that there is limited fiscal impact. Submitters are comfortable with the suggested solution. 85. Group life policies – trade-union sponsored group policies 12 – Sovereign Limited, Tower Limited and AXA New Zealand A technical change is needed so that group life policies sold to trade unions to cover their members are covered by the grandparenting provisions. Accept. These policies are indis tinguishable from a compulsory workplace policy taken out by an employer. 44 No Issue Submitter Submission Offici als’ recommendation and comment 86. Group life master policies 9 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc To reduce costs, new lives insured on and after 1 July 2010 under a group life master policy should also be grand-parented. Decline. Accepting this submissi on would mean preferential tax treatment is given to individuals who voluntarily choose to be covered by workplace policies instead of taking out ordinary term cover themselves. 87. Meaning of “cannot be changed” and “guarantee” 9 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc Some life policies may contain features and benefits other than life cover. The current wording of the transitional rules implies that the premium for the whole policy must remain constant. Decline. The words “to the extent to which” in both sections EY 30(5) and EY 9 make it clear th at the transition rules apply to the life insurance component of the premium only. 88. Credit-card repayment insurance 9 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc Credit-card repayment insurance policies directly entered into between the life insurer and the card holder should be grandparented. Accept. There is no reason to differentiate between credit-card repayment insurance policies (when it is part of a life policy) based on the legal relationship with the policyholder. 89. Expense deductibility 9 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc Life insurers should have the option to not apply sections EY 16 and EY 19 to exclude fees from the calculation of policyholder base allowable deductions and shareholder base income when the quantum of those fees was determined on the basis that they would be outside the tax net. Decline. Some life insurance po licies provide life insurers with the ability, if they so choose, to alter the terms of the contract in the event of tax law changes. As such, the matter identified is a commercial issue between shareholders and policyholders. The suggestion would be excessively complex to legislate, comply with (and administer) if the ta xation and deductibility of amounts were determined by whether these amounts were to be assumed to be in the tax net or not. 90. Cover review period 9 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc If the amount of life insurance increases above the transition threshold of the greater of 10 percent of insurance cover and movement in the consumer price index, the grand-parenting for that policy ceases from the start of the relevant income year. The grandparenting for the policy should apply, at the option of the insurer, to that part of the relevant income year until when the cover increases. Decline. Introducing a choice of when grandparenting would cease in the circumstances outlined would increase complexity. 45 No Issue Submitter Submission Offici als’ recommendation and comment 91. Drafting matters 9 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc A number of drafting matters were identified (some in the form of questions) in connection with the new life insurance rules. Accept, subject to officials’ comme nts. In response to the matters raised: (a) The words “retained earnings” should be added to sections EY 17(2)(b)(i) and (ii) for clarity. (b) The term “policyholder unvested liabilities” can be defined. (c) Sections EY 18 and EY 22 require amendment to ignore net transfers. The other matters identified will be outlined in a Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) after the enactment of the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009. 92. Premium payback policies Matter raised by officials Premium payback policies (life policies which pay a portion of premiums back to policyholders who maintain their policies for a set minimum period) are not eligible for grandparenting. The nature of the policies also mean that they also fall within the definition of “savings product policies” and are required to return policyholder base income. Accept. Premium payback policie s should be covered by the grand parenting rules. These policies, where they do not give rise to policyholder income should also be clarified that they are not “savings product policy” as it implies the policyholder is receiving a savings return. Premium payback policies will be fully taxed under the shareholder base. 46 No Issue Submitter Submission Offici als’ recommendation and comment Miscellaneous technical issues 93. Charitable donation deduction limit Clause 76 11 – Ernst & Young Clause 76 of the bill should be removed. Removing the 5% limit in section DB 32(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004 in respect of charitable donations by companies with effect from 19 December 2007 should not be done. Decline. Clause 76 restores the 5% limit to section DB 32(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004 for charitable donations by companies with effect from 19 December 2007. We are also aware that some taxpayers have interpreted this application date to mean that removal of the 5% limit applies to gifts made in the 2007-2008 income year. Officials do not support this submission. The amendment to the Income Ta x Act 2004 was an oversight. The explanatory note and commentar y issued in respect of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Business Taxation, KiwiSaver, Remedial Matters) Bill 2007 clearly stated that it was intended that the removal of the 5% limit in section DB 32(3) would apply for the 2008-09 and later years. Furthermore, this amendment was part of a package of measures to enhance the tax incentives for charitable giving and all of the other measures have correctly applied from the 2008-09 income year. 94. International financial reporting standards (IFRS) Matter raised by officials A technical amendment is necessary to the definition of creditor workout to ensure that it applies to workouts which are effected either by the alteration of the terms of a trust deed governing financial arrangements or to the terms of financial arrangements. Accept. The proposed amendmen ts achieve the policy objective that all legally binding creditor workouts qualify for the tax treatment. 95. International financial reporting standards (IFRS) Matter raised by officials A technical amendment is necessary to the YTM method used for financial arrangements subject to a creditor workout where floating rate financial arrangements are involved. Accept. 96. “Relative” definition Matter raised by officials A minor techni cal amendment is necessary to ensure that the current definition of “relative” in the Income Tax Act that is used in the Securities Act 1978 continues to apply for the purposes of the Securities Act 1978. Accept. 47 No Issue Submitter Submission Offici als’ recommendation and comment 97. Telecommunicati ons exemption in controlled foreign company rules Matter raised by officials The exemption in paragraph EX 20B(11)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be widened to include the case where a person ow ns the network operator and holds the controlled foreign company indirectly (through another company or companies), and the exemption should be restri cted to cases where there is an effective voting interest of strictly more than 50%, rather than 50% or more. Accept. 98. Payroll giving remedials Matters raised by officials Two minor technical amendments are being made to the payroll-giving rules set out in the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Bill. Sections LD 6(3)(a) and LD 7(3)(a) should be amended to clarify their original intent. Section LD 4(7) should be amended to clarify the intended scope of the definition of “pay”. Accept. The proposed amendments clarify the scope of the new definition of “pay” for the purposes of payroll giving, and the consequences when a payroll donation tax credit is extinguished. Sections LD 6 and LD 7 are intend ed to clarify the consequences when a tax credit for payroll donations is extinguished. However, these sections contain provisions (sections LD 6(3)(a) and LD 7(3)(a)) that restore the payroll donation tax credit when the substantive provisions are intended to extinguish the credit. Section LD 4(7) contains the definition of “pay” for the purposes of the new payroll-giving rules. The definition was intended to ensure that payroll donations could only be made from the salary, wages or other similar amounts paid to an employee by their employer. However, this provision may lead some people to interpret it as allowing people wh o receive income-tested benefits to have payroll donations deducted from these amounts. 99. Remedial Clause 10 11 – Ernst & Young Numeral “1” should not be substituted for the word “one” in subsection DC 14(4). Decline. The use of the numeral “1” is consistent with the PCO and Inland Revenue drafting styles. 100. Remedial Clause 21 11 – Ernst & Young The proposal in clause 21(2) should refer to “a person”, or should expressly refer to Maori authorities as well as companies and trustees. Accept. Officials agree that it would be useful to ensure the language is consistent with that used in section LE 2. 48 No Issue Submitter Submission Offici als’ recommendation and comment 101. Remedial Clauses 22 and 23 11 – Ernst & Young Subsection IA 3(5) should continue to refer to subsections IA 6 and IA 7. Decline. Officials consider th at the amendment removes a cross- reference from section IA 3(5) that has no direct effect on section IA 3. If a company wishes to use the loss grouping provisions, section IA 3(2)(a) states the company mu st satisfy the requirements set out in section IC 5. Section IA 6 applies for the purposes of subpart IC, and in particular section IC 5, which in turn must be satisfied for section IA 3(2)(a) to apply. There is no other provision within section IA 6 that has any relationship with section IA 3. Officials consider it is unnecessary for section IA 3(5) to refer to section IA 7, as that effect is already given by section IA 2(5). This amendment removes unnecessary duplication. 102. Remedial Clause 29 11 – Ernst & Young The words “in relation to a CFC resident in the country in which the loss arose” should not be replaced by the words “from the country in which the CFC that has the net loss is resident”. Accept in part. Officials agree that the CFC an d FIF income/loss rules are statutory constructions, and do not look to attribute a source to such income or loss. However, the 2007 Act does not correctly reflect the outcome in the 2004 Act, and therefore some clarification is necessary Officials recommend that the subm ission be accepted to the extent that the Act does not attribute a “source” to CFC losses and FIF (BE) losses, and that the drafting be amended to clarify this. 103. Remedial Clause 46 11 – Ernst & Young The existing reference to “resident passive income” in paragraph RE 22(1)(a) should be retained or the section YA 1 definition of that term should be retained. Decline. This amendment restores the effect of section NF 5 of the 2004 Act, in response to a recommendation of the Rewrite Advisory Panel. The policy is that if the payer of the income has made reasonable enquiries and concluded that the recipient is a non-resident, the payer is not required to withhold RWT from the payment. This rule applies even if the recipient is a resident. The provision allows a defence for not withholding RWT on the basis of the “reasonable enquiries”. Offi cials consider that describing the amount to pay as resident withholding income suggests the payer should know the amount is subject to RWT, which is contrary to the intended policy.

petroleum mining 2 3 OVERVIEW The bill contains provisions that amend the tax treatment of petroleum mining. Provisions relating to deductions for expenditure on petroleum mining undertaken via a branch in another country look to ensure that New Zealand receives its proper share of benefit from New Zealand petroleum resources, by preventing foreign branch petroleum mining expenditure being offset against income in New Zealand. Other provisions look to remove disincentives that may affect investment in oil and gas exploration and development in New Zealand. Ten submissions were received on the amendments. Most supported the modernisation of the petroleum mining tax rules, but raised some concerns around the practical application of the new rules. Generally, submissions did not support the proposed ring-fencing amendment. 4 FOREIGN BRANCH RING-FENCING Clause 71 Submissions (5 – Lindsay McKay for Greymouth Petroleum, 16 – Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of NZ, 21 – New Zealand Oil and Gas, 32 – KPMG, 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The proposed rule ring-fencing deductions for petroleum mining expenditure incurred through a foreign branch should apply only to foreign branches of New Zealand- incorporated petroleum miners controlled by non-residents, or to those where the majority of their petroleum mining operations are done outside New Zealand. The provisions that ring-fence foreign branch losses discriminate against the petroleum industry because all other industries can offset foreign branch losses against New Zealand-sourced income. Comment The current petroleum mining rules allow an up-front deduction for exploration expenditure that is of a capital nature to encourage petroleum exploration and development in New Zealand. The primary reason why we do not support limiting the scope of the proposed amendment is to ensure that New Zealand receives its proper share of benefit from New Zealand petroleum resources. Given the substantial increase in oil production in recent times, the government considers it is critical to protect the New Zealand petroleum mining tax base. Petroleum mining generally involves large amounts of expenditure incurred by companies that operate in a number of countries. The reality is that these companies, by their very nature, have considerable flexibility over what jurisdiction they structure expenditure through. The costs of a significant foreign exploration or development project could eliminate a New Zealand petroleum miner’s tax liability on its New Zealand operations. This concern applies whether the company is owned by residents or non-residents. The submission that the scope of the current provision in the bill be limited to off- shore branches of New Zealand incorporated petroleum explorers controlled by non- residents is also problematic because it may run foul of the non-discrimination clauses in New Zealand’s double tax agreements. These generally prevent New Zealand applying more restrictive tax treatments to non-residents than to New Zealand residents. The current provision in the bill is in line with the practice in a number of other countries, such as the United Kingdom, which do not allow foreign petroleum mining expenditure to be offset against domestic petroleum mining income. 5 The current tax treatment of petroleum mining expenditure is arguably concessionary. The concern is that the concession is not working as intended because some New Zealand-resident companies are, in effect, gaining a significant subsidy from the New Zealand tax base for overseas petroleum exploration. Officials were alerted to taxpayers using foreign branches to shelter significant amounts of New Zealand petroleum mining income in late 2007. The proposed legislation merely ensures that the concession is available only for the exploration and development of New Zealand’s petroleum resources. Should similar concerns arise in other areas of offshore activity, officials would provide advice on ways of addressing these concerns. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Submission (5 – Lindsay McKay for Greymouth Petroleum) There should be no change to the law for off-shore branch operations of petroleum mining companies, especially when such a change compromises existing petroleum mining off-shore branch operations. Comment Legislative changes often preserve the existing tax treatment for expenditure already incurred. The proposal to ring-fence foreign branch expenditure applies only to expenditure incurred on or after 4 March 2008, therefore preserving the tax treatment for expenditure incurred before that date. However, while the law changes are technically prospective, they do affect the future tax position of petroleum miners who have entered into arrangements involving future expenditure. In this case, the changes defer deductions for the costs of future foreign petroleum mining exploration and development until foreign petroleum income is returned. This treatment may be mitigated by grandparenting provisions, so the law does not apply to transactions already entered into before the proposed change to the law was announced/enacted. Businesses constantly have to deal with change, such as new competitors, products and services. Similarly, changes in tax law occur for many reasons, reflecting society’s changing view of equity, to counter the erosion of the tax base by aggressive tax behaviour, or to correct mistakes that are harmful to taxpayers. Officials recognise that changing the tax law is not a costless exercise and that costs must be justified. 6 For this reason, “grandparenting” is sometimes used to introduce changes to the tax system. Grandparenting is generally limited to transactions of a specific nature that are expected to be completed in a relatively short time after enactment. This is because there is a close similarity between the transaction completed just before enactment and one entered into but not completed until just after enactment. Giving the contracting parties certainty in allowing arrangements to be completed as contemplated by the parties helps to outweigh the costs (mainly fiscal) of not allowing these arrangements to be completed as contemplated. However, longer term arrangements, like obligations given under an exploration permit, tend to involve less certainty across a whole range of factors, including tax rules, than short-term transactions. For example, petroleum exploration tends to involve open-ended arrangements, where decisions about incurring exploration costs can occur many years after the date the arrangement was first entered and these costs may be very large. In such instances grandparenting is not appropriate because the costs (mainly fiscal) outweigh the objective of providing certainty. For these reasons we do not support grandparenting arrangements beyond expenditure incurred before 4 March 2008. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submissions (16 – Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of NZ, 32 – KPMG, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The submissions suggest a number of alternative proposals to address the government’s base maintenance concerns while being less problematic for taxpayers. They include: • denying deductions for foreign branch losses and expenditure with no tax on foreign branch income; or • limiting the application of the foreign branch ring-fencing rule to those companies where the majority of their petroleum mining operations (say 75 percent) are done outside of New Zealand, or limiting the rules to companies that are controlled by foreigners. Comment Given the immediacy of the risk to the petroleum mining revenue base and the expected timeframe for the review of the tax treatment of foreign branch active income, we consider that ring-fencing petroleum mining expenditure incurred outside New Zealand’s territorial waters is a discrete approach that targets the concern. 7 Provisions within the bill introduce changes to the tax treatment of controlled foreign companies. Under the current proposal, active foreign income will be exempt, and deductions will be excluded from the New Zealand base. Consideration is being given to apply a similar treatment to foreign branch active income. While this reform would in theory protect the New Zealand petroleum mining income base, it is not scheduled to apply until the 2010–11 income year at the earliest. A key concern to be resolved in the review of foreign branch active income relates to the allocation of income and expenditure to branches. We have previously discussed the problems with applying more restrictive tax rules on non-residents. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Submission (16 – Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of NZ, 21 – New Zealand Oil and Gas, 32 – KPMG) Allow an automatic entitlement to carry forward and reinstate any unallocated foreign branch deductions regardless of the normal shareholder continuity rules. One way to achieve this result would be to apply the amortisation rules that apply to research and development expenditure. Comment The government is concerned to ensure that tax losses of one person cannot be acquired by another person who happens to have taxable income. To prevent taxpayers trading losses, the current tax rules only allow deductions for expenditure and losses that are incurred by the taxpayer. The shareholder continuity rules set the bounds for determining changes in shareholder interests. An exception to the general loss trading policy was implemented for research and development expenditure, because the policy was problematic for the growth cycle of high technology companies. These companies typically have a long lead-in period where significant expenditure is incurred before any income is realised. It is part of the normal financing process for such companies for additional equity investors to come in after the initial development work has been successful. If tax deductions for this development work cannot be used because of shareholding changes, this can effectively result in technology companies being taxed on their gross income. The government previously decided to defer extending the current tax treatment of research and development expenditure to petroleum mining. As such, any project on this matter needs to be considered in the context of the government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 8 Submission (68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Under the foreign branch ring-fence proposal, there is a risk that the investment will not produce sufficient petroleum mining income and give rise to a loss which will never be tax deductible. Comment The concern the submission raises can occur with rules designed to prevent the trading of losses. For example, a taxpayer goes out of business and has significant tax losses. While we share the concern that some losses may be stranded, the provisions in the bill try to minimise the risk of this occurring. Allowing foreign branch petroleum mining expenditure to be offset against any foreign petroleum mining income reduces the risk of stranded losses. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The reference to section IF 1 in new section DT 1A(4) is a 2004 Act reference and should be in the 2007 Act. Comment The reference to section IF 1 is correct. There are two versions of section DT 1A(4), one for the Income Tax Act 2004 and one for the Income Tax Act 2007. Both versions have the correct references. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 9 Submission (16 – Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of NZ, 35B – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Section DT 1A(2) should be amended by replacing “those operations” with the phrase “petroleum mining operation undertaken outside New Zealand”. This would clarify the basis of deductibility for petroleum mining expenditure incurred through a foreign branch. Comment The policy is to allow foreign branch petroleum mining losses to be offset against petroleum mining income from any country other than New Zealand. The provisions in the bill ring-fence foreign branch petroleum mining losses on this basis. The reference to “on a country by country basis” in the commentary does not reflect the government’s final policy. There is a discrepancy between section DT 1A(2) and the commentary on that section. Section DT 1A(2) would be clearer if the words “those operations” were replaced with the words “petroleum mining operation undertaken outside New Zealand”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Submission (16 – Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of NZ) It is not appropriate to ring-fence deductions for development expenditure and residual expenditure. Comment The government is keen to ensure that New Zealand receives its fair share of the benefits from petroleum mining operations in New Zealand. This is fully achieved under the current amendments. Excluding other types of petroleum mining expenditure makes no sense given the policy objective. Once the petroleum miner returns foreign petroleum mining income, the foreign petroleum mining deductions can be used. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 10 MODERNISING THE PETROLEUM MINING TAX RULES Issue: Allow another method for amortising development expenditure Submission (16 – Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of NZ) The bill should allow petroleum miners to adopt a diminishing value/double declining balance approach as a way of amortising development expenditure. This approach would be in addition to the current straight-line basis and the unit of production basis as contained in the bill. Comment Currently, development expenditure is amortised on a straight-line basis over seven years. The bill contains provisions that will allow petroleum miners to choose to amortise development expenditure on plant and equipment designed and constructed to operate for the life of the permit (called “petroleum mining assets”) on a unit of production basis or on the current straight-line basis. The diminishing value method is generally accepted as being the method that more accurately reflects, when compared with straight-line amortisation, the actual decline in value of an asset over its useful life. Therefore, it is an appropriate method of calculating depreciation deductions for capital expenditure that has a finite useful life. The unit of production method provides an even more accurate method. The unit of production method is a way of calculating depreciation deductions that uses a fixed cost per unit of production, based on an estimate of the total number of units the property will produce during its service life and the total cost of the asset. As each unit is produced, a deduction is allowed for the cost of that unit. Economically, the unit of production method is likely to be the most accurate way of amortising petroleum mining assets. In theory it would therefore be preferable to replace the straight-line method with the unit of production approach. Economically, we see no reason to allow petroleum miners to amortise the cost of petroleum mining assets on a diminishing value basis. The diminishing value basis is a proxy for the decline in value for a given useful life. Amortising development expenditure over seven years is a concession where the capital spent to develop the field lasts for 20 years. Allowing a greater proportion of the capital expenditure to be taken earlier on in the asset’s life is more concessionary. Given there is no strong economic case for allowing a double declining balance approach, we are of the view that allowing petroleum miners to amortise petroleum mining assets on this basis only increases tax compliance costs, as taxpayers will assess the tax results of each method and select the one that produces the most favourable result. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 11 Issue: Unit of production – formula Clause 93 Submission (16 – Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of NZ) Probable reserves should be replaced with proved reserves in the unit of production formula that allocates expenditure on petroleum mining assets. Comment The basic difference between “proved” and “probable” reserves lies in the level of certainty about the quantities of commercially recoverable oil and gas. Reserve estimates are based on information at a given date looking forward, from known reservoirs and under current economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Proved reserves have more than a 90 percent probability of recovery, while probable reserves have a greater than 50 percent probability of recovery. Because proved reserves estimates are lower than estimates of probable reserves, the amount of development expenditure deductible per unit of production will be greatest using proved reserves. So that tax does not interfere with investment decisions, it is important that amortisation rates accurately reflect an asset’s decline in value at the point at which the investment occurs. Overly generous rates encourage investment in what becomes a tax-preferred investment at the expense of other investment. Conversely, amortisation rates that are lower than the assets decline in value will discourage investment in what becomes a tax-disadvantaged investment. The question is whether oil companies’ investments are based upon proven or probable reserves estimates. We consider that investment decisions are most likely based on estimates of probable reserves for the following reasons. First, probable reserve estimates are regularly reviewed for both accounting and regulatory purposes, and are frequently used in petroleum mining company annual reports. In addition, the International Accounting Standards Board, the standard-setting body responsible for the development of International Financial Reporting Standards, considered in September 2008 the categories of reserves to be disclosed. While a final decision is still pending, the Board’s current view seems to support the categories of reserves to be disclosed for accounting purposes ought to be “proven and probable”, as this is the best estimate of the economically recoverable resources. This supports the use of probable reserves as the basis for the unit of production method. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 12 Issue: Unit of production method – previous deductions Submission (16 – Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of NZ) The definition of “previous deduction” should be amended as follows: “The total amount of petroleum development expenditure to which this section applies that has been allocated in an earlier income year.” Comment The submission is concerned that deductions for pre-1 April 2008 reserves expenditure will be counted twice. If this is not corrected, the amount of reserve expenditure to be allocated under the units of production method would be incorrect. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Unit of production method – application date Submission (16 – Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of NZ, 21 – New Zealand Oil and Gas, 28 – Australian Worldwide Limited, 32 – KPMG, 35B – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The unit of production method should apply to all expenditure and not just expenditure incurred on or after 1 April 2008. A number of submissions are also concerned that the unit of production method is not available for development expenditure incurred on or after 1 April 2008 in relation to a permit area where there has been commercial petroleum production. Comment While we agree to some extent with the points made in these submissions, officials have at least two concerns. First, officials are concerned that there are fiscal risks associated with the proposal. It is possible for a number of oil or gas reservoirs to co-exist within a single petroleum mining permit. Commercial practice suggests that where possible, development infrastructure will be used across a number of reservoirs to reduce production costs. By allowing different amortisation rules for development expenditure within the same permit area, petroleum miners would have incentives to elect the seven-year amortisation for some development expenditure – that is, when the seven-year period is concessionary, and to apply the unit of production method to shorter-lived development expenditure. Under this arrangement, a petroleum miner would have the 13 flexibility and the incentives to undertake arrangements that produce the greatest tax benefits. Allowing taxpayers the flexibility to undertake such arrangements would increase fiscal costs. Allowing a one-off election that applies to the whole permit area, in the year of first production, addresses this concern. The second concern relates to the compliance and administration costs associated with allowing petroleum miners to mix and match amortisation methods for development expenditure within the same permit area. Complex apportionment rules would be necessary to address concerns of accelerated deductions for longer-lived production assets, when these assets are used for both short-lived and longer-lived reserves. In addition, different calculations would need to be applied to development expenditure for the same petroleum mining development, depending on the amortisation method used. For these reasons, officials prefer to have development expenditure within a permit area amortised on either the seven-year method or the unit of production method. However, we are still working on these matters. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Aligning date of application with balance date Submission (16 – Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of NZ) The rules should apply to expenditure, incurred on or after 1 April 2008, from the start of the petroleum miner’s income year (2009) to minimise compliance costs. Comment The application date is drafted to apply to expenditure incurred on or after 1 April 2008. This submission would, if accepted, defer the ability of taxpayers to apply the unit of production amortisation until the start of a later tax year. The problem is that some taxpayers are less sensitive to compliance costs than others. For those taxpayers that are less sensitive to compliance costs, they may prefer an earlier application date and bear the additional compliance costs. On balance, we think that compliance costs arising from the application date are unlikely to be large and that most taxpayers would prefer the current application date. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 14 Issue: Date of application Submission (35B – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The words “on or” should be added before “after 1 April 2008”. As currently drafted, the proposed sections do not apply to expenditure incurred on 1 April 2008. Comment Officials agree with this submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Cap amortisation period Submission (16 – Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of NZ) Irrespective of the choice of amortisation method, petroleum miners should be able to write off any remaining reserve value in the seventh year. Comment There is no basis for this approach as the seven-year period is arbitrary. In addition, capping the amortisation period for development expenditure would become a concession, under the unit of production method, and would have an additional fiscal cost. Consequently, officials do not support this submission. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 15 Issue: Transitional sections Submission (16 – Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of NZ) A transition section is required for expenditure incurred before 1 April 2008 that has not yet been amortised. Comment The new sections apply to expenditure incurred on or after 1 April 2008. Officials will ensure that deductions can be taken for pre-1 April 2008 expenditure. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Dry well and depleted production wells Clause 95 Submission (16 – Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of NZ) The expenditure write-off provisions for dry and exhausted wells should apply from 1 April 2008, irrespective of the date when the expenditure was incurred. Comment The bill introduces a deduction for expenditure incurred on dry wells and the remaining book value of wells that stop producing, if the unit of production method is used. The provisions apply to expenditure incurred on or after 1 April 2008. Allowing these provisions to apply to expenditure incurred before 1 April 2008 would produce a windfall gain for petroleum miners that incurred development expenditure earlier than 1 April 2008. It would also add fiscal costs. Petroleum miners undertake investment on the basis of the relevant economic and regulatory environment. For the investment to have occurred, they would have considered that the risks and returns made commercial sense. Retrospectively altering the regulatory treatment of these sunken costs does nothing to alter investor behaviour. Instead, it produces windfall gains only for those who had investment before 1 April 2008. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 16 Submission (35B – PricewaterhouseCoopers) We support the proposal to allow a deduction for the cost of drilling a dry completed production well at the time the well is abandoned. However, this provision should be extended to apply also to wells which are only partly completed before being abandoned. Comment Officials agree with this submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Removing the onshore/offshore boundary Submission (68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Taxpayers have had to historically determine whether or not any horizontal drilling operations were onshore or offshore, to determine when they could start amortising any petroleum development expenditure. Where such filing positions have been undertaken previously, these taxpayers should be grandparented and not subject to Inland Revenue audit, as there seems little point in seeking to clarify whether a boundary exists, when it is proposed to be removed. Comment Taxpayers are often required to make judgements that can have an effect on the tax treatment of certain transactions. Normally, previous decisions are safe-harboured if there is ambiguity about what the law means. This is not the case here. The main concern that led to this provision was that horizontal drilling techniques meant that the current onshore/offshore boundary no longer served a policy purpose. For this reason we do not support the proposal. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 17 Issue: GST input deductions for restoration costs Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) An amendment to the Goods and Services Act 1985 should be made that allows input tax credits to be claimed on the costs of restoration associated with past taxable activities. Comment The Commissioner’s view of the law that raised the concerns that input deductions might not be allowed for restoration costs associated with past taxable activity is currently being reviewed. Officials are waiting for the outcome of this review before recommending possible changes to the Goods and Services Act 1985. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Extending section CW 57 Submission (27 – Origin Energy, 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The current exemption for income earned by a non-resident company for certain exploration and development activities in an off-shore permit area should be extended beyond 31 December 2009, as part of this bill. Comment The current exemption ends on 31 December 2009. The exemption was introduced as part of a package of measures designed to enhance security of gas supply in 2005. This issue is currently under active consideration by the government. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 18 Issue: Claw-back provisions for exploration well expenditure Submission (16 – Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of NZ) The current rules that recover deductions previously allowed for exploration well expenditure should be removed, because this treatment does not occur anywhere else in the tax legislation. Comment There is a distinction made between the treatment of exploration and development expenditures, where the former is treated as a revenue expense and the latter is treated as a capital expense. The current rules use a final purpose test to determine what type of expenditure has been incurred. This is to ensure that the boundary between exploration and production expenditure can be effectively policed. While it is very unlikely that an exploration well will be re-entered after it is sealed and abandoned, it is technically possible to re-enter a well. Without the claw-back provision, however, there would be an opportunity for petroleum miners to seal and abandon an exploration well, claim the expenditure as a deduction, and then reopen the well some time later. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 19 Changes to the tax pooling rules 20 21 OVERVIEW Provisional taxpayers don’t always know how much their tax liability will be for the year and therefore how much provisional tax to pay. If they get the calculation wrong, they are subject to two-way use-of-money interest on the under-payment or over-payment of their tax liability. Provisional tax pooling was introduced in April 2003 and allows compliant taxpayers to reduce their exposure to use-of-money interest on under-payments as a result of uncertainty about their provisional tax payments by purchasing funds from, or depositing funds with, a tax pooling intermediary. Tax pooling generally involves a taxpayer depositing money with a tax pooling intermediary. The deposit earns interest. The intermediary deposits that money in their pooling account with Inland Revenue. The taxpayer may use the funds (deposit) in the future to pay outstanding tax liabilities or sell the funds to the tax pooling intermediary. If the taxpayer sells the funds to the intermediary, the intermediary can sell the funds to another taxpayer for a fee. On payment of the fee, the intermediary transfers the funds to the other taxpayer’s income tax account as at the date that the money was deposited with the intermediary (usually this will coincide with the provisional tax due dates). Tax pooling enables provisional taxpayers to access money at lower interest rates than if they failed to pay provisional tax on the due date and were subject to use-of-money interest. It also enables taxpayers who have overpaid their tax to get a higher return, from selling the funds, than they would receive from Inland Revenue. The fundamental principle on which tax pooling is based is the reduction of interest in situations where the taxpayer is uncertain of the amount they are required to pay on the due date. If there is certainty of liability on the due date, the taxpayer is required to pay that amount and tax pooling is not available. There are other instances, apart from provisional tax, where a taxpayer is uncertain of their tax liability, namely additional tax payable as a result of a reassessment or a dispute with Inland Revenue. The bill introduces changes which extend the tax pooling regime to additional tax payable as a result of a reassessment (including voluntary disclosures and the resolution of a dispute) for all tax types. Seven submissions were received on the proposed amendments. Most submissions were generally supportive of the changes, with some concerns raised over the resolution of tax disputes. 22 PROVISIONAL TAX POOLING Clauses 405 and 406 Submissions (44 – Provisional Tax Finance, 45 – Tax Management New Zealand, 50 – Electronic Tax Exchange, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Provisional Tax Finance, Tax Management New Zealand, Electronic Tax Exchange, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, and the Corporate Taxpayers Group support the proposed changes in the bill to enable taxpayers to transfer their funds from one tax pooling intermediary to another while retaining the original deposit date of the funds. This provision is pivotal in creating competition in the tax pooling market and will clearly deliver benefits to taxpayers. Tax Management New Zealand has received strong support from their clients for the proposals in the bill to extend tax pooling to reassessments of all taxes. Provisional Tax Finance also supports the extension of the regime to reassessments of other tax types. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 23 TAX POOLING ACCOUNTS AND THEIR USE Issue: Time period to access tax pooling funds following a reassessment Clauses 405 and 407 Submission (12 – Chapman Tripp, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 45 – Tax Management New Zealand, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The bill extends the tax pooling rules to include the financing of additional tax payable as a result of a reassessment of tax (including voluntary disclosures) and the resolution of a dispute. The bill allows taxpayers 60 days from the date the Commissioner issued an amended assessment to access funds from a pooling intermediary. The 60-day period is adequate for reassessments of income tax but the submitters consider that the 60-day period does not adequately cater for situations when the taxpayer initiates dispute proceedings. The submitters recommend that for disputes, the 60-day period should begin from the date the dispute between the Commissioner and the taxpayer is resolved. Comment Officials agree that the legislation as drafted does not provide the right policy outcome in cases of dispute between the Commissioner and the taxpayer. In these situations there may be a significant amount of time (maybe even years) between when the Commissioner issues an amended assessment, which is then disputed by the taxpayer, and resolution of the dispute. Officials recommend that sections RP 17B(3)(v) and (5), be amended and a new provision inserted (section RP 17B(6)) to enable taxpayers who have resolved a dispute and owe additional tax to access funds from a tax pooling intermediary within 60 days from the date the dispute is resolved. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 24 Issue: Resolution of a tax dispute Clause 405 Submission (68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The tax pooling rules should be available for the settlement of any dispute, without restrictions. There can be instances when a dispute arises, but ultimately does not change an assessment. The benefit of tax pooling should be available in this instance. Currently taxpayers in this situation would have to pay the whole amount of the assessment up-front if they wanted to access tax pooling funds. Comment Tax pooling is only available to reduce exposure to use-of-money interest if there is uncertainty over the correct tax liability at the due date. Taxpayers can access tax pooling funds to pay the original income tax assessed if the funds are accessed within 60 days of the terminal tax due date. If the amount is subsequently disputed, there is no uncertainty over the original amount assessed. Uncertainty only arises over the amount of the altered assessment. Tax pooling will be available for an increased amount over and above the original assessment. Extending tax pooling to include the original assessed amount could have two results: taxpayers could dispute their assessment before the due date to defer the payment of tax to subsequently reduce their interest exposure by using pooling funds, or extend the tax pooling rules to cover regular payments of other taxes. Both of these results open the scheme up to non-compliance and are contrary to the original intent of the tax pooling rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 25 Issue: Extending the 60-day period Clause 405 Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The bill provides for a 60-day period within which a taxpayer can access funds from a tax pooling intermediary to pay additional tax resulting from a reassessment. The 60-day period is not an appropriate timeframe and should be extended in situations when the taxpayer does not have the immediate financial resources to settle the debt. Comment On the resolution of a dispute or issuing of a reassessment, the Commissioner allows a minimum of 30 days (usually 60 days) to make payment before imposing penalties. The taxpayer will usually know early on in the dispute what their maximum level of exposure is if they lose and have time to obtain finance. Also, disputes can take some time to resolve and therefore tax can be deferred for a significant length of time. An extension to the 60-day period simply postpones the payment of government revenue. Although allowing further time to arrange finance seems reasonable, it is difficult to distinguish between someone arranging finance and someone who is not complying and is waiting until the last moment to make payment. Also, the 60-day period for obtaining finance is consistent with the maximum time allowed by the Commissioner for payment following a reassessment. Officials recommend that the 60-day period not be extended. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 26 Issue: Widening the tax pooling rules to taxpayers other than provisional taxpayers Clause 405 Submissions (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 45 – Tax Management New Zealand, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposed section RP 17B(1) currently limits access to the tax pooling rules to provisional taxpayers. With the extension of the tax pooling rules to reassessments of all taxes, references in legislation to the scheme being available only to provisional taxpayers should be removed. This will also enable any person to deposit money into a tax pooling account, not just provisional taxpayers, and provide a source of funds for tax pooling intermediaries. Also, the wording of the proposed section RP 17B(2) should be amended to clarify that amounts held in a tax pooling account on behalf of a person may be refunded to the person or sold, or used to satisfy a person’s terminal tax or provisional tax liability or an increased amount resulting from a reassessment, voluntary disclosure, or resolution of a dispute. The current wording in the bill does not reflect the taxpayer’s right to have the funds refunded or transferred. Comment Officials agree with the suggested changes to sections RP 17B(1) and (2), which are consistent with the other changes in the bill. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted Issue: Extending tax pooling to GST and other tax payments Clause 405 Submission (44 – Provisional Tax Finance) The tax pooling rules should be amended to allow taxpayers to access tax pooling funds to pay other tax obligations such as GST. 27 Provisional Tax Finance has been overwhelmed with enquiries from taxpayers asking if tax pooling can be used for GST payments. They consider they can provide financing to businesses to fund GST payments for up to 60 days for around 12% to 13%. Extending the tax pooling rules to regular GST payments would help smaller businesses with their cash flow and therefore should be considered on economic stimulus grounds. The submitter also recommends that the tax pooling rules should be extended to regular GST payments. Provisional Tax Finance considers that access to pooling funds should only be available for up to 60 days after the GST due date. Comment The tax pooling rules were introduced to deal with taxpayers’ exposure to use-of- money interest if they are uncertain of their tax liability when they have to make a payment, such as provisional tax. The amendments in this bill extend the tax pooling rules to include other tax payments where uncertainty arises, such as a reassessment of tax or a dispute. The tax pooling rules were not intended to be used for payments when the quantum of a tax liability is known with certainty at the due date, such as regular GST payments. Extending the tax pooling rules to include regular payments of GST would open the rules up to abuse by non-compliant taxpayers. For example, taxpayers could deliberately not pay GST, knowing that if they are caught they could access tax pooling funds with a backdated effective date, at a significantly lower cost than paying the outstanding GST, penalties and interest cost to Inland Revenue. This would undermine both the penalties rules and voluntary compliance. Also, once the due date passes, it is difficult to distinguish between compliant taxpayers who are having financial difficulties and non-compliant taxpayers that are trying to reduce their exposure to penalties and interest. The proposal raised by Provisional Tax Finance is for tax pooling to be extended to regular GST payments. A taxpayer would apply to the pooling intermediary for pooling funds before the GST due date. The intermediary deposits the funds in the tax pool with Inland Revenue at the GST due date. If within the 60-day period the taxpayer pays the intermediary, the pooling intermediary transfers the funds from the tax pool to the taxpayer’s GST account with Inland Revenue at a backdated effective date – the GST due date. If the taxpayer does not pay the pooling intermediary within the 60-day period, the intermediary withdraws the money from the tax pool. Inland Revenue would then have to begin recovery action for the overdue amount. This is a risk-free transaction for the tax pooling intermediary. If a bank were to lend money to this taxpayer, the bank would bear the risk of non-payment. Under the proposal, the risk from non- payment is carried by the government. Also, Inland Revenue will be 60 days late in beginning recovery action and therefore have a lower chance of collection. 28 There are other options available to businesses that are having financial difficulties. They could approach a financier before the due date and obtain finance. Alternatively, businesses can enter into instalment arrangements with Inland Revenue before the due date and will only be subject to a 1% penalty plus use-of-money interest. Further, officials consider that Inland Revenue would not be in a position to implement the amendment proposed by Provisional Tax Finance this year in any event because of resourcing constraints and related systems pressures. Recommendation That the submission be declined Issue: Application date of tax pooling amendments Clause 406 Submission (50 – Electronic Tax Exchange, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) To enable the changes to the tax pooling rules to apply as soon as possible, the provisions should be separated from the rest of the bill and enacted separately. The changes in the bill provide for the transferring of tax pooling deposits between intermediaries. One of the main payments which taxpayers use tax pooling funds to finance is their terminal tax payment. Taxpayers have until the middle of June 2009 to access this finance through their intermediary. If the bill is enacted after mid-June, funds will not be available from some intermediaries to meet 2009 terminal tax payments. The main benefits from the provisions enabling transfer of money between intermediaries will be delayed until 2010. As the amendments to the tax pooling provisions are not contentious, they should be split out from the bill and enacted separately. Also, clause 406 of the bill provides for the transfer of pooling funds between tax pooling intermediaries, either at the taxpayers request or by mutual agreement between intermediaries. This clause comes into force on the date of assent of the Act. However, all the other clauses introducing changes to the tax pooling rules apply from 1 April 2009. The bill should be amended to enable the transfer of tax pooling funds to apply from 1 April 2009. (Electronic Tax Exchange) 29 The application date should be backdated, but to the date the bill was introduced. This would allow taxpayers to benefit from reduced use-of-money interest. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment The original expectation was that the bill would be enacted before 1 April 2009, and therefore the provision enabling the transfer of pooling funds between intermediaries would apply from date of assent, being before 1 April 2009. With the delay in enacting the bill, the date of assent will now be after 1 April 2009. There is no ability for the legislative provision which enables tax pooling funds to be transferred between intermediaries to be backdated to apply from 1 April 2008. To be effective, a transfer would need to occur under the existing legislation, which does not allow such transfers. As a result of the delays in enacting the bill, officials recommend that the application date for the tax pooling provisions be the date of assent of the legislation. The delays in enactment will reduce the time available for tax pooling intermediaries to attract new deposits for the 2009–10 tax year. Recommendation That the Committee agree to the tax pooling provision applying from the date of assent of the legislation as a result of the delays in enactment of the bill. Issue: Transfer of pooling funds by an intermediary to another intermediary Clauses 406 and 510 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Clause 406 allows a taxpayer to transfer funds from one tax pooling intermediary to another intermediary, while retaining the original effective date of the deposit. However, the provision does not provide for an intermediary to instigate the transfer of pooling funds between intermediaries. The transfer between intermediaries could apply when one of the intermediaries is beginning or ceasing business. This provision would foster competition among intermediaries and enable intermediaries to transfer their business to another intermediary if they wanted to cease business. The new provision should apply to all deposits held by an intermediary. 30 Also, where amounts are transferred between intermediaries, the amounts retain their original effective date, being the deposit date with the original intermediary. The effective date provision is currently contained in clause 510 of the bill. To make the pooling rules easier to understand, officials recommend that the effective date provision be included in clause 406 of the bill, which provides for transfers between intermediaries. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Ordering rule for the allocation of tax pooling funds Clause 407 Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The bill provides that where an amount is transferred from a tax pooling account and credited to a taxpayer’s account after the terminal tax date, the amount is applied first to any interest outstanding and the remainder applied to the principal. This provision should be omitted. Comment Where a taxpayer applies, within 60 days of the terminal tax date, to use tax pooling funds to pay their terminal tax liability, the funds are credited to the taxpayers account as at the terminal tax date and applied to the principal amount. Where the taxpayer applies to use tax pooling funds to satisfy a terminal tax liability outside the 60-day period, the taxpayer has not complied with the tax legislation and the funds are transferred at the date of payment. The taxpayer will therefore be liable for interest from the due date to the date of payment. When the penalties and interest legislation was introduced, consideration was given to how payments were to be applied to outstanding tax liabilities. The government of the day decided to apply payments to penalties and interest first, with any remainder applying to the principal tax amount. If payments were instead applied to the principal amount first, there would be an incentive not to pay the penalties and interest amounts, thereby reducing the cost to taxpayers of not complying with their obligations. The ordering rules relating to tax payments from a tax pooling account reflect the ordering rules for other tax payments. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 31 Issue: Commissioner’s notification Submission (Matter raised by officials) The current legislation requires the tax pooling intermediary to provide the Commissioner with details relating to deposits made with the intermediary. On receipt of this information, the Commissioner provides this information back to the intermediary. In practice, the Commissioner does not currently provide the details back to the intermediary. To do so would increase both compliance and administration costs, with no real gain. Officials propose to amend section RP 18(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007 to require simply that the Commissioner confirms receipt of details provided by the pooling intermediary, rather than provide the details back to the intermediary. Recommendation That the submission be accepted Issue: Transferring of funds between tax pooling intermediaries Clause 510 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The ability to transfer money between tax pooling intermediaries is currently contained in two Acts. The ability to transfer funds between tax pooling intermediaries is in the Income Tax Act and the effective date of the transfer is contained in the Tax Administration Act. Officials consider the provisions that apply to the transfer of funds between tax pooling intermediaries should be contained in one Act, the Income Tax Act and therefore recommend that clause 510 of the bill be amalgamated with clause 406. Recommendation That the submission be accepted 32 Issue: Interest paid on deposits in tax pooling accounts Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment is proposed to section 120OE(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to specify that interest is payable on deposits in a tax pooling intermediary’s account from the date of the deposit and ends on the date the amount is refunded or transferred. The current wording does not specify the end date for the calculation of the interest. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 33 Tax treatment of emissions trading units 34 35 OVERVIEW The changes provide for the income tax treatment of transactions under the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). The ETS was enacted by the Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008 (Emissions Trading Act). The purpose of the changes is to provide income tax rules which cover recognition of income and deductions, and timing and valuation rules for both forestry and non- forestry businesses. The income tax amendments made by the Emissions Trading Act to the Income Tax Act 2007 are replaced by these provisions. Submissions were received from four tax professional organisations. At a general level, one supported the approach being taken while another thought legislation should wait until the outcome of the review of the Emissions Trading Scheme is known. A number of submissions were made on technical issues around the application and operation of the provisions and officials have recommended that a number of these submissions be accepted. 36 GENERAL MATTERS Clauses 9, 45B, 48, 61, 81, 84, 85, 98, 186B, 187, 519 and 524 Issue: Support for amendments Submission (68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Corporate Taxpayers Group is generally supportive of the proposed legislative changes. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: The ETS tax provisions should be put on hold Submission (62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Given the review of the ETS by the Emissions Trading Scheme Review Select Committee, it may be preferable for the ETS tax provisions to be put on hold until the outcome of that review is known. Comment There are arguments both in favour of and against this submission. The principal supporting argument is that if an ETS is not proceeded with, this legislation will be unnecessary, and that if a substantially amended ETS is proceeded with, the legislation may require further amendment. The main argument against the submission is that there is a likelihood that an ETS will be proceeded with. If it is, much of what is in the legislation is general in nature, and will continue to apply to whatever form the ETS takes. Accordingly, proceeding with the legislation in its current form gives taxpayers some degree of certainty, which is especially important in light of the next sector entry date under the current ETS of 1 January 2010. Any amendments which become necessary at a later stage can be made by subsequent legislation. Also, it should be noted that the forestry part of the ETS already applies. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 37 Issue: Sale of free units which relate to a future year Submission (68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) If a non-forestry taxpayer sells free units in the current income year but those units relate to an emissions liability in a future year, the tax liability should be recognised in that future year, not the current year as the bill now provides. Comment The general objective in the tax treatment of emissions unit transactions is to have standard principles apply wherever possible, and provide specific rules only when the application of standard principles is unclear or gives an inappropriate result. The application of standard accrual accounting principles to the receipt of free units would, in all probability, require the income to be recognised either on an accruals basis when the entitlement to receive those units is known, or possibly at a later date when those units are actually received. The tax rules proposed in this bill recognise that the concept underlying the receipt of those units is to compensate for increased costs or emissions liabilities in the future, and so defer the recognition of income until those costs accrue. There is an exception to this rule when units are sold and the value of the units has not yet been recognised as described above – then, the income from their sale is recognised. As noted above, officials expect that for financial reporting purposes all of the income would be recognised at the point of sale. If, as accounting standards are developed, this turns out not to be the case, officials will revisit this issue. We do not agree with the submission that the recognition of this income should be deferred to a later year. Following sale of the units, the taxpayer has converted a near-cash asset into a cash asset, and it is entirely appropriate to recognise that income in the year in which it arises. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Reference to issue of free units Submission (Matter raised by officials) The tax provisions should be amended to be consistent with the process set out in the Climate Change Response Act 2002. 38 Comment A number of provisions use the expression “issue” to refer to the process by which a business receives a free allocation of units from government. However, the Climate Change Response Act 2002 describes the process as a “transfer” of emissions units. To avoid any confusion, the terminology used in tax provisions should be consistent with the Climate Change Response Act 2002. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Relationship between sections CX 51B and ED 1B is unclear Submission (62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Section CX 51B should be amended to make it clear that income which arises under the valuation rules in section ED 1B is not excluded income. Comment Section CX 51B provides that any income which arises from the receipt of free emissions units is excluded income. Section ED 1B establishes rules for the timing of recognition of income in relation to these free units (essentially, as the costs for which that free allocation is intended to compensate arises). The intention is that these two provisions work together to ensure that no income arises when the units are first issued, but income is recognised later, on an appropriate accrual basis. Following consideration, we recommend this issue be addressed by deleting section CX 51B and achieving the desired effect of no income arising on the issue of units by inserting a valuation rule which will initially value free units at nil. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, as described above. Issue: Revenue account treatment of free units Submission (68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) If, in the future, units are allocated on the basis of the diminution of the value of the taxpayer’s assets, those emissions units should be treated as being received on capital account. 39 Comment The bill treats all allocations of emissions units as being on revenue account except for allocations made to pre-1990 foresters. This is on the basis that allocations other than those made to pre-1990 foresters are made to compensate businesses for either their emissions liabilities, or the cost increases they face as a result of the introduction of the ETS (such as increased power prices). As noted, there is an exception for pre-1990 foresters. The allocation of units to foresters is to compensate for the fall in value of their land, rather than their potential emissions unit liability. Pre-1990 forestry is unusual in that allocations of units are made to businesses which only suffer an impact on the asset value, and cost increases only in relation to a capital transaction (deforestation is a fundamental change in the nature of the business and so would be on capital account under ordinary principles). Accordingly, this allocation of units is appropriately treated as being on capital account. This capital treatment extends to the purchase of further emissions units to satisfy a liability to surrender. If emission units are in the future allocated by reference to the impact of the ETS on asset values, then capital treatment should be considered. However, in most instances, allocation of units will be to businesses which suffer cost increases – for example, a business which owns an industrial plant which emits CO 2 and so gives rise to an emissions liability when surrendered. Cost increases will be on revenue account, and so treating the allocation of units as being on revenue account is appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be noted for future consideration if the government does issue units for dimunition of asset values. Issue: Cost of emissions units valued under section ED 1B(3)(a) Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The definition of “cost” should be modified to include the cost of emissions units valued under section ED 1B(3)(a). Comment Section ED 1B(3)(a) states that the cost of emissions units which are recognised as having accrued to the business is their market value at the end of the year. This feeds into section CB 36 correctly. However, “cost” is defined in section YA 1 without any cross-reference to the cost concepts in section ED 1B. 40 We agree this is potentially confusing. We propose that section ED 1B should instead define “value” for certain emissions units, and that section CB 36 and other sections where this issue arises refer to cost or value, for those emissions units for which a value is prescribed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, with the issue being addressed as described above. Issue: Surrender of emissions units valued under section ED 1B(3)(b) Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The surrender of a unit which is given a zero cost by section ED 1B(3)(b) will not give rise to any income. An amendment should be made to ensure that income does arise. Comment Section ED 1B(3)(b) provides that a unit which has been transferred by government to compensate for an emissions liability or increased cost which has not yet arisen has a market value of nil. As the submission points out, the current drafting of section CB 36 means that if such a unit was surrendered, its receipt would never be taxable. We agree that such a unit should be deemed to be disposed of for its market value when surrendered, and recommend that proposed section CB 36 be amended. We note that the same problem arises with section ED 1B(2)(a), which also values emissions units at zero. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Year-end valuation for free units Submission (68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Free units should be brought into account at an average value, rather than the emissions year-end value, to avoid any price spikes. Comment Free units received by non-forestry taxpayers are brought into account at the end of the year at which the relevant increased costs or emissions liability accrues. The value brought into account is the market value at the end of the relevant income year. 41 Because the market value used is the market value at the end of the income year, which will vary amongst different taxpayers, we do not think price spikes are as likely as the submission suggests. If any price spikes do occur, they are likely to be around the time emitters are required to surrender units to the government, which is not aligned to any income year (or the emissions year). The ability of New Zealand businesses to surrender emissions units purchased on the international markets, as well as New Zealand units should mean that price spikes do not arise – it is unlikely that the New Zealand surrender timetable will have any effect on international markets. Accordingly, we think the methodology currently proposed is robust. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Operation of section ED 1B Submission (62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Section ED 1B is complex and there are a number of concerns with it. These include: • confusion between the valuation of a single emissions unit and the valuation of a pool of emissions units; • the definitions in the formula are circular and contain reference to some terms which are not defined; and • the formula gives a negative result if some emissions have already been sold, which should not be the case. Comment Officials agree that this provision is complex. In relation to the specific matters raised: • We agree that there is one instance in which a singular concept is used rather than a plural one, and agree that this should be amended. • We agree that one expression is not defined, and this should be corrected. • We agree that the formula can produce a negative result when more units have been sold than need to be recognised as income, but disagree that this is the wrong outcome. The words preceding the formula state that any negative number is to be treated as zero. A zero result simply means that a sufficient number of units have already been brought into the income calculation by virtue of being sold, and no further units are required to be recognised at that time. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part. 42 Issue: Valuation of excess units held Submission (68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Taxpayers who hold units at year-end which have fallen in value since acquisition, should be able to value those units at the lower of cost or market value. Comment The valuation methodology currently provided for emission units which have been purchased is the cost basis. An alternative approach would have been to value these units at market value, which would allow taxpayers to take losses when values fall, but recognise increases when values rise (financial arrangements model). Because the majority of taxpayers will hold units for compliance purposes rather than speculative purposes, the decision was taken following consultation that for simplicity and compliance-cost purposes, a cost basis method of valuation should be used. We note that the submission requests that cost be written down to a lower market value, but there is no suggestion that if market value increases above cost, the increase be recognised as income. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Surrender of a post-1989 forest land unit to meet a pre-1990 forest liability Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Income ought to arise when a post-1989 forest land unit is surrendered to meet a pre- 1990 forest liability. Comment Post-1989 forestry is generally on revenue account, and pre-1990 forestry is generally on capital account. Forestry is also taxed on a cash basis. Units received in relation to post-1989 forestry give rise to a tax liability when they are sold. The current provisions would result in no income arising if post-1989 units were surrendered to meet a pre-1990 forestry liability. The same issue will arise if post- 1989 units are surrendered for any other liability. 43 This is inconsistent with the treatment of their sale, and we agree that amendment is required. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and the amendment apply to the surrender of a post- 1989 forest land unit in relation to any emissions liability which is not a post-1989 forest liability. Issue: Incorrect reference to “deforestation” in section CB 36(4) Submission (Matter raised by officials) This subsection refers to the liability to surrender emissions units on the “deforestation” of post-1989 forest land, but in fact the liability arises on harvest, fire, wind-throw or other carbon loss. A more general expression should be substituted. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Interest deductibility should be available for companies that derive exempt ETS income Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The general provisions dealing with interest deductibility should be amended to include companies that derive exempt income from the disposal of pre-1990 forest land units. Comment This issue arises because the sale of pre-1990 forestry units is treated by the proposed legislation as giving rise to exempt income – consistent with the general treatment of post-1990 forestry as being on capital account. Under existing general provisions, most companies are entitled to a deduction for interest paid regardless of the nature of their business or the underlying purpose of the borrowing. However, when a company derives exempt income, the interest deduction is available only when the exempt income falls into one of three specified categories. The disposal of pre-1990 forest land units is not one of those specified categories. 44 However, adding pre-1990 forestry to the specified categories for exempt income would not deal with the position of sole traders, who would still be denied a deduction for interest. We think the best way to resolve this issue is to instead treat the sale of emission units awarded in relation to pre-1990 forestry as giving rise to excluded, rather than exempt, income. There is no restriction on the deduction of interest expenditure by taxpayers that earn excluded income. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Deduction in relation to forest emissions liabilities Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The legislation should be amended to make it clear that taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for accrued emissions liabilities related to forests. Comment The intention of the legislation is that emissions transactions for foresters are dealt with on a cash basis, consistent with other forestry income and expenditure. Deductions should accrue to post-1989 foresters and pre-1990 foresters who hold the land on revenue account when they acquire replacement units or surrender units (or are implicitly given by the non-recognition of income from the award of free units). Deductions should not be recognised on an accrual basis in the way they are in the non-forestry sector, and we agree that there is value in making this clear in the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 45 Issue: Use of expression “paragraphs” may be confusing Submission (Matter raised by officials) The expression “paragraphs” in section ED 1(5B) should be clarified. Comment Section ED 1(5B) divides emissions units into different pools for valuation purposes. It states that emissions units may not be pooled with emissions units described in another paragraph. These paragraphs contain sub-paragraphs. There is a risk that some readers will not appreciate the difference between paragraphs and sub- paragraphs, and find the section confusing. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Eligibility for a deduction for emissions liability accruals should be set out in statute Submission (62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Officials have stated that a deduction for accruing liabilities will be available under existing law. However, it is not clear that this is the case, and the legislation should be amended to expressly provide for this deduction. Comment The submission correctly states that a deduction cannot be claimed for a provision, only for a liability which has economically accrued at balance date. In our view it is clear that a properly calculated amount for an emissions liability at the end of an income year is deductible, even when the requirement to surrender the relevant emissions units arises in a subsequent year. The liability arises under statute, and it is certain that it will arise. In CIR v Mitsubishi Motors Limited, the Privy Council upheld the taxpayer’s claim to deduct a provision for warranty defects, on the basis that the cars had already been sold with the latent warranty defects in them, and noted that at balance date those defects were an existing fact and not a future contingency. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 46 Issue: Method for calculating emissions liability accruals should be set out in legislation Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Officials have explained that the accrual calculation for an emissions liability for a non-forestry user will be calculated by reference to the cost of units on hand, the market value of units which have been awarded by government, and a reasonable estimate of the cost of units to be acquired post-balance date. This approach is a reasonable one but it is not set out anywhere in legislation, as it should be. Comment The method for valuing the accrued liabilities is in accordance with our understanding of standard accounting and tax practice. Our view is that further explicit guidance is unnecessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Identifying the cost of units held in excess of accrued liabilities Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The legislation should prescribe the valuation method to be applied when units are acquired in excess of those required to satisfy accrued liabilities. Comment The legislation provides that emissions units are to be valued using either first-in first- out or the weighted average cost method. Provided one of these methods is used in a consistent way across the taxpayer’s entire stock of emissions units, we do not see that any problem should arise. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 47 Issue: Application of anti-avoidance provisions Submission (62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Section GC 4B should be clarified to ensure that it is not applied when a market value is difficult to ascertain, or when fixed-price forward contracts are entered into by unrelated parties. Comment The proposed legislation defines emissions units as trading stock. This means that section GC 4B is no longer required, and the standard trading stock rule, section GC 1, can apply. Officials do not have any concerns around units having a value which is difficult to ascertain. It is likely that the New Zealand market will develop sufficiently for prices to be readily ascertainable. If it does not, then units which are internationally recognised will have readily ascertainable prices on world markets. New Zealand units can be valued by reference to equivalent Kyoto units. In any event, a price which is reached between unrelated parties and in the absence of any other circumstances influencing price will, by definition, be a market value. We also do not have any concerns around the use of forward contracts. If this was an issue, it would already be a known concern for forward contracts for shares, which are also trading stock for some taxpayers. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: “Replacement forest land emissions unit” definition – application to surrender Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition should be amended to make it clear that it does not apply when post- 1989 forest land emissions units are disposed of by surrender. Comment The purpose of the definition of replacement forest land emissions is to allow an immediate deduction where emissions units are purchased to replace post-1989 forestry units previously sold. The definition should not apply where units are purchased following the surrender of post-1989 forestry units, as it presently does. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 48 Issue: “Replacement forest land emissions unit” definition – application to certain pre-1990 forest land transactions Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The “replacement forest land emissions unit” definition should be extended to apply when pre-1990 forest land is held on revenue account. Comment The definition of “replacement forest land emissions unit” is part of the mechanism which ensures that a person who sells a post-1989 forest land unit (which will be taxable) and then purchases a replacement unit is entitled to a deduction for that subsequent purchase. This is consistent with the cash-basis treatment of forestry. While pre-1990 forestry land is generally considered to be on capital account, the legislation acknowledges that some pre-1990 forestry land could be on revenue account (such as when it is held by a land developer). The drafting in the bill presently ensures that a deduction will be available when the deforestation liability for pre-1990 land held on revenue account is met. No deduction is available when units which replace those previously sold are acquired. While this treatment differs from the cash basis treatment provided to post-1989 foresters, we think that this difference is appropriate as someone who holds pre-1990 forest land on revenue account is holding it for a non-forestry purpose, and so ought not to be entitled to use the cash basis. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Operation of “replacement forest land emissions unit” definition Submission (62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) The definition appears to allow a deduction to be available for a replacement forest land emissions unit only once all other units disposed of by the taxpayer have been replaced. It should be amended. Comment The definition is certainly not intended to have the meaning suggested by this submission. However, it does include some wording which may cause confusion and is probably unnecessary, so we agree that it should be amended. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 49 Issue: Certain definitions should be simplified Submission (62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, matter raised by officials) Certain definitions are complex in their construction and should be replaced with simpler cross-references to the Climate Change Response Act 2002. Comment The bill was introduced in July 2008 before enactment of the recent amendments to the Climate Change Response Act 2002 in September 2008. Because a bill cannot refer to another bill (as its enactment is uncertain), certain definitions had to be constructed in a way which did not refer to the proposed amendments to the Climate Change Response Act 2002, so are more complicated than now required. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Forestry income tax provisions introduced by the Emissions Trading Act Submission (Matter raised by officials) The amendments made by the Emissions Trading Act to the Income Tax Act 2007 are superseded by the amendments in the current bill, and should be repealed. Comment The Emissions Trading Act made amendments to the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007 dealing with the application of the ETS to the forestry sector. The provisions in the 2007 Act will be superseded by the provisions in the current bill, so those existing 2007 Act provisions should be repealed. This bill does not amend the 2004 Act, so those provisions ought to remain. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 50 GST MATTERS Issue: GST provisions contained in current bill Submission (53 – Ernst & Young) The provisions in the bill which address the GST treatment of transactions relating to emissions units should be deleted, as they appear to have been superseded by more comprehensive amendments enacted in the Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008. Comment The original intention was to enact the necessary amendments to the GST legislation in the current bill. However, a subsequent decision was made to enact the necessary GST amendments in the Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008, which was enacted in September 2008, to give taxpayers greater certainty. Officials agree that the GST provisions in the current bill are no longer required. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application of reverse charge provisions Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Either: • the legislation should make it clear that, if the reverse charge applies to a supply of emissions units, GST is charged at zero %; or • the reverse charge rules should not apply to a supply of emissions units. Comment The reverse charge rules apply to a small number of transactions involving imported services. If a non-New Zealand resident makes supplies to a New Zealand-resident, and the resident does not make at least 95 percent taxable supplies, the New Zealand resident is required to account for GST on the imported services as if they had made the supply, as well as receiving it. 51 This provision will clearly apply to the acquisition of emission units from non- residents by New Zealand-resident entities such as financial institutions, which typically do not meet the 95 percent taxable supply threshold. Officials do not agree with the submission that there is any uncertainty about either this or the application of the zero-rating provisions. It is clear that this transaction is zero-rated under the provisions previously introduced. This outcome is preferable to that sought under the submission’s second alternative, which is not to apply the reverse charge rules to emissions units. Recommendation That the submission be declined, noting that the objective sought is already achieved under current legislation. Issue: Application of section 5(6D) Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) That the legislation be amended to make it clear that section 5(6D) does not apply. Comment Section 5(6D) provides that when the Crown makes any payment “in the nature of a grant or subsidy”, that grant or subsidy is deemed to be consideration for a taxable supply made by the recipient of the grant or subsidy. This will apply to some situations when the government awards emissions units to businesses – such as the award of units to pre-1990 foresters or businesses in the industrial sector. These supplies are zero-rated under the amendments introduced in the Emissions Trading Act. Officials have considered whether the deeming provision ought to be “switched off”. This would be done by way of an Order in Council under section 5(6E), rather than by a legislative amendment. However, our view is that the better outcome is for this provision to continue to apply. This is because, consistent with the general approach to emissions transactions as an ordinary part of business, businesses which receive income in the form of emissions units should recognise that they are making taxable supplies in exchange for that income. Requiring these businesses to recognise that they have made taxable supplies will mean that the various supply-based thresholds, such as liability to register and the return periods, will apply. 52 A further consideration is that in some instances, it will not be clear whether businesses are making an actual supply, or a deemed supply under section 5(6D). Leaving section 5(6D) to apply means this question need not be addressed, thereby making compliance simpler. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: GST treatment of derivatives Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The zero-rating which is currently applied to emissions units transactions should also apply to derivatives of emissions units. Comment This matter was considered when the GST provisions dealing with emissions units were introduced. The submission makes the point that the EU experience shows that derivatives comprise a very large proportion of the carbon market. In due course, a derivatives market may also develop in New Zealand. The effect of the current law is that a derivative which could be satisfied by the delivery of an emissions unit would be standard-rated (not zero-rated as the submission suggests), whereas a derivative which could not be satisfied by delivery of an emissions unit would be an exempt financial service. This is the same as the treatment of any other derivative which relates to an underlying commodity (such as oil or aluminium) and we do not think that an exception is justified for derivatives relating to emissions units. In particular, several of the reasons for zero-rating emissions units do not apply to derivatives. At this stage, we are not aware of a significant market in derivatives having been established. If this does develop over time, we can consider this matter again. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 53 Issue: Application of GST provisions to legacy schemes Submission (Matter raised by officials) The existing GST zero-rating treatment of government allocation of emissions units under the ETS should be extended to government allocation of units under some of the other earlier schemes. Comment In addition to the transfer of emissions units to forestry and other businesses under the ETS, the government also transfers emissions units under three other arrangements – the Permanent Forest Sink Initiative (PFSI), Project to Reduce Emissions (PRE), and Negotiated Greenhouse Agreements (NGA). Of these three schemes, only the PFSI is still open to new participants (and had its first participant enter the scheme late last year). PRE and NGA have long since closed to new participants, although emissions units continue to be allocated under them. The current GST provisions do not apply either to the transfer of emissions units under these agreements, or any supplies made in exchange for those emissions units (such as the supply of the services of carbon capture). Accordingly, they are standard-rated, although any subsequent supply of units by the recipient of them will be zero-rated. This last aspect is important, because it means that a subsequent purchaser has no need to enquire into the original source of the units. Officials recommend that PRE and NGA arrangements remain standard-rated for GST. These arrangements were entered into at a time when it was clear that the supplies were to be standard-rated. Some of the contractual arrangements included specific reference to GST, and a binding ruling has since been issued on the GST treatment of PRE. We see no reason to upset these established arrangements by zero- rating these transactions. There is ambiguity in the current legislation under which certain transactions in emissions units involving the government are being zero-rated, although this was not the policy intention. Because of the nature of these transactions, there is no revenue loss, but in the interests of consistency this ambiguity should be clarified, with effect from the day on which this bill receives the Royal assent. However, officials recommend that PFSI transactions are zero-rated. There are two reasons for the distinction between PFSI and the other legacy schemes. First, PFSI covenants have been entered into only very recently, and will continue to be entered into in the future. So, participants’ understanding of the GST treatment is being developed now, rather than arising at a time when standard-rating was the only possibility. Secondly, some businesses which enter PFSI will also participate in forestry aspects of the ETS, which are zero-rated. It would be confusing for these forestry businesses to have different GST rules applying to their transactions with the government. 54 This amendment should also have effect from 1 January 2009. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 55 NON-KYOTO UNITS Issue: A deduction should be expressly provided for acquisition of non- Kyoto units Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) A deduction should be expressly provided for the acquisition of non-Kyoto units. Comment Legislation enacted previously, and contained in the current bill, is restricted to the tax treatment of emissions units which are recognised under the Kyoto Treaty or the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). Other emissions units exist which have essentially been created by non-government sources, which are not recognised under the Kyoto Treaty, and which are not eligible for surrender under the ETS. Our view is that because these units are not used in transactions with government, their tax treatment should be determined under ordinary tax rules. The questions raised in the submission (such as whether these units should be capitalised or deducted, depending on the circumstances) are entirely appropriate to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. It is not clear that deductibility is the right answer in all circumstances. However, if transactions in non-Kyoto units become significant in the future, consideration could be given to amending the law generally. This is something which should go through a proper consultation process. In the interim, we think that acceptance of the submission below will provide sufficient clarity. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Basic income tax concepts which apply to emissions units should be extended to non-Kyoto emissions units Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) ETS units will be treated for tax purposes as excepted financial arrangements and revenue account property which is not trading stock. These rules should be extended to non-Kyoto units. 56 Comment In the interests of certainty, bringing all types of emissions units within the trading stock and excepted financial arrangements rules is desirable. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: The GST rules which apply to Kyoto units should also apply to non-Kyoto units Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The zero-rating treatment that applies to Kyoto units should also be extended to apply to non-Kyoto units to ensure that the New Zealand market is attractive to foreign participants. Comment This matter was considered when the GST provisions dealing with emissions units were introduced. New Zealand has adopted a broad-based, low-rate approach to GST. This results in New Zealand’s GST being one of the most efficient value-added taxes anywhere in the world. Accordingly, the standard-rating model is deviated from only with very good reason. Zero-rating was justified for Kyoto units for the following reasons: • Transactions in Kyoto units will almost exclusively be business-to-business, so there is no revenue loss from zero-rating. • Transactions involving the government, where no consideration is paid, are unusual from a GST perspective and the risks of error are high. • Under current emissions projections, there will be a shortfall of units on the domestic market, which will require the import of units, some of which are likely to be acquired on international electronic markets. • It is important for price stability that New Zealand businesses can both buy and sell emissions units on international markets, as the domestic market, in early years in particular, will be thin. • The ability of New Zealand businesses to buy and sell emissions units simply and efficiently is key to the success of the ETS and New Zealand’s response to its Kyoto obligations. 57 While non-Kyoto units may be traded internationally, it is not clear that some of the other reasons set out above apply to them, and some reasons clearly do not. Accordingly, we do not consider that zero-rating should be extended to non-Kyoto units at this stage. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 58 TREATMENT OF NON-RESIDENTS Issue: Application of income tax rules to non-residents Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Specific rules should be included to ensure that a non-resident which does not have a permanent establishment in New Zealand is not subject to income tax on the sale of emissions units in New Zealand. Comment The standard treatment of non-residents is that they are taxable on New Zealand- sourced income. It is not clear to us why a special exemption to this rule should be created for non-residents when it applies to, for example, non-residents who trade in New Zealand shares or debt instruments. Variations to the taxation of non-residents should be considered in the context of a review of the international tax rules, not on an isolated basis. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Requirement for non-residents to register for GST Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Non-residents should not be required to register for GST in New Zealand solely because they have trades in emission units on the New Zealand register. However, they should have an option to register voluntarily for GST. Comment The sale of emission units on the New Zealand register by non-residents does not automatically create an obligation to register for GST. Generally, the sale of intangible property by a non-resident who is outside New Zealand at the time of supply is treated as outside the scope of the GST Act. It is possible, however, that sales of emission units by non-residents to New Zealand residents may be treated for GST purposes as imported services. If the supply is treated as imported services, the recipient may need to consider the application of the “reverse charge”, which imposes GST on certain imported services. This outcome does not require the non-resident to register for GST. 59 In the event that the non-resident is present in New Zealand when selling emission units, the supply may continue to be treated as supplied outside New Zealand if the recipient of the supply is a registered person, unless the parties agree otherwise. Officials note that the current rules allow non-residents that carry on a taxable activity to voluntary register for GST in New Zealand if they choose. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 60 61 Other policy matters 62 63 FILM AND GOVERNMENT FUNDING Issue: Treatment of Large Budget Screen Production Grant payments Clauses 36, 45 and 63 Submission (4 – Pieter Holl & Associates Ltd, 53 – Ernst & Young) The application of standard grant treatment to films receiving Large Budget Screen Production Grant payments should not proceed as this will cause this grant to be less competitive with its Australian equivalent. Comment The Large Budget Screen Production Grant (LBSPG) was designed to be a response to Australia’s “location” refundable tax rebate and intentionally adopted the same tax treatment as Australia. The tax base (cost) for a LBSPG film includes the costs that are reimbursed by the LBSPG. This treatment results in artificial tax losses for the special purpose company that makes the film. In some cases these losses are being offset against non-film taxable income (for example, income of a finance company). Reverting to the standard grant treatment will result in there being no artificial losses. This has the effect of reducing the subsidy from 19.5% to 15% for the particular film studio where the losses can be used. All film studios should receive an equal incentive for making a film in New Zealand. Tax deductions are not designed to act as an indirect subsidy for particular industries and any subsidies should be explicit. Therefore, it has been decided to bring the treatment of this grant under standard grant treatment. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Timing of introduction of measures applying to Large Budget Screen Production Grant payments Clause 2(22) Submission (4 – Pieter Holl & Associates Ltd, 53 – Ernst & Young) The application date of changes to the Large Budget Screen Production Grant payment tax treatment should be deferred so as not to apply to projects that began pre- production or production before this bill was introduced. 64 Comment The issue revolves around giving the industry sufficient notice of the change without unnecessarily exposing the revenue base. At the moment the bill proposes that the amendment apply from 1 April 2009. We note that this is not as helpful as it could be. Accordingly, while not accepting the submission, we recommend that the application date be changed so the amendment applies when the final application for the grant is made on or after 1 October 2009. This should go some way towards meeting the submitters’ concerns as well as providing a more coherent cut-off for films that do or do not qualify. Officials have also been made aware of a project that was begun before 1 July 2008 and will not be completed until, at earliest, December 2009. Expenditure for this film should be grandparented and officials therefore also recommend that films that incurred at least $3 million in film-related expenditure by 1 July 2008 should come under the treatment proposed in this bill. Recommendation That the application date be changed so the amendment applies when the final application for the grant is made on or after 1 October 2009 except when the project incurred at least $3 million in film-related expenditure by 1 July 2008. Issue: Deductibility of Screen Production Incentive Fund payments Clause 69 Submission (51 – Screen Production and Development Association) Producers should continue to be allowed to permit deductions for expenditure in the year of completion of the film, rather than over 24 months. Comment The Screen Production and Development Association (SPADA) is concerned about inconsistencies between the tax treatment of Screen Production Incentive Fund (SPIF) grants and non-SPIF funded productions. Its argument is that a number of films have until now been government-funded, and have still qualified for the immediate tax write-off upon completion. This is correct, but the quality of the government funding has changed from limited-recourse loan, to an absolute grant with no claw-back. 65 SPADA is also concerned about how producers will fund their films between the production date and receiving the grant. However, this is a problem with the grant itself, which is exacerbated by the taxation change recommended. Previously, government funding was paid out on a percentage completion basis, whereas the grant is paid out after completion. SPADA is concerned private investors will be discouraged from investing in films by their inability to immediately offset their film tax losses to the same extent, and that producers will be less able to fund other projects because the timing of their tax refund will be pushed out. Taxation is not designed to be an indirect subsidy to producers and the screen production industry. Any subsidies should be made explicitly. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application date for Screen Production Incentive Fund payments Clause 2(18) Submission (51 – Screen Production and Development Association) The proposed date of implementation of the scheme for deduction of Screen Production Incentive Fund (SPIF) payments should be deferred to the beginning of the 2010–11 tax year, which is 1 April 2010. Comment SPIF was implemented on 1 July 2008 and during the period of delay caused by the later enactment of this bill there is uncertainty over how the deduction rules will apply. Given this uncertainty, it would be unfair to those few productions underway to be caught by the new rules. Delaying the implementation date would allow productions currently held up to proceed with certainty over their tax treatment. Recommendation That the submission be partially accepted, with a new application date of 1 January 2010, the date suggested to the industry by the Minister of Revenue in August 2008. 66 Issue: Application date of information sharing and secrecy provisions Submission (Matter raised by officials) The proposed date of application for new information sharing and secrecy provisions between Inland Revenue and the Film Commission should be deferred from 1 July 2008 to the date of enactment of this bill. Comment Officials have realised that the dates currently proposed in the bill for application of the new provisions that override standard Inland Revenue secrecy are retrospective. The override is necessary to allow Inland Revenue to verify film expenditure for the Film Commission for the SPIF grant. Officials do not believe it is appropriate for such provisions to have retrospective application and recommend that their application be moved from 1 July 2008 to the date of enactment of this bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 67 MIGRANT WORKERS – TAX RATE THAT APPLIES Clauses 383, 422 and 445 Submission (32 – KPMG) The submitter supports the proposed initiative to reduce the compliance costs for migrant workers, but also notes that some additional compliance costs will be imposed on employers and payroll software developers. They also submit that migrant workers will not receive a high income for the period they are in New Zealand and therefore the proposed flat tax rate of 19% in the bill is too high and should be reduced. Comment The bill introduces a full and final flat tax rate of 19% which would apply to migrant workers. Since the introduction of the bill, the tax rates for individuals have been reduced twice and the 19% rate is now too high. A more appropriate flat tax rate for an average migrant worker in a normal picking season would be 15%. This rate should apply from date of assent of the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and the flat tax rate that applies to migrant workers be reduced from 19% to 15%, and apply from date of assent of the legislation. 68 BANKING CONTINUITY ISSUES Clauses 408 and 416 Issue: Ownership interest requirements Submission (29 – Russell McVeagh) The proposed legislation refers to the “new parent” holding all ownership interests in the “initial parent”, and the “initial parent” holding all ownership interests in its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Exceptions need to be made to these ownership requirements to deal with instruments that are regarded as equity for tax purposes that do not convey real ownership interests. Comment Officials agree that certain exceptions will need to be considered if the proposed legislation is to carry out its intended policy objectives. Officials have considered the carve-outs proposed and agree they are necessary. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (29 – Russell McVeagh) The present definition of “ownership interest” in the proposed legislation means either a voting interest or a market value interest, but not both. The definition should not be mutually exclusive and the continuity of both voting interests and market value interests should be preserved. Comment Officials agree that the continuity of both voting interests and market value interests should be preserved. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 69 Issue: References to execution, beginning and ending of a non-operating holding company restructure Submission (29 – Russell McVeagh) Terms such as “execution”, “beginning” and “end” should not be used in the proposed legislation. This is because it is difficult to determine the exact timing of a restructure. Comment Officials accept that it may be difficult to determine the exact timing of the beginning and end-date for this type of restructure. We agree that the legislation should reflect the fact that there will not be a single clear-cut beginning or end-date for this type of restructuring. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Other drafting matters Submission (29 – Russell McVeagh) A number of technical changes need to be made to the current draft legislation. The majority of those are minor drafting matters that are needed to ensure the draft legislation is applicable to taxpayers. Comment Officials have considered all the changes proposed in the submission and agree they are necessary. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 70 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The proposed legislation should also include a requirement that the shareholders will need to hold the same proportion of ownership interests in the new parent company as they had done in the initial company once the restructured arrangement is completed. Comment The amendment will further improve the integrity of the proposed legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 71 CHARITABLE DONEE STATUS Clause 427 Submission (37 – Inter Church Working Party on Taxation) The proposed additions to Schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007 are supported. However, the list of charities with an overseas focus is too limited. Comment Inclusion of a charitable organisation in Schedule 32 is dependant on that organisation coming within the criteria established by Cabinet. The submitter recognises it might not be appropriate to suggest making further amendments in this bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 72 TAX RECOVERY ARRANGEMENTS – APPLICATION DATE Clause 508 Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) This legislation is penal and the amendment (that clarifies that changes such as interest, administrative penalties and costs may be collected under New Zealand’s tax recovery arrangements) should not apply retrospectively. It should only apply from the date of assent of the current legislation. Clearly this legislation was not clear before that date, therefore taxpayers should not be punished by legislation that had not been passed at the time the act was undertaken. Comment The legislation is not unclear. New Zealand’s tax recovery arrangements (generally forming part of a double tax agreement although, in one case, established as a stand- alone convention) all expressly state that penalties and certain other costs may be recovered. Those arrangements have been given overriding effect by Order in Council to become part of New Zealand law. The amendment to the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being sought to prevent the possibility of a highly technical argument being made that certain provisions of the Act (chiefly the definition of “tax”) can be construed as presenting an obstacle to the recovery of penalties. Such an argument would run counter to the clear intention that penalties can be recovered. Given that New Zealand’s treaty obligations under tax recovery arrangements came into effect from 1 April 2008, it is appropriate to ensure that the amendment also has effect from 1 April 2008. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 73 PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND GST Clause 519(4) Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The term “offices of Parliament” only applied from 1 July 1991, so the legislation need only be made retrospective to that date. The term “offices of Parliament” came from the Public Finance Act 1989, in which it was defined to include the offices of the Auditor-General, Ombudsman and Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment. Comment Officials note that the proposed legislation amends the definition of “public authority”, and not the definition of “office of Parliament”, by inserting a reference to the Parliamentary Services and the Office of the Clerk. Since the definition of “public authority” applied from the introduction of the original GST legislation, the proposed legislation is drafted to apply from the dates when the Parliamentary Services and the Office of the Clerk were first meant to charge GST on their supplies. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 74 GST ON CERTAIN LOYALTY POINTS Clauses 519(3), 520, 521 and 525 Submission (23 – American Express, 24 – New Zealand Law Society, 62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) The proposed ability of operators of loyalty programmes to defer charging GST on the supply of loyalty points should also apply when the GST “reverse charge” provisions in the GST Act apply. Comment A number of submissions note that the legislation should make it clear that the proposed rules allowing deferral of GST on loyalty points until the loyalty points are redeemed will apply when the GST “reverse charge” provisions in the GST Act treat the New Zealand-resident purchaser of the loyalty points as supplying the points. Since the resident purchaser will be liable for the GST on the supply of the loyalty points, it should also be able to choose whether to defer the payment of the GST until those points are redeemed. Officials agree that the deferral should be available to resident purchasers of loyalty points in situations where they are liable to account for GST under the reverse charge rules. The proposed legislation should be clarified to give effect to that intention. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (32 – KPMG) If a loyalty programme operator is able to identify at the time of the redemption of loyalty points whether or not GST has been imposed on the points or whether GST is deferred until redemption, there should be no reason to prohibit access to the new rule. Comment KPMG welcomes the proposed changes but considers there is no need to require that 25 percent or more of the loyalty programme operating business (or associated person’s business) involves providing zero-rated goods or services. 75 The proposed rules defer the imposition of GST until the nature of the loyalty reward is known. The rules are meant to ensure that the supplier of the loyalty points does not charge the standard rate of GST on loyalty points if there is some possibility that the reward provided on redemption is a zero-rated supply – for example, air travel that could be either domestic (and standard-rated) or international (zero-rated). Therefore, by requiring that a proportion of the loyalty programme operator’s business involves the provision of zero-rated goods and services, the rules ensure that there is some likelihood that the underlying reward is a zero-rated supply. Removal of the requirement that loyalty programme operators must provide zero- rated supplies as part of their business would allow loyalty programme operators who do not redeem their loyalty points for any zero-rated rewards to defer the imposition of GST until the redemption of the loyalty points. Since, on redemption, these operators would still be required to charge GST at 12.5%, including them in the proposed rules would unnecessarily delay the payment of GST, with consequent (unquantifiable) fiscal implications. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The GST treatment of loyalty point transactions should be reviewed, and specific legislation enacted to cover the GST implications of loyalty point schemes more comprehensively. Because there is little case law on the GST treatment of loyalty points, the New Zealand GST position regarding the issue and subsequent redemption of loyalty points is very uncertain. There are three specific areas of concern: • whether the issue of loyalty points to customers is a supply for GST purposes; • a possibility that a redemption of points in consideration for a supply or services could be a supply for a consideration upon which GST is payable, which would result in a double GST impost; and • that the above uncertainties are complicated even further when loyalty points issued outside New Zealand can be redeemed for goods and services in New Zealand and when loyalty points issued in New Zealand can be redeemed for goods and services in another jurisdiction. 76 Comment Officials note the first and third concerns regarding the need for clarity over the tax treatment of loyalty points received by a loyalty programme customer directly from a loyalty programme operator for acquiring goods from that operator and consider that further work is required on this issue. Officials note, however, that there is no such uncertainty in situations to which the proposed legislation will apply (which is necessary to avoid over-taxation). In relation to PWC’s second concern, officials agree that GST should not be imposed on both the issue of loyalty points and their subsequent redemption for goods and services. Conversely, officials consider that a loyalty programme operator will charge GST on redemption of loyalty points only in situations when they choose to defer the imposition of the GST under the proposed legislation. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The implementation date of the amendment should be grandparented so that any entities that have treated past loyalty programmes as proposed in the bill will not be subject to Inland Revenue scrutiny or penalty. Comments Officials do not consider there are sufficient grounds for making the changes retrospective. The policy of imposing GST on the form of business transactions has always been clear and the fact that some arrangements have given rise to an unwarranted tax impost does not in itself justify retrospectivity. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The Group is supportive of the proposed amendments to allow the deferral of GST on certain loyalty transactions and sees the changes as a pragmatic approach for both taxpayer and government. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 77 GST AND EXPORTED SECOND-HAND GOODS Clauses 522 and 523 Under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, a GST-registered person who purchases second-hand goods from an unregistered person may claim an input tax deduction for the tax fraction (one-ninth) of the purchase price which has been paid. As a base integrity measure, second-hand goods that have been the subject of such an input tax deduction cannot be zero-rated if they are exported. The amendment changes this outcome and allows exported second-hand goods to be zero-rated if the registered person obtains a written declaration from the recipient of the goods that they or an associate will not cause the goods to be brought back to New Zealand. This declaration is necessary to ensure that Inland Revenue has sufficient information to determine when goods form part of an export/reimport arrangement that seeks to create second-hand goods input tax deductions. Submissions agree with the amendment but recommend that it apply from 1 April 2004. Officials disagree with this recommendation. A drafting matter has been identified with the amendment that needs to be changed to specify that the amendments apply to GST-registered persons. Issue: Support for the proposed amendment Submissions (As per form letter 8: SimsPacific Metals Limited, Wellington Scrap Metals Ltd, 14 – The Scrap Metal Recycling Association of New Zealand Inc and W Macaulay Ltd, 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Submissions note their support for the proposed change subject to the amendment having retrospective application to 1 April 2004. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 78 Issue: Retrospective application Submissions (As per form letter 8: SimsPacific Metals Limited, Wellington Scrap Metals Ltd, 14 – The Scrap Metal Recycling Association of New Zealand Inc and W Macaulay Ltd, 53 – Ernst & Young) The application of the proposed changes should be backdated to 1 April 2004. The amendment removes a point of difference between Inland Revenue and taxpayers about whether certain supplies of exported scrap metal are subject to GST at the standard rate of 12.5%. The effect of the amendment negates the need to consider whether the exported scrap metal was new, second-hand or modified to such an extent that it was “new” compared with its original purchase condition. Backdating the amendment would therefore protect those taxpayers that have zero-rated exported scrap metal and produce an equitable result for dealers in the scrap metal industry. It is further noted that: • There is no constitutional objection for retrospective application as the amendment confers a benefit to taxpayers. • The benefit conferred by the amendment should not be delayed until enactment. • There is little or no revenue risk connected with backdating the amendment to 1 April 2004 because of the costs associated with transporting scrap metal. • Inland Revenue is prevented, in situations other than avoidance, from amending assessments that are more than four years old (the four-year time-bar). Backdating the amendment to 1 April 2004 with application to taxpayers that have zero-rated the exports in question is consistent with the time-bar. Comment Officials consider that the amendment is new policy and does not clarify an existing uncertainty with the treatment of exported second-hand goods – it modifies the application of an existing anti-avoidance provision. The amendment also does not deal with the question of what are “second-hand goods”, which is currently being considered by Inland Revenue. The change therefore does not remove the different GST treatment of exported second-hand goods and all other exported goods. We note Inland Revenue is investigating taxpayers that have zero-rated exports potentially involving the supply of second-hand goods. Decisions about whether legislative changes should have retrospective application need to be made on a case-by-case basis. In this particular case, we consider that backdating the amendment is not appropriate for the following reasons: 79 • The requirement to charge GST on exported second-hand goods that have been subject to a second-hand goods input tax deduction has been present in the Act since its enactment. The application of the relevant sections in the GST Act and its role as an anti-avoidance measure has also been confirmed by the New Zealand courts. 1 Most taxpayers should therefore have a reasonable expectation that exported second-hand goods cannot be zero-rated like other exported goods. • The amendment applies to all exported second-hand goods, not just scrap metal. Backdating the amendment is likely to create unintended consequences and potentially give rise to windfall gains. While there may be a limited revenue risk associated with exported scrap metal, we consider it would be inappropriate to backdate the amendment for the benefit of the scrap-metal industry and not for other dealers in exported second-hand goods. • Backdating the amendment, as suggested by submissions, to taxpayers who have taken a zero-rated tax position in connection with exported second-hand goods (thereby limiting the scope for unintended consequences) would create an inequity between taxpayers in similar fact situations depending on whether or not they zero-rated or charged GST on the export. We are unable to estimate the number of taxpayers (and amounts in question) that would fall into each situation. • Affected exporters are unlikely to be able to retrospectively comply with the record-keeping requirements demanded by the amendment before the export can be zero-rated. Submissions note that this requirement should not apply for the retrospective period because of the costs involved. We are of the view that removing the need to keep records about the recipient’s intended use of the goods would undermine the integrity of the amendment. • Based on our estimates of the revenue cost of the amendment being $4 million each year, there would likely be a revenue cost of $20 million or more if the amendment were backdated to 1 April 2004. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Scrap metal is not “second-hand goods” Submission (14A – The Scrap Metal Recycling Association of New Zealand Inc and W Macaulay Ltd) Scrap metal is not second-hand goods. 1 Case N66 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,495. 80 Comment The GST Act defines the term “second-hand goods” to mean: “Secondhand goods, does not include— (a) Secondhand goods consisting of any fine metal; or (b) Secondhand goods which are, or to the extent to which they are, manufactured or made from gold, silver or platinum, or any other substance, if they were of the required fineness, would be fine metal; or (c) Livestock:” The Court of Appeal in LR McLean 2 noted that there is nothing in the purpose or scheme of the Act that would justify ignoring the ordinary meaning of the words “second-hand goods”. The ordinary meaning of “second-hand” was described by the Taxation Review Authority as: “...used or treated or stored by a previous owner in such a manner that it can no longer be regarded as new”. 3 This would suggest that breaking down goods into individual components does not of itself create “new” goods. For example, removing a door from a second-hand motor vehicle for re-sale does not make the door the sale of new goods. While the question of whether specific goods are second-hand or new is a question of fact and law, policy discussions with representatives from the scrap-metal industry have been on the basis that the goods in question are second-hand for GST purposes, giving rise to the problem that this amendment is intended to address. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Drafting matter – “registered person” Submission (Matter raised by officials) The amendment inserting new section 11(3B) makes reference to the “supplier”. This term should be corrected to read “registered person”. The reason for the change is that the section is intended to have effect when second-hand goods are exported by a registered person. The term “supplier” means “the person making the supply” and can refer to a registered person or an unregistered person. The change is recommended as it specifies that the section should apply to registered persons only. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 2 LR McLean and Co Ltd and Ors v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1994) 16 NZTC 11,211. 3 Case N16 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,142 at 3,147. 81 Issue: Application date should be specified Submission (53 – Ernst & Young) It should be specified that the amendment applies to supplies made on and after a specified date rather than have the change apply from the date of enactment. Simply having the amendment apply from date the bill is enacted can result in uncertainty and ambiguity – for example, over supplies made but not yet returned for GST purposes. Comment The GST Act contains a number of rules that determine the point in time when a GST-registered person must recognise a supply of goods and services that give rise to an output tax liability (including zero-rated supplies). The rules approximate when a transaction has been concluded and economic control of the goods and services has passed from the supplier to the recipient. In the majority of cases, the time of supply will be when the supplier issues an invoice or receives payment. This general rule is a mechanical provision that assists with the imposition and collection of that tax by determining such matters as when tax becomes payable. 4 The GST treatment of a supply is therefore determined by reference to these rules rather than when a registered person is required to file a return. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Meaning of “substantially the same condition” Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Guidelines need to be published by Inland Revenue on the meaning of the phrase “substantially the same condition”. Comment Officials will discuss with submitters the publication of guidelines. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 4 See Pine v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1998) 18 NZTC 13,570 CA. 82 RAISING CERTAIN TAX THRESHOLDS The proposals in the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Bill to make changes to tax thresholds for small and medium enterprises (as summarised on page 11 of the explanatory note to this bill) are to be withdrawn. All these changes have now already been made as a result of the enactment of The Taxation (Business Tax Measures) Act 2009. The legislation was part of an urgent tax package for small and medium enterprises introduced by the government to make it easier for smaller businesses to manage their cash flows and meet their tax obligations. As part of this package, the tax threshold changes in this bill were brought forward so they could become effective as soon as possible, and in some cases further enhanced. The proposals are therefore no longer required in this bill. 83 ACC: TAXATION OF PERSONAL SERVICE REHABILITATION PAYMENTS – DRAFTING CLARIFICATION Submission (Matter raised by officials) Amendments are necessary to correct three deficiencies or ambiguities in changes to the taxation of personal service rehabilitation payments that were made in the Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007. Comment The intention of the changes was to tax attendant care payments at the time they were made to claimants – when that person on-pays his or her carer(s) – or to the carer(s) themselves – when ACC pays them directly on behalf of the claimant. In the former situation, no tax was to be deducted when the claimant on-paid his or her carer(s). However, a drafting error occurred at the select committee stage of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Business Taxation, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Bill, which effectively reversed the position – in other words, that ACC is not required to deduct tax, and that claimants who pay their caregivers directly are responsible. This effect negates the whole purpose of the amendments. One of the criteria for qualifying for the in-work tax credit is that the person has earned income that is a “PAYE income payment”. As personal service rehabilitation payments are excluded from this definition, full-time carers do not currently qualify for this credit. There is doubt that the provisions apply to personal service rehabilitation payments made under provisions that applied in earlier Acts covering entitlements arising from accidents, which have been carried forward, but “grandparented”, in the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Compensation Act 2001. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and that the amendments apply from 1 July 2008.

414, 415, 431, 436, 477, 502, 503 and 624 The bill makes amendments to strengthen and rationalise the definitions of “associated persons” in the Income Tax Act 2007. The definitions are mainly used in an anti-avoidance capacity to counter non-arm’s length transactions that could undermine the intent of the income tax legislation. The changes are consistent with a key theme of the government’s tax policy work programme, which is ensuring that the income tax system is robust. This is supported by the high priority that protection of the tax base has in the current economic and fiscal environment. There are currently a number of major weaknesses in the definitions, in particular, those applying to land sales. These weaknesses pose a risk to the tax base which the bill addresses by introducing a number of amendments to the income tax legislation. The main changes: • deal with the weaknesses in the current definitions in relation to trusts. In particular, there will be new tests focussing on a trust’s settlor (that is, the person who provides the trust property); • provide more robust rules aggregating the interests of associates to prevent the tests for associating two companies and a company and an individual being circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among close associates; and • implement a tripartite test associating two persons if they are each associated with the same third person, thereby making the associated persons tests as a whole more difficult to circumvent. The bill also rationalises the current income tax definition of associated persons and other income tax provisions that employ a similar concept, such as the definition of “related persons” in the dividend rules. This represents a significant simplification and makes the associated persons concept in the Income Tax Act more coherent. Twenty-six submissions were received on the associated persons proposals in the bill. Submissions were opposed to the proposals in the bill. Officials have worked with those who made submissions on recommending refinements to the new associated persons definitions in the bill to prevent any overreach while still addressing weaknesses in the current definitions that, for example, allow property developers to escape tax by operating through closely connected entities. The refinements to the bill will, for example, ensure that energy consumer trusts will not be associated with members of the public as a result of the reforms. This report explains why people cannot be associated through community trusts. It is not the policy intent for such trusts that have a public nature or their beneficiaries to be adversely affected by the reforms. The tripartite test has been narrowed to address concerns that it could apply more widely than is necessary to protect the tax base. To reduce uncertainty, officials recommend not proceeding with the changes to the dividend and fringe benefit tax rules. 4 A number of submissions have criticised the current legislative policy that land dealers, developers and builders are generally taxed on all their land sales and cannot claim to hold non-taxable investment property portfolios. It is not envisaged that this policy on land sale gains will be narrowed. The changes in the bill would mean that the policy is properly achieved by closing some gaps in the current law. Officials note that the reforms are not all “one-way” and some current tests have been narrowed in the bill. For example, the ambit of the “relatives” test has been reduced from four to two degrees of blood relationship to reduce compliance costs. The “habitually acting in concert” test has also been removed to improve certainty. The application date changes that the Minister of Revenue has asked the Committee to consider will ensure that the associated persons reforms will not have any retrospective application. The changes mean that the reforms will generally apply for the 2010–11 and subsequent income years. However, for the purposes of the land provisions, the reforms will generally apply to land acquired on or after the date of enactment. 5 REFORMS SHOULD NOT PROCEED Submissions (15 – WHK Taylors, 39 – Russell McVeagh, 47 – Grant Thornton, 53 – Ernst & Young, 54 – Business New Zealand, 57 – Tomlinson Paull, 61 – Trustee Corporation Association of New Zealand, 62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 70 – Deloitte) The proposed amendments are too extensive and result in unintended consequences. Officials should undertake a comprehensive review of the current tests, the historical and policy reasons for their introduction (including in relation to developers/real property) and for their application to particular rules. Against that properly informed background, officials should then determine whether any fiscal concerns are already adequately addressed by the current levels of applicable “association” in the rules. The changes to the associated persons tests would represent a significant barrier to business and should be withdrawn from the bill to allow further consideration. The proposals need to be considered together with the wider land tax policies. If the government decided to review the associated persons rules, the proposals should be publicly consulted in a government discussion document. It is incumbent on Parliament to ensure that it limits the associated persons provisions to those persons who it considers should be subject to tax. Comment The bill contains amendments to strengthen and rationalise the definitions of “associated persons” in the Income Tax Act 2007. These definitions are mainly used in an anti-avoidance capacity to counter non-arm’s length transactions that could undermine the intent of the income tax legislation. There are a number of significant and generally recognised weaknesses in the definitions and, in particular, the definition which applies to land sales. The amendments in the bill will address these weaknesses. The associated persons reforms in the bill have been developed in accordance with the generic tax policy framework. This has included a full consultation process and has involved a comprehensive review of the current definitions. In particular, an issues paper was released in March 2007 which allowed an opportunity for people to comment on the proposals. Significant modifications were made to the proposals in response to the extensive submissions on this issues paper. Officials have also continued to engage in discussions with interested parties since the 2007 issues paper. In response to submissions on the bill, further modifications have been recommended by officials. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 6 APPLICATION TO LAND PROVISIONS Submissions (11 – M Scott, 15 – WHK Taylors, 32 – KPMG, 39 – Russell McVeagh, 47 – Grant Thornton, 53 – Ernst & Young, 57 – Tomlinson Paull, 58 – nsaTax, 61 – Trustee Corporation Association of New Zealand, 62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 70 – Deloitte) The integrity of the tax system is at risk because of the arbitrary and unfair nature of the taxation of certain land transactions, even more so under the proposals in the bill relating to associated persons. Therefore, the associated persons rules in the land provisions in sections CB 9 to CB 11 should be repealed. Land should be capable of being held on capital account if that is the taxpayer’s purpose. There does not seem to be any policy reason why taxpayers should not structure their land holdings to clearly differentiate between property held for indefinite or long-term rental purposes and property held on revenue account. The current exclusions in the land provisions such as those for residential land, business premises and investment land should be extended. The land provisions require extensive amendments to remove inconsistencies and make them more coherent. For example, Section CB 10, which relates to land development or subdivision businesses, is redundant because of section CB 12 (schemes for development or division begun within 10 years), and should be repealed. The Valabh Committee proposed a rebuttal nomination scheme which would have allowed taxpayers to specify the purpose of a land acquisition and be taxed accordingly. This is a better policy approach than what is proposed in the bill. It seems timely to question whether the 35 year-old policy in relation to real property is still good policy today. The wider policy aspects of the land tax rules should be reviewed contemporaneously with the review of the associated persons rules. Parliament should reconsider whether the so-called “10-year sale rule” in the taxation of land provisions is appropriate at all, or whether it should be modified in some way. The introduction of a wide associated persons test to land transactions is an inappropriate way to target base maintenance concerns and the application of the proposed associated persons rules to land transactions should be more carefully targeted to situations where there is an actual threat to the tax base. Essentially, the law should provide a mechanism that allows persons associated with property developers to hold property on capital account, if in fact it is held on capital account. 7 Comment Officials note that when Parliament enacted the current land sale tax rules in 1973, it expressly provided that land dealers, developers and builders could not generally hold land on capital account. This means that all gains on properties sold by property developers within 10 years of acquisition are taxed in most cases. Parliament’s intent to strengthen the tax provisions relating to land sale gains and, in particular, restrict the ability of land dealers, developers and builders to hold land on capital account, is clear from the parliamentary debates. The land sale tax rules are buttressed by associated persons rules that are designed to prevent land dealers, developers and builders escaping tax if they structure the ownership of their investment properties through an associate. This legislative policy can currently be circumvented by some relatively simple structures. For example, a property developer can arrange for a trust, settled by that developer and under which the developer is a beneficiary, to acquire land. The property developer is not, under the current associated persons rules, associated with the trust, so the trust is not taxed on any subsequent sale of the land within 10 years of acquisition. It is unlikely that Parliament intended that the current legislative policy on land sale gains – which is that land dealers, developers and builders should generally be taxed on all their land sales and cannot claim to hold non-taxable investment portfolios – could be circumvented by such structures. The changes in the bill would mean that this legislative policy is better achieved by closing some gaps in the current law. It is not envisaged that the current legislative policy on land sale gains will be narrowed. Officials note a considerable number of modifications have been made to the associated persons tests for the purposes of the land provisions so they cover situations under the effective control of property dealers, developers and builders, but do not apply to other situations. A number of submissions have also suggested extensive amendments to various aspects of the land provisions such as the exclusions for residential land and business premises, and how transactions between associated persons are treated. These submissions are outside the scope of the associated persons reforms which are primarily concerned with defining when persons are associated with each other. The Valabh Committee proposal involving a nomination scheme has not been proceeded with mainly because of the large compliance and administration costs that such a proposal would entail. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 8 COMPANIES TESTS Issue: Application of aggregation rule to managed funds Submission (18 – Staples Rodway) There should be an exception from the aggregation rule in section YB 2 on voting interests for portfolio investment entities (PIEs) or entities eligible to be PIEs. Comment Officials agree that a widely held fund should not be adversely affected because of the personal land dealings of the directors of that fund. After further consultation with Staples Rodway, this issue can be best addressed by including an exclusion, for the purposes of the land provisions, in the test associating two companies in section YB 2 for a company that is a portfolio investment entity (PIE) or that is eligible to be a PIE. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Scope of aggregation rule Submission (15 – WHK Taylors) The intended scope of the application of the aggregation rule in sections YB 2 and YB 3 is unclear. The intent of how the aggregation rule applies should be clarified in the legislation and the commentaries. In particular, is the aggregation rule focused on countering the fragmentation of shareholder interests or does it act as a tripartite test? Comment The aggregation rule is an element of the companies tests in sections YB 2 and YB 3. For example, in determining whether two companies are associated under section YB 2, a person is treated as holding anything held by persons associated with them under sections YB 4 to YB 14. The examples on pages 81 and 82 of the commentary on the bill illustrate how the aggregation rule applies. The aggregation rule is designed to prevent the companies tests in sections YB 2 and YB 3 being circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among associated persons, resulting in the interest thresholds in those sections not being met. The aggregation rule does not act as a separate associated persons test. 9 Recommendation That the submission that the legislation be amended be declined. It is noted that the Tax Information Bulletin article on the legislation will confirm that the aggregation rule is an element of the companies tests and is not a separate tripartite test. Issue: Application of the aggregation rule and the tripartite test Submissions (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 53 – Ernst & Young, 57 – Tomlinson Paull, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The tripartite test in section YB 14 should not be applied as part of the aggregation rule because it could result in that rule applying too widely. Therefore, the aggregation rules in sections YB 2(4) and YB 3(4) should refer to sections “YB 4 to YB 13” and not to sections “YB 4 to YB 14”. The combination of association under the tripartite test and the aggregation provisions proposed in sections YB 2(4) and YB 3(4) could possibly involve some reiterative effect. This could give rise to significant overreach in the context of land transactions. The interaction of these provisions should be clarified. Comment Officials do not agree that the tripartite test should not be applied as part of the aggregation rules in the company-related tests. The example on page 88 of the commentary on the bill involves the application of the tripartite test in the aggregation rule, which ensures that a closely held arrangement is treated as associated. In relation to the example in the PricewaterhouseCoopers submission, officials do not consider that the two companies would necessarily be associated under the proposed rules. This is because the husband would be treated as holding only the wife’s share in the partnership, including her share in the development company. For example, if the wife only held, say, a 20 percent share in the partnership, the husband would be treated under the aggregation rule as holding only that 20 percent share. Therefore the two companies would not be associated. However, if the wife held a 60 percent share in the partnership, the two companies would be associated under section YB 2 because there would be a group of persons (the husband and the wife) holding at least 50 percent of the voting interests in both companies. This would be an appropriate application of the new associated person rules. Officials note that the tripartite test in proposed section YB 14 cannot act reiteratively because the two persons associated with each other under that test cannot be associated with the same third person under the tripartite test itself. This is illustrated in the example in page 88 of the bill commentary – The Trust and A are not associated with A’s spouse under the tripartite test. 10 For the associated persons reforms to be effective, the aggregation rule in the company-related tests needs to incorporate the tripartite test. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: “Control by any other means” limb Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The “control by any other means” limb under the “two companies test” in section YB 2 should be removed. Alternatively, Inland Revenue should provide more definitive guidance as to how it is to be interpreted and applied. Comment The removal of the “control by any other means” limb in the test associating two companies has never been part of the proposal to reform the associated persons definitions. In particular, the removal of this limb was not raised in the issues paper Reforming the definitions of associated persons published in March 2007. Officials consider that the “control by any other means” limb acts as a buttress to the other limbs of the tests associating two companies which are based on voting and market value interests. The role of the limb also needs to be kept in perspective. It mainly acts as a backstop only to the primary voting interest test. Officials note there is a reasonable body of case law on the meaning of “control” in the company context, such as the House of Lords decision in British American Tobacco Company Ltd v IRC \[1943\] AC 335. This body of case law provides the appropriate guidance on the “control by any other means” limb. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 11 Issue: Test associating a company and a person other than a company for the purposes of land provisions Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The test in proposed section YB 3(6) and (7) should not apply to associate a company and a trust or trustee. Therefore, these provisions should only associate a company and a person who is a natural person (and not a trustee). Comment If a trustee wholly owns a company, it follows that the trustee and company should be associated for the purposes of the land provisions. There is no reason in principle to limit association to when the shareholder is a natural person only (not acting in a trustee capacity). The submission refers to the reference on page 82 of the bill commentary to the “company-individual” test to describe section YB 3. This reference is intended to be a short-hand term only for “a company and a person other than a company”. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Aggregation rule for purposes of land provisions Submission (Matter raised by officials) The proposed rule aggregating the interests of certain associates in the test in section YB 3 associating a company and person other than a company for the purposes of the land provisions needs to be modified to ensure that the rules work as intended. The example on page 88 of the commentary on the bill involving a person’s spouse settling a trust which wholly owns a family company would not be covered under proposed section YB 3(6) if person A was a property developer. Such a closely held arrangement should be covered in the context of the land provisions. Officials propose that the aggregation rules in section YB 3(6) and (7) should be replaced with a rule where a person is treated as holding anything held by persons associating with them under sections YB 4 (the limited version applying for the purposes of the land provisions), YB 7, YB 8, and YB 10 to YB 14. This means that the beneficiary-related trust tests and the general relatives test would not apply in the aggregation rule in the test associating a company and a person other than a company for the purposes of the land provisions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 12 Issue: Threshold in the company and person other than a company test Submission (32 – KPMG) The required shareholding interest for a company and a person other than a company under section YB 3 should remain at 50 percent or more for particular sections. Comment The threshold for associating a company and a person other than a company in the general associated persons definition has always been 25 percent. In particular, officials note that the threshold for this test in the land provisions has always remained at 25 percent since its original enactment in 1973. Although the associated persons definition currently applying for certain provisions (in particular, the “1988 version provisions”) uses a 50 percent threshold, we consider it is desirable to have a consistent threshold for associating a company and a person other than a company. Given that the 25 percent threshold is used most widely in the Income Tax Act, it is appropriate to adopt this threshold. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Company acting in its capacity as trustee of a trust Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed section YB 3(8) is unnecessary. Comment Section YB 3(8) provides that for the purposes of section YB 3 (the test associating a company and a person other than a company), a person other than a company includes a company acting in its capacity as a trustee of a trust. Officials note that the general position under the Income Tax Act is that a company acting in its capacity as trustee of a trust is treated as a trustee and not treated as a company (specific recognition of this position in relation to the voting interest definition which forms the basis of the main voting interest limb in section YB 3, is set out in the Tax Information Bulletin, April 1992, page 23). Section YB 3(8) ensures that this continues to be the position in section YB 3, which refers to a “person other than a company”. Section YB 3(8) makes it clear that the reference to a “person other than a company” includes a corporate trustee. We therefore consider that this clarifying provision will be helpful to readers of the legislation. 13 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Modifications to companies tests for listed or widely held companies Submission (62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 77 – Westpac) Modifications should be made to the applicable determination of “voting interest” and “market value” to ensure that the rule is workable in practice in relation to listed or widely held companies. These modifications would be generally consistent with current sections YC 10 and YC 11 in relation to the continuity provisions. Comment The modifications in sections YC 10 and YC 11 to the measurement of voting and market value interests for certain listed and widely held companies were specifically designed for the purposes of the continuity provisions which mainly relate to the ability of companies to carry forward and use tax losses and tax credits. The associated persons definitions, which also use voting and market interest concepts, have never incorporated the modifications to the measurement of voting and market value interests now contained in sections YC 10 and YC 11. The former section OD 8(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004, also contained a tripartite test but again, did not include the above modifications. This definition was applied in a wide range of operative provisions in the Income Tax Act, such as the depreciation, transfer pricing, thin capitalisation, share lending, and international tax rules. Officials therefore consider there is no reason to depart from the long-standing position of not applying the modifications to the determination of voting and market value interests now contained in sections YC 10 and YC 11 in the new associated persons definitions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 14 RELATIVES TEST – MODIFYING THE DEFINITION OF “DE FACTO RELATIONSHIP” Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The de facto relationship test should apply only for the purposes of the land provisions if the de facto relationship has been in existence for at least three years or longer. Comment The Income Tax Act 2007 uses the definition of “de facto relationship” in the Interpretation Act 1999, which treats two people in a de facto relationship as associated if they live together as a couple in a relationship in the nature of a marriage. This definition is used throughout the Income Tax Act and is not limited in any provision to a relationship which has lasted for at least three years. Officials consider that the Income Tax Act should continue to take a consistent approach to the meaning of a de facto relationship and therefore are not in favour of limiting the definition for the purposes of the land provisions only. Importantly, the current associated persons definition that applies for the purposes of the land provisions already associates people in a de facto relationship whether or not that relationship has lasted for three years. Therefore the bill is maintaining the status quo in this area. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 15 TRUST TESTS Issue: Scope of trustee for relative test Submission (15 – WHK Taylors) The trustee for relative test in section YB 5 may apply more widely than intended. Comment Officials agree that the trustee for relative test in section YB 5 should not apply for the purposes of the land provisions. This would be consistent with the land provision exclusions in the other beneficiary-related tests in sections YB 6 and YB 9. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Scope of beneficiary-related trusts tests Submissions (15 – WHK Taylors, 32 – KPMG, 48 – PricewaterhouseCoopers for nine electricity lines companies, 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Energy consumer trusts should be excluded from the trustee and beneficiary test in section YB 6 because of their public nature. Discounts to consumers from electricity lines companies owned by consumer trusts should be excluded from the dividend definition. Currently consumers, while beneficiaries of the company’s shareholding trust, are not treated as associated with the shareholder. Therefore the requirement in section CD 6(1)(a)(ii) is not satisfied. However, changes proposed in the bill are likely to result in the discounts being treated as dividends from 1 April 2009. The scope of the trustee and beneficiary test in section YB 6 and the settlor and beneficiary test in section YB 9 are too broad and should not be adopted. In particular, the trustee and beneficiary test in section YB 6 should be amended to associate a trustee and a beneficiary only where the trust was established mainly to benefit that beneficiary. 16 Comment The beneficiary-related trusts tests are important elements of the new associated persons provisions and are necessary if the provisions are to be effective. Exceptions have been included in these tests so that they do not apply for the purposes of land provisions. These exclusions are designed so that the beneficiary-related tests do not apply too broadly. Officials agree that energy consumer trusts established under the Energy Companies Act 1992 should be excluded from the test associating trustees and beneficiaries and the trustee for relatives test. This is because such trusts (having a very large pool of beneficiaries) are public in nature and do not pose a risk to the tax base. These large public trusts are quite different in nature from private trusts, which are intended to be covered by the test associating trustees and beneficiaries. We agree that discounts to consumers from electricity lines companies should not be treated as dividends. Excluding energy consumer trusts from the trustee and beneficiary and trustee for relatives tests, along with the recommendation in this report not to proceed with certain changes to the dividend rules, will address concerns that the reforms could mean these discounts could be treated as dividends. Officials consider that the unit trust that administers bonus bonds should also be excluded from the test associating trustees and beneficiaries, and the trustee for relatives test. This unit trust is excluded from the unit trust definition in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and therefore is not treated as a company. This means that the trust-related associated persons tests apply to it. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Exclusion for charitable organisations in beneficiary-related tests Submissions (72 – Russell McVeagh) The beneficiary-related tests in sections YB 6 and YB 9 will have significant unintended consequences when the beneficiary of many trusts is the same charity. The trustee and settlor of each such trust would be associated with the trustee and settlor of all such trusts without being aware of the fact. The proposed tripartite test in section YB 14 should be amended so it does not apply if parties are associated under section YB 6 (trustee and beneficiary test) or section YB 9 (settlor and beneficiary test). 17 Comment Officials agree that the beneficiary-related tests in sections YB 6 and YB 9 could have unintended consequences when the beneficiary of many trusts is the same charity. This issue is best addressed by excluding “charitable organisations” (as defined under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007) from the definition of “beneficiary” for the purposes of sections YB 6 and YB 9. This would ensure that trustees and settlors of trusts which have the same charity as a beneficiary would not be associated. The separate recommendation in this report that the tripartite test apply only to associate persons if they are each associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests, will also assist in addressing concerns about over- reach. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Exception in trustee and beneficiary test for purpose trusts Submission (32 – KPMG) An exemption should apply when an association arises because of eligibility to benefit under a purpose trust, such as a community trust. Comment Officials note that because purpose trusts do not at law have beneficiaries, the beneficiary-related tests in the associated persons rules are not relevant to these trusts. In particular, “community trusts” referred to in the Community Trusts Act 1999 are expressly stated to be purpose trusts. These trusts were established to hold the shares in the successor companies to the former trustee banks. Therefore it is not necessary to exclude purpose trusts such as community and charitable trusts from the definition of “trustee” in the trustee and beneficiary test in section YB 6. However, there are several existing references in the Income Tax Act 2007 that refer to a beneficiary of a community trust (sections HC 21(3) and HC 32(2)). These references are incorrect and should be amended to refer to a person who receives a distribution from a community trust. Recommendation That the submission be declined. That existing references to a beneficiary of a community trust be amended. 18 Issue: Scope of two trustees with common settlor test Submissions (15 – WHK Taylors, 57 – Tomlinson Paull, 62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 70 – Deloitte) The two trustees with common settlor test in section YB 7 is too broad. For example, it could result in the entire client bases in a law firm being associated to each other because the firm’s lawyers were the nominal settlors of clients’ trusts. Therefore, this test should be either removed or modified to apply only to a settlor who has a beneficial interest in the trust property. The test should also only apply to settlors who have made settlements on or after 1 April 2009. Professional trustees such as the trustee companies should be excluded from the operation of the proposed sections YB 7 to YB 9. Comment Officials do not consider that a professional advisor who acts as a nominal settlor will be treated as a common settlor for the purposes of the associated persons definitions. This is because under the nominee look through rule in section YB 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007, it is the client that would be treated as the settlor rather than the professional advisor, who is merely acting as a nominee. This interpretation is specifically supported by Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin, November 1989, paragraph 6.93. The nominee look through rule in section YB 21 is the successor provision of section HH 1(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004 (which concerned nominal settlements). We note that professional trustees such as the trustee companies often act as the trustee of unit trust investment vehicles. Because unit trusts are treated as companies for income tax purposes, it is the companies-related tests – in particular, section YB 3 – that will be mainly relevant. The 25 percent threshold in section YB 3 would ensure that investors are typically not associated with the unit trust. The two trustees with common settlor test is an important element of the new associated persons provisions and is necessary if the provisions are to be effective. Officials consider that it is not appropriate to limit the application of this test to trusts settled on or after 1 April 2009 as this would significantly limit the effectiveness of the new provisions. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 19 Issue: Definition of “common settlor” Submission (Matter raised by officials) For the purposes of the test associating two trustees with a common settlor in section YB 7, two persons who are married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship should be treated as the same person. Comment It may be possible to circumvent the new associated persons definition in the bill by the use of “mirror trusts” – that is, spouse A settles a family trust for the benefit of spouse B and spouse B settles another family trust for the benefit of spouse A. Officials consider that the test associating two trustees with a common settlor should apply to such mirror trusts. To ensure this, it is necessary to amend section YB 7 of the bill to treat persons who are married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship as the same person for the purpose of identifying a common settlor. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Scope of trustee and settlor test Submission (15 – WHK Taylors, 32 – KPMG, 70 – Deloitte) The trustee and settlor test in section YB 8 is too broad. Therefore, this test should be either removed or modified to apply only to a settlor who has a beneficial interest in the trust property. The test should also only apply to settlors who have made settlements on or after 1 April 2009. Comment The trustee and settlor test is an important element of the new associated persons provisions and is necessary if the provisions are to be effective. Officials consider that it is not appropriate to limit the application of this test to trusts settled on or after 1 April 2009 as this would significantly limit the effectiveness of the new provisions. We also consider that the settlor basis of many of the trust-related associated persons tests is consistent with the settlor focus of the trust taxation rules in the Income Tax Act. 20 Officials note that the separate recommendation in this report that the tripartite test apply only to associate two persons if they are each associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests will also assist in addressing concerns about overreach. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Exception in trustee and settlor test for charitable trusts Submissions (32 – KPMG, 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Philanthropic settlements on charitable and non-charitable trusts are a common occurrence. All persons making settlements on these trusts are associated with the trust. The tripartite test would associate all such persons. In the corporate environment, corporates can gift funds to various trusts; these trusts will now be associated. Comment Officials agree that there should be an exception for charitable trusts in the trustee and settlor test in section YB 8. An exception would prevent donors to charitable trusts being associated with each other. A charitable trust under the Income Tax Act 2007 is required to be registered as a charitable entity under the Charities Act 2005 and is therefore subject to the regulatory requirements of that Act. Officials do not consider that these entities pose a risk to the tax base and therefore it is not necessary to include them in the trustee and settlor associated persons test. Officials do not consider that this exception should be extended to non-charitable trusts as they are not subject to the same level of regulation as charitable trusts registered under the Charities Act 2005. However, we consider that the separate recommendation in this report that the tripartite test apply only to associate two persons if they are each associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests will address concerns about overreach in this area. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 21 Issue: Definition of “settlor” Submissions (39 – Russell McVeagh, 62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 70 – Deloitte) The settlor concept for the purposes of the associated persons rules would be better targeted by focussing on persons who truly control or materially influence the trust’s affairs and benefits from it. The definition of “settlor” should not include a person who provides financial assistance to a trust or who makes settlements on the trust of less than a prescribed amount (perhaps $5,000). Otherwise, beneficiaries who do not charge interest on credit current account balances and professional advisors who make nominal settlements on a trust would be treated as settlors. The definition of a “settlor” should be defined to include the settlor only when they have some ongoing relationship with the trust. Comment The settlor-based test of association (common settlor, trustee-settlor and settlor- beneficiary tests in new sections YB 7, YB 8 and YB 9) use the definition of “settlor” set out in section HC 27, with the modification that a settlor does not include a person who provides services to a trust for less than market value. This modification was designed to prevent a professional advisor who provides services at no charge being treated as a settlor. The current definition of “settlor” in section HC 27 is used extensively in the Income Tax Act. In particular, the definition in section HC 27 is used in the current common settlor and trustee-settlor associated persons tests. These tests are applied in a wide range of operative provisions in the Income Tax Act such as the depreciation, transfer pricing, thin capitalisation, share lending and international tax rules. The extensive use of this definition is consistent with the settlor-based focus of the trust taxation rules in the Income Tax Act. We consider that the submissions to treat as settlors only persons who control or materially influence or who have some ongoing relationship with the trust would introduce an undesirable subjective element to the definition of “settlor”. It would also lead to application of the settlor-based tests being uncertain. It would be inappropriate to have a blanket exclusion from the settlor definition for persons who provide financial assistance (for example, an interest-free loan) to a trust because these amounts could be very substantial. The current settlor definition does not contain a minimum threshold and officials consider that this approach should be maintained for the purposes of the associated persons reforms. 22 Professional advisors who make nominal settlement on a trust are not treated as settlors under current law – this treatment will continue under the associated persons reforms. This point is discussed under the previous “Scope of two trustees with common settlor test” issue. Officials also consider that beneficiaries who have received distributions and are not paid interest on their credit current account balances are not treated as settlors. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Scope of trustee and person with a power of appointment or removal Submission (15 – WHK Taylors, 39 – Russell McVeagh, 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 33 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc) The test in section YB 11 associating a trustee and a person with a power of appointment or removal of the trustee is too broad and should be either removed or modified to apply only to an appointor if the tax base is threatened. The test should also only apply where the appointor has a beneficial interest under the trust. Alternatively, section YB 11 should apply only if the person has both the power of appointment and removal or just the power of removal. Comment This test in section YB 11 is intended to complement the test associating a trustee and settlor in section YB 8. In many cases, a settlor of a trust, as the author of the instrument creating and governing administration of the trust, retains the power to appoint or remove trustees. However, this power could be reposed in a separate person. Officials consider there is sufficient connection between a trustee of a trust and the person who has the power to appoint or remove the trustee to justify treating them as associated persons. For the associated persons definitions to be effective, it is considered necessary to include this test. Officials do not support attempting to limit the application of this test only to avoidance situations where the tax base is threatened because of the uncertainty this approach entails. Neither would officials support limiting the test to situations where the appointor has a beneficial interest under the trust because the nature of a discretionary trust means an appointor could be made a discretionary beneficiary after the power of appointment is exercised. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 23 Issue: Appointors who are professional advisors Submission (57 – Tomlinson Paull) The trustee-appointor test in proposed section YB 11 could give rise to significant overreach when professional advisors are nominated as appointors. This test, coupled with the proposed tripartite test, would result in completely unrelated trusts being associated, merely because a trusted advisor has been granted the power to appoint or remove trustees. Comment Officials agree the trustee-appointer test in proposed section YB 11, in conjunction with the tripartite test, should not associate otherwise unrelated trusts because a professional advisor acting in their capacity has been granted the power to appoint or remove trustees by their clients. The nominee look through rule may not apply to attribute this power to clients. Officials consider that this concern is addressed by the separate recommendation in this report that the tripartite test apply only to associate two persons if they are each associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Exceptions for employee trusts Submission (Matter raised by officials) An exception for employee trusts in section YB 15 should be made for the test associating a trustee of a trust and a person who has the power of appointment or removal of the trustee. Comment The various trust-related tests, other than the test in section YB 11 associating a trustee of a trust and a person who has the power of appointment or removal of the trustee, contain exceptions in section YB 15 for certain employee trusts. It would be consistent if section YB 15 also contained an employee trust exception in relation to section YB 11. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 24 PARTNERSHIP TESTS Issue: Scope of partnership and partner test Submission (15 – WHK Taylors, 68A Corporate Taxpayers Group) A partner and a partnership should not be associated in all circumstances. Instead, they should be associated only if a partner has a 25 percent or greater share in the partnership. Comment Since the enactment in 1968 of the first associated persons definition in the Income Tax Act, a partner and their partnership have always been associated regardless of the share a partner has in the partnership. It has not been part of the reform proposals to change this long-standing position. Officials consider that it is appropriate to always associate a partner and their partnership given the transparent treatment of partnerships for income tax purposes, which involves attributing any activity of a partnership to its partners. A separate associated persons rule is being implemented for limited partnerships. A limited partnership and a limited partner will only be associated if the limited partner has a partnership share of 25 percent or more in the limited partnership. The treatment is appropriate because a limited partner cannot be involved in the management of the partnership (unlike a partner in a general partnership). Therefore, a limited partner is more akin to a shareholder in a company which has a 25 percent interest threshold for association under section YB 3. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Scope of partnership and associate of partner test Submission (1 – Bell Gully, 15 – WHK Taylors, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 53 – Ernst & Young, 57 – Tomlinson Paull, 62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The partnership association tests in sections YB 12 and YB 13, in conjunction with the tripartite test, creates the apparently unintended consequence that a partner will be associated with the associates of the other partners in the partnership. 25 It is also considered that a partnership and an associate of a partner are too remote to be associated in all circumstances. Comment Officials agree that it is not intended to associate a partner with the associates of other partners in the same partnership. This issue is best addressed by omitting section YB 13, which associates a partner’s associates with the partnership. It is noted that an associate of a partner (for example, the spouse of a partner) would still be associated with the partnership under the tripartite test, which associates two persons if they are each associated with the same third person. For example, the spouse of a partner is associated with the partner under the relatives test in section YB 4. The partner is associated with the partnership under section YB 12. Therefore, the spouse and the partnership will be associated under the tripartite test in section YB 14. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Amendments to partnership and partner test Submission (Matter raised by officials) The test for association for a limited partnership in section YB 12(2) should be amended so it applies only to a limited partner and not a general partner in a limited partnership. An aggregation rule should also apply for the purposes of section YB 12(2). Comment Currently, section YB 12(2) switches off the primary test for associating a partnership and a partner in subsection (1) in relation to limited partnerships. However, this exclusion should be limited to the limited partners and not the general partner in a limited partnership. This limitation would be consistent with the current section YB 16(1B). This would also mean that a general partner in a limited partnership will be associated with the partnership under section YB 12(1). Under section YB 12(2), a limited partnership and a limited partner will only be associated if the limited partner has a partnership share of 25 percent or more in the limited partnership. This approach has been adopted because a limited partner is more akin to a shareholder in a company which has a 25 percent interest threshold for association under section YB 3. It would be consistent with this approach for an aggregation rule such as that contained in section YB 3(4) to also apply for the purposes of the limited partnership test in section YB 12(2). This test would ensure 26 that for the purposes of determining whether a limited partner and a limited partnership are associated, a person is treated as holding anything held by their associates. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Ambiguity in limited partnership tests Submissions (33 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposed sections YB 12 and YB 13 should be amended to clarify whether and if so, in what circumstances a general partner or a person associated with a general partner is associated with a limited partnership. For general partners who do not economically share in the profits or losses of a limited partnership, the legislation should be clarified so that they are not associated. Alternatively, a general partner should be associated with a limited partnership only if they have a 25 percent or more interest in that partnership. The test associating a partnership and an associate of a partner in section YB 13 should be amended to achieve its intended outcome. The limited partnership tests in sections YB 12(2) and YB 13(2) should include a discretion for the Commissioner to disregard any partnership share of 25 percent or more where the share in the limited partnership held by the limited partner corresponds to control or influence of less than 25 percent. Section HG 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 which provides that partnerships are transparent should be made consistent with new section YB 12 which only associates a limited partner who has a 25 percent or more interest in a limited partnership. Comment The drafting issue of whether a general partner is associated with a limited partnership has been addressed under the previous heading “Amendments to partnership and partner test”. Officials consider that because a partner in a general partnership is always associated, the general partner in a limited partnership should also always be associated with the partnership. The submission relating to the wording in section YB 13 is superseded by the recommendation to omit this provision. 27 Officials consider that the submission to insert a discretion in the limited partnership associated persons test would introduce a subjective element which would not be desirable. It would also lead to the application of the test being uncertain. We do not consider it necessary to amend section HG 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 in relation to limited partnerships, given the specific nature of section YB 12 which only associates limited partners who have a 25 percent or more interest in a limited partnership. Recommendation That it be noted that the submissions relating to the drafting of the limited partnership tests in proposed sections YB 12 and YB 13 have been addressed under previous headings. That the submission to amend section HG 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 be declined. 28 TRIPARTITE TEST – SCOPE Submissions (32 – KPMG, 39 – Russell McVeagh, 58 – nsaTax, 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 70 – Deloitte) The scope of the tripartite test in section YB 14 is too wide in its application, will give rise to unintended consequences and should not be enacted in its current form. For example, it could result in every beneficiary under an energy consumer trust being associated with each other in conjunction with the trustee for a relative test in section YB 5. These tests will likely be detrimental to the Crown revenue, at least in the short-term, with the declining property market. In the context of land transactions, the exceptions contained in section YB 14(2) should be expanded to include section YB 5 (which relates to the association of a person and a trustee for a relative). Comment The tripartite test in the bill, which associates two persons if they are each associated with the same third person, currently contains a number of exceptions to ensure it does not apply more widely than is necessary to protect the tax base. For example, partners in a partnership will not be automatically associated under the tripartite test. Officials consider that the scope of the tripartite test should be narrowed so that the test applies only to associate two persons if they are each associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests. This amendment would address a number of examples raised in submissions of where the tripartite test could apply more widely than is necessary to protect the tax base. The exceptions in the current section YB 14(2) could be largely subsumed by this modification to the tripartite test. The tripartite test should also not apply if two persons are both associated with the same third person under any of the companies-related tests in sections YB 2 or YB 3. Currently, the exceptions in sections YB 14(2)(a) and (b) apply only if two persons are both associated with the same third person under the same companies-related tests – that is, persons A and B are both associated with person C under the two companies test in section YB 2, or are both associated with person C under the company and person other than a company test in section YB 3. The exceptions do not currently apply if person A is associated with person C under section YB 2 and person B is associated with person C under section YB 3 – the amendment proposed by officials would provide an exception to the tripartite test in this case. In response to a submitter’s example involving an energy consumer trust, officials have separately recommended in this report that these trusts be excluded from the trustee and beneficiary test in section YB 6 and the person and trustee for relative test in section YB 5. In addition, officials have also recommended that the person and trustee for relative test not apply for the purposes of the land provisions. 29 Officials note that a submission’s reference to the reforms possibly reducing Crown revenue given the current declining property market does not take into account the application date of the associated persons reforms. In particular, the new associated persons definitions will generally apply only to land acquired on or after the date of enactment of this bill. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 30 USE OF EXISTING ANTI-AVOIDANCE PROVISIONS Submissions (15 – WHK Taylors, 39 – Russell McVeagh, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The existing anti-avoidance provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007, including the general anti-avoidance provision in section BG 1, should be used to counter transactions that threaten the tax base. Alternatively, the associated persons rules should apply only in cases of proven tax avoidance. Expanding definitions of associated persons rather than applying the anti-avoidance provisions in appropriate circumstances will result in transactions being subject to tax where there is no policy justification for imposing tax. Comment The types of transactions and structures that the amendments are directed against raise significant tax base concerns. The submissions argue that the associated persons reforms are unnecessary because the types of transactions and structures causing concern should be countered under the various anti-avoidance provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007. Although it is possible that Inland Revenue could be successful in applying the anti-avoidance provisions against these types of transactions and structures, this may involve litigation, the outcome of which is not certain. Also, any possible litigation involving the anti-avoidance provisions can take considerable time to complete. Officials do not consider that it is sufficiently certain or timely to rely on the anti-avoidance provisions to address the types of transactions and structures causing concern. The best way of protecting the tax base with sufficient certainty and in a timely manner against the type of transactions and structures causing concern is to proceed with the proposed amendments. This is supported by the high priority that protection of the tax base has in the current economic and fiscal environment. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 31 DIVIDEND AND FRINGE BENEFIT TAX RULES – PROPOSAL TO REMOVE ASSOCIATED PERSONS TEST SHOULD NOT PROCEED Submission (54 – Business New Zealand, 61 – Trustee Corporations Association of New Zealand, 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Removing the associated persons requirement from the dividend and fringe benefit tax (FBT) rules would undermine various arrangements outside the shareholding or employment relationship, including very common business practices that in most instances have no adverse effect on the New Zealand economy and which can be very important during times of recession when cash flow is short. For example, a plumber may lend a bricklayer some specialist tools without any payment made. They agree that when the plumber needs to borrow some tools used for bricklaying, he can do so without cost. Under the new rules this would be classified as a dividend and therefore taxable. The proposed amendments could have wide-reaching and unintended consequences. There will be a greater perceived level of subjectivity in the dividends test and accordingly the potential for greater scrutiny in audit vis-à-vis considering dividends through an objective association test. The proposed amendments should not be made because of the compliance costs which will arise from needing to understand the new rules. Comment Officials acknowledge that the changes to the dividend and FBT rules would result in some situations being less certain than they are currently. Presently, if a person is not a shareholder or associated with a shareholder, they do not need to be concerned with the dividend rules. Under the proposed changes, the fact that they are neither a shareholder nor associated with one is not sufficient to provide certainty on the dividend issue. Officials consider this potential uncertainty outweighs the conceptual advantages of the proposed approach. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 32 RATIONALISATION OF ASSOCIATED PERSONS DEFINITIONS Submission (39 – Russell McVeagh, 57 – Tomlinson Paull) Officials consider that the current multiplicity of definitions creates unnecessary complexity in the Act which increases compliance and administrative costs. However, we consider that complexity per se is not objectionable, despite related compliance costs, if the outcome is an appropriately targeted base-maintenance measure. Removal of this flexibility and substitution with a one-size-fits-all universal test of association makes such an approach impossible and ignores the good policy reasons for having a range of tests. The current definitions of associated persons should be consolidated into two definitions: a broad-based definition that would apply for some purposes (for example, for international tax purposes) and a narrow definition that would apply for certain other purposes (such as the taxation of land transactions). Comment An objective of the associated persons reforms is to rationalise the various income tax definitions of associated persons and make the tax law more coherent. Officials consider that the current multiplicity of definitions has mainly an historical origin: the specific definitions were mainly conceived in response to shortcomings in the general definition, and there are no convincing policy reasons for retaining the current multiple definitions, which can be significantly rationalised. Officials consider the reform of the associated persons definitions retains sufficient flexibility. For example, a considerable number of modifications have been made to the associated persons tests for the purposes of the land provisions so they cover situations under the effective control of property dealers, developers and builders, but do not apply to other situations. In particular, the beneficiary-related tests in proposed sections YB 5, YB 6 and YB 9 will not apply for the purposes of the land provisions – this modification prevents cases where there would otherwise be potential overreach of the new rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 33 RATIONALISATION OF OTHER PROVISIONS Issue: Replacing the company control definition Submission (53 – Ernst & Young) There needs to be further review and amendment of provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 which refer to “control” or related words, particularly in relation to the subpart FE thin capitalisation rules. Comment As a rationalisation measure, the bill repeals section YC 1, which defines when a company is treated as being under the control of any persons – its function will be performed by the new associated persons definition. Officials do not agree that the repeal of section YC 1 creates any additional uncertainty over the meaning of “control by any other means”. This is because section YC 1 does not define “control by any other means”. The new associated persons definition and other provisions in the Act, such as the thin capitalisation rules, continue to use the “control by any other means” wording which is not defined in the Act. Therefore, the meaning of this wording is left to be determined by common law concepts. Officials note that there is a reasonable body of case law on the meaning of “control” in the company context, such as the House of Lords decision in British American Tobacco Company Ltd v IRC \[1943\] AC 335. This body of case law provides guidance on the “control by any other means” wording. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Replacing the related person definition Submissions (15 – WHK Taylors, 32 – KPMG, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 47 – Grant Thornton, 57 – Tomlinson Paull, 58 – nsaTax, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The related person definition should not be replaced with the new associated persons definition. Alternatively, the related persons rules in section CD 44(11) to (17) should be repealed. 34 The aggregation rule in current section CD 44(16) should be retained because the related party capital gains provisions were not intended to apply to capital gains made with the adult children or other close relatives of the shareholders in the vendor company. The modifications in the associated persons definition that apply for the purposes of the land provisions should also apply for the purposes of the capital gains exclusions in section CD 44. Comment The bill proposes to replace the related person definition in section CD 44(15) to (17) with the new associated persons definition. The two definitions are conceptually similar, and the function of the related person definition can be performed by the new associated persons definition. Replacing the related person definition with the new associated persons definition is also a worthwhile simplification measure. The current related person rules are used to determine the amount of the capital gain exclusion from a dividend arising from the realisation of a capital asset in the course of a company’s liquidation. It is outside the scope of the associated persons reforms to consider the removal of this feature of the dividend rules. The advantage of rationalising provisions which embody an associated persons concept, such as the related persons definition in the dividend rules, cannot be fully realised if there is no change to the current scope of those rules such as the aggregation rule in section CD 44(16). Officials note that the aggregation rule in section CD 44(16) is not limited to infant children as is the case in the land provisions. Official do not consider that the modifications in the associated persons definition that apply for the purposes of the land provisions should also apply to section CD 44. This is because the transactions that give rise to capital gains could relate to property other than land. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Scope of counted associate amendment Submission (32 – KPMG) The “counted associate” definition in section CD 22(9) should be modelled on the land sale rules. 35 Comment The amendment in clause 12 of the bill to the counted associate definition in section CD 22(9) is limited to making that provision’s description of discretionary beneficiaries consistent with other references in the Act. The submission’s reference to where the shareholder is a company relates to a current feature of the “counted associate” definition which is not being amended by this bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 36 APPLICATION DATE Issue: Change to application date Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 53 – Ernst & Young, 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 70 – Deloitte) Given that the bill will not have been enacted before the commencement of the 2009–10 income year and is unlikely to be enacted before 1 April 2009, we submit that the application dates be deferred. Comment The associated persons amendments in the bill currently generally apply for the 2009–10 and subsequent income years. However, for the purposes of the land provisions, except for section CB 11, the reforms apply to land acquired on or after 1 April 2009. For the purposes of section CB 11, the reforms will apply to land on which improvements are begun on or after 1 April 2009. These application dates were set when it was expected that the July bill would be enacted before 1 April 2009. The Minister of Revenue has asked the Committee to consider a change to the application date for the associated persons reforms as a result of the bill being enacted later than originally expected. In particular, the general application date for the associated persons reforms (excluding the land provisions) should be changed to the 2010–11 and subsequent income years. In the case of the land provisions, except for section CB 11, the reforms should apply to land acquired on or after the date of enactment. For section CB 11 (disposal within 10 years of improvement: building business), the reforms should apply to land on which improvements are begun on or after the date of enactment. The suggested changes to the application date will ensure that the associated persons reforms do not have retrospective effect. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 37 Issue: Deferral of application date to allow further consultation Submission (32 – KPMG, 32A – KPMG) The associated persons amendments should be deferred until further consultation can occur. The significant impact on taxpayers and transactions of the proposed changes means they should not be rushed through without proper regard for the consequences. Further work is needed to refine the proposals. Comment The associated persons reform has been developed in accordance with the generic tax policy framework. This has included a full consultation process. In particular, an issues paper was released in March 2007 which provided an opportunity for people to comment on the proposals. Significant modifications were made to the proposals in response to the extensive submissions received. Officials have also continued to engage in discussions with interested parties since the 2007 issues paper’s release. In response to submissions on the bill, further modifications have been recommended by officials to the proposals in the bill. The current submission would require the associated persons reforms to be removed from the bill to allow a further round of consultation. Given the extensive consultation that has been undertaken throughout the associated persons reform process, officials do not support this suggestion. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application date of replacing related person definition with associated person definition Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed replacement of the related person definition with the associated persons definition should not have retrospective application to any transaction with an associated person (who is not currently a “related person”) that has occurred since 31 March 1988. 38 Comment Officials agree that the legislation should be clarified to ensure that the replacement of the related person definition with the associated person definition has prospective application only. In particular, it should apply only to transactions with associated persons occurring on or after the application date of the new associated person reforms. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 39 MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS Issue: Application of changes to Fisheries Act 1996 Submission (49, 49A – Seafood Industry Council) The current associated persons definition that applies for the purposes of the Fisheries Act 1996 should continue to apply after the enactment of the new associated persons definition in the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Bill. Comment The Fisheries Act 1996 uses the associated persons definition in the Income Tax Act 2007. The proposals in the bill to strengthen the associated person definition have been developed for income tax purposes rather than fisheries’ purposes. Officials do not have a policy concern with the changes in the bill not applying for the purposes of the Fisheries Act. Therefore, from a policy perspective, officials agree with the submission to allow the current associated persons definition in the Income Tax Act to continue to apply for the purposes of the Fisheries Act. The only concern that officials have with the submission is that it is not an ideal long- term situation because it requires users of the Fisheries Act to have access to old tax legislation. However, the Ministry of Fisheries has advised Inland Revenue officials that they intend to address this issue in the medium-term by amending the Fisheries Act so that it contains its own definition of associated persons. On this basis, officials consider it is appropriate to accept the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Definition of “international tax rules” Submission (53 – Ernst & Young) The reference to the new associated persons definitions in section YA 1 of the international tax rules should be refined or the subsection YB 2(6) exclusion should be qualified. 40 Comment Officials agree that the reference to the new associated persons definitions in the section YA 1 definition of “international tax rules” (clause 404(68) of the bill) should be clarified. Because a general definition of associated persons will apply to the international tax rules from the application date of the associated persons reforms in the bill (expected to be the 2010–11 income year), paragraph (a)(xiv) of the “international tax rules” definition (which currently refers to the 1988 version provisions) should be omitted from that date. The current paragraph (a)(xiv) of the definition should be amended from “the commencement of the Income Tax Act 2007” to refer to “the parts of subpart YB that apply for the purposes of the 1988 version provisions”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Associated persons for GST purposes Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The test in section 2A(1)(h) of the Goods and Services Act 1985 associating the trustee of a trust with the trustee of another trust where the same person is settlor of both trusts should be amended so that it does not apply if the trust is a charitable or non-profit body. Comment The bill amends only the associated persons definitions in the Income Tax Act. The submission is seeking to amend the associated persons definition in the Goods and Services Act 1985 which is not the objective of these reforms. Therefore the submission is outside the scope of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 41 Issue: Clarification that trust tests do not apply to unit trusts Submission (62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 77 – Westpac) It should be clarified that the trustee-related tests in sections YB 5 to YB 11 are not applicable to unit trusts because unit trusts are treated in all respects as companies for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. Comment The trustee-related tests would not apply to unit trusts because unit trusts are treated as companies for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. Therefore it would be the company-related tests in sections YB 2 and YB 3 that would apply to unit trusts. This position results from a unit trust being included in the definition of “company” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Officials do not consider this treatment requires further clarification for the purposes of the associated persons tests. The treatment of unit trusts has been subject to the Income Tax Act rewrite process. If a person wishes to raise an issue related to this rewrite process, it should be directed to the Rewrite Advisory Panel, which considers and advises the government on issues arising from the rewrite of the Income Tax Act. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application of voting and market value interest tests to fiscally transparent entities Submission (53 – Ernst & Young) Further consideration should be given to clarifying and describing in the legislation how the voting and market value interest tests in subpart YC of the Income Tax Act 2007 should apply for associated persons and other purposes where fiscally transparent or hybrid entities (such as limited partnerships) are involved. Comment Officials note that this submission relates generally to how the voting and market value interest tests in subpart YC apply to fiscally transparent entities. Any consideration of this issue is distinct from the associated persons reforms in this bill and would be a separate exercise. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 42 43 Relocation and overtime meal allowances 44 45 OVERVIEW Clauses 34, 35, 42, 485, 545, 547 to 549, 616, 617 and 619 The amendments to the Income Tax Acts 1994, 2004 and 2007 ensure that payments by employers when relocating their employees, and providing them with overtime meal allowances are exempt from income tax and fringe benefit tax if certain criteria are met. The changes were signalled in an officials’ issues paper, Tax-free relocation payments and overtime meal allowances, released in November 2007, and are designed to remove uncertainty about whether and when these payments are tax-free to employees that receive them. To further reduce uncertainty, the changes apply to payments made over the past four years, as well as to future payments. By statute, Inland Revenue is generally unable to re-assess an income tax liability beyond four years. Ten submissions were made on this part of the bill and were generally supportive of ensuring that the two allowances were non-taxable. Five submissions expressed concern, however, that specifically making two allowances non-taxable would imply that all other allowances would be taxable. They suggest Inland Revenue undertakes a general review of the tax treatment of all allowances before any legislative changes are contemplated. This is a misunderstanding, as the bill does not remove the more general provision that determines whether allowances are tax-free or taxable. All it does is carve out two allowances to ensure that they are non-taxable when the general provision might otherwise suggest that they were taxable. 46 REVIEW OF ALLOWANCES Clauses 34, 35, 547, 548 and 616 Submission (32 – KPMG, 38 – New Zealand Council of Trade Unions, 46 – Employers and Manufacturers Association (Northern), 54 – Business New Zealand, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) There should be a general review of allowances to determine their tax status. This would help to remove uncertainty about the tax treatment of other allowances. The Commissioner promised a review back in 1996. The appropriate starting point for a review is general consultation under the generic tax policy process to determine what general principle should apply. Comment Officials are not averse to the idea of a general review of allowances under the generic tax policy process if it is shown to be warranted. We have been endeavouring to establish whether there is a problem in practice. Based on the feedback we have received on whether a wide range of non-taxable allowances would suddenly become taxable, we do not consider a general review to be warranted. Furthermore, there are very limited resources available to undertake such a review given the significant number of projects already on the tax policy work programme. It is important to note that the bill does not remove the more general provision that determines whether allowances are tax-free or taxable. Nor does it affect those allowances, such as additional transport costs, that already have their own exemption. All it does is carve out two more allowances to ensure that they are non-taxable when the general provision might otherwise suggest that they were taxable. To help determine whether other allowances are non-taxable, Inland Revenue intends to finalise the interpretation guideline of the current law in this area that was first circulated for comment in late 2007. This guideline was a key outcome of the review that the Commissioner indicated in 1996 would be undertaken given concerns following changes to the legislation in 1995. Although it ultimately depends on the detail of each specific case, it would appear on the information available that many of the examples of allowances raised to date would likely continue to be non-taxable. During our various rounds of consultation on the proposed legislative changes, officials asked whether there were other allowances that, like relocation and overtime meal payments, needed to be specifically legislated as non-taxable. The only concrete example has been the sustenance allowance raised by Deloitte on behalf of NZ Post, which we are recommending be included in the legislative changes. This is discussed later in our responses. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 47 REVERT TO PREVIOUS LEGISLATIVE TEST Clauses 35, 548 and 616 Submissions (38 – New Zealand Council of Trade Unions, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The current test of whether an allowance or reimbursement can be paid tax-free (as per section CW 17) should be returned to an “incurred” test and the government should consult under the generic tax policy process to determine what allowances should be tax-free. In the event that this submission is not accepted, then the law should be returned to an “incurred” test with an exclusion for capital items. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) In the event that the submission for a general review is not accepted, then the law should be returned to an “incurred test”, with an exclusion for capital test. (New Zealand Council of Trade Unions) Comment In 1995, changes were made to the tax treatment of allowances. The need for the Commissioner to determine whether an allowance was taxable or exempt was removed, putting the onus instead on the taxpayer to determine this. Also the test was changed from whether the expenditure was incurred as a necessary part of the employee’s earning their income to one based on whether the expenditure would have been deductible by the employee were it not for the prohibition in the Income Tax Act that employees cannot claim expenses in relation to their employment. The New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants has suggested that this change went beyond what was intended. Officials consider that beyond precluding reimbursements for capital expenditure as intended, any difference between the two tests is largely semantic and of little practical difference in determining whether an allowance or reimbursement is taxable or non-taxable. This is because an incurred test would still require the expenditure to be incurred in deriving the employee’s income. Consequently, reverting to an incurred test would be unlikely to achieve an outcome materially different from continuing with the current law supplemented by the interpretation guideline. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 48 OTHER ALLOWANCES SHOULD ALSO BE SPECIFICALLY EXEMPTED Clauses 35, 548 and 616 Submission (32 – KPMG, 68 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The present proposal to allow only two specific forms of tax-free allowances does not go far enough and should be expanded to other allowances that are commonly paid by employers – for example, clothing and footwear. Comment We do not consider this to be necessary. As noted in an earlier response: • The bill does not remove the more general provision that determines whether allowances are tax-free or taxable. • To assist in determining whether other allowances are non-taxable, Inland Revenue intends to finalise the interpretation guideline of the current law in this area that it first circulated for comment in late 2007. Although it ultimately depends on the detail of each specific case, it would appear on the information available that many of the examples of allowances raised to date would likely continue to be non-taxable. The interpretation guideline, for example, discusses the circumstances in which clothing and footwear allowances would be non- taxable, such as when they involve protective clothing or uniforms. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 49 TREATMENT OF DEPRECIATION Clauses 34, 547 and 616 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The words “depreciation loss” should be added after the word “expenditure” in the general provision that determines whether an allowance is non-taxable (section CW 17) to ensure that allowances that provide for some element of depreciation are not precluded from being non-taxable. Equivalent changes should be made to the 1994 and 2004 Income Tax Acts. Up to the date of assent, however, these changes should apply only in relation to past positions taken. Comment Many employees use assets that they own during the course of their work. Employers often provide allowances to reimburse employees for the costs associated with the use of these assets for work purposes. Tool allowances and mileage allowances are prime examples. Arguably part of the reimbursement relates to the depreciation of those assets. The main provision in the Income Tax Act determining whether allowances are non- taxable, section CW 17, refers only to payments to cover expenses. The Income Tax Act treats depreciation as a capital loss rather than as an expense. Accordingly, there is an issue as to whether the wording in section CW 17 adequately covers all elements that an allowance might cover. To remove this doubt, officials recommend that section CW 17 should refer to both “expenditure” and “depreciation loss”. Given that the changes in relation to relocation payments and overtime meal allowances are being backdated to the 2002–03 income year, similar changes to incorporate “depreciation loss” should be made to the equivalent provisions in the 1994 and 2004 Income Tax Acts. Up to the date of assent, however, these changes should be confined to past positions taken, to ensure that only those taxpayers that had genuinely included a depreciation element in their allowances would be able to utilise this change. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 50 RELOCATION EXPENSES Issue: Reasonable daily travel distance requirement Clauses 35, 548, 616 and 619 Submissions (32 – KPMG, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) In relation to the requirement for the employee to have relocated their home base, employers should be able to decide whether or not an employee has relocated as a consequence of the employer’s needs, subject to a “reasonableness test”. The application of this test should not be unduly restricted by Inland Revenue guidelines. (KPMG) The requirement that the relocation is required because the employee’s workplace is not within reasonable daily travelling distance from the employee’s residence should be removed. In the alternative, if the “reasonable daily travelling distance” requirement is retained, the term should be defined or guidelines regarding its interpretation be issued as soon as possible. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment Officials agree that employers can largely be relied upon to confine their reimbursements to reasonable relocation expenses because their natural inclination is to minimise the costs that they incur. Nevertheless, the existence of an exemption for one form of expenditure will naturally create an incentive to recharacterise other forms of expenditure to take advantage of that exemption. This provides justification for limiting the scope of the exemption. One of the proposed limitations is that the relocation of the employee’s home base must be necessary to carry out the job. If the employee could have commuted to the new job from an existing home base there would appear to be a clear monetary private benefit involved when the employer pays for the relocation costs and, in principle, this should be taxable. This suggests the need for some form of distance requirement before a move could be considered a qualifying relocation. Options considered were that the employee’s existing home must not be within reasonable daily travelling distance of the new workplace (the United Kingdom approach) and a specific minimum distance test (the United States approach). Both these requirements do, however, involve some compliance costs. The United Kingdom’s approach requires assumptions to be made about what is “reasonable”, although reasonableness is a common concept within accounting. The United States’ approach is more certain in this regard but is less flexible in handling genuine local relocations, such as within a major city where traffic congestion and transport difficulties may make shorter distance relocations more justifiable. 51 A third option, and the one appeared favoured by the submissions, would be to leave it to employers to decide whether there has been a home base relocation that they wish to pay for, on the basis that employers will be reluctant to pay for relocations that are not related to work. While this would generally be the case, there could be some instances, particularly for senior appointments, when a salary recharacterisation could be achieved by relocating locally to coincide with taking up a new appointment. On balance, our preference, backed by consultation, was to adopt the United Kingdom’s approach. In terms of the reasonableness aspect, we note that the reasonable daily travelling distance is not defined in the United Kingdom’s legislation. Instead taxpayers are expected to apply common sense and take account of local conditions. The usual time taken to travel a given distance is an indication of whether that distance is reasonable. For example, in the United Kingdom employees living within larger cities commonly travel much greater distances or take longer to travel the same distance to work than do employees elsewhere. In the New Zealand context, transport difficulties in the major cities may make long distance commuting less likely. We consider that the small additional compliance costs associated with this requirement are warranted in light of the reduced opportunity for salary recharacterisation. Since a number of submissions from our various rounds of consultation asked for guidelines from Inland Revenue on what is meant by “reasonable travelling distance”, we will be developing these in time for the legislation’s enactment. We are happy to work with key stakeholders to develop a set of practical guidelines that are not too restrictive. Recommendation That the submissions that there should not be any specific home base change or a reasonable travelling distance test requirement be declined. That the submission that there should be no Inland Revenue guidelines on how to interpret “reasonable travelling distance” be declined. That the submission that the guidelines be issued as soon as possible be accepted. 52 Issue: Developing guidelines on reasonable daily travelling distance Clauses 35, 548, 616 and 619 Submission (68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The Corporate Taxpayers Group would like to work with officials on the guidelines prepared on the issue of what is not within a reasonable daily travelling distance of the employee’s former residence. Comment Officials are happy to work with the Corporate Taxpayers Group and other key stakeholders on developing the guidelines. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Ensure that relocation and overtime meal payments are tax-free Clauses 35, 548, 616 and 619 Submission (38 – New Zealand Council of Trade Unions) The current provisions should be amended to ensure that payments made by employers when relocating their employees and providing them with overtime meal allowances are exempt from income tax and fringe benefit tax. Comment Officials agree with this submission as the purpose of the proposed legislative changes is to achieve this very objective. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 53 Issue: Estimates of relocation expenses Clauses 35, 548 and 616 Submission (32 – KPMG, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 53 – Ernst & Young, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) As a compliance reduction measure, employers should be allowed to reimburse employees for relocation expenses by way of a reasonable estimate of expenses rather than be required to reimburse on the basis of actual expenditure. Comment The exemption will apply only to actual expenditure incurred. Hence, paying an employee a relocation allowance would not generally qualify unless it could be shown that the allowance covers costs that were actually incurred. Similarly, any amount paid by the employer in excess of the actual amount incurred will be taxable, even though a particular expense is on the list. We appreciate that when there is a significant number of employees relocating over the year that the requirement to reimburse actual costs might mean additional compliance costs for employers. We consider this requirement to be necessary, however, given the potentially high variation in the costs of relocating from employee to employee and the potential magnitude of the expenses. Otherwise, general allowances bearing no semblance to actual expenditure in a particular case could be paid as salary substitutes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) There should be a degree of pragmatism and leniency when it comes to the satisfaction of new section CW 17B(2) which requires the amount paid to be no more than the actual cost, particularly given that full evidence dating back possibly to October 2001 may not be available to employers. We suggest less restrictive wording in the equivalent sections of the 1994 and 2004 Income Tax Acts. Comment We acknowledge the passage of time may have made it more difficult to substantiate that previous payments covered actual eligible expenses. Accordingly, a degree of pragmatism is required in applying the test. But rather than trying to reflect this in the legislation, we suggest that it be handled administratively. Practically, the issue is more likely to be of relevance for those relatively few employers that are likely to seek refunds or credits because they have paid tax on relocation payments. Those 54 employers are more likely to have the necessary information given that the cases that we are aware of where tax has been paid arose from reassessments. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Time limit on eligible relocation expenses Clauses 35, 548 and 616 Submissions (32 – KPMG, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) A time limit for paying relocation claims is not needed. Instead there should be a test to assess whether there is a sufficient nexus between the expenditure and the employee’s relocation. But if there is to be a time limit, it should also recognise that when relocation occurs early in the income year, some of the expenditure can be incurred late in the preceding income year. (KPMG, Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) If there is to be a limit, it should run from the beginning of the income year prior to the income year in which the employee relocates to the end of the next income year. The limit should refer to “tax year” rather than “income year”. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The time limit should just be a requirement that the expenditure has to be incurred by the end of the tax year following that in which the relocation occurs. (Matter raised by officials) Comment The intention is that to qualify for the tax exemption the expenditure for a particular relocation must be incurred, or the benefit provided, before the end of the income year following the one in which the employee starts the new job or moves to the new location. The purpose of this requirement is to provide a cut-off, to avoid expenditure some years later being attributed to the relocation when that expenditure would have no bearing on the employee’s decision to relocate. In practice, most relocation costs will be incurred close to the time of relocation so the time limitation will not generally be a difficulty. The draft legislation also requires the expenditure to have been incurred no earlier than the beginning of the income year in which the relocation takes place. Officials agree with submissions that this requirement is not needed and instead the other tests can be relied on to ensure an adequate nexus between the expenditure and the relocation. Expenditure in advance of relocation is quite feasible given the various preparations that a relocation can involve. 55 We agree that the provisions should refer to “tax year” rather than “income year” to remove any doubt over whose income year is involved. Tax year is a defined term and generally means the period from 1 April and ending on 31 March. Recommendation That the submission that there be no time limit be declined. That the submission that the time limit should just be a requirement that the expenditure has to be incurred by the end of the tax year following that in which the relocation occurs, be accepted and note that this will address the submissions that called for the beginning of the time limit to begin earlier than the income year in which the relocation takes place. That the submission that the limit should refer to “tax year” rather than “income year” be accepted. Issue: Treatment of temporary moves that become permanent Submission (53 – Ernst and Young) The section CW 17B(3)(b) qualification should be omitted or amended to provide that the time limit applies from the start of the income year in which the relocation becomes permanent for any further relocation expenditure which is the result of the change from temporary to permanent relocation. Comment The bill generally does not distinguish between temporary and permanent relocations. For example, there is no minimum requirement on the length of time that an employee has to stay in the new location. The only reference to temporary moves is in relation to allowing more flexibility around the time limit. The draft legislation, however, omits to say what time limit applies when a temporary move becomes a permanent relocation. The intention is that if the earlier temporary move had not been treated as an eligible relocation against which claims had been made, the temporary move would be ignored. We agree that the legislation should make this clear. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part, so that the legislation makes it clearer what time limit applies when a temporary move is ignored. 56 Issue: Application date Clauses 35, 548, 616 and 619 Submissions (32 – KPMG, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) To remove any residual doubts about reassessments of previous tax positions, either all tax positions taken in relation to relocation expenses and overtime meal allowances before the law change should be affirmed or the retrospective application date should be extended to match the period that Inland Revenue could reassess. (KPMG) The backdating of the application date to 2002–03 will not provide any cover for taxpayers who have made tax-free relocation and overtime meal payments before that date. To be effective, the changes need to be made retrospective to the date when the current legislation was enacted. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment The submissions question whether the Commissioner’s ability to reassess taxpayers is limited in this instance to four years, as per the statute bar. The uncertainty about whether the statute bar would apply is a technical argument and should not be a problem in practice. Officials therefore consider that there is no need to take the application date back beyond the 2002–03 income year as contemplated in the draft bill. Furthermore, reaffirming all previously taken tax positions would not provide tax credits to those who had paid tax, which was a key reason for making the change retrospective. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 57 Issue: Commissioner’s determination specifying eligible relocation expenses Clause 485 Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The draft determination issued on 21 November 2008 should be finalised by the Commissioner immediately following enactment of the bill. Comment Officials intend to finalise the list of eligible relocation expenses in time for the bill’s enactment. This was the reason why the draft determination setting out the suggested list was circulated by Inland Revenue late last year for comment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Additional items for list of eligible relocation expenses, including catch-all Clause 485 Submissions (24 –New Zealand Law Society, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) There are a number of payments commonly made to expatriates and relocating employees which should be included on the list, for example: • visits to the new location before the actual move to scope matters such as accommodation options and schooling for children; • property management fees paid to real estate agents engaged to manage the employee’s family home (if it is rented out); • travel insurance paid in respect of moving to the new location and any pre-move visits to the new location; • language lessons, if the employee is moving somewhere where they are unable to speak the main local language; • costs incurred in cancelling utility connections in their current location; • “home leave” travel costs; 58 • costs incurred in relocating to a “developing country”, which might be considered a fringe benefit in a developed country, but which are a required expense for someone relocating from New Zealand. The following items should also be included in the list of eligible relocation expenditure: • any loss on sale of a family home; • the GST charged on goods transported into New Zealand; • fees for the employee and their immediate family to attend training and employment consultation, provided these costs are incurred within, for example, 12 months of the relocation; • the costs incurred in sending a child to a school of a comparable standard to the school they attended previously; • costs incurred on, for example, family reunion visits and compassionate travel; • the costs involved in obtaining a host-country driving licence; • the costs involved in the purchase of reasonable furniture and electrical goods if it is decided not to transfer these from the previous location; • any other incidental costs in relation to the relocation, up to a maximum of $1,000. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The following items should be included on the list of eligible relocation expenditure: • the cost of immigration applications (including application fees, x-rays, doctors’ reports, police reports and other special documentation); • charges for currency exchange on moving money to New Zealand; • house valuation costs; • LIM reports (or similar); • customs clearance costs; • storage costs at the new location before obtaining a permanent residence; • costs associated with complying with New Zealand customs regulations; • statutory obligations that arise on importation of cars, vans, boats and trailers (for example, compliance certificates and modifications required to comply). The list should also include a “catch-all” clause. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment The legislation proposes that the Commissioner issue a list of eligible relocation expenses. New section 91AAR of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides some parameters around the Commissioner’s proposed power to issue such determinations. 59 Section 91AAR(3) sets out the factors that the Commissioner may take into account when considering whether a type of expenditure necessarily arises from a relocation of an employee rather than being costs, including capital costs, that would have been incurred gradually over time, irrespective of whether an employee had relocated. In this regard, factors that may be borne in mind are whether the expenditure is really a substitute for salary and wages, whether employers generally treat the expenses as relocation expenses and the difficulty and costs of measuring any private benefit element. Losses on the sale of a house, for example, would not be considered to qualify as they are a potentially sizable capital loss that may have accumulated over time. As noted earlier, Inland Revenue issued a draft determination in November 2008 for comment, setting out a suggested list of eligible relocation expenses. The items referred to above can be considered by the Commissioner, alongside the suggestions made directly to the Commissioner on the draft determination. Officials confirm that the intention is that the list would also include a “catch-all” category to cover miscellaneous relocation expenses. Recommendation That the submissions be noted, and the items suggested be considered by the Commissioner along with the submissions made directly to the Commissioner on the draft determination. Issue: Nature of the list – ability to amend the determination and whether it should be a fixed list for earlier years Clause 485 Submissions (24 – New Zealand Law Society, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) A mechanism should be put in place so that the determination can be amended easily as omissions are identified and agreed with the Commissioner. (New Zealand Law Society) In relation to earlier income years (those starting from the 2002–03 income year), the list of eligible relocation expenses should be a fixed list. But for future income years, the Commissioner should be able to add and delete items from the list provided the Commissioner gives adequate notice of any amendment. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) 60 Comment Draft section 91AAR(4) already provides for a determination to be altered, subject to the Commissioner giving at least 30 days notice of the implementation date of any change. A person affected by a determination may challenge the determination under the Disputes Procedures and Challenges parts of the Tax Administration Act. The aim is to get from the outset as comprehensive a list as possible so that changes to the list items will then need to relate only to future income years. Nevertheless it is important to have the ability to backdate changes as taxpayers may subsequently realise that a relocation expense item that they have been paying or reimbursing tax- free in the past has been omitted from the list and it should be on the list. Recommendation That submissions recommending a mechanism be put in place so that the determination can be amended easily as omissions are identified and agreed; and that the Commissioner be able to add and delete items from the list, provided the Commissioner gives adequate notice of any amendment be accepted. Note that the draft legislation already provides for this. That the submission recommending that the list be fixed in relation to earlier income years be declined. Issue: Nature of the list – inclusive or definitive Clause 485 Submissions (24 –New Zealand Law Society, 32 – KPMG, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The list should be an “inclusive” list. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The relocation expenses that can be reimbursed tax-free should not be restricted to a list determined by the Commissioner as this will unnecessarily constrain employers in the types of reimbursements that they make, and the list could become outdated. The legislation could establish broad principles, coupled with a list of common expenses. If the list approach is to be retained: • the types of expenses should be broadly defined; and • there should be no restrictions based on monetary limits, either as an overall cap or for specific items. (KPMG) The determination should be kept as general as possible. A finite list may result in some valid employee relocation payments being denied tax-free status to which they should be entitled. (New Zealand Law Society) 61 Comment A list of all eligible relocation expenses provides greater control and certainty over the expenses that would be tax-exempt than the converse approach of allowing any expenses other than those on an ineligible list or having a list that provides just examples of the main items that would be included. This is why the legislation provides for a list that covers all eligible expenses. Submissions on an earlier version of the list indicated a preference for more detail rather than broadly defined items – for example, whether an amount includes GST, or specifying insurance separately rather than referring to just removal costs. We agree that there should not be an overall cap on the amount of relocation expenditure and none is included in the legislation. A concern with placing a cap on the amount of exempt expenses is that it could preclude some socially optimal relocations because it would not recognise variations in employees’ costs, which can be significant, depending on factors such as an employee’s family size. Also, with the exception of the catch-all for miscellaneous relocation expenditure, no dollar limits are contemplated for individual items on the list. Recommendation That the submission that the list just provide an indication or examples of the types of expenditure that would be eligible be declined. That the submission that there should not be an overall cap on the amount of relocation expenditure be accepted, and note that none is included in the legislation. Issue: Mechanism for claiming overpaid tax in previous periods Clauses 35, 548 and 616 Submissions (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) A special legislative mechanism should be introduced so employers can claim overpaid tax. Inland Revenue should provide guidance on what will constitute “corroborating material” when making a claim. Inland Revenue should establish a simple procedure for employers to claim past overpaid FBT and provide guidance to employers on how to claim a refund. 62 Comment Given that the legislative changes in relation to relocation and overtime meal payments are being backdated to the 2002–03 income year, some taxpayers will be entitled to a credit for over-paid tax if they paid tax on past qualifying payments. These adjustments will be handled through Inland Revenue’s standard administrative practices. Section 113 of the Tax Administration Act enables the Commissioner to amend the relevant assessments. Our information is that adjustments are likely to be claimed only in relation to some relocation payments. There was general agreement with the suggestion in the officials’ issues paper of November 2007 that employers should receive the credit for over-paid PAYE when they have grossed-up the payment to compensate the employee for the tax impost. The issues paper also noted that a special legislative mechanism might be needed to achieve this. On further consideration, a special legislative mechanism was decided not to be necessary. Inland Revenue already has administrative practices in place that enable credits to be given for over-payments of PAYE. An employer can request an adjustment to a past employer monthly schedule, which the Commissioner will do on the receipt of corroborating material. Similarly, as would normally occur, employers receiving these credits should be adjusting their taxable income when they have treated the past PAYE payment as a cost of business. This process may involve employers incurring some additional compliance costs but our assumption is that there are not many employers who have paid tax on the payments and not significant numbers of employees involved. Trying to set up a special process for employers proved to be too complicated given the need to also give some employees adjustments to redress the fact that they will have received lower entitlements (for example, for family assistance) and had higher liabilities (for example, child support) as a result of the payments being previously subject to income tax. Employers who have overpaid fringe benefit tax on relocation benefits will be able to obtain a credit for that overpaid fringe benefit tax by amending the relevant FBT returns. We consider this to be a relatively simple mechanism. Guidance on what would be expected, including in terms of corroborating evidence, will be provided in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin which will be published once the bill has been enacted. Recommendation That the submission for a special legislative mechanism to enable employers to claim overpaid tax be declined. That the submission that Inland Revenue provide guidance on what will constitute “corroborating material” when making a claim, be accepted and note that this will be covered in a Tax Information Bulletin. 63 That the submission that Inland Revenue establish a simple procedure for employers to claim past overpaid FBT and provide guidance to employers on how to claim a refund be accepted, and note that the mechanism will be through the standard approach of an employer revising its relevant FBT returns. Issue: Application to expatriate employees Clauses 35, 548, 616 and 619 Submission (32 – KPMG) Further consideration should be given to expatriate employees who have been relocated from one jurisdiction to another. For example, the treatment of additional taxes payable as a consequence of the employee being assigned. Comment The proposed legislative changes in relation to relocation payments are intended to cover not only relocations within New Zealand but also relocations out of and into New Zealand. The changes are of relevance to those employees who are relocating out of New Zealand if they retain their tax residence in New Zealand, which is the case for public servants who are posted overseas. The draft list of eligible relocation expenses reflects this wide range of possible relocations. Submissions on that list will be considered over the coming months. Tax-free reimbursement of ongoing costs is not considered, however, to be appropriate as these are more akin to salary and wages substitutes. There is a range of allowances that employees receive that are currently treated as taxable and should continue to be treated as such. Cost of living allowances and tax equalisation allowances are two examples. The fact that taxes and/or living costs are higher in a country would normally be reflected in the salaries paid in those countries and should not be considered a relocation expense. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 64 Issue: Interrelationship with accommodation element of employment income Clause 21 Submission (32 – KPMG) In relation to accommodation, there should be an exemption provided under section CE 1(c) to mirror the amendments to section CX 19(1)(b) to exempt amounts that, if they had been paid, would be exempt income under section CW 17B. Comment Section CE 1(c) ensures that the market value of accommodation provided by an employer to an employee is income to the employee. If the provision of accommodation would qualify as an eligible relocation expense, it should be excluded from being income to the employee. Consequently, officials agree with the submission that section CE 1(c) should be amended accordingly. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Interrelationship with entertainment tax Clauses 35, 548 and 616 Submissions (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, matter raised by officials) The limitation rule in the entertainment tax rules that limits entertainment expenditure deductions to 50 percent should not apply to payments for overtime meals. Section DD 4(3) of the Income Tax Act should be amended so that it refers also to new section CW 17C. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Expenditure on meals that qualifies as eligible relocation expenditure should also be exempted from the limitation on entertainment expenditure deductions. (Matter raised by officials) Comment Officials agree that section DD 4(3), which specifically excludes expenditure on overtime meals from the limitation on entertainment expenditure deductions should, as a consequence of the changes in the bill, refer to section CW 17C rather than section CW 17 as it currently does. 65 Furthermore, we consider that the expenditure on meals that qualifies as eligible relocation expenditure should also be exempt from the limitation on entertainment expenditure deductions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. That expenditure on meals that qualify as eligible relocation expenditure should also be exempt from the limitation on entertainment expenditure deductions. 66 OTHER CONSEQUENTIAL CHANGES Clauses 35, 548 and 616 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Several references in other sections of the Income Tax Act that currently refer to the main provision that determines whether allowances are taxable or non-taxable also need to refer to the new provisions relating to relocation payments and overtime meal allowances. The relevant sections in the 2007 Act are: • section DD 10(a) relating to reimbursement and apportionment of entertainment expenditure; • section EA 3(7) relating to prepayments; and • definition of “employee” in section YA 1. Comparable changes are also needed in the 2004 and 1994 Income Tax Acts. Comment These amendments are merely consequential changes as a result of carving out the relocation payments and overtime meal allowances from the more general provision that determines whether allowances are taxable or non-taxable. The amendments ensure that the rules covered by the amendments (as referred to above) continue to apply also to the two carved out allowances. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 67 MEAL ALLOWANCES Issue: Definition of “overtime” Clauses 35, 548 and 619 Submission (46 – Employers and Manufacturers Association (Northern), 54 – Business New Zealand) The words “when the employee has worked more than two hours beyond their ordinary hours on the day” should be omitted from the meaning of “overtime” in clause 35 of the bill. Comment The submission seems to be concerned that the current wording of the “overtime” definition implies that two hours overtime must be worked before an employee is eligible to be paid for overtime. Officials are not convinced that this is the implication and it certainly was not the intention of the current wording in the bill. However, to remove any doubt we agree that the two-hour reference can be removed from the definition of “overtime”. Given that this time limit is important, we recommend that it be included instead in section CW 17C(2) as one of the eligibility requirements for the meal to be exempt. We have discussed this change with Business New Zealand, and they are comfortable with it. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Requirement to do at least two hours overtime Clauses 35, 548 and 619 Submission (68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The requirement that at least two hours of overtime has to be worked is too strict, particularly for certain types of workers. Consequently, there should be no time limit and instead meal allowances should not be taxable as long as the payment of the allowance is not a substitute for the employee’s ordinary remuneration. Or the definition of “overtime” could be buttressed by excluding any arrangements which have been entered into for the purpose of defeating the intention of the exemption. 68 Comment A time limit is important to avoid an employee working only a few minutes of overtime to get a non-taxable overtime meal allowance. Officials understand that two hours is the standard time that employers require before they pay an overtime meal allowance so this limit should fit with current practice. Having instead a specific rule in relation to overtime that either excluded salary substitutes or any arrangements which have been entered into for the purpose of defeating the intention of the exemption would likely create uncertainty about what it meant in practice. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Overtime meal allowances determined by industrial awards Clauses 35, 548 and 619 Submission (68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The rules on the documentary evidence required to support the quantum of allowance paid should be relaxed to specifically state that an amount determined with reference to an industrial award satisfies the evidential requirements. Comment Officials consider it is important that the amounts paid for overtime meals should either represent actual costs incurred or a reasonable estimate of those costs rather than having particular amounts automatically sanctioned. If amounts are paid out with no intention of expenditure actually being incurred, the amount paid equates to a salary substitute and should be taxed. We consider that the draft legislation is already sufficiently wide to accommodate the situation raised in the submission and, consequently, we would generally expect there to be no issue in terms of amounts specified in industrial awards qualifying in practice. As the submission acknowledges, this would arguably already be covered by the legislation on the assumption that the award amounts are based on a reasonable estimate of the costs to be incurred. Furthermore, verification is not required if the actual amount spent is under $20. We do, however, agree with the alternative suggestion that any concerns in this regard could be addressed through the commentary in the Tax Information Bulletin to be published by Inland Revenue after the bill’s enactment. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 69 Issue: Meals provided to postal delivery workers Clauses 35, 548 and 619 Submission (74 & 74A – Deloitte) The exemption for overtime meals should extend to cover meal allowances paid to postal delivery workers actively involved in the delivery of mail. Comment Deloitte is raising this matter on behalf of NZ Post Limited which has several thousand postal workers that carry out their employment duties outside. These employees do not have access to the usual employer-provided drink facilities that employees working in offices would normally have access to. NZ Post indicates that this liquid refreshment (which includes energy drinks) is particularly needed given the physical activity being undertaken by the postal workers actively involved in delivering mail. Moreover, because these workers are required to carry bags of mail, either on foot or by bicycle, they do not have the capacity to carry the energy drinks with them. NZ Post consequently provides a daily “meal” allowance of around $14, so employees can purchase the required refreshments along the work route if the employee completes 7.5 hours of work on the day. This is consistent with ensuring the health and safety of these employees. NZ Post has been treating this allowance as non- taxable for decades. On average, a postal worker would receive around $300 from these allowances, with their wages being $30,000 to $40,000 a year. Officials agree that this meal allowance should be non-taxable and recommend that the legislative changes be widened to encompass it. It recognises the additional costs associated with the particular situation and even though it covers a “meal” which would be of private benefit, it also covers refreshments (adjusted for the relevant circumstances) that are normally provided by employers at no cost to their employees. We do not, however, consider that the draft legislative changes suggested in the submission are the best way to achieve this (for example, there is no need for a cut-off date and to refer to health and safety). Instead we envisage exempting sustenance payments using generic wording that picks up a number of the key attributes of a postal delivery worker’s job, which in combination are seemingly unique, as follows: • the employees employment agreement requires them mainly to work outdoors; and • to undertake a long period of physical activity that does not take place in a single location; and • the employee works a minimum of seven hours on the day the allowance relates to, without recourse to the employer’s premises; and 70 • because of the nature of the employee’s work, it is not practicable on the day for the employer to provide refreshments as an employer would in the normal course of their business. We will continue to discuss the exemption wording with the submitter. As a consequential change, the sustenance payment should also be exempted from entertainment tax. Recommendation That the submission, as modified, be accepted. Issue: Defining “meals” Clauses 35, 548 and 619 Submission (74 – Deloitte) A definition of “meals” should be included in the legislation to ensure that it covers drinks as well as food. Comment This submission was made with reference to the previous submission on postal delivery workers. The submission’s concern is that “meal” could be interpreted to be restricted to “food” and, therefore, would not include a situation such as that of the postal delivery workers, when drinks or energy drinks are purchased and consumed. “Food” according to the Oxford dictionary means any substance taken in to maintain life and growth. This would seem to be wide enough to cover drink. Moreover, tax case law has indicated that drink can form part of a meal. In these circumstances it seems unnecessary to define “meals”. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 71 Payroll giving 72 73 OVERVIEW Clauses 232, 233, 235, 236, 379, 384, 402, 403, 408(23), 408(38), 408(89), 408(99), 442(1) and (3), 443, 447, 458 and 504 Eleven submissions were received on the proposed payroll-giving scheme. Five confirmed their support for the concept of payroll giving and the tax credit mechanism of delivering tax relief on payroll donations. Even so, most submissions were concerned to ensure that the compliance costs of the scheme for employers were kept to an absolute minimum, otherwise the benefits of the scheme might not be fully realised. A common theme throughout submissions was the need to provide greater clarity in legislation on the following matters: • that participation in payroll giving is voluntary for employers and employees; • the roles and responsibilities of employers, employees and donee organisations; and • sanctions for non-compliance. For the most part officials agree with the submissions as they would ensure that underlying policy intentions are achieved, improving the overall integrity of the scheme. A further prevailing theme in submissions has been the desire for the legislation to prescribe the details of the payroll-giving scheme arrangement. As proposed, the bill simply provides for the tax mechanism to deliver tax relief for payroll donations on a pay-period basis. It does not prescribe the nature of the arrangements or relationships between employers, employees and donee organisations, or how the schemes should be set up. Matters that would need to be decided upon by the relevant parties include: • the process for establishing a scheme that works best for all parties concerned; • the use of intermediaries; • the level of employee education about payroll giving; • the process for selecting donee organisations to participate in the scheme; • the number of donee organisations that can participate in the scheme; • the level of engagement between donee organisations and employee donors; and • any minimum payroll donation threshold. The non-prescriptive nature of the proposed scheme is intended to provide flexibility to allow relevant parties to work together to establish schemes that work best for them and to manage the associated costs. A key policy outcome of payroll giving is that it has the potential to establish genuine partnerships between businesses and the community, while supporting employees’ community activities. 74 The voluntary nature of the scheme also reflects the ethos of giving, and sets up a system that facilitates, but does not mandate, giving. We propose to outline these points in Inland Revenue’s publication, Tax Information Bulletin, which will be published following enactment of the bill. The proposed scheme would deliver payday tax relief on payroll donations by way of a tax credit. Employees would receive a tax credit on the amount of their donation made each payday. Employers would offset the credit against the PAYE calculated on the employee’s gross pay. The tax credit would be calculated on the set rate of 33⅓%. Employees who make payroll donations would not have to keep receipts or wait until the end of the year to claim the tax benefit of their donations. The scheme would also operate in addition to the current end-of-year tax credit claim system. Therefore, employees who do not or are not able to give through payroll giving can still claim tax relief on their donations through the end-of-year process. 75 SUPPORT FOR PAYROLL GIVING Submission (19 – Volunteering New Zealand, 24 – New Zealand Law Society, 32 – KPMG, 37 – Inter-Church Working Party on Taxation, 62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) The submissions support the concept of payroll giving and the tax credit mechanism for delivering the tax relief. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 76 “VOLUNTARY” NATURE OF THE SCHEME Clause 236 Issue: Participation in payroll giving should be voluntary for employers Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 37 – Inter-Church Working Party on Taxation, 46 – Employers and Manufacturers Association (Northern), 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The bill should clearly provide that payroll giving is voluntary for employers and employees. Comment Proposed section LD 4 provides that tax credits for payroll donations are available to a person who is an employee whose employer files their employer monthly schedule 1 electronically and who chooses to make a payroll donation in a pay-period. This section suggests that if an employee chooses to make a payroll donation, his or her employer is obliged to offer payroll giving. This outcome was not intended. Participation in payroll giving is intended to be voluntary for both employers and employees. To correct this matter, officials recommend that proposed section LD 4 be amended to make it clear that the scheme is also voluntary for employers. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Employers would be morally obliged to offer payroll giving to their employees Submission (68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The scheme might not necessarily be voluntary for employers in practice. Should an employee express a desire to participate in payroll giving, employers could feel morally obliged to offer the scheme to their employees even though the scheme is intended to be voluntary for employers. If the employer chooses not to offer payroll giving, they could be seen as socially irresponsible and could portray their organisation in an unfavourable light. 1 An employer monthly schedule provides pay-period information on employee salaries and wages, PAYE deductions and other social policy-related deductions. 77 Comment Officials acknowledge the point made in this submission. Even so, payroll giving is all about establishing genuine partnerships between the parties concerned. The voluntary nature of the scheme should enable employers to weigh up the potential compliance costs of offering payroll giving to their employees against the benefits in the context of corporate social responsibility and the possibility of aligning their business objectives with the work of certain community organisations. It is also noted that the scheme will operate in addition to the current end-of-year tax credit claim system. Therefore, employees who do not or are not able to give through payroll giving could still claim tax relief on their donations through the end-of-year process. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 78 THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR PARTICIPATING IN THE SCHEME Clause 236 Issue: Extend payroll giving to all employers Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Payroll giving should be made available to all employers and not just to those who file their employer monthly schedules electronically. Comment As mentioned previously, employers are required to electronically file their employer monthly schedules before they can participate in payroll giving. This requirement was necessary because the paper form of the employer monthly schedule could not be easily amended to capture the relevant payroll donation information. Therefore, it was not practicable to extend payroll giving to employers who file their employer monthly schedules in paper form. Officials note that any employer with access to a computer and the internet can file electronically using Inland Revenue’s secure IR-file system. Inland Revenue provides relevant support and education to employers who choose to file their employer monthly schedules in this way. As already noted, if an employee wishes to make a donation and their employer does not file their employer monthly schedule electronically, the employee can use the current end-of year tax credit claim process. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Employers who offer payroll giving should be required to electronically file their PAYE income payment forms Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment to the eligibility criteria in proposed section LD 4 is necessary to require employers to file their PAYE income payment forms electronically. 79 Comment Like the paper form of the employer monthly schedule, there are space limitations in the paper form of the PAYE income payment form. The PAYE income payment form contains summary PAYE and other deductions information and accompanies the payment of PAYE. Officials consider that this requirement should be part of the eligibility criteria for employers who wish to offer payroll giving to their employees. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Payroll giving should be available to people who earn income from employment Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment to the eligibility criteria in proposed section LD 4 is necessary to clarify that people who earn income from employment are able to participate in a payroll-giving scheme. Comment As currently drafted, the bill would treat the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC), the Ministry of Social Development and Inland Revenue as employers when payments of ACC compensation and attendant care payments, paid parental leave and means-tested benefits are made. This outcome was not intended. Payroll giving was intended to apply to employees who earn income in connection with their employment. People who receive payments of ACC compensation and attendant care payments, paid parental leave and means-tested benefits should not be permitted to make payroll donations from these payments. Officials note that there would be practical difficulties in making payroll giving available to people who receive such payments. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 80 Issue: Employees having satisfied their tax and other statutory obligations Submission (32 – KPMG, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The bill should be amended to allow the employer to rely on the statement or assurance given by the employee that they have satisfied any tax obligation that they may have or any other statutory requirement that they may be obliged to meet from their salary and wages. This would help to minimise compliance costs for employers. Furthermore, any subsequent square-up should be between the employee and Inland Revenue. Comment Proposed section LD 7 provides that a person could only make payroll donations for a pay-period if they have satisfied all of their tax obligations (including, student loan and child support payments and KiwiSaver obligations) and any statutory requirements that they are obliged to meet from their wage and salary income. This requirement was intended to ensure that people paid their tax and social policy obligations from their employment income before making payroll donations. It was also intended that this requirement would apply on a pay-period basis. As drafted, the bill does not impose any requirement on employers to verify that an employee is meeting all of their tax and other statutory obligations from their salary and wages before making any payroll donations. This aspect would help to reduce compliance costs on employers. We consider that in practice the employer would make the required pay-period tax and social policy deductions and any other deductions required to be made from an employee’s salary and, if there are sufficient funds, make the necessary adjustments for payroll donations. Officials also consider that proposed section LD 7 should be amended so that it better reflects the stated policy intention. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but that proposed section LD 7 be amended so that it better reflects the stated policy intention. 81 THREE-MONTH TIMEFRAME FOR TRANSFERRING PAYROLL DONATIONS Clause 447 Submission (19 – Volunteering New Zealand, 24 – New Zealand Law Society, 62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) The three-month timeframe for payroll donations should be shortened. This period is too long given the potential for an employer to become insolvent in the current economic environment. Comment Proposed section 24Q of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires employers or PAYE intermediaries to transfer payroll donations to the relevant recipient donee organisations within three months from the end of the pay-period in which the donations were deducted from the employee’s pay. The three-month timeframe is designed to encourage employers to transfer payroll donations to the relevant recipient donee organisations in a timely manner. It also seeks to help offset some of the employer compliance costs associated with the administration of the scheme by transferring small amounts of money to donee organisations frequently. In the event of an employer becoming insolvent and any payroll donations not being transferred to the relevant recipients, the tax credit for those payroll donations would be extinguished and the employer would be responsible for paying the resulting shortfall in PAYE. This is further discussed under the section Issue: Shortfall in PAYE when a payroll donation tax credit is extinguished. Additionally, the employee would have recourse to the employer for the payroll donations not transferred, a matter also discussed under the section Issue: Payroll donations held in trust for employees. On balance, officials consider it important to minimise as far as practicable the compliance costs for employers. The three-month timeframe helps to achieve this result. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 82 PAYROLL DONATIONS SHOULD BE HELD IN TRUST FOR EMPLOYEES Submission (19 – Volunteering New Zealand, 24 – New Zealand Law Society, 62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) The bill should provide that payroll donations are held in trust for employees until those donations have been transferred to the relevant recipient organisations. Submissions raised concerns about the risk of employers becoming insolvent and the employees losing their entitlement to payroll donations that have not yet been transferred to the relevant recipient organisations. Comment The proposed scheme is silent on whether payroll donations held by the employer during the three-month timeframe are held in trust for employees or the donee organisations. Officials consider that payroll donations that have not been transferred should be held in trust for the employees. As previously mentioned, in the event of an insolvency the payroll donation tax credit would be extinguished and the employer would become liable to the resulting shortfall in PAYE. Additionally, the employee would have the right to claim compensation or redress from the employer for the payroll donations that had not been transferred. If payroll donations were treated as being held in trust for the employee, the employee’s claim on the assets or income of the employer would be treated in the same way as trust monies. Officials agree with this submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 83 TRANSFERRING PAYROLL DONATIONS TO DONEE ORGANISATIONS Clause 447 Issue: Responsibility for confirming the status of donee organisations Submissions (24 – New Zealand Law Society, 32 – KPMG, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 37 – Inter-Church Working Party on Taxation, 62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Employees should be responsible for ensuring that payroll donations are made to an eligible recipient of a payroll donation and required to confirm that a recipient entity is in fact a donee organisation. It would be unfair to place the onus on employers as it could expose them to claims from their employees for compensation for not determining properly the eligibility of the recipient entity. (New Zealand Law Society, Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Employers should be responsible for ensuring that payroll donations are made to a donee organisation. This is simply a matter of checking that a chosen entity is listed on Inland Revenue’s website as a “donee organisation”. (Inter-Church Working Party on Taxation) Employers should not be responsible for monitoring the list of eligible organisations to ensure that the selected donee organisations are still entitled to receive charitable donations. Otherwise, employers would face significant compliance costs given the potential large range of donee organisations employees could ask donations to be made to. For example, there are 1,334 donee organisations with names beginning with the letter “A” alone. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Inland Revenue should provide further guidance to employers on what entities are donee organisations. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment To be eligible to receive tax relief on payroll donations, these donations must be provided to a donee organisation. Proposed section 24Q of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires employers to check that the recipient entity chosen by the employee is in fact a donee organisation. A donee organisation is an organisation that is approved by Inland Revenue or that is approved by Parliament and listed in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007. A full list of donee organisations can be found at www.ird.govt.nz. 84 Officials consider that given the accessibility of the Inland Revenue list of donee organisations, it seems reasonable to require employers to check whether an entity is on the list. Employers can manage the compliance costs associated with this requirement by limiting the number of donee organisations that can participate in their payroll-giving scheme. Furthermore, this requirement does not preclude employers from requiring that their employees confirm if the chosen organisation is a donee organisation. Therefore, officials do not recommend any change to the legislation. We agree, however, that Inland Revenue could raise employer and employee awareness about the donee organisation list through Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That responsibility for confirming the status of eligible recipients should remain with the employer. That Inland Revenue publicise the donee organisation list. Issue: Record-keeping requirements to verify the transfer of payroll donations Submission (32 KPMG, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The record-keeping requirements for verifying that payroll donations have been transferred to the correct donee organisation should be clarified. Comment Proposed sections 22(2)(ed) and 22(2)(ke) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provide that employers must maintain sufficient records to enable Inland Revenue to determine the transfer of an employee’s payroll donation to the recipient of that donation. Officials consider an employer’s bank statement showing the transfer of funds to the recipient would constitute a sufficient record. This matter should be clarified in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin, which will be published following enactment of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 85 Issue: Donee organisations should issue receipts for payroll donations Submissions (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The bill should require that the entity receiving a payroll donation issues a receipt or other form of acknowledgement to the employee. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Inland Revenue should also have mechanisms in place to ensure it can determine when a donation has not been paid to the relevant recipient, or when the recipient is not an eligible donee organisation. For example, the issuing of a tax invoice by the recipient could be an appropriate audit mechanism to ensure payments have been received, and to confirm which entity has received them. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment As proposed, there is no requirement in the bill for donee organisations to issue receipts to employees who have made payroll donations. The reason for this was to avoid the potential for “double-dipping” – where employees claim tax relief on their payroll donations throughout the year and then use the receipt to claim the tax credit through the end-of-year tax credit claim process. Because of the potential threat of double-dipping, we do not recommend that donee organisations who receive payroll donations be required to issue receipts to employees. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Disclosure of the name of the recipient organisation to Inland Revenue Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The name of the recipient organisation should be included in the employer monthly schedule. Requiring employers to keep a record, and file details with Inland Revenue of the entities to whom an employee has made a donation, would be a way of monitoring whether donations have been paid to eligible entities and provide an audit trail when determining whether a payroll donation has in fact been transferred. 86 Comment Officials do not consider it necessary for employers to provide the name of the recipient organisation in the employer monthly schedule. The proposed record- keeping and disclosure requirements should be sufficient for Inland Revenue to undertake effective audits of payroll-giving schemes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 87 SHORTFALL IN PAYE WHEN A PAYROLL DONATION TAX CREDIT IS EXTINGUISHED Clause 236 Issue: Incorrect calculation of the payroll donation tax credit Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The bill should clarify who is responsible for correcting any errors in calculating the payroll-giving tax credit and the process and timeframe to be followed. Comment Under current law, the responsibility for correcting errors that flow through the employer monthly schedule rests with the employer (section RD 4(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007). As the payroll donation tax credit flows through the employer monthly schedule and affects the amount of PAYE payable by the employee, the employer would be responsible for correcting any errors relating to the tax credit. The process for correcting these errors would require the employer to contact Inland Revenue about the relevant adjustments to be made. If the employer does not correct the error, proposed section LD 5 would apply. Section LD 5 provides that an incorrect tax credit is extinguished and the correct amount is included in the employee’s tax credits for PAYE income payments (salary and wages) for the tax year under section LB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Officials consider that the process and responsibility for correcting any errors in PAYE resulting from an incorrectly calculated payroll donation credit should follow the current process for correcting shortfalls in PAYE. These matters should also be fully explained in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin, which is published following enactment of the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and that the process and responsibility for correcting any errors in PAYE resulting from an incorrectly calculated payroll donation credit should follow the current process for correcting errors in PAYE. That this process should be further explained in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin on the legislation. 88 Issue: Employer fails to transfer the payroll donation to the relevant recipient Submissions (32 – KPMG, 62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The bill should clarify what happens when a tax credit is extinguished as a result of an employer failing to pass on payroll donations, and who is responsible for correcting the resulting shortfall in PAYE. (KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) If the employer fails to transfer an employee’s payroll donation in circumstances where an eligible recipient has been identified, Inland Revenue should not be able to recover the shortfall in PAYE from the employee. (Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Comment Proposed section LD 6(1)(a) provides that when an employer fails to transfer payroll donations to the relevant recipients within the three-month timeframe, the payroll donation tax credit is extinguished. If this occurs, the employee would have an additional PAYE liability to pay for the relevant pay-period. Under current law, the employer is responsible for deducting PAYE from an employee’s pay and then paying this amount to Inland Revenue. If there is a shortfall in PAYE deducted from the employee’s pay, the employer is also responsible for correcting and paying this shortfall. As the payroll-giving tax credit is treated in the same manner as PAYE, it follows that the employer would be responsible for correcting any shortfalls in PAYE resulting from the extinguishment of a payroll donation tax credit. If the employer fails to correct the shortfall, the employee would be expected to do so as provided in section RD 4(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section 168 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. If the failure on the part of the employer is a simple mistake – for example, the employer inadvertently transfers the payroll donations to the wrong recipient, the employer could be expected to take remedial action to correct the mistake and, if so, the tax credit should be reinstated. If the failure on the part of the employer is deliberate – for example, the employer pockets the payroll donations or the employer knowingly transfers the payroll donation to the wrong recipient, the tax credit should be extinguished and the correct amount included in the employee’s tax credits for PAYE income payments under section LB 1 – that is, it is corrected as part of the end-of-year square-up process. Because the shortfall arises from a deliberate act of the employer, it would be unnecessary to provide for the payroll donation tax credit to be reinstated. In the event that the employer fails to correct the shortfall, Inland Revenue would recover the amount from the employee. Although this approach might seem unfair given that the shortfall arises due to employer fault, it is important to remember that the employee would be able to seek compensation or redress from the employer for failing to transfer the payroll donations to the relevant recipient. 89 The penalties for employers failing to transfer payroll donations to the relevant recipients are explained in the next section of this report, “Penalties”. Recommendation That the submissions be declined, and the process and responsibility for correcting any shortfall in PAYE resulting from the employer failing to transfer payroll donations to the relevant recipient should follow the current process for correcting shortfalls in PAYE. Issue: Employer transfers the payroll donation to an ineligible recipient Submission (68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The bill should clarify what happens when a tax credit is extinguished as a result of an employer mistakenly transferring the donations to an ineligible recipient. If employers have taken reasonable care in determining that the tax credit applies – for example, by checking that the relevant charity is listed with the Charities Commission, the tax credit should not be adjusted. Comment Proposed section LD 6(1)(b) provides that when an employer transfers the payroll donation to an ineligible recipient, the payroll donation tax credit is extinguished. If this occurs, the employee would have an additional PAYE liability to pay for the relevant pay-period. As outlined in Issue: Employer fails to transfer the payroll donation to the relevant recipient, the process and responsibility for correcting errors and paying any shortfall as a result of the payroll donation tax credit being extinguished should follow the current process for correcting shortfalls in PAYE. If the failure on the part of the employer is a simple mistake – for example, the employer mistakenly transfers the donations to an ineligible recipient, the employer could be expected to take remedial action to correct the mistake and the tax credit should be reinstated. If the failure on the part of the employer is deliberate – for example, the employer deliberately or knowingly transfers payroll donations to an ineligible recipient, the tax credit should be extinguished and the correct amount included in the employee’s tax credits for PAYE income payments under section LB 1 and corrected as part of the end-of-year square-up process. Because the shortfall arises from a deliberate act of the employer, it would be unnecessary to provide for the payroll-giving tax credit to be reinstated. In the event that the employer fails to correct the shortfall, Inland Revenue would recover the amount from the employee, as discussed in the previous item. 90 The penalties for employers failing to transfer payroll donations to the relevant recipients are set out in the next section, “Penalties”. Recommendation That the submission be declined, and the process and responsibility for correcting any shortfall in PAYE resulting from the employer failing to transfer payroll donations to the relevant recipient should follow the current process for correcting shortfalls in PAYE. 91 PENALTIES – CLARIFYING THE SANCTIONS FOR NON- COMPLIANCE Submissions (32 – KPMG, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Clarification should be provided on what penalties, if any, should apply if the failure to transfer payroll donations to a relevant recipient is not deliberate. (KPMG) The bill should clarify who bears the cost of errors and what penalties, if any, would be imposed if a false donation claim is filed. Any penalties and costs imposed on employers as a result of errors should be minimised. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) If employers have taken reasonable care in determining the tax credit applies – for example, by checking that the relevant charity is listed with the Charities Commission, the tax credit should not be adjusted and no penalties or use-of-money interest should be payable. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment Proposed section RD 2(1)(b) provides that the payroll donation tax credit provisions are part of the PAYE rules. Therefore, the normal penalty and use-of-money-interest charges that apply to the determination and payment of PAYE also apply to the payroll donation tax credit. It would be a question of fact and degree whether the current late payment penalties or any of the shortfall penalties would apply and application of penalties would be on a case-by-case basis. The only additional penalty for payroll giving is contained in proposed section 141E (1)(c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This provides that employers are subject to a 150% penalty for evasion if the employer knowingly does not transfer the payroll donations to a relevant recipient within the three-month timeframe, or the donation is passed to an ineligible recipient. The penalty is imposed on the payroll donation tax credit that is extinguished, because the credit would represent the short-paid PAYE. Officials agree that the interrelationship between the payroll-giving provisions, the PAYE rules and the penalty and use-of-money interest rules should be clarified. This clarification should be outlined in Inland Revenue’s publication, the Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Further clarification on how the PAYE rules, the penalty and use-of-money interest rules and the specific tax evasion penalty for payroll giving should be provided in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin. 92 APPLICATION DATE Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) There should be at least six months from the date the legislation is passed into law until the date the scheme is implemented. Comment Officials note that the application date for the scheme needs to be reviewed. The bill envisages the scheme coming into operation from 1 April 2009. However, employers cannot begin the scheme until the bill has been enacted or they would be acting outside the law. Employers and payroll software designers also need time to promote the scheme to employees and build the necessary changes into their software packages. Inland Revenue also needs time to communicate the changes and amend its systems. This suggests the application date should be set on a date that is after the bill has been enacted. On the other hand, the payroll-giving scheme is keenly awaited by charities and should therefore be available as soon as is practicable after enactment rather than waiting until the start of an income year (for example, 2010–11). After consideration of all of these factors, we recommend that the legislation for the payroll giving scheme should take effect three months after the date of enactment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part, but that the application date for the proposed scheme apply three months after the bill has been enacted. 93 MINIMUM PAYROLL DONATION AMOUNT Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 37 – Inter-Church Working Group on Taxation) There should be a minimum donation amount to any one recipient before the payroll- giving tax credit is available. Comment No minimum payroll donation amount was specified under the payroll-giving scheme. In line with the non-prescriptive nature of the proposed payroll giving scheme, it was decided that this would be left to the employer and employee to determine any minimum threshold. Submissions noted that a minimum donation amount would be consistent with the current donation tax credit system. Under that system individuals must make a cash donation of at least $5 to a single donee organisation before the tax credit can be claimed at the end of the year. Officials do not support prescribing a minimum payroll donation amount in legislation as we consider that this could deter employees from participating in payroll giving. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 94 CONSISTENCY WITH YEAR-END TAX CREDIT SYSTEM Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Differences between the end-of-year donation tax credit scheme and the proposed payroll-giving scheme should be kept to a minimum. Individuals who are able to participate in payroll giving will be in a better position than those who are not able to do so because of the time value of money. To address this difference, those individuals who are unable to participate in payroll giving should be allowed to claim tax credits on their donations on a monthly or quarterly basis. Comment Officials agree that the differences between the end-of-year tax credit scheme and the payroll-giving scheme should be kept to a minimum. However, we acknowledge that there will be some differences because of the specific design features of each scheme. We do not support allowing individuals to claim the end-of-year donation tax credit throughout the year either on a monthly or quarterly basis because: • the donation tax credit applies to donations up to an individual’s taxable income for the year in which the donations are made; and • there would be significant administrative costs associated with allowing tax credit claims during the year. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 95 TWO RATES FOR THE PAYROLL DONATION TAX CREDIT Submission (24 – New Zealand Law Society) The payroll-giving tax credit should have the following two rates: • 33⅓% for employees earning less than the threshold for the top marginal income tax (currently $70,000); and • 39% for employees earning greater than the threshold for the top marginal income tax rate. The New Zealand Law Society is concerned that the proposed flat tax credit rate of 33⅓% will discourage employees in the 39% marginal income tax bracket from making charitable donations. The Society considers that if the rationale behind the payroll-giving scheme is to create the foundation for a stronger culture of giving in New Zealand, higher income earners should be given a full deduction through a 39% PAYE tax credit to encourage them to make donations. Comment The single rate of 33⅓% was adopted to ensure consistency with the tax benefit delivered under the current donation tax credit system and is considered to be more equitable because all employees receive the same tax benefit regardless of their marginal tax rate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 96 ALTERNATIVE GIVING OPTIONS FOR EMPLOYEES Submission (54 – Business New Zealand, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Inland Revenue should have a communications programme established around alternative solutions if an employee wishes to give through their payroll, but is unable to with their current employer. Comment Inland Revenue, the Office for the Community and Voluntary Sector and the Treasury are developing a communication and assistance plan to help raise public awareness and encourage take-up of the tax and charitable-giving initiatives. These initiatives include the lifting of the caps on charitable donations made by individuals and companies (which applied from 1 April 2008), the proposed payroll-giving scheme and clarifying the tax rules for volunteer reimbursements and honoraria. The communications plan will state that the only alternative to payroll giving for donors is to give directly to donee organisations and to claim the tax benefit on their cash donations at the end of the tax year. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 97 TAX DEDUCTION MECHANISM Submission (54 – Business New Zealand) A tax deduction mechanism should replace the tax credit mechanism as the mechanism for delivering payroll-giving tax relief. Comment Two options were put forward in the October 2007 discussion document, Payroll giving: providing a real-time benefit for charitable giving – the tax deduction mechanism and the tax credit mechanism. Under the tax deduction mechanism, donations would be deducted from an employee’s gross pay. This would reduce the employee’s taxable income and, as a result, alter the employee’s social policy entitlements and obligations. PAYE would be imposed on the net amount. An immediate tax benefit would be received by way of a reduction in the amount of the PAYE required to be withheld. The tax benefit would be at the employee’s marginal tax rate. Under the tax credit mechanism, employees would receive a tax credit on the amount of their donations made each payday. Employers would offset the credit against the PAYE calculated on the employee’s gross pay, and the tax credit would be calculated on a set rate of 33⅓ percent. The tax credit mechanism was preferred over the tax deduction mechanism as being more equitable because all employees would receive the same tax benefit regardless of their marginal tax rate. Furthermore, the tax credit mechanism does not alter the level of an employee’s taxable income, and therefore does not affect the employee’s social policy entitlements and obligations that use taxation income as the basis of their calculations – for example, Working for Families, student loans, child support and KiwiSaver. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 98 CENTRAL PAYMENT PROVIDER Submissions (64 – Payroll Giving Limited, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The proposed payroll giving scheme should specifically provide for the option of a central payment provider. This would require a two-year “safe harbour” for donors on their annual level of donations relative to their taxable income. This proposal would be compatible with Inland Revenue systems for the exchange of taxpayer data that were implemented for KiwiSaver. (Payroll Giving Limited) Inland Revenue could assume the responsibility for paying the donations made through payroll giving to donee organisations. If Inland Revenue were to administer the scheme, employers could make just the one payment to Inland Revenue, which could more easily distribute the payments to the relevant donee organisations within the three-month timeframe. Furthermore, it would be easier for Inland Revenue to monitor whether the charity is eligible and Inland Revenue would ensure that the money is passed onto the relevant recipient. This would deal with a significant risk of funds being misappropriated by unscrupulous employers, as there are limited checks and balances in place. Employees will have comfort that all funds have been properly passed on to the correct donee organisations. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Corporate Taxpayers Group) In the event that Inland Revenue does not act as a payment intermediary and given the risks for employers in administering the scheme, Inland Revenue should select a small group of approved payment intermediaries. Inland Revenue would be able to more easily monitor the payment intermediaries, rather than the outputs of all the employers in the country. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment Although payment intermediaries may form part of a payroll-giving scheme arrangement, they are not mandatory. This approach provides greater flexibility and choice for employers seeking to offer payroll giving to their employees. It also takes into account the current arrangements that existing employers have in place for directing payroll donations to charitable or philanthropic causes. For example, some employers use United Way as a payment intermediary, while ANZ National Bank has set up its own charitable foundation (which itself is a donee organisation) to determine how its employees’ payroll donations are applied. Officials see clear simplification benefits for employers and employees in using payment intermediaries. However, catering for a central payment provider is likely to involve considerable change to the design of the proposed scheme and significant cost which would defer implementation of payroll giving for at least another 12 months. It may be that the concept of a central payment provider could be revisited after the scheme has “bedded” down. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 99 TECHNICAL AMENDMENT – REMOVING THE NEED TO SPECIFY THE TOTAL DONATION AMOUNT Clause 408(38) Submission (Matter raised by officials) The requirement to specify the “total donation” amount in the employer monthly schedule should be removed as it is unnecessary. Comment The proposed definition of “employer monthly schedule” requires the payroll donation amounts to be specified in the schedule. This explicit requirement is considered unnecessary at this time. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 100 101 Stapled stock provisions (SOP 224) 102 103 OVERVIEW Stapled stock is a debt security attached to a share so that the two must be traded together. Supplementary Order Paper No 224 (SOP) proposes to treat the debt component (referred to here as “stapled debt”) of certain stapled stock instruments as shares for tax purposes, with the interest treated as dividends. The purpose of this proposal is to protect the tax base from excessive interest deductions achieved through these arrangements. Nearly all modern company tax systems hinge on a distinction between debt (money lent, with an expectation of regular income and/or repayment) and equity. “Equity” implies participation in the profits and losses of a company (hence “equity risk”), usually through ordinary shares. New Zealand’s established practice is to tax debt and shares based on their legal form, rather than their economic substance, but with certain specific exceptions where legislation overrides legal form. For example, a “debt” that pays a return dependent on the profits of the company is treated as a share for tax purposes. The government has become concerned that, under the current law, stapled stock could be treated as shares for commercial purposes (such as accounting, regulation and credit rating), but as debt for tax purposes. Even though the interest payment is effectively a substitute for a dividend, the interest would be deductible. Stapled stock could lead to significant revenue loss if issued to non-resident and tax-exempt investors. The matter became urgent in early 2008 when several large, widely held companies were actively considering public issues of debt legally stapled to ordinary shares. Officials estimated that these arrangements would have an annual revenue cost in the order of $90 million. The proposed new rule was announced on 25 February 2008 and was to apply from that date. The scope of the proposed rule is narrow. Stapled stock has not previously been issued, to our knowledge, by a listed New Zealand company. Arrangements that do not result in interest deductions, and debt stapled to a share before the announcement, are excluded. As a result of consultation in mid-2008, the rule excludes arrangements in which the issuing company is not a party, or debt is stapled only to a fixed-rate share (a debt substitute). Submissions on the SOP focussed mainly on the need to target arrangements that present a genuine risk to the tax base, and to avoid unintended consequences. As a result, officials recommend some further narrowing of the scope of the new rules, along with technical changes to ensure that the rules operate as intended. 104 Issue: Reconsider the need for the stapled stock rule Submissions (32 – KPMG, 68 & 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The rule should be reconsidered on the basis that: • The changes were introduced in an ad hoc, hasty manner that could result in poor policy and undermine investor confidence. • Stapled stock is used in other countries for non-tax reasons: any tax minimisation effects are only a by-product. • Companies can minimise tax by gearing up their debt instead of stapling. • The changes could increase financing and transaction costs. • The proposals favour companies with a non-resident parent, able to have up to 75 percent debt under thin capitalisation rules, over widely held New Zealand- owned companies that would issue shareholder debt as stapled debt for commercial reasons. (KPMG) The rule applies more widely than is justified and will undermine investor confidence in the tax policy process. It will create a further preference for 100 percent ownership of New Zealand businesses by non-residents because closely held companies can achieve the same tax effect without “legal” stapling. As currently drafted, all shareholder debt in a public company (which by definition requires that debt to be stapled) would become “offensive” from a policy perspective. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Given that the “potentially offending transactions” (the arrangements contemplated in early 2008) are now no longer proposed, the measure should be removed from the bill and subject to further consultation to develop the correct framework upon which reform should be based. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment Officials agree that there is a need to further reduce the scope of the stapled stock rule. Our recommendations are set out under the more specific submission points that follow. The potential revenue cost of the contemplated transactions was discussed in the section “Overview”. Officials consider that the new rule will not have the consequences claimed in submissions for the following reasons: • The very narrow scope, including only newly stapled instruments of a type that has not, to our knowledge, been issued by a listed New Zealand company. • The rule is consistent with the past practice of recharacterising certain specific financial instruments at the extreme margin. • Officials consulted with taxpayers on draft legislation, and the select committee process has provided a further opportunity for taxpayers to make submissions. 105 The argument that companies can, instead of issuing stapled stock, increase their debt by simply increasing their gearing overlooks an important fact. Stapled stock allows companies to overcome normal commercial, regulatory and tax law barriers to excessive debt and interest deductions. If companies with a non-resident parent enjoy an advantage when issuing shareholder debt, any such advantage is long-standing, is not the result of the current proposal, and is constrained by other tax rules. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Exclude widely held and listed companies Submission (32 – KPMG) To avoid favouring companies with a non-resident parent, the rule should exclude widely held companies and unit trusts or companies listed on the NZX. Stapled stock allows these companies to increase their debt ratios to the same extent as companies with a non-resident parent. Comment Most of New Zealand’s biggest companies are widely held (meaning, in general terms, that ownership and control is spread among a large number of investors). Their potential to increase their interest deductions is at the core of the base maintenance concerns arising from stapled stock. Furthermore, the proposed new rule does not give companies with a non-resident parent any tax advantage that does not exist under the current law. As noted under the previous submission, any tax advantages that these companies enjoy are long- standing, not the result of the current proposal, and constrained by other tax rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 106 Issue: Exclude companies subject to thin capitalisation and other rules or with certain shareholder characteristics Submissions (32 – KPMG, 33 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 36A – Russell McVeagh, 60 – Commonwealth Bank of Australia (New Zealand) Group, 62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 68 & 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Companies should not be subject to the new rule if they are (or opt to be) subject to the thin capitalisation rules, on the grounds that these rules provide adequate protection against excessive interest deductions. (KPMG, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) The transfer pricing rules, which apply to loans from non-resident controlling shareholders, also protect the tax base from excessive interest deductions. (Commonwealth Bank of Australia) An exclusion from the stapled stock rule should be made where: • thin capitalisation rules are met; • the debt is subject to a market rate of interest; and • the debt is to be repaid at face value on maturity. Such arrangements do not present an undue risk to the tax base. (Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc) Members of a New Zealand banking group should be excluded because the thin capitalisation rules for banks, which require a minimum level of equity, provide sufficient tax base protection in that industry. (Russell McVeagh) Stapled stock is not an undue risk to the tax base if: • the issuing company is subject to or elects to be subject to the normal buttresses of the thin capitalisation and transfer pricing rules; or • the shareholders are all resident non-exempt taxpayers (or where the non- resident and exempt taxpayers hold less than, say, 10 percent of the shares on issue). Excluding stapled stock from the rule in these cases would avoid discouraging foreign direct investment. Companies should be able to have as much debt as current rules allow using whatever instruments they believe provide the best commercial result. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment The thin capitalisation and transfer pricing rules protect the tax base by limiting interest deductions. 107 The thin capitalisation rules cap the level of debt (usually at 75 percent of assets) on which a company can deduct interest. These rules apply to companies with a non- resident controlling shareholder, but will apply to more companies under proposed changes to the taxation of New Zealand companies’ direct investments abroad. The transfer pricing rules do not allow deductions of amounts paid to a non-resident related party above an “arms-length” price. This applies to interest just as it does to other expenses. The assumption that the thin capitalisation and transfer pricing rules adequately protect against excessive interest deductions overlooks the key concern with this type of financial instrument. Stapled stock, being debt for tax purposes but equity for other purposes, allows companies to significantly increase their interest deductions, even within the scope of the thin capitalisation and transfer pricing rules. Stapled stock could also help companies to concentrate shareholder debt among the shareholders who can most benefit from it. Furthermore, treating stapled stock as debt when a company complies with thin capitalisation and transfer pricing rules, but as equity when it breaches those rules, could add substantial compliance and administration costs. The Corporate Taxpayers Group’s submission that the stapled stock rule should not apply if all shareholders are resident, non-exempt taxpayers could also add compliance and administration costs. Listed companies would need to constantly gather information about their shareholders from share registrars and recharacterise their stapled stock accordingly. In addition, non-discrimination rules in New Zealand’s international tax treaties can limit the effect of tax rules based on shareholder residency. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Exclude if dividends on share are at fixed rate before conversion Submission (36A – Russell McVeagh, 60 – Commonwealth Bank of Australia (New Zealand) Group) The submissions seek a wider exclusion for debts stapled only to shares of a certain type. The submissions argue that the stapled stock rule should not apply if a debt is stapled only to a share that would be a fixed-rate share if only those dividends payable before conversion of the share were taken into account. Furthermore, they argue that this exclusion should ignore any dividend arising as a result of a formula, reflecting generally accepted market practice, for converting the share into another type of share. 108 According to the submissions, these changes are needed to achieve the intent of the current exclusion for debt stapled only to a fixed-rate share. They would help Australian banks with a New Zealand branch to comply with Australian bank regulations at minimum cost. Comment The current rule does not apply to debts stapled only to a “fixed-rate share”. This term is defined in the Income Tax Act, but has been widened for the purpose of this exclusion. In general it refers to a share that is similar to a debt because all dividends are at a fixed rate or have a fixed relationship to a recognised market interest rate. Debt stapled only to a “fixed-rate share” is not equivalent to an ordinary share, because a fixed-rate share is a “debt substitute”, offering a return equivalent to an interest rate. Therefore, debt stapled only to a fixed-rate share is to be excluded from the stapled stock rule. However, the view expressed by submissions is that debt stapled to certain convertible preference shares that are similar to fixed-rate shares warrants the same exclusion. A “convertible preference share” may or may not be a fixed-rate share. It typically offers a regular, fixed-rate dividend for a certain number of years, and then is exchanged for ordinary shares of a certain value (similar to paying back a debt). In some cases, the terms of a convertible preference share may change to those of an ordinary share (so the investor’s return depends on the value of ordinary shares, which depends on the company’s performance). Some conversions may combine both of these approaches (involving a change of terms and an issue of new shares up to a certain value). The proposal suggested by submissions would mean that a debt stapled to a convertible preference share would not be subject to the stapled stock rule as long as all dividends paid before conversion are at a fixed rate, or have a fixed relationship to a recognised market rate of interest. However, potential gains (equity risk) at the point of conversion or later mean the share may not be a debt substitute, but more akin to an ordinary share. A debt stapled to such a share should not be excluded from the stapled stock rule. Therefore, officials do not recommend ignoring all potential gains on or after conversion. In addition, because of the rarity and complexity of these arrangements, the resulting danger of admitting arrangements that mimic ordinary shares, and the availability of simpler arrangements that achieve the same broad commercial objective, we do not recommend attempting to define all situations where a convertible preference share is a debt substitute. We do, however, recommend dealing with two specific reasons, highlighted by the submissions, why an essentially “fixed-rate” share might fail to meet the definition of a “fixed-rate share”. These variations typically arise when a preference share converts to a fixed value of ordinary shares (often including a small fixed premium on the amount originally invested). They do not add significant equity risk and should be ignored for the purposes of the exclusion. 109 The draft wording of the exclusion for debt stapled only to a fixed-rate share already allows for a dividend reflecting transaction costs expected to be incurred by the investor as a result of conversion of a preference share to an ordinary share. Typically such a dividend is provided by discounting the value of the ordinary share around three or four percent when calculating the number of new shares needed to match the value of the preference share. The purpose may not be specified. The rule should instead simply allow for any fixed gain on conversion of up to five percent of the amount subscribed for the share. This makes for simpler drafting and widens the exclusion. In addition, the rate of conversion from one type of share to a fixed value of another type of share (equivalent to a fixed-value return of funds) depends on the estimated value of the other share. This value is typically estimated based on trades over the 20 trading days before conversion. An increase in the market value of the other share in the estimation period could result in the investor receiving a higher value of new shares than was intended. A potential small gain in value may take the share outside the usual fixed-rate share definition. Recommendations That stapled debt should be excluded from the rule if it is stapled only to a share that would be a “fixed-rate share” but for dividends arising from: • a fixed gain of no more than five percent of the amount subscribed for the share, upon conversion to another class of share; or • an increase in the price of another class of share during up to 30 days (allowing for a degree of flexibility) before conversion to the other class, of a number determined by the price observed in that period. That, if this recommendation is agreed, the exclusion limited to discount factors used to compensate for expected transaction costs should be removed, because it will be redundant. Issue: Amendments to thin capitalisation calculations Submission (32 – KPMG, 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Stapled debt should not be treated as debt for thin capitalisation purposes while treating it as equity for other tax purposes, as this would be inequitable. The Corporate Taxpayers Group considered that implementing the rule would be complex, given the need to obtain shareholder residency information from share registrars each time a company undertakes a thin capitalisation calculation (although few companies are likely to issue stapled debt given the changes in the bill). 110 Comment Under the new stapled stock rule, a stapled debt is to be treated as a share for most purposes. However, recharacterising stapled stock as a share for all tax purposes, regardless of the circumstances, could allow it to be used to circumvent the thin capitalisation rules. If a company is near the thin capitalisation limit on issuing debt, it could instead issue debt stapled to a small amount of equity and pay resident taxpayers, who benefit from imputation credits, fully imputed dividends at a post-tax rate of return. This would be economically equivalent to paying deductible interest. For this reason, if stapled debt subject to the proposed rule is issued, it would usually be treated as debt for the limited purpose of the thin capitalisation rules. The exception would be if the debt was stapled proportionately to all shares in the company, and not concentrated in the hands of those who gain little tax advantage from holding debt. Under the current drafting, the test to determine whether the debt is stapled proportionately to all shares in the company is applied at the time when the debt security is issued. The debt could easily cease to be stapled proportionately to shares, for example, as a result of the issue of new shares, or a de-stapling of some of the debt and shares. Officials consider that this test should instead be applied at the relevant time, which is when total group debt is measured under the thin capitalisation rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but that the test of whether debt is stapled in proportion to all shares in the company be applied when total group debt is measured under the thin capitalisation rules. Issue: Deduction of expenditure incurred in borrowing Submission (32 – KPMG) Under the proposal, a deduction would be denied for expenditure incurred in borrowing money secured by or payable under the stapled debt security. An amendment is needed to ensure that a deduction is only denied to the extent that borrowings are secured against the debt component of the stapled stock (as distinct from the share component). Comment The submission is in line with the draft legislation, and the draft legislation does not need to be amended to achieve this policy intent. As currently drafted, the proposed rule denies deductions in relation to a “stapled debt security”, being the debt component (referred to in this report as the “stapled debt”) of the overall stapled stock arrangement. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 111 Issue: Outbound stapled stock should be taxed at fair dividend rate (FDR) Submission (33 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc) When the rule applies to stapled stock issued to New Zealanders by offshore companies, the combined debt and equity returns of stapled stock should be taxed as one under the FDR method of taxing outbound portfolio investments. This would fairly reflect the economic position and limit the cost of having to identify, track and tax two separate instruments. Comment The stapled stock will not apply unless the interest would otherwise be deductible against New Zealand income. For the submission to be relevant, New Zealanders would have to own stapled stock issued by an offshore company, and the company would have to apply the funds raised by the stapled stock in a New Zealand branch of the company. This would be a relatively rare scenario. In any case, it is not within the scope of the current amendments to override the rules determining when the FDR method should be applied. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Meaning of “stapled” Submissions (33 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 36B – Russell McVeagh, 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The term “stapled” is too broad and uncertain. As a result, it is unclear whether the following situations will be subject to the stapled stock rule: • when a shareholders’ agreement or an agreement of a similar nature implies but does not require that the debt and equity instruments be disposed of together; • when an investor who holds shares and debt within a business where the debt and equity are disposed of together, but were not required to be disposed of together; • when a financing arrangement, shareholders’ agreement or similar agreement outlines or assumes that equity and debt will be disposed of together but only in certain circumstances; 112 • when, without the shareholder holding the debt, the shares would lose their value or vice versa. That is, there is not formal agreement that the debt and equity must be traded together but it is common practice, and an investor would not hold the shares without also having lent money to the entity. (Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, PricewaterhouseCoopers) The provision should be limited to “stapling” requirements contained in the terms of the debt security, the share, or the constitution of the issuer. The issuer company must often be party to shareholders’ agreements for corporate law reasons. Applying the rule to such agreements would have significant unintended consequences. (Russell McVeagh) It is unclear whether a company is “party” to a stapling arrangement simply because it is party to the debt and equity instruments themselves. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment The submissions raise a concern that the proposed definition of “stapled” is too broad. To fall within the proposed definition of “stapled”, an arrangement would need to meet two requirements. The first requirement is that a debt security “can, or ordinarily can, be disposed of only together with the share”. This wording is used elsewhere in the Income Tax Act, and there is no history of dispute over its meaning. The words imply a requirement (albeit with possible exceptions), not a mere expectation or assumption or the possible exercise of a choice. The second requirement is that a company that issued the debt security or the share must be a party to the stapling arrangement. This is intended to exclude conventional “shareholder agreements” that limit separate trading of debt and shares in smaller companies. These shareholder agreements were not the focus of the policy announcement in February 2008. However, submissions have highlighted that many of these shareholder agreements have the relevant company as a party, and so would be subject to the stapled stock rule as currently drafted. Widely held companies are not known for using shareholders’ agreements to bind debt and shares in the same way as closely held companies. To do so, they would most likely incur significant transaction costs. However, we cannot be certain that it will not occur. To balance these concerns, officials recommend adopting the submitters’ proposal to include only those stapling arrangements made under the terms of the debt, the share, or the constitution of the issuer, but only for companies that are not widely held. A “widely held company” is defined in the Income Tax Act 2007 as one that has no less than 25 shareholders and is not a closely held company. A “closely held company” is, essentially, one controlled by five or fewer persons. 113 Recommendation That, for companies that are not widely held, the stapled stock rule should only apply when the debt and share are stapled under the terms of the share, the debt, or the constitution of the company. Issue: Debt securities offering no return or a conditional return Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) A debt security that ordinarily pays no interest, discount or premium to the holder, but is capable of doing so in certain circumstances, such as if interest is payable if demanded by the shareholders, should be excluded from the rule. In some shareholder financing arrangements, it would be unclear whether a debt “...gives rise to an amount for which the company would have a deduction...” as required in the draft definition of a “debt security”. A positive exclusion for debt instruments that do not bear interest and are not issued for a discount or a premium would clarify the intent and remove uncertainty. This circumstance may arise when a shareholder provides debt funding to a company in proportion to their shareholding, with a shareholder’s agreement and possibly a requirement in the company’s constitution that the debt and shares are not to be traded separately. Comment The definition of “a debt security” proposed in the draft legislation is based on the definition of “total group debt”, a term introduced in 1995 and used to determine a company’s debt ratio under the thin capitalisation rules. Officials are not aware of any dispute indicating that the meaning of this term is unclear. Stapled debts offering no deductions are excluded from the proposed rule because they do not result in firms paying interest in substitution for dividends to reduce tax. In contrast, having interest payable if demanded by shareholders suggests a significant risk, with payments demanded in “good years” to distribute profits in a tax-effective way. It would not be appropriate to exclude such an arrangement from the stapled stock rule. The more ambiguous arrangements referred to by PricewaterhouseCoopers are most likely to be found in agreements among shareholders of smaller companies. Under the previous submission point, on the meaning of the term “stapled”, officials recommended not including these shareholder agreements in the stapled stock rule. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 114 Issue: What happens when an existing debt becomes stapled or unstapled? Submissions (33 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Greater clarity is needed on the effect of an existing debt becoming stapled or unstapled so that a debt that becomes unstapled is treated as a normal debt, with deductions available and the issuer able to repay in part or whole without stepping through the share repurchase rules. (Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, PricewaterhouseCoopers) Transitional rules or guidance is needed to confirm how to reclassify as a share a stapled debt that the issuer has treated as debt, especially where this is retrospective. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment Officials agree there is a need to clarify certain effects of the stapling of an existing debt to a share, or the de-stapling of a debt and a share. The stapled stock rule only applies when a debt security is stapled to a share. If an existing debt security is stapled to a share, then thereafter it is treated as a share “issued by the company” if it falls within the stapled debt security rule. If a debt security is de-stapled, the rule no longer applies. The transitional tax effects of stapling and de-stapling are intended to flow accordingly. However, the submissions have drawn officials’ attention to two matters that need clarification. First, it needs to be clarified that stapling of an existing debt is equivalent to a subscription for new shares, and a de-stapling after which the debt security ceases to be a share (rather than becoming a share under another provision) should be treated as a share cancellation. This will ensure that the appropriate adjustments are made to a company’s available subscribed capital, and an appropriate amount is treated as a dividend or, alternatively, treated as a return of capital upon de-stapling. Secondly, the legislation should make it clearer that interest deductions are available if the stapled debt ceases to be treated as a share under the stapled stock rule. With the narrow targeting of the rule, it is unlikely that any debts will need to be re- classified as a share retrospectively. Recommendation That stapling of an existing debt to a share should be treated as a subscription for shares, and that de-stapling be treated as a share cancellation with interest deductions subsequently available (unless other features of the arrangement, such as stapling to another share, cause the debt to continue to be treated as a share). 115 Issue: Exclusion – arrangements before 25 February 2008 Submissions (33 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Arrangements made before the announcement of the policy on 25 February 2008, and particularly ongoing employee share schemes, should be excluded from the new rule, even if stapling occurred later. Companies will face compliance and commercial issues if there are different tax treatments for stapled stock issued to employees as part of an ongoing programme before and after that date. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The Investment Savings and Insurance Association expressed the same concerns regarding ongoing unit trusts. Comment In theory, there would be practical problems for an employee share scheme or unit trust where debt was stapled both before and after 25 February 2008 as part of an on- going programme. However, continued issues of stapled stock under such schemes would raise the same policy concerns as other new issues of stapled stock. Moreover, policy officials are not aware of any actual employee share scheme or unit trust that would be subject to the stapled stock rule. Some Australian unit trusts have issued stapled stock. To be affected, a non-resident unit trust would need to apply the funds raised in a New Zealand branch, which is very rare. If a specific example is identified, officials would consider whether any remedial action is required. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Date of application Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Given the uncertainty around the legislation and when it will be enacted, the new rule should not apply until on or after the date it is enacted. Comment Inevitably, some uncertainty will exist around the legislation until it has been enacted. However, deferring application until enactment would leave in place a significant revenue risk until enactment, and create uncertainty around the date from which the new rule will apply. 116 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Unclear when stapled debt and share treated as one share Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) It is unclear from the current drafting whether a stapled debt security and share are intended to be one share for all purposes or only where the underlying share is a non- participating redeemable share. Therefore, section FA 2B(3) should be amended to read “a stapled debt security and a share to which it is stapled are treated as a single share where the underlying share to which the debt security is stapled falls within one of the following...”. Comment PricewaterhouseCoopers’ proposed wording would not be consistent with the policy intent. The draft legislation treats the stapled debt as a separate share for nearly all purposes under the Act. However, when deciding whether the stapled debt or the share to which it is stapled meet certain definitions the two parts are to be considered together, in line with their economic substance. This is consistent with the general approach of taxing debt and shares based on their legal form, with exceptions only when required to avoid undue risk to the tax base. The affected definitions identify shares that are “debt-like”. Stapled stock could be used to defeat the purpose of the definitions if both parts were not taken into account. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Treating stapled debt and share as one share means no share cancellation Submission (68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Treating the share and stapled debt as one share when applying the definition of a “non-participating redeemable share” means that redemptions of stapled debt will be inappropriately treated as a taxable dividend if the debt is redeemed. If the two parts are treated as one share, the redemption cannot be a share cancellation. 117 Comment Under the proposed rule, the stapled debt and share would be treated as one share when testing whether either part is a non-participating redeemable share. However, when applying the remainder of the tax rule governing share cancellations, the two parts remain separate shares that can be separately cancelled. The definition of a “non-participating redeemable share” is found in the off-market share cancellation rule, which determines how much of an amount paid on cancellation of a share is treated as a tax-free return of capital, and how much is treated as a dividend. It is unlikely that a stapled debt will ever be a non-participating redeemable share, but its redemption may be treated partly or wholly as a non-taxable return of capital under another test. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Section reference in proposed stapled stock amendments Submission (32 – KPMG) In clause 542B, the reference should be changed to section FA 2B(2). Comment The clause amends the Income Tax Act 2004, and refers correctly to proposed section FC 2B of that Act, set out in clause 578D of the draft legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Definition of a “fixed-rate share” Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The definition of a “fixed-rate share” in the stapled securities rule should clarify the weight to be put on each of the three indicators that a dividend is “the equivalent of the payment of interest on money lent”. 118 Comment While there may be value in considering this matter in the future, it is outside the scope of the stapled stock proposal. The “fixed-rate share” definition to be used to exclude certain arrangements from the stapled stock rule combines and expands two existing fixed-rate share definitions. The meaning of the “equivalent of interest” wording has not led to any notable dispute, and changing it could have wider implications. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Should exclude hybrid instruments Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The legislation should exclude debt-equity hybrid instruments such as convertible notes, unless they are stapled to another security. Such instruments are generally treated for tax purposes as part debt and part equity. These parts can only be disposed of together. Comment No amendment is needed to achieve the intent of the submission. The stapled stock rule will only apply if an apparently separate debt and share must be traded together. It would not apply to a convertible note unless it is stapled to another security (a share). Recommendation That the submission be declined, noting that the draft legislation already achieves the submission’s policy intent. Issue: Definition of “stapled” Submission (Matter raised by officials) Paragraph (b) of the proposed definition of “stapled” should be amended by inserting the words “the company that issued” after the words “the company that issued the debt security or”. This will more clearly allow for the possibility that different companies are involved. 119 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Definition of “non-participating redeemable preference share” Submission (Matter raised by officials) There is a possible circularity in the proposed treatment of cancellations of stapled debts treated as shares. Therefore, we propose that a stapled debt and share should not be aggregated when applying subparagraph (b)(iii) of the definition of a non- participating redeemable share in section CD 22(9) of the Income Tax Act 2007, or its predecessor in the Income Tax Act 2004. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 120 121 Research & Development 122 123 OVERVIEW Clauses 47, 243–247, 273, 279, 280, 284, 287, 296, 307, 325–329, 331, 336, 337, 339, 343, 424, 433, 466, 467, 474–476, 490, 491, 509 and 511 Since the introduction of this bill the R&D tax credit has been repealed and, as a result, a number of the provisions are no longer necessary. However, the credit continues to be administered for the year that it was in place (the 2008–09 year). Those making submissions have proposed remedial amendments and some possible enhancements to the tax credit covering eligibility issues, eligible expenditure, the repeal of the tax credit and administrative issues. At the time the tax credit was repealed, the government signalled further work to align the tax credit legislation with the policy intention in a number of areas. This report recommends several amendments as a result of that work. Several submissions propose other changes that would significantly broaden the scope of the credit for the year that it is in force. These are not supported in principle because there is no incentive effect in retrospectively broadening the provisions and it would merely create a windfall gain to taxpayers. 124 ELIGIBILITY ISSUES Issue: “On-behalf” rules Submission (68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The “on-behalf” tests should be relaxed so that a claimant does not need to meet all three of the tests. This would better reflect commercial realities. Comment The tests require claimants to show that they control the R&D activity, bear the financial risk associated with the project, and effectively own the results. Some groups, such as partnerships and unincorporated joint ventures are able to apply the tests as a group. The submission seeks to relax the rules further, so that the purpose of the test becomes one of deciding which party in a joint arrangement should receive the concession. They point out that current formulation means that some R&D activities carried out in New Zealand are ineligible for the concession. This issue was debated at the time the tax credit was introduced. Officials do not agree with the submission for two reasons. First, the design of the tests is intended to achieve more than the result sought by the Corporate Taxpayers Group. It aims to provide a high value concession to the party making investment decisions about what R&D is undertaken, to compensate them for creating spillover benefits that are captured by other firms in the local economy. The absence of any one of the three tests could undermine that objective. For example, if the claimant bore no financial risk, then they are not funding any of the spillover benefits from the activity that are captured by other firms and therefore do not need to be compensated for them. If the firm does not own the results of the activities it is poorly placed to exploit the results. Lastly, if a firm does not control the R&D activity (for example, determining the direction of the work and making decisions to stop unproductive lines of work) it is unlikely that they are the party making decisions about what R&D should be undertaken. Secondly, given that the credit has been repealed, amending the policy in line with the submission, for the 2008–09 income year the tax credit was in place, which finishes on 31 March 2009 for most taxpayers, would create a retrospective windfall gain, at some cost to the Crown, with no effect on future incentives for R&D. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 125 Issue: Company groups Submission (34 – Zespri) It should be possible to apply the business test, the minimum threshold, and the three “on-behalf” tests to wholly owned groups of companies rather than only to individual firms. Comment To qualify for the tax credit, a claimant must: • be in business; • incur at least $20,000 of eligible expenditure in the year; • control the R&D activity; • effectively own the results of the R&D activity; and • bear the financial risk associated with the activity. As pointed out in the submission, this can be problematic for larger firms that separate aspects of their operation for commercial purposes. For example, a firm may locate its R&D division in one subsidiary but hold any resulting intellectual property in another subsidiary to separate risky undertakings from assets. The submission points out that wholly owned companies, which are essentially one economic unit, would be eligible for the tax credit if they restructured their activities so that one member in the group carried out all the necessary functions. Requiring firms to amalgamate these functions, which previously were carried out in separate subsidiaries within the group, in order to be eligible for the tax credit, is inefficient and it would create unnecessary compliance costs. Officials largely agree with the submission. The location of the business activity and control of the R&D in a New Zealand-based separate entity within the group would not undermine the objective of maximising spillover benefits for the local economy. Some New Zealand firms have adopted the practice of locating the ownership of intellectual property offshore, for other tax and commercial reasons. The spillover benefits arising at the location of the firm that owns the results of the R&D activity is likely to be the smallest contributor to the overall spillover benefits from the activity. Therefore it is not considered vital to the policy that the subsidiary owning the results should be a New Zealand resident as long as the group owning the subsidiary is based in New Zealand. An important question is the level of commonality sufficient for firms to be considered part of the same economic entity for the purposes of the tax credit. We consider that the wholly owned grouping (100 percent commonly owned) suggested by the submission would exclude many firms that have small holdings that reflect the participation in the enterprise by innovators and investors. A more appropriate test is that applied to group companies for income tax purposes (with 66 percent or more commonality of ownership). 126 A central feature of the tax credit is that the incentive should go to the party making the investment decision. Given the level of commonality most appropriate for the amendment is that of group companies (rather than wholly owned groups) we do not consider it is appropriate to extend the amendment to cover the financial risk test. In effect this means that the subsidiary in the group bearing the financial risk of any R&D expenditure is the party that will claim the tax credit for that expenditure. This restriction is also necessary to prevent two members of the group from claiming a credit for R&D expenditure that is deductible to both of them. For example, if one member pays another for the R&D activity, both would meet the deductibility requirement and both would meet the financial risk test (applied to the group as a whole) for essentially the same R&D expense. Similarly, we do not consider that the minimum threshold should be applied on a group basis. The threshold is relatively low and should be within the reach of large firms for whom these grouping issues arise. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part and that, subject to officials’ comments on the location of the relevant group members, companies be able to satisfy as a group the requirements that the claimant: • be in business; • control the R&D activity; and • effectively own the results of the R&D activity. That the submission that wholly owned groups should be able to apply the minimum expenditure threshold and the financial risk test as a group be declined. Issue: Government agencies Submission (Matter raised by officials) It should be made clear that all Crown entities, as defined in the Crown Entities Act 2004, are not eligible for the tax credit. Comment The tax credit rules require a claimant to be in business or to be an industry research co-operative. Some Crown agencies are specifically excluded from eligibility. Crown agencies that can meet the business test and that are not specifically excluded are eligible for the tax credit. This is contrary to the policy of the tax credit, which aims to incentivise R&D carried out by private sector businesses. The exclusion does not apply to State Owned Enterprises, which remain eligible for the credit. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 127 REPEAL OF THE TAX CREDIT AND EXPENDITURE ISSUES Issue: Feedstock rule Clause 424 Submission (68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The feedstock rule should be amended to make it clear that where a valuable output is produced as part of an R&D testing process, only the cost of the inputs is potentially denied the credit. Comment This issue was raised by the Corporate Taxpayers Group with officials before the repeal of the tax credit. The government announced on repeal that the feedstock rule would be reviewed. The feedstock rule operates to restrict the availability of the R&D tax credit when, as part of an R&D process, a valuable output is produced. For example, a paper manufacturer might be developing a new process, and produce saleable quality paper during testing. If the costs incurred in the testing process were $10 of materials and $40 of other costs, and the end product was worth $60, some or all of the costs may be denied the credit. While the original intention of the provision was to deny the credit for the materials only ($10 above), the legislation has been interpreted as denying the credit for all costs ($50 above). The legislation should be amended to make the original intention clear. Officials also recommend that other minor amendments be made to address matters such as the scope of the application of the provision (it should not, for example, apply to the construction of prototypes) and remove an unnecessary duplication in the drafting. This proposal has been discussed with the Corporate Taxpayers Group, which agrees it is consistent with the policy intent of the credit and supports the amendment. We have also consulted in detail with the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Ernst & Young and KPMG. They all support the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and that the feedstock rules be limited in application only to inputs of items and materials that are the subject of testing. 128 Issue: Eligibility of labour R&D costs for the credit Submissions (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The credit should be available in full on capitalised labour R&D costs (such as design and testing), whatever the ultimate use of the underlying asset. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) That an upfront credit should be available for design labour costs. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment This is another issue that was raised before repeal of the R&D tax credit, and which the government undertook to review to ensure the legislation conformed to the original policy intent. Complex rules apply when capital expenditure is incurred as part of an R&D project. If the capital expenditure is incurred in developing a depreciable intangible asset or a tangible asset which is intended to be solely used in R&D, the credit is available in full. If capital expenditure is incurred in developing a non-depreciable tangible asset which is not solely intended to be used in R&D, the credit is available (if at all) only on the depreciation which arises when the asset is used in R&D (for example, for testing). This is not the right outcome when the expenditure is incurred on something like the labour costs of design or testing. This is R&D expenditure under the narrowest definition, and limited eligibility for the credit is not consistent with the original policy intent. Moreover, it is not consistent with the approach indicated during consultation when the credit was being developed. Accordingly, officials recommend that the credit be available in full for the labour R&D costs of design and testing, which are capitalised, whatever the ultimate purpose of the underlying asset. Care should be taken, however, to ensure that labour costs which are incurred in constructing these assets are not automatically given the credit. We also propose a requirement for capital expenditure, that replicates the effect of the deferred salary expenditure rule so that firms can claim the credit only in relation to salaries that are paid out. This change has been discussed with the Corporate Taxpayers Group and is supported. It considers that the change is consistent with what the Group and officials consider is the policy intent of the rules when introduced. We have also consulted in detail with the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Ernst & Young and KPMG. They all support the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 129 Issue: Costs capitalised after R&D is completed Submission (68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) In certain circumstances, no credit is available for R&D costs because there is no depreciation on the asset being developed while the R&D is being done. An amendment should be made to allow a deemed depreciation calculation to apply for the purposes of the tax credit in these circumstances. Comment There are circumstances in which no tax credit is available because of the way the credit is designed. If the credit were ongoing, these would be reviewed and, where appropriate, recommendations made for change. As the tax credit is now repealed, and any change can only be retrospective, officials do not support the amendment proposed in the submission. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Removal of internal software development cap Submission (68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The $3 million internal software development cap should be removed. Comment The internal software development cap is a base protection measure intended to reduce fiscal risk associated with the tax credit. Its removal would likely expose the government to high cost but potentially low-value R&D claims. Other jurisdictions, such as Canada, have experienced very large internal software development claims, such as from banks and insurance companies. A discretion to raise the cap is available if a case is made to the Minister of Finance. As the tax credit is now repealed, to change this retrospectively would also have no incentive effect and provide a windfall gain. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 130 Issue: Scope of internal software development cap Submissions (68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The internal software development cap should apply only where the purpose of the R&D activity was wholly or mainly the development of software. Where the software development is only a facet of a wider project the cap should not apply. The internal software cap grouping rules should be less restrictive. A 66 percent commonality of shareholding should be required for a group to be an internal software development group. The boundary between external and internal software development is uncertain and the cap should not apply to software developed for selling or leasing when it is also used internally. Comment The $3 million software development cap applies to all internal software development. Grouping rules ensure that the cap cannot be avoided by spreading internal software development expenditure over multiple companies or other entities. Officials do not support the loosening of these restrictions as this would apply only retrospectively to the 2008–09 year and have no incentive effect on taxpayers. Also, in the case of the first submission, our concern is that it may also be relatively easy to recharacterise software developed mainly for an independent project as software developed as part of a wider project. Our understanding is that such behaviour has occurred in Australia. Our concern with weakening the grouping rules is that it may allow internal software development to be structured in a way which by-passes the cap. The potential revenue risk if the cap is not successful could be significant. In relation to the third submission, we do not support relaxing the rule that software used in-house is internal software development even if it is also sold or licensed to third parties. Without this rule a financial institution, for example, could provide an implicit licence to customers to use its internal back-office software and charge a small fee for the use of those systems. The software would then be seen as licensed to all the institution’s customers and therefore an argument presented that the software was not internal-use software and therefore eligible for the tax credit. We received advice that this type of situation could be a problem, so the rules were extended to cover it at the Select Committee stage of the introduction of the R&D provisions. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 131 Issue: Grant funding – third party co-funding Submission (68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Third party contributions that are a condition of a grant should be eligible for the tax credit. Comment The rationale for providing government subsidies for R&D activities is to compensate firms for benefits that accrue to society (spillover benefits) rather than to the firms. Generally, firms are unable to capture all the benefits of the R&D that they undertake. This matter was debated at the time the credits were introduced. Expenditure met with funds that are required as a condition of a grant is not eligible for a tax credit. This is because the R&D project is already subsidised by the grant. Required co- funding (whether it is funded directly by the grant recipient or by a third party) is part of the contribution that the government expects from the relevant private sector firms towards the work. Providing both forms of subsidies for the same R&D activity would therefore be a double subsidy. While in principle the double-dipping concern could be dealt with by contemporaneous changes to grant funding and R&D tax credit rules, as the changes would be only retrospective this option is not recommended. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Repeal of the tax credit Clauses 245 and 246 Submission (Matter raised by officials) A number of technical amendments, including removal of clauses 245 and 246, are required to the bill and the Tax Administration Act 1994 as a consequence of the repeal of the R&D tax credit. 132 Comment Clauses 245 and 246 amend the timing rules for the tax credit so that R&D salary expenditure that is paid out in a year after the R&D is performed would be eligible for the tax credit in the year in which the salary is actually paid. Similarly, overseas expenditure that has been carried forward to a subsequent income year would be eligible for a tax credit at the time there is sufficient local expenditure to make a claim. These amendments are no longer necessary because the tax credit only applies to R&D performed in the 2008–09 income year and it was explicitly stated as part of the repeal that expenditure that would otherwise become eligible for a tax credit after the 2008–09 year, in relation to R&D activities performed in that year, would not be eligible for the concession. Officials therefore recommend that the clauses be removed. Other minor technical amendments are also necessary to the rules for administering the credit as a consequence of its repeal. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Timing adjustments Clauses 245 and 246 Submissions (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed changes to the timing rules for deferred employee remuneration and overseas expenditure should be rationalised to make them easier for taxpayers to follow. The proposed exclusions from the timing rules should also apply to bonus entitlements determined after the income year in which the R&D activity occurs. The $20,000 minimum expenditure requirement should not apply to deferred employee remuneration in the year in which it is paid out Comment Officials recommend above that clauses 245 and 246 be removed as the tax credit will be claimable only for the 2008–09 income year. These submissions are therefore no longer relevant. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 133 Issue: Petroleum mining development expenditure Clauses 245 and 246 Submissions (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The proposed exclusions from the timing rules should also apply to deferred petroleum development expenditure. (PricewaterhouseCoopers, Corporate Taxpayers Group) “Offshore” petroleum mining, which is subject to New Zealand income tax, should be treated as R&D performed in New Zealand. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment While petroleum mining exploration expenditure is not eligible for the tax credit, expenditure on R&D activities which are included in petroleum mining development expenditure is eligible. However, the combination of the requirement that the expenditure be deductible and the seven-year spreading rule for petroleum mining development expenditure means that the credit is available for only 1/7th of the revenue expenditure for each year. This does not apply to capital expenditure. All capital expenditure that meets the requirements of the rules will be eligible As the tax credit will be available only for one year, this means that only 1/7th of the R&D expenditure that is on revenue account and that is incurred in the 2008–09 year in petroleum mining development will be entitled to a tax credit. The first submission seeks an amendment so that all the expenditure incurred in a year will be eligible. It is not clear that the current law provides the right outcome. The intention of the tax credit was to encourage R&D expenditure, and there is no reason why the specific petroleum mining timing rule should apply to limit its availability. However, the only sensible amendments that can now be made are those which have retrospective effect to the date of commencement of the tax credit. An amendment which is retrospective and unanticipated by those entitled to it cannot have an incentive effect, and will purely be a windfall gain to recipients. Officials have discussed the influence of the availability of the tax credit on the petroleum mining sector with a number of advisers, and none have suggested that petroleum miners have taken into account the availability of the credit, either on a 1/7th or a full-year basis, in their decisions on whether to carry out R&D activities. Also, we have been told that the amendment in relation to capital design costs, discussed earlier, will significantly reduce the amount of expenditure that is not eligible for the credit. We therefore do not recommend any change be made in this area. 134 The same argument applies to the second submission. As the tax credit is now repealed, other than the changes signalled at the time of the repeal, we do not support changes that retrospectively broaden the scope of the credit as this has no incentive effect and creates a windfall gain to taxpayers. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Eligible expenditure Submissions (68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) An amendment is required to ensure that a tax credit is available for supporting R&D expenditure (such as feasibility studies) incurred in a year before the main R&D activity. Consideration should be given to a new “other” class of expenditure for expenditure that is currently not eligible (for example, compensation for the opportunity cost of participating in a trial). Pre-business expenditure on R&D should also be eligible for a tax credit. Comment R&D can be either a “core” activity (that is, an experimental activity) or a support activity (an activity that, while not experimental in itself, is required to conduct the core activity). The tax credit rules do not require expenditure on supporting R&D to be incurred in the same year or before expenditure on core R&D, although they do require that the core activity takes place. Therefore officials do not consider that an amendment is needed to clarify this point. Given the repeal of the tax credit from the 2009–10 income year, amendments to extend the types of expenditure eligible for a tax credit in the 2008–09 year would have no incentive effect and result in windfall gains. Therefore we do not support them. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 135 Issue: Claw-back of imputation credits Submission (68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) There should be no claw-back of tax credits paid to a company when the company makes distributions to shareholders. Comment This matter was debated at the time the tax credit was introduced. There is a partial claw-back of tax credits paid to a company when the company makes distributions to its shareholders. To remove the claw-back would move more entities away from the economically correct position and involve significant fiscal cost. Officials do not support any change to this position, especially as now any change would be retrospective only and have no incentive effect. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 136 ADMINISTRATIVE AMENDMENTS Issue: Changes to response period for notices related to R&D tax credits Clauses 433 and 474 Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The wording of the new response period provision in the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended so the start date of the response period in proposed section 89AB(4)(a), (b) and (c)(i) is the date of issue of the initiating notice and not the date the initiating notice is received in an office of the department. Additionally, the reference to “that Act” in proposed section 89AB(4)(c) is confusing and should be changed to the Income Tax Act 2007. Comment Proposed section 89AB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is a rewrite of the “response period” definition in current section 3(1) of the same Act. The rewrite ensures that the response periods for notices relating to R&D tax credits are consistent with other time limits relating to the tax credit. It was not the intention of the rewrite to change the response periods in cases that do not relate solely to an amount of R&D tax credit. Officials therefore agree that proposed section 89AB(3)(a), (4)(a) and (b) be amended so the start date of the response period is the date of issue of the initiating notice and not the date the initiating notice is received in an office of the department. Proposed section 89AB(4)(c) concerns a notice relating solely to an amount of R&D tax credit and should not be amended. We do not agree that the reference to “that Act” in section 89AB(4)(c) is confusing. The use of this term is standard drafting practice, and it is clear from section 89AB(4)(c) that “that Act” refers to the Income Tax Act 2007. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part, subject to officials’ comments. 137 Issue: Filing detailed R&D returns on behalf of partners Clauses 466 and 467 Submission (68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Requiring partners to individually file R&D returns could increase compliance costs for taxpayers and also result in confusion if there is inconsistency in the positions taken by individual partners. Comment Currently the legislation allows partnerships to file a detailed statement. When this happens, all the R&D relating to a partnership and the partners is required to be on the same detailed statement. This means that partner A has to disclose to partner B the R&D partner A is doing on their own behalf. The amendment in the bill addresses this problem by requiring individual partners to file a detailed statement rather than the partnership. The amendment also streamlines the process in situations when a partner is a member of more than one partnership doing R&D, and particularly when they are also in an internal software development group. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: No credit until detailed statement is filed Clause 244 Submission (68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Clarification may be required so that a taxpayer can claim the R&D tax credit in their tax return, due to be filed before the detailed statement, and so that the tax credit is also factored into the appropriate year’s residual income tax. These issues could be addressed by allowing the tax credit to be available only once the detailed statement is filed. Comment Proposed section LH 2(8) provides that no tax credit arises before an R&D detailed statement is provided. Information contained in the detailed statement is necessary for Inland Revenue to properly process the claim. The submission supports the amendment but queries whether this creates a problem because taxpayers claim the tax credit in their tax return and factor in the credit in calculating the residual income tax, both of which occur before the detailed statement is filed. 138 The intention is that, if a detailed statement is not filed, the credit is treated as if it never existed. It is still intended that taxpayers claim the credit in their return and factor in the tax credit in calculating residual income tax. This should be clarified. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Change to response periods for notices related to R&D tax credits Clauses 433 and 474 Submission (68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The proposed changes to response periods for filing a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA), should be amended so that if an R&D tax credit adjustment has been included in a NOPA with other issues, the portion of that NOPA which relates to R&D tax credits will have a response period of one year (or two years if the temporary extension applies). Comment The normal tax rules allow a four-month opportunity for taxpayers to amend a tax return. However, because the R&D tax credit raises particular risks, different time periods for amendment were considered desirable. It is therefore appropriate that the proposed two-year response period only relates to a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) that relates solely to R&D tax credits. Officials do not agree that this rule should be extended so that when an R&D tax credit adjustment has been included in a NOPA with other issues, then the portion of the NOPA that relates to the R&D tax credit is treated as having a response period of two years, while the other issues will still have the general four-month response period. We consider that the benefits of such a change would be outweighed by the cost of the extra complexity that would be introduced into the rules relating to filing of a NOPA. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 139 Issue: Requirements for a notice of proposed adjustment relating to an R&D tax credit Clauses 475 and 476 Submission (68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The new amendments relating to a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) in sections 89D and 89DA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 are unnecessary. Given that a tax credit will only arise once a detailed statement is filed, the Commissioner will not be able to issue an assessment in relation to a tax credit before a detailed statement is provided. Comment The new amendments to sections 89D and 89DA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ensure that a claimant cannot dispute an assessment of an R&D amount until an R&D detailed statement (under sections 68D or 68E) has been provided for the tax year. This ensures Inland Revenue has the necessary information about a claimant’s R&D activities before a dispute commences. Officials therefore consider that these amendments are necessary. There are several time limits which are specific to the detailed statement under sections 68D and 68E of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Officials propose that the new amendments in sections 89D and 89DA be further clarified so that a claimant can only dispute an assessment of an amount of R&D by providing a detailed statement within the time limits required under sections 68D or 68E. Recommendation That the submission to remove the new amendments in sections 89D and 89DA be declined. That the proposal to further clarify these proposed sections be accepted. 140 Issue: Reviewing the R&D detailed statement as a return Submission (Matter raised by officials) The R&D detailed statement is currently a tax return for the purposes of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Consequently, under section 36(3) of that Act, a claimant must retain a signed, hardcopy transcript of the detailed statement. Section 23 of the same Act also requires this transcript to be retained for seven years after the end of the income year to which the return relates. Another consequence of the detailed statement being a tax return is that shortfall penalties (section 141 of the Tax Administration Act 1994) may apply to the position taken by claimants in the detailed statement. Officials recommend that these features, as well any shortfall penalties that result from the detailed statement being a tax return, are switched off. Comment The R&D detailed statement is a completely electronic form that claimants of the R&D tax credit must complete and submit electronically. The requirements to sign and to retain a hardcopy transcript of the detailed statement for seven years are inconsistent with the electronic nature of the detailed statement itself. Officials therefore recommend that these tax return features are “switched off” for the detailed statement. Although the detailed statement is a tax return, it acts more like a disclosure form. Officials therefore recommend that any shortfall penalties that would apply as a consequence of the detailed statement being a tax return are also “switched off”. This means that the details in a detailed statement are not considered as a “tax position” taken by the claimant. The figures in the detailed statement should, if completed correctly, reflect the R&D tax credit figure claimed in a claimant’s return of income. The R&D tax credit figure claimed in a claimant’s return of income is a tax position taken by a claimant and therefore, will still be subject to all the shortfall penalties under the Tax Administration Act 1994. The absolute liability and knowledge offences (sections 143 and 143A of the Tax Administration Act 1994) will also still continue to apply to the R&D detailed statement. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 141 Issue: Minor rewrite changes to R&D provisions Clauses 284, 328 and 339 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Proposed sections OP 35(1B), OK 14B(1)(a) and OB 37(1)(a) require minor rewrite changes. Comment Minor rewrite changes to proposed sections OP 35(1B), OK 14B(1)(a) and OB 37(1)(a) will ensure that these provisions give full effect to the policy intent of the R&D tax credit amendments. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 142 143 Portfolio investment entity rules 144 145 OVERVIEW The portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules were enacted in 2007 with application from 1 October 2007, to support the introduction of KiwiSaver. The rules remove a number of tax disadvantages for people investing via managed funds that elect to be PIEs. The PIE amendments contained in this bill are generally of a technical nature and will ensure that the PIE rules reflect existing practice and the intended policy. A number of submissions were received on the technical aspects of these rules. The bill also rewrites the PIE rules to ensure the rules are consistent with the plain language drafting approach that has been adopted more generally across other parts of the Income Tax Act. The remedial amendments contained in this bill and the recommendations contained in this report would, if adopted, amend both the current and rewritten PIE rules. 146 GENERAL COMMENTS ON REWRITE OF PIE RULES Issue: Terminology used in PIE rules Submission (31 – NZ Funds, 32 – KPMG, 33 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) The terminology used in the current PIE rules should not be changed as the current terms are now commonly understood. In addition, changes to the terminology in the legislation will require changes to PIE documentation which will result in extra costs. Comment The rewritten PIE provisions in the current tax bill are the last of the major parts of the Income Tax Act to be rewritten. Officials have recommended (see below) that the rewritten PIE rules be deferred until 1 April 2010 to prevent retrospective application. This deferral will provide time for the managed fund industry and Inland Revenue to change the relevant terminology for written material. This should alleviate some of the submitters’ concerns. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application date of rewritten PIE rules Submission (Matter raised by officials) The application date for the rewritten PIE rules should be deferred from 1 April 2009 to 1 April 2010. Comment The Minister of Revenue has written to the Chair of the Committee requesting that the application date for the rewritten PIE rules be deferred from 1 April 2009 to 1 April 2010. The PIE rules operate on a tax-year basis, that is, from 1 April each year. Because this bill will be enacted after 1 April 2009, it is highly desirable for the rewritten PIE rules to be deferred until 1 April 2010 to prevent them having any retrospective application. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 147 BECOMING A PIE Issue: Listed PIEs should be able to elect to be portfolio tax rate entities Submission (18A – Staples Rodway) There should be an option for PIEs that are listed on a recognised exchange to elect to be portfolio tax rate entities. Comment Officials agree with the submission as it is consistent with the policy intention of the PIE rules. This change should apply from 1 April 2009. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Active company exclusion should be reconsidered Submissions (32 – KPMG, 62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) The proposed changes to preclude active land-owning companies from setting up PIEs should be reconsidered. (KPMG) The proposed rules for income sources relating to income derived from a lease of land in section HL 10(2)(b)(iii) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (section HM 12(b)(iv) of the rewritten provisions in the bill) should not apply where land holdings are separated by an active business into a PIE to raise funds from new investors by way of an offer made to the public. (Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Comment The policy intent of the PIE rules has always been that PIEs should be passive investment vehicles, such as managed funds. The existing PIE rules therefore prevent companies with active operations from becoming PIEs. PIEs are able to hold land, as well as shares and debt investments, since prudent investment management principles generally require portfolio investments to be diversified. Widely held companies can be PIEs if their main activity is to lease land and buildings to people who run businesses on those premises, since passive income includes rent from leases (but not payments from licences to occupy). Listed property trusts that own commercial buildings would generally fall into this category. 148 The PIE rules were not, however, designed for active businesses that hold most of their assets in land – such as airports, hotels and rest homes. The proposed amendments in the bill referred to by KPMG were announced in 2007. Consistent with the original policy intent of the PIE rules, these amendments prevent active land-owning companies from using certain loopholes in the law to set up PIEs – for example, by separating the land and active business parts of the business into different companies. Officials also do not agree that an entity with an associated entity that runs an active business from which it derives rental income from land should be able to be a PIE simply because the entity running the active business previously sought funds from new investors by way of a public offer. The treatment suggested in the submission would be inconsistent with the core policy principle of the PIE rules that PIEs should be deriving the majority of their income from non-active sources. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Public unit trusts Submission (33 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc) The current investor interest size requirement in section HL 9 should be retrospectively amended so that there is no investor interest size requirement for a portfolio investor class that, if treated as a unit trust, would meet the requirements of one or more of paragraphs (a) and (c) to (e) of the definition of a public unit trust. This should be in addition to the current provision which applies for an investor who would meet those requirements. Comment Officials consider that the correct interpretation of the investor interest size requirement in relation to certain funds in section HL 9(2) is that it applies to the class rather than the investor. This is consistent with the policy intent of the provision. Officials agree that the provision be expanded so that the public unit safe harbour can also apply at the investor level. As this amendment is consistent with existing policy and practice, it should apply from 1 October 2007. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 149 Issue: Exception for community trusts Submission (33 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc) In the new investor interest size requirement rules, section HL 9 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (section HM 21(1) of the rewritten provisions in the bill) “community trusts” should be added to the list of investors to which exceptions apply, after Auckland Regional Holdings. Comment Officials agree that as community trusts are established to manage public assets they are analogous to other entities that have been exempted such as the Earthquake Commission and Auckland Regional Holdings. The amendment should apply from the start of the 2009–10 income year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Portfolio investor proxy Submissions (33 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 32 – KPMG, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 60 – ASB, 62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) We propose that the use of “investor” in the investor interest size requirement rules in section HL 9 be amended to ensure that where a portfolio investor proxy is concerned, the underlying investor is the person who is limited to holding 20 percent or less of the class, rather than the portfolio investor proxy. A more compliance-efficient approach would be to allow a portfolio investor proxy to be an excluded investor, subject to a notification requirement at certain levels of holdings. (KPMG) Comment Officials agree that a look-through approach should be taken, provided that the portfolio investor proxy assumes the obligations of the PIE being invested into. As this amendment is consistent with existing policy and practice, it should apply from 1 October 2007. While the second submission has some merit, we consider that the current PIE rules, combined with the recommended amendments, would achieve the outcome that KPMG requests. 150 Recommendation That the first submission be accepted. That the second submission be declined. Issue: Investor size requirements – charities Submission (60 – ASB) Registered charities should be permitted to hold more than 20 percent of a PIE. Comment Officials do not consider there is a policy basis for having an exception in the general investor size requirement for charities. If this submission were accepted, it would provide the opportunity for charities to control PIEs, which was not the intention of the rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Exemption for investor interest size Submission (32 – KPMG) There should be provision similar to the less than 20 persons provision in the investor membership requirement in section HL 6(1)(j) in the investor interest size requirement in section HL 9 for certain small classes of investors in multi-class superannuation funds. Comment Officials agree with the submission. As this amendment is consistent with existing policy and practice, it should apply from 1 October 2007. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 151 BECOMING A PIE – TRANSITIONAL ISSUES Issue: Treatment of excess foreign investor tax credits Submission (32 – KPMG) The legislation should clarify how a PIE that has excess foreign investor tax credits before becoming a PIE can claim the value of those credits after becoming a PIE. Comment Officials consider that the current rules allow excess foreign investor tax credits to be carried forward and used for a future tax year. We note there is no provision allowing the credits to be converted into formation losses. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Tax credits for supplementary dividends carried forward upon transition into PIE Submission (33 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc) The tax credits from supplementary dividends should be grossed up at the company tax rate on the date of entry into the PIE rules and treated as formation losses. This change should apply retrospectively from 1 October 2007. Comment Officials consider that, under current income tax rules, PIEs can carry forward excess imputation credits which reduce the tax liability of the PIE as a whole. The provision relating to credits received by a portfolio tax rate entity or portfolio investor proxy in section HL 29 does not preclude this result. This is consistent with the rule that unless a general provision is specifically “switched off” in relation to a PIE it should be treated as applying to a PIE. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 152 ALLOCATIONS AND CALCULATIONS Issue: Portfolio class land-loss restriction on non-land losses Submission (33 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc) The proposed land-loss restriction in the rewritten rules in section HM 64 applies to all losses of an investor class. It should be restricted to losses arising from the investments in land or shares in the land investment companies when the required investment threshold is satisfied for the land-loss restriction to apply. The above scenario could be corrected by amending the definition of “land investment company” to exclude foreign PIE equivalents (referred to as “foreign investment vehicles” in the 2007 Act). Comment The submission points out that, in certain circumstances, tax losses of PIEs that own predominantly land (or shares in companies that own predominantly land) caused by foreign exchange losses on hedging contracts can be trapped at the PIE level. The policy intention of the PIE rules was not to allow the flow-through of losses for PIEs owning predominantly land. This was to alleviate the revenue risk of land PIEs generating large tax losses and passing these through to investors. While the foreign exchange losses on hedging can be seen as separate to the land investments, accepting the treatment suggested in the submission is likely to result in a large revenue risk. In addition, the foreign exchange instruments that provide the hedge are integral to the overall land investment and should not be separate from a tax perspective. We therefore recommend that the submission is not accepted. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Master fund expenditure passed up to a PIE Submission (32 – KPMG, 33 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 61 – Trustees Corporations Association of New Zealand) There should be no restrictions on how much expenditure is passed up to a particular PIE under the proposed changes to the rules on expenditure specific to certain entities in subpart DV. 153 Alternatively, if the proposed restrictions on expenditure are retained, there should be guidelines on how expenditure should be apportioned. Comment Officials have reconsidered the issue and agree that the restrictions proposed in the bill are not practical. The master fund should be allowed to use the expenditure to offset income of the investor across one or more classes in which the investor has an interest. However, the maximum amount of expenditure that can be transferred should be limited to the investor’s portion of the PIE’s income for the relevant calculation period or periods of the PIE. This will prevent expenditure in excess of the investor’s share of the PIE income being rebated to the PIE for the benefit of the investor – which would be an inappropriate result. The amendment should apply from 1 April 2008, which is the same as the application date for the main expenditure transfer rules as they apply to PIEs. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Formula for calculating maximum deduction for master funds that are portfolio tax rate entities Submission (33 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc) The current rules should be amended so that the provision that calculates the maximum deduction for expenditure transferred to master funds that are portfolio tax rate entities in section DV 6 should not apply. Comment Officials agree that the current rules should be amended so that the provision that calculates the maximum deduction for expenditure transferred to master funds that are portfolio tax rate entities in section DV 6 should not apply. The amendment should apply from 1 April 2008, which is the same as the application date for the main expenditure transfer rules as they apply to PIEs. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 154 Issue: Minimum threshold for paying rebates Submission (31 – NZ Funds) PIEs that calculate income and pay tax on a quarterly basis should not have to refund amounts that are less than $5 (representing their share of a tax credit) to investors who have fully exited the PIE. Comment The issue raised in the submission is part of a broader matter concerning the extent to which PIEs should receive rebates for losses when investors exit funds. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 155 TAX CREDITS AND LOSSES Issue: Formation loss available – reference to basic tax rates in schedule 1 Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The definition of “rate” for the purpose of the formula used to calculate the amount of formation loss available for allocation to an investor class in section HL 30(7)(c) should be amended to correct an incorrect clause of schedule 1. It should be amended to refer to “the rate of tax for companies set out in schedule 1, part A, clause 2”. Comment Officials agree that the definition of “rate” for the purpose of the formula used to calculate the amount of formation loss available for allocation to an investor class in section HL 30(7)(c) should be amended to correct an incorrect clause of schedule 1. It should be amended to refer to “the rate of tax for companies set out in schedule 1, part A, clause 2”. The amendment should apply from 1 April 2008, when the Income Tax Act 2007 came into effect. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Tax credits allocated to a zero-rated investor with income from a portfolio tax rate entity Submission (20 – BDO Spicers) The 2004 and 2007 legislation should clarify that a zero-rated company investor can claim a tax credit (other than a foreign tax credit) in its imputation credit account that is allocated to it by a portfolio tax rate entity. Comment Officials consider that the 2004 and 2007 legislation is already sufficiently clear that tax credits can be claimed by company investors in portfolio tax rate entities. The only situation where this is not currently the case is for imputation credits, and the amendments contained in the bill will ensure that imputation credits allocated by a portfolio tax rate entity to a company investor can be recorded in the company’s imputation credit account. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 156 TAX CREDITS AND LOSSES – INVESTOR RETURN ADJUSTMENT Issue: Investor interest adjustment Submissions (33 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 60 – ASB) The rules for adjustments to investors’ interests or to distributions in section HL 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (section HM 48 of the rewritten provisions in the bill) should be amended to require a PIE to adjust an investor’s interest or a distribution to reflect the investor’s prescribed investor rate within a reasonable time period – that is, that no specific date be prescribed in the legislation. Inland Revenue support material should advise that a “reasonable time period” would include payment made by the later of 30 June or 60 days of receipt of a PIE rebate for a PIE in a net-rebate position. The provision that causes the PIE to lose its PIE status because it has not met the investor interest adjustment requirement should be removed. Comment Officials agree that PIE status should not automatically be lost when this requirement is not satisfied within the required time period. This issue can be addressed with a provision allowing the Commissioner to extend the period within which this requirement must be met. The amendment should apply from 1 April 2008. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part, subject to officials’ comments. 157 FILING AND INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS Issue: Providing information to zero-rated investors Submission (60 – ASB) Portfolio investor proxies should be required to provide investors with information pertaining to their PIE investments no later than 31 July following the tax year instead of 30 June. Comment Officials understand the concerns raised in the submission. However, delaying the date on which information is required to be provided to investors later than 30 June, may adversely impact compliance for those investors as many will have 7 July tax return filing requirements. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Annual attribution – portfolio investor proxy’s exposure to penalties and UOMI Submission (60 – ASB) To ensure that provisional PIE tax payments based on third-party information are correct, portfolio investor proxies should be allowed until 31 July to make any additional PIE tax payments. Comment Officials understand the concern raised in the submission. However, commercial imperatives should ensure that the portfolio investor proxy receives details of the income it should be allocating to investors within an appropriate timeframe. Officials therefore recommend that the submission be declined. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 158 INVESTORS – PRESCRIBED INVESTOR RATE Issue: Zero-percent prescribed investor rate for individuals Submission (31 – NZ Funds) An individual PIE investor with an effective marginal tax rate of 0% should be able to elect a prescribed investor rate of 0%, upon application to Inland Revenue. Comment Officials do not support the submission for the following reasons: • The proposal would add significant complexity to the PIE rules. • There could be a high cost to Inland Revenue in administering the application process. • The proposal would be asymmetrical as investors could elect a 0% rate and flow through losses when they are in a loss position, and when they are in a positive income situation they could elect a non-flow-through treatment and have their tax rate capped at 30%. • It could be viewed as inequitable as investors that incurred an unexpected loss during the year would be disadvantaged relative to those with historical losses that could elect a 0% at the start of the year. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Prescribed investor rate for trustees Submission (61 – Trustees Corporations Association of New Zealand) PIE legislation for trustees should allow trustees to choose a “prescribed investor rate” of 12.5% or 21%. The tax paid then by the PIE will not be a final tax and the income allocated to the trustee will be taxable in the hands of the trustee or beneficiaries. The tax paid by the PIE will be available as a credit to either the trustee or beneficiaries. 159 Comment Officials agree. Allowing trusts to elect a lower PIE rate than 30% with the PIE income taxable at the trust level (and a credit for tax paid at the PIE level) should help certain trusts with provisional tax payments. This amendment should apply from 1 April 2009. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 160 INVESTORS – INCOME ALLOCATED BY THE PIE Issue: Individuals and inadvertent errors Submission (31 – NZ Funds) Portfolio investor allocated income should not be excluded income to a person who has accidentally elected a prescribed investor rate that is too high for that individual. Comment Officials do not support the submission for the following reasons: • The proposal would add significant complexity to the PIE rules. • There would be a very high cost to Inland Revenue in administering the application process. • The proposal would be asymmetrical as investors could elect a 0% rate and flow through losses when they are in a loss position, and when they are in a positive income situation they could elect a non-flow-through treatment and have their tax rate capped at 30%. • It removes the current incentive for people to elect the correct rate up-front. • The current rules already allow individuals to change their PIE tax rate at any time during the calculation period (usually a year). Officials also note that investors can change their portfolio investor rate before the end of the relevant period. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Zero rate investors in provisional tax PIEs Submission (32 – KPMG) A zero-rated investor in a provisional tax PIE should be entitled to make use of its share of tax credits to offset tax on the allocated income. This should also be reflected in the rewritten PIE rules. 161 Comment The policy intent behind introducing provisional tax PIEs was to provide the key benefits of the PIE rules but with lower compliance costs. As part of this approach to keep compliance costs low, losses are carried forward at entity level rather than allocated to individual investors. To allow zero-rated investors to make use of their share of tax credits would be inconsistent with the policy intent of introducing provisional tax PIEs. Officials note that provisional tax PIEs have the option to become full PIEs (portfolio tax rate entities) and in this case, zero-rated investors can make use of their share of tax credits. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Corporate investors in PIEs – no relief on subsequent distribution of excluded income Submission (33 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc) Excluded PIE income derived by a company investor that is a public unit trust (that is not a PIE) should retain its non-taxable character when the public unit trust distributes that income to its shareholders. This change would require retrospective amendment to the application date of the PIE rules. Comment A deliberate design feature of the company tax rules is that amounts that are exempt or excluded from tax at the company level are taxable if they are distributed to shareholders as a dividend. The issue described in the submission was considered and not accepted when the PIE rules were designed. It is therefore recommended that the submission be declined. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 162 GENERAL ISSUES Issue: Certificate of exemption for RWT Submission (31 – NZ Funds) PIEs should be automatically exempt from RWT and should not be required to apply for certificates of exemption from RWT. Comment Officials consider that the main concern underlying the submission (ongoing compliance costs for PIEs) can be accommodated through a change to Inland Revenue administrative processes. This would entail PIEs being granted open-ended RWT exemption certificates. While this would not remove the up-front requirement for PIEs to apply for an RWT exemption certificate, it would reduce compliance costs as future applications would not be necessary. Recommendation That it be noted that the concern underlying the submission has been addressed. Issue: Application of fund withdrawal tax rules to superannuation funds that have elected to be portfolio tax rate entities Submission (33 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 32 – KPMG, 60 – ASB) The fund withdrawal tax of an investor should not be allowed to affect the PIE taxable income calculations relating to other investors in the portfolio tax rate entity. The amount of fund withdrawal tax deducted from an investor should be payable as a separate tax payment (outside of the PIE tax rules). This can be by way of a new fund withdrawal tax payment form. The portfolio tax rate entity will make the payment annually, no later than 30 June, which will represent deductions made from withdrawals for the tax year to 31 March. For example, for a portfolio tax rate entity with a 31 March balance date, the initial year payment due on 30 June 2009 would include deductions made from withdrawals from the start date as a portfolio tax rate entity to 31 March 2009. 163 Comment Officials consider that this issue can be dealt with by ensuring that income that a PIE derives under the fund withdrawal tax rules should be treated as income to which no investor has an entitlement. This effectively results in the PIE accounting for the tax separately and paying tax at the PIE tax rate of 30%. The amendment should apply from the start of the 2008–09 income year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Currency hedging and FDR investments Submission (32 – KPMG, 33 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc) Fully hedged foreign assets which are subject to the fair dividend rate (FDR) within a PIE should be fully subject to FDR. The hedging should also be taxed under FDR. This would ensure that 100 percent hedging before tax would also be 100 percent hedging after tax for all investors in the PIE. Comment Officials agree conceptually that there is an argument that foreign exchange contracts that have been entered by a PIE to fully hedge the PIE’s assets that are subject to FDR should be subject to FDR along with the foreign asset that is hedged. This approach would allow PIEs to create an effective post-tax hedge for their investors. In addition, this approach should result in less volatile revenue flows for the government as the gain or loss on the foreign exchange contract would be neither taxable nor deductible. However, further work and consultation with the managed funds’ industry is necessary to develop the detail of any solution. It is therefore recommended that officials consider this submission further in consultation with the PIE industry with a view to introducing a legislative change later this year. Recommendation That officials consider this submission further in consultation with the managed funds’ industry and other interested parties. 164 Issue: Consolidated tax group including portfolio tax rate entities Submission (33 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc) The provisions relating to common ownership and wholly owned groups of companies (section IC 4) should be amended to clarify that a wholly owned group of companies can include portfolio tax rate entities and that this can apply to a portfolio tax rate entity that owns 66 percent of the voting interests in portfolio land companies. Comment The policy intention of the grouping rules as they apply to portfolio tax rate entities is that the benefits of the wholly owned group rules apply when a portfolio tax rate entity parent owns 100 percent of the underlying companies and the underlying companies are portfolio tax rate entities or portfolio land companies. The submission is correct that this policy intention has not been reflected in the rewritten provision in the bill. Officials therefore recommend that the bill be amended to confirm the policy intention. The amendment should apply from the recommended application date of the rewritten PIE rules – that is, 1 April 2010. Officials, however, do not agree that the 100 percent ownership requirement be reduced to 66 percent as this would undermine the policy intention of the PIE rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part. Issue: Imputation credit of ICA company passed on by portfolio tax rate entity Submission (20 – BDO Spicers) An imputation credit account (ICA) company is allowed an imputation credit for the amount of imputation credit allocated to it by a portfolio tax rate entity, from 1 April 2008. The Income Tax Act 2004 should similarly be amended so the provision applies for the 2007–08 income year. Comment Officials agree that an ICA company should be allowed an imputation credit for the amount of imputation credit allocated to it by a portfolio tax rate entity. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 165 DRAFTING ISSUES Issue: Minor drafting issues – Income Tax Act Submission (Matter raised by officials) A number of minor technical amendments to the PIE rules should be made to ensure that they achieve their policy intent. Comment Several submitters have raised a number of useful minor drafting points that officials consider should be incorporated into the current PIE rules to ensure they achieve their intended effect. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Remedial amendments to rewritten PIE rules Submission (Matter raised by officials) A number of amendments should be made to the rewritten PIE rules to ensure that they are an accurate translation of the current rules. Comment A number of submitters have raised useful drafting points in relation to the rewritten PIE rules that officials consider should be taken into account in the rewritten rules. Similarly, we have identified some minor drafting points that will ensure that the PIE rules operate as intended. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 166 167 Penalties 168 169 OVERVIEW The Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007 introduced a number of changes to the penalty rules in the Tax Administration Act. Officials have recommended that the following amendments be made to clarify practice and policy intent. They have not required detailed consultation, although officials have discussed the amendments with the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants. As these amendments clarify the policy intent they apply from the dates the amendments in the Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007 apply. 170 GRACE PERIODS Issue: Pre-emptive instalment arrangements Submission (Matter raised by officials) If the taxpayer enters a pre-emptive instalment arrangement, the grace period should not apply. Comment The Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007 amended the late payment penalty to provide a grace period under which Inland Revenue notifies a taxpayer the first time a payment is late rather than imposing an immediate late payment penalty. If payment is not made by a certain date, the penalty will be imposed. To encourage taxpayers to contact Inland Revenue as soon as possible, the second stage of the initial late payment penalty is not imposed if a taxpayer enters an instalment arrangement before the due date for payment of tax (this is known as a pre- emptive instalment arrangement). To provide a further incentive for taxpayers to contact Inland Revenue as soon as possible, officials recommend that the grace period is not applied for the period when a pre-emptive instalment arrangement is entered into but would apply at a later date if the taxpayer inadvertently misses a payment. This amendment also reinforces the policy of the grace period – that it ensures that taxpayers who inadvertently miss a payment are not penalised. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 171 Issue: Application to the first default identified Submission (Matter raised by officials) The grace period should apply to the first default identified by Inland Revenue. Comment It is possible for Inland Revenue to apply a grace period and then determine that the grace period should have been applied to an earlier period. For example, when a return is filed late, and a grace period has already been applied to a subsequent return when it should have been applied to the late return. To ensure that the taxpayer benefits from the grace period, the grace period should be applied to the first default identified by Inland Revenue. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 172 NOT PAYING EMPLOYER MONTHLY SCHEDULE (EMS) AMOUNT PENALTY Issue: Imposition of the late payment penalty on the EMS penalty Submission (Matter raised by officials) A late payment penalty should not be imposed on the EMS penalty. Comment An EMS penalty is imposed when an employer files an employer monthly schedule but does not pay some or all of the tax it should. The penalty was introduced in 2008 and is aimed at encouraging employers to comply by providing an incentive for them to pay tax associated with employer monthly schedules on time. It is imposed each month if the tax is not paid or the employer has not entered an instalment arrangement. A late payment penalty is imposed when taxpayers do not pay their tax, and any previous penalties imposed, on time. It too is imposed each month the amount remains unpaid. Currently the EMS penalty is also subject to the late payment penalty. To ensure that penalties do not accumulate too quickly, and are not disproportionate to the non-payment, officials recommend that the EMS penalty not be subject to the late payment penalty. The amount of tax not paid will still be subject to late payment penalties as well as use-of-money interest. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Negotiation periods Submission (Matter raised by officials) Employers wishing to enter an instalment arrangement should not be subject to the EMS penalty when they are negotiating an arrangement. 173 Comment Currently, an employer who files an employer monthly schedule but does not pay the tax may be liable to an EMS penalty. Before the penalty is imposed the taxpayer will be warned that if they do not pay or enter an instalment arrangement a penalty will be imposed the following month. To encourage employers to enter instalment arrangements, officials recommend that the EMS penalty should not be imposed when an employer is negotiating an instalment arrangement. If an instalment arrangement is not entered into or payment is not made, the employer will be warned and the EMS penalty will then be imposed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Corrected amounts Submission (Matter raised by officials) If the amount on the EMS changes, the EMS penalty should be calculated using the lesser of the corrected figure and the unpaid amount. Comment Currently, the EMS penalty is imposed on the lesser of the unpaid amount and the amount shown on the EMS when it is filed. Officials consider that if the employer corrects the schedule, the penalty should be calculated on the lesser of the corrected amount and the unpaid amount. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Ordering rule for payment Submission (Matter raised by officials) The legislation should set out a rule for the application of a payment when an EMS penalty has been imposed. 174 Comment If an EMS penalty has been imposed and a payment is then made, the payment should first be applied to the EMS penalty and then to the core tax owing. If the payment is not applied to the penalty first, taxpayers would pay the core tax and the penalty would remain outstanding with the risk that the penalty is never paid. Similar rules apply for late payment penalties and use-of-money interest. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Assessment of the EMS penalty Submission (Matter raised by officials) The EMS penalty should not be assessed in the same way as the tax to which it relates and the Commissioner should not give a notice of assessment to the taxpayer. Comment Under section 94A(2), a shortfall penalty is assessed in the same way as the tax to which it relates, and under section 111, the Commissioner must give a notice of assessment to the taxpayer. The EMS penalty is a shortfall penalty. However, unlike other shortfall penalties it is imposed each month that an EMS amount is not paid and is therefore more like a late payment penalty. Before an EMS penalty is applied, the employer is warned. When the penalty is applied, the employer receives another letter and a statement setting out the penalty and the core tax, therefore it is not necessary to send a separate notice of assessment. Officials consider that the EMS penalty should not be assessed in the same way as the tax to which it relates and the Commissioner should not give a notice of assessment to the taxpayer. This would mean that the EMS penalty and the late payment penalty are imposed in the same way. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 175 Issue: Imposition of the EMS penalty on amounts less than $100 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The EMS penalty should not be imposed on amounts of $100 or less rather than amounts of less than $100. Comment Penalties and interest are not charged on small amounts. In the current legislation, the EMS penalty is not imposed if the unpaid amount is less than $100. The legislation should be amended so that the penalty is not charged on amounts of $100 or less to ensure that it is consistent with other similar provisions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Imposition of penalties and interest on amounts of $100 or less Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 183F should be amended to apply on a tax-type basis rather than to the total amount outstanding. Comment Under section 183F, small amounts of penalties and interest are not charged. Officials also consider that the provision should be amended to apply on a tax-type basis rather than the total amount outstanding. This would still reflect the intention of the provision, which is that small amounts of penalties and interest are not charged but ensure that separate taxes are considered separately. Similar amendments should also be made to the late payment penalty and use-of-money interest provisions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 176 MISCELLANEOUS Issue: Removing tax agent status should not be a disputable decision Submission (Matter raised by officials) The decision to remove a tax agent from the list of tax agents or not to list a person as a tax agent should not be a disputable decision. Comment Following an amendment in the Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007, Inland Revenue must keep a list of tax agents. Inland Revenue has the ability to remove a person from the list or not list a person, if it is concerned that continuing to list the person as a tax agent would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. Operational guidelines set out the circumstances in which the discretion might be exercised. Before making a decision not to list or remove a person from the list, Inland Revenue is required to give a tax agent notice of the intention to revoke the agent’s status and give reasons for the intended revocation. The agent will be given a 30-day period (or a shorter period if Inland Revenue is concerned that there is a substantial risk to the revenue and a longer period if such a period is appropriate in the circumstances) in which to resolve the matters raised in the notice of intended revocation. Because sufficient time is allowed for the affected agent to comment and for those comments to be taken into account, officials consider that the decision of the Commissioner should not be a disputable decision. Tax agents will still be able to judicially review Inland Revenue’s decision. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 177 Issue: No new due date for default assessments Submission (Matter raised by officials) The requirement to set a new due date should be amended so that it does not apply when the Commissioner makes a default assessment. Comment The Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007 amended section 142A to allow a new due date to be set by the Commissioner, regardless of whether a return has been filed. The amendment ensures that both late payment penalties and shortfall penalties are not imposed if the taxpayer has not filed a return. For example, before the amendment to section 142A, if a return had not been filed and some time later Inland Revenue determined that there was income and a return was necessary, late payment penalties would apply from the original due date for payment with a possible shortfall penalty also imposed. As currently drafted, the amendment also applies if the Commissioner makes a default assessment. A default assessment is an estimation of tax liability and remains in place until the taxpayer files a return. A default assessment is likely to present a slightly larger debt than a self-assessment, and thereby encourage taxpayers to file returns. Given that a default assessment is made when there is a concern about non- compliance and a taxpayer has not filed a return, and that the assessment is reversed when the return is filed, officials consider it appropriate that a new due date is not set when a default assessment is made. When the return is filed, a new due date will be set. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 178 179 KiwiSaver remedial amendments 180 181 REMOVAL OF THE EMPLOYER TAX CREDIT ANNUAL SQUARE- UP Submission (Matter raised by officials) The employer tax credit annual square-up contained in the bill should not proceed. Comment Employer tax credits were removed by the Taxation (Urgent Measures and Annual Rates) Act 2008. The proposed square-up would therefore only be applicable for the 2008–09 tax year. The compliance and administration costs to employers and Inland Revenue do not justify a one-off square-up. Many employers do not have payroll software and it would be necessary to perform the complicated calculations manually. The small amounts involved in most square-up payments, particularly for small businesses, may not make it worth claiming. A number of employer agencies have been consulted. They acknowledged that the square-up is likely to be too small to worry about claiming given the compliance costs involved and would be more trouble than it is worth for small to medium businesses and those without automatic payroll software. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Calculation of the employer tax credit Clauses 258–261 Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The legislation should be amended to relate the calculation of the employer tax credit to the employer’s contributions actually made, subject to a maximum of $1,042.86. A taxpayer with fortnightly pay days should have the ability to elect to merely claim $20 per week per employee based on the number of payroll days that fall within that month. 182 Comment Employer tax credits were removed by the Taxation (Urgent Measures and Annual Rates) Act 2008, so the submission is no longer relevant. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (79 – Michael Chamberlain) The employer tax credit (ETC) annual square-up should proceed. The formula for calculating the employer tax credit in MK 10 of the Income Tax Act 2007 results in an under-calculation of the correct amount of ETC. The amount of a square-up may be significant and therefore worthwhile for an employer to claim. Comment The submission raises concerns about whether an employer would receive the full amount of the employer tax credit. Inland Revenue’s interpretation of current legislation is that the calculation in section MK 10 correctly delivers the vast majority of the ETC to employers. This addresses the submission’s concerns. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 183 CLAIMING ENTITLEMENT TO THE EMPLOYER TAX CREDIT ANNUAL SQUARE-UP Clause 260 Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Proposed section MK 12B(b) requiring that employers must claim their entitlement to any employer tax credit (ETC) square-up should be removed. Comment Employer tax credits were removed by the Taxation (Urgent Measures and Annual Rates) Act 2008, so any ETC square-up would only be applicable for the 2008–09 tax year. As a result of the administration and compliance costs involved, officials are recommending that the square-up not proceed. If this recommendation is accepted, the submission will no longer be relevant. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 184 CREDITABLE MEMBERSHIP – COMMISSIONER’S DISCRETION TO BACKDATE MEMBER TAX CREDIT Clauses 408(28) and 613(4) Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The Commissioner should have to backdate creditable membership if there is a delay in employee deductions being made, rather than the backdate being discretionary. Comment The proposal requires an employee to request that Inland Revenue nominates a start date, if the date for their creditable membership has been delayed for reasons outside their control. For administrative reasons, this backdating should be subject to the exercise of the Commissioner’s discretion and is also necessary as a safeguard against abusive practices. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 185 REPEAL OF SECTION 13 (EMPLOYMENT IN SCHOOLS) – APPLICATION DATE Clause 531 Submission (63 – Chapman Tripp) The repeal of section 13 should take effect from when the amending legislation is enacted and not be backdated to 1 October 2008. Comment Backdating the repeal of section 13 to 1 October 2008 would adversely affect Ministry of Education employees who were automatically enrolled after that date as a result of changing from one state or state-integrated school to another. When the repeal takes effect, any automatic enrolments during the backdating period would be retrospectively invalidated. Subsequently, the legal position – such as an employee’s membership in a KiwiSaver scheme – is unclear. If the repeal of section 13 is not backdated but instead takes effect from when the legislation is enacted, this legal uncertainty would be avoided. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 186 EXEMPT EMPLOYER PROVISIONS – SUNSET CLAUSE Clause 532 Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) There should be no general limitation on superannuation schemes (clause 532) as this restricts genuine employers from setting up schemes with possibly better benefits for employees. Rather, legislation should target specific employers who abuse the rules. Comment The proposed provision does not impose a general limitation on employers setting up superannuation schemes for their employees. The amendment is to deal with a concern that a number of employers are establishing superannuation schemes that qualify as an exempt employer scheme for the apparent purpose of avoiding the automatic enrolment rules of KiwiSaver. Under the KiwiSaver Act an employer is not required to automatically enrol new employees into KiwiSaver if they are registered as an exempt employer. This provision was introduced to reduce the compliance costs on employers that already had superannuation schemes in place that met the requirements of the exempt employer rules when KiwiSaver was introduced. This undermines the policy intent of the automatic enrolment rules of KiwiSaver and the rationale for the exempt employer rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 187 REFUNDS OF EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS IF EMPLOYEE OPTS OUT Clause 535 Submission (62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) The amendment to section 100 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 proposed in clause 535 is unnecessary, as amendments to the Employment Relations Act 2000 cover any situation in which the proposed amendment to section 100 may apply. Comment The proposed amendment to section 100 of the KiwiSaver Act requires Inland Revenue to refund to the employer any compulsory employer contributions if an employee opts out of KiwiSaver. Under this proposal, the refund cannot be used to offset tax debt. Section 101B of the KiwiSaver Act specifies that compulsory employer contributions may be paid in addition to an employee’s salary or wage. To avoid the possibility of reducing an employee’s total remuneration, any contributions must be refunded by Inland Revenue to the employer so they can be passed on to the employee. Clause 535 will therefore bring section 100 into line with the amended section 101B. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Clause 535 amending section 100 of the KiwiSaver Act should be deleted. Comment As compulsory employer contributions may form part of an employee’s total remuneration package, if an employee opts out of KiwiSaver such contributions must be returned by Inland Revenue to the employer so they are available to be refunded to the employee. The ability to use a contribution to offset tax debt prevents the employer from using it to refund the employee. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 188 SECTION 101FB – REFERENCE TO SECTION 34 Clause 538 Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The cross-reference in proposed section 101FB(1)(b) should be to section 34(1) not section 34(2). Comment Officials agree. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 189 GRACE PERIOD FOR EMPLOYERS – OPTING IN AND AUTOMATIC ENROLMENT Clause 538 Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section 101FB(1)(b) should be deleted. Section 101FB(1)(a) talks about automatic enrolment, whereas section 101FB(1)(b) is in relation to opting in. Therefore, there cannot be a circumstance where both apply. Comment A preferred solution would be to make paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 101FB(1) alternatives rather than conjunctive. That would cover both automatic enrolment and opting in directly to a KiwiSaver scheme provider, whereas the submission’s proposal would cover only automatic enrolment. An employer should not have to face unlimited liability to back-pay compulsory employer contributions if an employee who is not eligible for automatic enrolment opts in directly through a provider and the employer is not informed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 190 SECTION 101FB – GRACE PERIOD FOR EMPLOYERS Clause 538 Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section 101FB should be deleted. The employee should not be disadvantaged if other parties such as the employer and Inland Revenue make errors concerning automatic enrolment and compulsory employer contributions. Comment Section 101FB limits an employer’s liability to back-pay any unpaid compulsory employer contributions in the event of their non-compliance with the automatic enrolment provisions of KiwiSaver. Requiring employers to back-pay all unpaid compulsory employer contributions is not considered by officials to be a fair option, particularly because employees who are not subject to automatic enrolment can opt in at any time. The proposed grace period strikes a balance between the employer’s obligation to automatically enrol (and make employer contributions) and the employee’s obligation to make contributions from salary or wages. Furthermore, an employer’s open-ended liability under the status quo is administratively complex. A grace period would be simpler to administer while maintaining an incentive for employers to comply with their KiwiSaver obligations. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 191 SECTION 101FC MINIMUM AMOUNTS APPLYING TO “HYBRID” SCHEMES Clause 538 Submission (10 – New Zealand Society of Actuaries) Section 101FC should be amended so that it also applies for contributions to “hybrid” schemes. Comment New section 101FC introduces a rule so that an employer may not be required to make a top-up contribution if an employee is a member of a KiwiSaver scheme and an existing employer superannuation fund. As long as the amount of the contributions to the existing employer fund is calculated using the same compulsory employer contribution rate, there is no additional compulsory employer contribution payable (even if the dollar amounts are uneven as a result of a different salary basis being used). As currently drafted, the provision applies only to “other contributions” that meet the requirements of section 101D(5)(b). The provision should be extended to include “hybrid” scheme amounts as such amounts can be deducted from the amount of compulsory employer contributions required to be paid. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 192 SECTION 101FC MINIMUM CONTRIBUTION RATE Clause 538 Submission (10 – New Zealand Society of Actuaries) Proposed section 101FC should be amended to provide that employers are not required to pay a top-up if the amount of “other contributions” is calculated using a percentage at least as great as the compulsory employer contribution rate. Comment Section 101FC requires that the amount of other contributions be calculated at the same percentage as the relevant compulsory employer contribution rate in section 101D(4). This proposal will also apply to those employers contributing at a higher rate than the required compulsory employer contribution rate, so these employers do not have to pay a top-up if the requisite conditions are met. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 193 SECTION 101FC – REPLACE BY AMENDED FORMULA IN SECTION 101D(1) Clause 538 Submission (62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Proposed section 101FC should be removed, and the calculation of compulsory employer contributions in section 101D(1) be amended to incorporate its function. Comment Officials acknowledge that the formula proposed in the submission would achieve the same result as section 101FC. However, it would complicate the calculation of the amount of a compulsory employer contribution in section 101D for those employers who do not make other contributions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 194 MORTGAGE DIVERSION FIXED DOLLAR AMOUNT – APPLICATION DATE Clause 541 Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Clause 541 should apply from 16 October 2008. There were serious problems in implementing the mortgage diversion facility, which resulted in the KiwiSaver Amendment Regulations (No 2) to address those issues. Those regulations had effect from 16 October 2008, and therefore the application date of clause 541 should be the same. Comment The current application date of 1 July 2008 does not give rise to any problems. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 195 MINIMUM CONTRIBUTION RATES FOR EXEMPT EMPLOYERS WITH COMPLYING SUPERANNUATION FUNDS Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 64(1) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 concerning contribution rates should be amended to apply to exempt employers with complying superannuation funds. Comment The Taxation (Urgent Measures and Annual Rates) Act 2008 amended the contribution rate rules in section 64 of the KiwiSaver Act. It is not clear how the amended provision applies in relation to exempt employers with complying superannuation funds. In particular, the contribution rates in the amended section may not necessarily apply to employees of exempt employers who do not belong to KiwiSaver schemes. Officials consider that section 64 should be amended to ensure that the minimum contribution rates apply to exempt employers with complying superannuation funds. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 196 DEFINITION OF OTHER CONTRIBUTIONS – REMOVAL OF SECTION 101D(5)(A) Submission (62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Section 101D(5)(a) of the KiwiSaver Act should be removed from the definition of “other contributions”. Comment Officials do not consider there are any problems caused by the current drafting, and so no changes are necessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 197 OFFSET OF “HYBRID” SCHEME CONTRIBUTIONS AGAINST COMPULSORY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS Submission (10 – New Zealand Society of Actuaries) The hybrid schemes amount in section 101D(6) of the KiwiSaver Act should be amended to add an allowance for the amount of employer superannuation contribution tax payable on this employer contribution. Comment Under the KiwiSaver Act an employer who is contributing to an employee’s existing superannuation scheme can offset the amount of those contributions against the amount of compulsory employer contributions to KiwiSaver. The amount that can be offset is the amount the employer is required to pay, including the amount of employer superannuation contribution tax that is payable on such contributions. As the rules applying to hybrid scheme amounts do not refer to an employer’s superannuation contribution, the legislation does not provide any certainty that such amounts are inclusive of the amount of employer superannuation contribution tax payable. The policy intent is that it should and this is reflected in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin (April 2008) on the matter. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 198 MORTGAGE DIVERSION – USE OF PAST CONTRIBUTIONS Submission (Matter raised by officials) Mortgage diversion should apply only to contributions made after a person joins the mortgage diversion facility and not to a member’s previous contributions as well. Comment Currently, the wording of section 229 of the KiwiSaver Act could be interpreted as allowing up to half of a member’s total KiwiSaver funds to be diverted, including all past contributions. It is the policy intent that past contributions cannot be used under the mortgage diversion facility and the legislation should be clarified accordingly. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 199 FIRST HOME WITHDRAWAL FOR MEMBERS THAT HAVE MADE A CONTRIBUTION VIA INLAND REVENUE Submission (Matter raised by officials) Schedule 1, clause 8(1) of the KiwiSaver scheme rules should be amended to clarify that the provision applies to a member at the earlier of satisfying either paragraph (a) or (b), provided that the member also satisfies the criteria in paragraph (c). Comment Schedule 1, clause 8 of the KiwiSaver scheme rules sets out the requirements for withdrawing funds for the purpose of purchasing a first home. The current wording in clause 8(1) creates confusion with the use of “a member”, “any other member” and “any member”, and the use of “and” linking each paragraph. With this wording, if a person joins KiwiSaver directly through a scheme provider and contributes only via the provider, no matter how long they have been a member as soon as they send a contribution via Inland Revenue, the three-year time period for first home withdrawal restarts from the date the contribution was received by Inland Revenue. Officials recommend that, provided a member has not already made a withdrawal under clause 8, eligibility to withdraw funds under clause 8 applies to the earlier of paragraph (a) or (b). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 200 KIWISAVER SCHEME RULES – WITHDRAWAL OF FUNDS ON DEATH Submission (63 – Chapman Tripp) Clause 9 of the KiwiSaver scheme rules should be amended to stipulate that a deceased member’s balance must be paid either in the manner currently prescribed or, where the requisite conditions are met, in accordance with section 65(2) of the Administration Act 1969. Such an amendment should be considered to have taken effect from 1 July 2007. Comment Current law requires that probate or letters of administration be presented to trustees of a KiwiSaver scheme before a deceased member’s funds can be withdrawn. This results in additional compliance costs for the member’s personal representative as a result of legal expenses and delays associated with attaining probate or letters of administration. The accumulated funds in a KiwiSaver scheme should also be able to be paid out in a manner similar to that set out in section 65 of the Administration Act 1969 for certain superannuation funds. That is, trustees of a superannuation fund can pay a prescribed amount (currently not exceeding $11,000) from that fund direct to a named person without awaiting probate or letters of administration. This would be in addition to the current probate or letters of administration procedures. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 201 SCOPE OF THE EMPLOYER SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTION TAX EXEMPTION Submission (Matter raised by officials) The scope of the employer superannuation contribution tax exemption amended by the Taxation (Urgent Measures and Annual Rates) Act 2008 should be clarified. Comment This is a clarifying amendment to ensure that all employer contributions to KiwiSaver and complying superannuation funds, for members aged between 18 and 65, that were eligible to be exempt from ESCT up to the matching level of 2 percent before 1 April 2009 continue to be exempt from ESCT on and after 1 April 2009. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 202 DEFINITION OF “MEMBER CREDIT CONTRIBUTION” Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of “member credit contribution” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (and in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004) should be amended to exclude the $1,000 kick-start payment and the member tax credit. Comment In determining the amount of the member tax credit payable to a member, section MK 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 takes into account the total yearly amount of a person’s member credit contributions for all of their KiwiSaver scheme amounts and complying superannuation fund amounts. The definition of “member credit contribution” in section YA 1 is an amount of a superannuation contribution to a KiwiSaver scheme or complying superannuation fund, excluding employer contributions and contributions diverted under the mortgage diversion facility. The $1,000 kick-start payment and the member tax credit have not been excluded from this definition. The policy intent is that they should be excluded, otherwise members can “double-dip” by including these Crown contributions in the calculation of the member tax credit. Officials therefore recommend that an amendment be made to exclude the $1,000 kick-start payment and member tax credit from the definition of “member credit contribution”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 203 EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS (BREAKS, INFANT FEEDING, AND OTHER MATTERS) ACT 2008 – KIWISAVER-RELATED AMENDMENTS Submission (17 – Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand) Provisions in the Employment Relations (Breaks, Infant Feeding, and Other Matters) Act 2008 – which make it grounds for personal grievance if an employee is adversely affected because they are a member of KiwiSaver scheme – should be amended to limit the scope of these provisions to situations where an employee’s salary or wages are reduced because of compulsory employer contributions. Comment These provisions were repealed in the Employment Relations Amendment Act 2008. In addition, section 101B of the KiwiSaver Act was amended by the Taxation (Urgent Measures and Annual Rates) Act 2008 to ensure that compulsory employer contributions are in addition to an employee’s salary or wages when an employee joins KiwiSaver or changes employment. However, employers and employees have the ability as part of good faith negotiations to contract out of this general requirement. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 204 205 Miscellaneous remedials 206 207 RWT EXEMPTION FOR TOKELAU AND NIUE INTERNATIONAL TRUST FUNDS Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 32E(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to include the Tokelau International Trust Fund and the Niue International Trust Fund so their trust income is not subject to resident withholding tax. Comment The Tokelau and Niue international trust funds were established by the New Zealand government in 2000 and 2004 respectively and trust deeds for the trust funds were subsequently executed, with the parties to the trust deeds agreeing to ensure that the trust funds would be exempt from all direct taxation. Amendments were made to relevant tax legislation to ensure that the contributions received, income earned and distributions made by the Tokelau and Niue international trust funds would be exempt from taxation. However, resident withholding tax (RWT) has continued to be deducted from interest income earned by the funds in New Zealand. This is because a bank is obliged to withhold RWT unless Inland Revenue issues a certificate of exemption from RWT to the trust fund and the bank establishes that the trust fund holds the certificate. To be granted an exemption certificate, the trust funds must be included in the list in section 32E(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. By an oversight, section 32E(2) was not amended to include the Tokelau and Niue International Trust Funds. Officials therefore recommend an amendment be made so that the Tokelau International Trust Fund and the Niue International Trust Fund are listed in section 32E(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 208 GIFT DUTY – GENERAL POWER OF APPOINTMENT Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of “general power of appointment” should be reinserted in the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. Comment The Estate Duty Repeal Act 1999 repealed from the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 (EGDA) a number of definitions that were no longer relevant since estate duty had been repealed. One of the definitions that was repealed was “general power of appointment”. This term is, however, used in paragraph (e) of the definition of “disposition of property” in section 2(2) of the EGDA and is relevant for gift duty purposes. It was not intended in 1999 to repeal any provisions that apply for gift duty purposes. Officials therefore recommend that the definition of “general power of appointment” be reinserted in the EGDA. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 209 VALUE OF ACCOMMODATION PROVIDED BY EMPLOYER Submissions (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 53 – Ernst & Young) Section CX 28 of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be amended to ensure that the provision of accommodation by an employer is not subject to FBT. Section RD 5(8) should refer to section CE 1(c) instead of section CE 1(1)(c). Comment As the provision of accommodation by an employer to an employee is treated as salary or wages and subject to income tax, it should not be subject to FBT as well. The reference to section CE 1(1)(c) is correct. Recommendation That the submission on CX 28 be accepted. That the submission amending the reference to section CE 1(1)(c) be declined. 210 CONTRACTORS PROVIDING SERVICES TO THE AGRICULTURE, HORTICULTURE AND VITICULTURE INDUSTRIES Submission (Matter raised by officials) Changes are proposed to the schedular payments rules (formerly withholding payments). The current wording and scope of “horticultural contract work” in schedule 4, Part C of the Income Tax Act 2007, which deals with tax evasion by contractors who provide services to the agriculture, horticulture and viticulture industries, is unclear and should be amended. Comment Officials propose that the term “horticultural contract work” be changed to “cultivation contract work” and include – payments by growers in the agriculture, horticulture and viticulture industries to contractors that are substantially for the supply of labour, and payments by vegetable growers that are substantially for the supply of labour. Officials also propose that this definition specifically exclude payments to pack houses and management entities. Currently, the term “horticultural contract work” could catch contractors with a high capital component, or entities such as post-harvest facilities. This was not the intent of the rules as these entities are generally compliant and do not pose a threat to the revenue. In contrast, vegetable growers are not currently included within the definition and there is evidence of non-compliance within this sector. The new “cultivation contract work” definition that is proposed will ensure that those intended to be caught by the schedular payments rules are included, while those who are not, are excluded. The changes are supported by the industries concerned and will give them certainty while aligning current administrative practices with the law. Officials propose that these changes apply from 1 April 2010. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 211 THRESHOLD FOR ATTRIBUTION OF PERSONAL SERVICES INCOME Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section GB 27(2)(c) attributes income from personal services to the individual performing the services in certain circumstances. The bill proposes to raise the threshold at which the rules apply to $70,000 in 2009, $75,000 in 2010, and to $80,000 in 2011. However, the amendments relating to 2010 and 2011 should not apply. Comment The threshold at which the personal services attribution rules apply is intended to be the same as the threshold at which the top tax rate begins to apply. As a result of the Taxation (Urgent Measures and Annual Rates) Act, the threshold is not changing in 2010 or 2011. Accordingly, the threshold at which the personal services attribution rules apply should be $70,000. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 212 NON-RESIDENT ENTERTAINER Clause 386 Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Section RD 19(2) should not be repealed as it confirms that the income tax liability of a non-resident entertainer should equal the amount of tax withheld, if the only amount of income derived by the entertainer in a tax year is from a schedular payment. Comment The policy for the taxation of a person whose only New Zealand-sourced income is derived for services as a non-resident entertainer is that the person may choose to either file a return of income and claim expenses, or elect to be non-filing taxpayer. Section RD 19(2) as currently drafted prevents a non-resident entertainer from electing to file an annual return of income. The repeal of section RD 19(2) is linked to the amendment to the definition of non- filing taxpayer. Together, these amendments are intended to ensure that a non- resident entertainer, whose only New Zealand-sourced income is for services provided as a non-resident entertainer, is permitted to elect to be a non-filing taxpayer. Under the Income Tax Act 2007, the income tax liability for a non-filing taxpayer is equal to the amount of tax withheld from the income of the person. That is the outcome sought by the submission and it is therefore unnecessary to retain section RD 19(2). Recommendation The submission be declined. 213 TAX RELIEF ON REDUNDANCY PAYMENTS SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO PERSONS APPOINTED A DIRECTOR FOR ADMINISTRATIVE/SECRETARIAL PURPOSES Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The redundancy rebate should be made available to persons (not being shareholders) who are appointed a director of a company for administrative/secretarial purposes only. The amendment should be retrospective from 1 December 2006. Comment The redundancy tax credit (rebate) provisions include certain exclusions to mitigate the risks associated with the availability of tax relief for redundancy payments. One exclusion applies to company directors, who are often in a position to influence both redundancy contracts and the event of redundancy. In the time available, we have not fully reconsidered the matter. However, our view is still that the line that was drawn is appropriate. As with any hard line, there may be the odd person who is disadvantaged, however, we have integrity concerns if the line were to be moved. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 214 ADDITIONS TO THE LIST OF DEPRECIABLE LAND IMPROVEMENTS Clause 423 Submissions (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Clause 423(2) should be amended to include indoor land improvements. An alternative is that indoor sports grounds with purpose-built surfaces should be depreciated separate from the building under the “building fit-out” asset category. Comment The provisions will enable taxpayers to claim depreciation deductions for purpose- built surfaces if the surface is a land improvement that previously did not meet the definition of “depreciable land improvement”. Officials consider that an indoor purpose-built surface will generally form part of a building and buildings that are already depreciable land improvements. With respect to the alternative submission, the Commissioner already has the power to determine whether a type of indoor surface is a separate item of depreciable property (from the building) and can, where appropriate, allow a separate depreciation rate. For these reasons we do not support the submissions. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The term “grounds” should be replaced by “facilities”. Comment The term “facilities” is a broader term and it may better cater for development of the law in this area. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 215 DRAFTING ISSUES Income Tax Act In 2007, around 3,500 pages of the New Zealand tax legislation were enacted. This legislation included the Income Tax Act 2007. At 2,800 pages, this Act represented the fourth and final stage of the project begun in 1994 to rewrite the income tax law in plain language style. As an inevitable consequence of the rewriting process there has been a temporary but large increase in the number of remedial amendments necessary to maintain the tax law in sound working order. This increase is in part because very few remedial amendments have been enacted since December 2007. Of the remedial amendments proposed below, approximately 115 are typically of a minor nature and intended to correct matters such as incorrect numbering and cross-references, printing errors, incorrect terminology used, punctuation issues, and omitted words. Other amendments are of a less clerical nature, and arise both as rewrite issues, including submissions to the Rewrite Advisory Panel, and as clarification of policy in business as usual drafting. These 160 or so amendments affect provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007, Income Tax Act 2004, Tax Administration Act 1994, KiwiSaver Act 2006, Stamp and Cheque Duties Act among others. Of these, 30 issues were referred to the Rewrite Advisory Panel for resolution. In addition to the 119 remedial amendments included in the bill at introduction, officials recommend that the Committee proposes the inclusion of about 150 further remedial amendments, the need for which has been discovered since introduction of this bill, and which include the items referred to the Rewrite Advisory Panel. Amending Acts passed after this bill introduced Several Acts that amend tax Acts have been enacted since the bill was introduced to Parliament. They include the Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008, the Taxation (Urgent Measures and Annual Rates) Act 2008, and the Taxation (Business Tax Measures) Act 2009. Numbering and cross- references in the bill need to be adjusted to take into account the changes made by those Acts. Officials recommend that the Committee proposes the inclusion of such amendments. The schedule of amendments follows. 216 Schedule of remedial amendments Recommendation That the following submissions be accepted.

IQ 5(3) In subsection (3), clarify that, when applying ring-fencing to FIF net losses, if the maximum amount allowed to be subtracted from the person’s net income exceeds the ring-fenced income limitation, the excess amount is converted to an ordinary net loss to carry forward. This amendment clarifies how the surplus amount for FIF net losses referred to in section IA 2(4)(f) is determined for group companies. LB 4 Amend section LB 4 to clarify that the tax credit arising under subparts MD and ME (Working for Families and the Minimum Family Tax Credit, respectively) is reduced by the amount of any instalments of the tax credit due in the current year that have been used to repay an overpayment of subpart MD or ME credits in earlier years.

LJ 3 Replace section LJ 3. This amendment clarifies the nature of foreign income tax. LJ 5 Amend subsections (5) and (6) to restore the outcome under the corresponding provisions of the 2004 Act. Corrects an unintended change in law, as recommended by the Rewrite Advisory Panel. LJ 7 Replace section LJ 7. Improves readability.

LK 1 Amend section LK 1, insert an equivalent to section LC 1(3A), LC 4(1), (10), and section (11) of the Income Tax Act 2004. Corrects an unintended change in law, as recommended by the Rewrite Advisory Panel. LK 2(2)(b) Amend the definition of “tax paid” in section LK 2(2)(b) to omit “in relation to the person’s attributed CFC income”. A clarification arising from minor items referred to the Rewrite Advisory Panel. The amendment ensures that the calculation in section LK 2(1) apportions the total tax borne by the CFC based on the income interest of the person holding the attributed income interest. LP 4 Insert in the additional requirement, that before calculating a market value interest, a market value circumstance must exist. Corrects an unintended change in law, as recommended by the Rewrite Advisory Panel. MA 7 In definition of “full-time earner” replace subsection (1)(a) with subsection (1), and replace cross-references in subsection (2). Corrects cross-references.

The changes are the result of work that began in July 2006 and in response to submissions and comment received on two officials’ issues papers and one government discussion document. Life insurance companies are companies that carry on a life insurance business and are registered under the Life Insurance Act 1908 to write life insurance policies. When the current life insurance rules were enacted, most of the large insurers in New Zealand were mutual entities – meaning they were owned by their policyholders, and premium contributions as well as retained investment income built up over the years contributed to the capital base of the life insurer. All of the large insurers are now limited liability companies (though some operate in New Zealand as branches of foreign companies), and most are owned by foreign companies. Many of the large life offices operate within financial services groups of companies that generally provide a wide range of savings products and, in some cases, general insurance. Some subsidiaries of banks are now involved in writing life policies. Until the 1980s, the products most frequently offered by life insurance companies were the traditional whole of life and endowment products 1 . Since the current life rules have been in operation, term insurance business has increased from being less than 10 percent of total industry premiums to now over 50 percent. Term insurance is a pure risk product that pays out only on death (within the term of the policy). There is no savings component, which means that these policies have more in common with general insurance (such as motor vehicle or home and contents insurance) than traditional savings-related policies. The nature of modern life insurance companies and their business is illustrated in figure 1. The life insurer, like other businesses, operates to provide an economic return to shareholders who have contributed capital in the company. The life insurer also receives premiums from policyholders which are invested or used to meet expenses and claims. The net returns from the invested funds produce returns for the shareholder, and in the case of savings policies, for the policyholder as well. Certain policies which “participate” in the profits of the life insurer allocate the life insurer’s profits to the benefit of the policyholders in those products. Otherwise, the profits from the life insurer are available (subject to corporate law and regulatory requirements) to be returned to shareholders. 1 A frequently used way of describing life products is whether they are participating or non-participating policies. A participating policy (also known as a “with profits policy”) is a policy entitled to participate in distributions of profit – as most whole of life and endowment policies are. Conversely, a non-participating policy (also known as a “without-profits policy”) does not participate in distributions of profit, examples being term life insurance and most unit-linked policies. 4 Figure 1: Structure of modern life insurance business The net assets of a life insurer are owned by the shareholders. The rights of the policyholder are by way of contract with the life insurer and do not extend to specific assets. The economic policyholder “ownership” rights in the company are generally reflected in “unvested policyholder liabilities”. 2 Current tax rules The current rules tax life insurers on a two-tier basis. The first tier, the life office base (LOB), taxes the income earned for the benefit of both shareholders and policyholders of the life insurer (and a reinsurer) as a whole. It consists of investment income less expenses, and underwriting income (basically the difference between the premiums earned and the costs of settling claims but which is calculated under the current rules by way of a formula. Income accruing to policyholders is taxed to the life insurer on a proxy basis under the policyholder base (PHB). Income is calculated by a formula equal to the increase in reserves plus benefits (such as claims) paid, plus underwriting income less premiums. The tax base is grossed up by (1 – the LOB tax rate) to arrive at the before-tax amount necessary to provide the after-tax benefit implicit in the policy. Tax paid on the LOB generates imputation credits that can then be used to meet the PHB liability (thus avoiding double taxation) or as tax credits on dividends paid to shareholders. 2 Nevertheless, many unbundled products give their policyholders rights to a group of assets which are very close to the right of beneficial ownership, and therefore pull back all investment profits. • Financial arrangements • Equities (and deemed equities) • Real property Premiums Life insurer Share capital Shareholders Policyholders Investable funds Investment Returns Claims/Investment Returns Dividends 5 Individuals generally cannot claim a tax deduction or get a tax credit for life insurance premiums paid (as happens in some countries) but, on the other hand, they are not taxed on insurance proceeds. There are two fundamental problems with these rules. The first is that they under-tax term insurance profits. The second is that they over-tax savings income. Term insurance The key factor in the current taxation formula of components of underwriting income is the premium loading formula which brings to tax 20 percent of the “Expected Death Strain” (EDS) which are the expected claims. The 20 percent of EDS bears no relationship to actual profit. Typically, the expenses of many term insurance products are at least, and in many cases considerably more than 20 percent of expected claims. This implies that such products will always generate a loss for tax under the formula. The anomalous tax result is illustrated in Example 1. Example 1 Financial accounting LOB Tax Premiums 100 Claims (=Expected claims) (45) 0 Investment income 10 10 Expenses (40) (40) Premium loading (20% claims) 9 Accounting profit/ tax (loss) 25 (21) In this example, where there is a loss ratio (claims ÷ premiums) of 45%, a $25 accounting profit translates into a $21 tax loss. This tax loss may be offset against other profitable business of the company, or with that of another company that is part of the same wholly owned tax group as the life insurer, in which case the after-tax return to the life insurer (at a 30% tax rate) is $31.30. Even more incongruous, a greater accounting profit on term insurance business may result in a greater tax loss. If another life insurer had the same financial accounting results as in the previous example, except that claims were $25 (a loss ratio of 25%), the accounting profit and the LOB tax would be as follows in Example 2. 6 Example 2 Financial accounting LOB Tax Premiums 100 Claims (=Expected claims) (25) 0 Investment income 10 10 Expenses (40) (40) Premium loading (20% claims) 5 Accounting profit/ tax (loss) 45 (25) The lower expected claims result in a premium loading for tax of $5 and a tax loss of ($25). So, although accounting profit is actually $20 higher than in the first example, the corresponding tax loss is also higher. Artificial tax losses such as these demonstrate that the tax system is effectively providing a subsidy to insurers, which was not the intent of the legislation. In effect, life insurers are not being taxed on the profit they make on term risk business and so are treated more favourably than other businesses. Savings Policyholders saving through certain life insurance products, unlike other investments, are effectively taxed on unrealised investment gains. They are also taxed at investors’ marginal tax rates, not at a proxy rate of tax. Proposed new tax rules The proposed new rules for the taxation of life insurance business are designed to introduce an integrated framework that: • taxes life risk business on actual profits in a manner similar to the way that other businesses are taxed; and • extends the tax benefits of the portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules to all savers in life products. Under the new rules, life insurers will be taxed on two bases: a shareholder base (representing income derived for the benefit of shareholders) and a policyholder base (representing income derived for the benefit of policyholders). Detailed provisions apply to taxing participating policy income between the shareholder and the policyholder bases. Policyholder base income cannot be offset with losses or credits from either the shareholder base or any other company in the life insurer’s tax group. The amendments in this bill also extend the benefit of the PIE rules to policyholders in all life insurance savings products. Under the new rules, life insurers can also elect to attribute income in investment-linked products to policyholders at their individual PIE rates. 7 The nature of life insurance gives rise to complexities in applying tax concepts. The long-term nature of most policies makes it difficult to match income and expenses appropriately, and therefore complex legislative provisions are required to equitably bring to tax income and expenses in the correct period. In addition, complexities in determining the relevant mix of savings return, savings and risk intermediation, and risk pooling inherent in some life policies also requires detailed rules to appropriately allocate the tax burden between shareholders and policyholders. Moving from the current life tax rules to the proposed rules will affect life insurers’ business and accounting processes. To mitigate the impact, detailed transitional rules will apply for term-insurance products sold before the application date. Generally, existing policies will be grandparented under the current rules for up to five years. However, if a policy is a single premium, level premium, or guaranteed premium, it could be grandparented for the life of the policy or for the period for which the premium is guaranteed. Policies cannot be subject to any fundamental change in their terms during the transition period – otherwise a new policy is created and it is fully subject to the new rules. However, it is proposed that certain minor changes to the amounts of cover would not cause grandparenting to be lost. The proposed PIE benefits will apply immediately on the application date. Generally, subject to ordinary shareholder continuity and other specific rules, tax and credit balances, and losses from the LOB can be carried by the life insurer into the new rules. The life insurance provisions attracted 16 submissions 3 and focused on the following matters: • opposition to the proposed changes; • alternative methods of taxation; • application dates; • basis of taxation; • reserves; • participating policies; • reinsurance; • transition; • miscellaneous technical issues; and • drafting. 3 Multiple submissions from the same organisation are treated as one submission. 8 Officials are recommending a range of technical changes in response to submissions. Of most importance to the life insurance sector is the recommendation that the application date of the changes be deferred to 1 July 2010 (with early application at the election of the life insurer in certain circumstances). Other important changes that we are recommending in response to submissions are as follows: • changes to the operation of the premium smoothing reserve to ensure the legislation reflects policy intent; • providing a low compliance alternative to the taxation of existing participating policies; • providing consistent treatment of reserves for non-life products held by life insurers; • allowing tax balances carried forward into the new rules to be applied against tax liabilities arising in the shareholder base and the policyholder base; and • changes to clarify the calculation of taxable income under the new rules. 9 OPPOSITION TO THE PROPOSED CHANGES While Minter Ellison Rudd Watts and the life industry generally, and the New Zealand Society of Actuaries (at the oral hearing of the Finance and Expenditure Committee on 11 and 19 March respectively) accept the policy principles underlying the reforms, some submitters do not like the effect of the proposed rules because they remove tax benefits created by the operation of the current rules. Some submissions have argued that life insurance provides wider benefits to society and therefore the current life insurance tax rules should not be changed, or any alternative rules should include tax incentives. Issue: Social implications Submissions (32 – KPMG, 33A – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 52 – Sovereign) Submissions are of the view that the life insurance tax reforms are unnecessary and should not proceed. The principal arguments are: • The rationale for the life insurance tax reforms should be considered further. The reason for the reforms appears to be the need to remove perceived tax benefits. The tax benefits are being passed on to policyholders. • On public policy grounds, life insurance provides a social good that should be supported by the government. In principle, policyholders should be able to claim deductions for premiums. But this would create additional compliance and administration costs. The current rules effectively create a similar result, with the tax benefits accruing to the insurer as a proxy for the policyholder. Comment The comprehensive changes to the taxation of life insurance in this bill introduce an integrated framework extending many PIE benefits to all savers in life products. Under current rules, term insurance profits are taxed on the basis of artificial formulas which were not designed with these products in mind. The formula results in otherwise profitable business generating a tax loss. The aggregate tax benefits to life insurers resulting from these artificial losses amount to an effective $75m (at least) tax subsidy annually. The proposed revised rules tax life insurers on their actual profits from term insurance in the same manner as any other business in New Zealand. In any case, there is absolutely no reason to provide tax concessions to life insurance. While life insurance provides social benefits, so do numerous other goods and services. For example, fundamental human needs such as food, shelter and comfort are not subsidised by the tax system. 10 Even if an argument could be made that life insurance requires special tax concessions above all other goods and services, providing tax concessions to the providers of life products rather than directly to the policyholder, as these submissions suggest should continue, has no policy justification and no precedent. The economic benefits of the current tax treatment are basically reflected in a combination of lower premiums, increased profits to insurers, and higher costs, particularly as the industry recognises that it pays a high level of commissions to insurance sales people. There is no certainty therefore that all of the tax benefits that are currently enjoyed by life insurers are being passed to consumers in the form of lower premiums. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Impact of proposed rules on affordability Submission (32 – KPMG, 33A – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 52 – Sovereign, 55 – Asteron) The proposed rules will require an increase in premium prices of up to 30 percent, making life insurance unaffordable for many, and contributes to New Zealand’s under-insurance. The submission argues against the need for life tax reform (because it would be contrary to social policy) and suggests delaying the application of reforms. Comment The pricing of life insurance premiums takes into account a number of factors such as an individual’s health and lifestyle, and the costs of selling and administering the policy such as commissions paid to advisers. Taxation is a relatively small component when compared with some of these other factors. The potential financial impact of the proposed changes on individual policyholders also needs to be objectively considered. For example, the Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc considers the benchmark minimum-term life cover to be five times the average annual wage. Assuming this amount to be $250,000 the monthly premium for a 35-year-old male non-smoker for term life cover of this amount, based on an average from several major insurers, would be currently about $20. Even if, as a result of the new rules, products fully subject to the proposed rules are 20 percent more expensive, which officials consider is at the higher end of potential increases, the monthly premium would be $24, a difference of $4 to the premium paid currently. There is no commonly accepted definition of “under-insurance” just as there is no definition of “over-insurance”. Comparisons of insurance levels between countries are not conclusive because of: 11 • different tax treatments (in some countries insurance benefits are subject to tax or death duties); • types of insurance (some countries’ statistics include investment contracts which are basically savings plans), cost of cover (the same level of cover may cost more than the equivalent contract in another country); and • availability of insurance equivalents and social welfare network (for example, New Zealand’s comprehensive ACC scheme). However, in a free market, given the level of information available about life insurance, it could be strongly argued that the current insurance levels reflect the consumer preferences to purchase life insurance, in the same way for any goods or services. The alternative to the proposed reforms is to maintain tax incentives provided to life insurers under the status quo. As discussed earlier, there are considerable policy arguments against this approach. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Alternative method of taxation Submission (52 – Sovereign) The submission agrees that taxation of insurance needs reform but does not support the proposed measures as it considers they do not take into account social policy issues and the “inevitable worsening of the financial position of New Zealanders through a reduction in life insurance below prudent levels”. The submission suggests an alternative that, in broad terms, is based on the rules contained in the bill with regards to term insurance, with the important difference that claims would be taxable and premiums deductible to individuals. While individuals could take deductions for premiums and pay tax on claims in their individual tax returns, the submission suggests that to reduce compliance costs, this could be done by the life insurer, who would deduct all premiums received and add all claims paid against the insurer’s taxable income. As generally premiums exceed claims in a life insurance business, this would result in a tax loss on the risk business. The insurer could offset this loss against other income from the company or corporate group. The tax benefit would be passed through in the form of lower premiums to policyholders. 12 Comment The fundamental premise of the suggested alternative, that because life insurance performs a social function, it should receive tax preferences, has been discussed earlier. Additionally, there are a number of other fundamental policy objections to the submission: • The idea of taxing of claims is foreign to New Zealand and has been adopted only in a small number of countries. If adopted here it would mean that a person insured for say, $100,000 cover would only receive $70,000 after tax, which could cause financial distress to the beneficiaries who might be unaware that the pay-out was taxable. • Taxing claims would also mean that obtaining the same after-tax level of cover would require the cover to be grossed up by the tax rate. This would mean higher premiums, which would tend to negate the supposed “lower premiums” offered in the first place. The tax benefit given to the life insurer under the current rules may be reflected in lower premiums but there is no guarantee that some of it may not be reflected in the insurer’s profits and/or higher costs (for example, commissions). Providing tax benefits in excess of $135m annually to life insurers (based on current industry figures and assuming full implementation of this alternative) based on no more than an unverifiable hope that the benefits will be passed on, dollar for dollar, in the form of lower premiums, is an inefficient way to transmit targeted tax benefits. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Tax incentives for non-residents Submission (64A – Payroll Giving Limited) The submission seeks a tax exemption for investment income irrespective of its source, attributable to non-resident policyholders of New Zealand life insurance policies. As an alternative to this exemption, the following amendments are sought: • restrict the tax exemption to policyholders who are residents of a country that has a double tax treaty with New Zealand; • a tax exemption for non-source income attributable to non-resident holders of New Zealand life insurance policies; • non-resident withholding tax rules should apply to interest income attributable to non-resident policyholders and also be eligible for approved issuer levy status. 13 Comment Under the proposed rules, all investment income earned by life insurers will be taxed either on the shareholder base or the policyholder base. The amendments sought by the submission are to enable New Zealand-domiciled insurers to participate in the international insurance market, and to replicate favourable tax treatments given by other countries by providing certain incentives. The proposed tax rules are intended to remove tax preferences for life insurers under the current rules. They have not extended to providing tax preferences to particular existing or potential policyholders. The potentially wide-reaching ramifications of accepting the alternatives proposed in this submission would need to be discussed with all stakeholders. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 14 DEFERRAL OF APPLICATION DATE Submissions (32 – KPMG, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 33A and 33B – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 41 – AXA New Zealand, 52 – Sovereign, 55 – Asteron, 62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 68A and 68C – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Submissions suggest a variety of options for deferring the application of the changes to the taxation of life insurance business. Most submissions note that there are significant problems with the rules as currently proposed. Deferring the application date would allow insurers sufficient time to understand the rules and develop robust systems to comply with the new rules. Other reasons for changing the application date contained in the bill include: • The need for a “hard” application date that will apply to all insurers. Under the current bill, insurers with a balance date later in the calendar year will have a significant advantage over insurers with an earlier one. While the current “balance date” application contained in the bill is preferred because it reduces complexity and compliance costs, the commercial implications created by the rules need to be addressed by adopting a “hard” application date. (Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc) • The global downturn is having a material impact on the balance sheets of most life insurers and the timing of when the proposed changes come into effect needs to be reconsidered. (Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, Sovereign) The options for deferring the application of the changes are: • The new taxation rules should be deferred until at least one year after the reforms have been enacted. (PricewaterhouseCoopers, Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) • The application date should apply to income years starting on and after 1 April 2010. The grandparenting rules should also apply from 1 April 2010 or not until after six months have past since the bill has been enacted. (AXA New Zealand) • The application date should be deferred to income years starting 1 April 2011 at the earliest. (KPMG, Sovereign) • Insurers should have the choice of application dates – either their first balance date after 1 April 2010 or a “hard” date of 1 January 2011. (Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Asteron, Corporate Taxpayers Group) 15 Comment The bill provides that the change to the taxation of life insurance business starts for insurers with income years beginning on and after 1 April 2009 and in respect of life insurance policies sold on and after 1 April 2009. As the enactment will occur after 1 April 2009, the Minister of Revenue, on 25 March 2009, asked the committee to give serious consideration to a number of deferrals, in whole or in part, of application dates in the bill, and requested “that the application date of the new rules be deferred until a date to be determined following further discussion with the industry”. The Minister’s request was especially supported by the Corporate Taxpayers Group. Officials have discussed the application date options, including the option of creating a “hard” date, with a committee from the Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc representing the life insurance industry. A hard application date would mean that the rules would apply to all life insurers from a specified date. This could mean that when the hard date bisects an insurer’s income year, the insurer would be required to complete a separate tax return for the period before the specified date and another for the period after. Both Inland Revenue and life insurers consider that the costs of preparing and auditing two income tax returns in the same calendar year are manageable. Officials are mindful of the logistical requirements for life insurers to be able to apply the new rules. However, officials are also mindful that delaying the implementation of the new rules may adversely affect policyholders of life insurance savings products. Following our discussions with the Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, officials recommend that the new rules apply on and after 1 July 2010. This date would apply to the changes to the taxation of life insurance business and the application of the PIE taxation system to policyholder savings policies. This “hard” application date is intended to deal with the equity and competition problems identified by the submissions on the bill. The five-year grandparenting period would also start from that date. The recommended application date also ensures that all life insurers have sufficient time (10 to 11 months from the likely enactment date of the bill) to develop adequate compliance systems that respond to the new rules. The industry has also asked for flexibility for insurers who may want to implement the new rules at an earlier date. Officials consider this flexibility is desirable as it would give life insurers an opportunity to provide extended PIE benefits to their policyholders and it may reduce compliance costs for life insurers with balance dates earlier than 30 June 2010. Therefore, officials consider that while the application date for the new life insurance rules should generally be 1 July 2010, that life insurers be given the option to apply the new rules from the beginning of their income year if that year includes 1 July 2010. Officials also consider that if a life insurer elects to apply the new rules from the beginning of their income year, they should be able to make a further election that grandparenting will apply to policies entered into before the beginning of the same income year. If they do not make this election, grandparenting will apply to policies entered into before 1 July 2010. 16 Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part, so that the new rules, and the grandparenting provisions, will apply from 1 July 2010, with an option for life insurers to elect to apply these rules from the beginning of their income year, if the income year includes 1 July 2010. Officials also recommend that life insurers who have elected to apply the new rules from the beginning of their income year be able to make a further election to apply the grandparenting rules from the beginning of the same income year rather than from 1 July 2010. 17 BASIS OF TAXATION The proposed tax rules require an allocation of all types of life insurance income and expenditure, and related tax balances to either the new shareholder base or the policyholder base. They provide for a number of ways in which this can be done. A number of submissions requested clarification or suggested improvements on the allocation methods and related issues contained in the bill. Issue: Apportionment of income Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 53 – Ernst & Young) The apportionment basis should be extended to allow a specific identification basis which may also be “equitable and reasonable”. Comment Section EY 4 provides for an alternative basis (other than the “Default basis”) for apportioning income to the policyholder and shareholder bases. The alternative basis is limited to one which is “actuarially determined and is more equitable and reasonable” than the default basis. Officials consider that the alternative basis is sufficiently broad to allow a “specific identification” basis, if that produces a more “equitable and reasonable” result. Any further extensions of the apportionment basis is therefore unnecessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Non-participating policies – GAAP accounting Submission (53 – Ernst & Young, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The reference to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) should be removed and replaced with a definition of “investment income” for life insurers to ensure that only investment income for tax purposes is apportioned to policyholder base income. 18 Comment Proposed section EY 15(1)(c) relies on GAAP to allocate investment income relating to non-participating policies to the policyholder base. In recent years, the financial accounting concept for accrual and disclosure of income has changed with the adoption of international financial reporting standards (IFRS) which, in some cases, may be different from the accepted principles for income tax purposes. Officials consider that the criteria for apportionment (including alternative methods) in the bill are clear and understandable and would not result in any material mis- allocation of income in the life insurer. A reference to investment income determined under tax legislation as proposed in this submission, on the other hand, may have elements of circularity and be complex to legislate and comply with. However, officials note that if a life insurer does invest the assets of the policyholder into a reinsurance arrangement that earns the investment income of the policyholder by way of a reinsurance claim, then that investment would be life financial reinsurance and a financial arrangement. Proposed section EY 15(1)(c) which requires investment income to be recorded under GAAP would preclude that life financial reinsurance income from being investment income. Therefore that paragraph needs to be amended to include income from life financial reinsurance. Recommendation That the submission be declined, however, the words “or income derived from life financial reinsurance” be included in proposed section EY 15(1)(c). Issue: Non-participating policies – average values Submission (53 – Ernst & Young, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Life insurers should be allowed to select a basis for calculating the average values that are to be used in the formula in proposed section EY 15(2). The basis must be applied consistently when apportioning such investment income. Comment Section EY 15(2) provides that in the event investment income may be shareholder gross income in terms of section EY 19, the investment income should be apportioned to the policyholder base income based on the average surrender value relative to the average savings assets. The bill does not prescribe the method to determine average surrender values. 19 The definition of “average surrender value” officials consider is a clear and understandable concept for life insurers and does not require further precision. If the apportionment was to result in an unfair apportionment of income, the life insurer could instead adopt the “equitable and reasonable” basis prescribed in section EY15 (4). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Profit participating policies – average values Submission (53 – Ernst & Young) The method to be used to calculate the average value in proposed section EY 17 should either be defined in the legislation, or life insurers should be allowed to select their own basis for calculating such averages, subject to applying their selected method consistently from year to year. Comment Proposed section EY 17 provides a formula for determining a life insurer’s “policyholder base gross income” by reference to an “average of policy liabilities over the income year” and “an average of the asset base’s value over the year” (paragraph EY 17 (1)(b)) but does not describe how the averages should be calculated. Officials consider the concept of “average” should be readily understandable to life insurers and does not require prescriptive rules, provided life insurers calculate the “average” consistently. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, by allowing life insurers to select their own basis for calculating such averages, provided the method is applied consistently between income years. 20 Issue: Components of policies Submission (10 – New Zealand Society of Actuaries Inc) It needs to be understood that the components of composite policies, such as the life risk component of premiums, will involve estimations, and the methods of estimation may vary between companies. Comment The proposed rules are largely based on calculations performed by life insurers which in turn are largely based on actuarial principles. Officials acknowledge that these calculations require professional judgement, and these judgements may legitimately vary between companies and will bring this understanding to bear when applying the new rules. Officials note that the estimations have to comply with the definition of “actuarially determined”. Conformity with this definition should reduce the estimates of life risk differences between life insurers. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Shareholder base deductions Submission (33A – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 52 – Sovereign, 55 – Asteron) The proposed legislation should ensure that all direct and indirect expenditure incurred by the life insurer is deductible in the shareholder base. Comment Proposed section EY 20 requires a direct nexus between the shareholder base gross income derived and the expenditure or losses derived. On this basis it is possible that some general and direct business expenditure incurred by the life insurer but not directly incurred in relation to the income will not be deductible under section EY 20. If so, this is contrary to the policy intent, and therefore needs to be remedied. Proposed section DR 2(5) overrides the general permission for deduction of expenses and officials agree there is no guidance on the relationship between income. Submissions argue that, for example, some overheads in selling and administering a bond portfolio may have no direct nexus to income but would be deductible under normal principles, and officials agree that this expenditure should be deductible. 21 Officials therefore accept it is not clear what expenditure or loss in proposed section EY 20 might include and recommend the legislation be clarified. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Alternative method for apportionment between shareholder base and policyholder base Submissions (53 Ernst & Young, 55 – Asteron, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The legislation should be amended to allow life insurers to apportion the expenditure or loss between policyholder and shareholder base on a basis that is equitable and reasonable. The requirement that the expenditure should have a nexus to policyholder base gross income should be removed. Comment Income should be split fairly between the shareholder and policyholder base and should be subject to as little manipulation as possible. If not, shareholders may generate imputation credits on true policyholder earnings. Also, some insurers with economically profitable businesses may end up with overstated net income on the policyholder base, and losses on the shareholder base leading to over-taxation, which could make the business unviable. Therefore, a nexus test must still be maintained. Under proposed section EY 16, policyholder base gross expenditure is restricted to the extent that the expenditure is incurred in deriving policyholder base income as provided for in section EY 15. As policyholder base gross income is solely investment income, it is arguable that life insurers will be able to deduct from the policyholder base only direct investment- related costs incurred by the insurer on that income (likely to be small). If non-direct investment expenditure and other overheads are not deducted against the policyholder base they will instead be deducted in the shareholder base under proposed subsections EY 20(2)(e) and (f). If this occurs it will lead to most expenses being deducted on the shareholder base generating losses, whereas the policyholder base could have substantial income and little allowable expense. Officials agree that there should, however, be a trade-off with compliance costs, with one of the aims of the legislation to allow life insurers to use existing actuarial and accounting practices in determining income allocation. 22 Recommendation That the submissions accepted in part, by allowing an apportionment basis between the shareholder and policyholder bases which is equitable and reasonable. However, the nexus test for expenditure on the policyholder base must still be maintained. Issue: Deductibility of fees against policyholder base Submission (53 – Ernst & Young, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Proposed sections EY 16 and EY 18 should be amended to state that all fees and charges, including implicit charges included in premiums by life insurers to recover costs relating to the selling of and administration of policies, other than those relating to life and non-life risk, and claims will be allowed as deductions in the policyholder base. Comment In practice, the policyholder base gross expenditure is likely to comprise fees and charges made by the shareholder that are taxable in the shareholder base. Fees and expenses which life insurers charge policyholders relating to the execution and administration of policies are specifically income to the life insurers, but submissions argue it is not clear whether they have a direct nexus to income taxable by policyholders. The intention of the rules is that the deductibility of fees and expenses to policyholders is consistent with their deductibility if the policyholders incurred the fees and expenses directly. Certain expenses relating to life risk cover which the submission argues should be deductible against the policyholder base would not ordinarily be deductible to policyholders if incurred periodically and so should not be deductible in the policyholder base. Therefore, only expenses related to deriving investment income should be deductible in the policyholder base. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 23 Issue: Fees gross-up Submission (52 – Sovereign) The proposed rules create two separate tax bases between which charges are made, with the result that these charges become subject to tax. So that the life insurer maintains the same level of fee income under the new rules as under the existing rules, it will be necessary to gross up the fee by an amount equal to the tax payable on the income. To avoid the compliance costs and administrative issues if all relevant policies were required to allow fees to be grossed up, the proposed legislation should specifically permit insurers to gross up existing fees for the purposes of proposed sections EY 16 and EY 19. Comment Fees are usually determined by way of contract between the life insurer and the policyholder. As a practical matter, most contracts allow changes to their terms in the event of a change in law. It would be outside normal tax policy principles to amend contractual terms. If tax legislation permitted a “gross up” it might imply that such an event was expected or mandatory, which would not necessarily be the case for each life insurer. Each life insurer will respond differently to the impact of the new rules, particularly as existing contracts will be subject to grandparenting. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Reinsurance premiums and claims Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 53 – Ernst & Young, 32 – KPMG) Clarification on the inclusion of the amount of reinsurance claims received (shareholder base gross income) and reinsurance premiums (shareholder base expenditure) is required. Comment Chapter 5 of the discussion document Taxation of the Life insurance business: proposed new rules, suggested that only the risk portion of reinsurance premiums and claims must be included, which is consistent with the “introductory” subparagraphs of proposed sections EY 19 and EY 20. 24 However, officials note that some ambiguity arises because sections EY 19(2)(d) and EY 20(20(d) are silent on whether the full claim or premiums respectively or only the risk portion must be included in the shareholder base gross income and expenditure or loss. Those provisions should be qualified by reference to “the life risk component”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and the legislation be clarified so that only the risk proportion of reinsurance claims paid by the life insurer (reinsurer) and premiums paid to the life insurer (reinsurer) is included in shareholder gross income and expenditure or loss respectively. Issue: Capital guarantee reserves Submissions (10 – New Zealand Society of Actuaries Inc, 33A – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 53 – Ernst & Young, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Where the capital guarantee reserve comprises movements within policyholder funds, no movement should be attributed to the shareholder. In circumstances where the shareholder is required to inject money, section EY 27(4) proposes a reflex adjustment for “capital guarantee reserving amounts” whereby a positive (taxable) in the shareholder base is expenditure or loss for the policyholder base and vice versa for negative amounts. This will apply to both participating and non-participating guaranteed investment contracts. This reflex adjustment should be amended to give capital treatment to the policyholder base. Shareholders who transfer funds to support a capital guarantee in a participating capital guaranteed investment contract should be actuarially determined. (Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc) Comment The approach in the draft legislation is to tax non-participating capital guaranteed investment contracts in a manner consistent with non-participating non-capital guaranteed investment contracts and to tax participating capital guaranteed investment contracts in a manner consistent with non-capital guaranteed contracts. This approach is generally supported by submissions. The capital guarantee reserve (CGR) (or an equalisation or financial smoothing reserve) is a portion of the policyholder return which has been set aside. In times of poor investment performance, the reserve will typically be drawn upon to “top up” the amount credited to policyholders. In times of good investment performance, apportion of the investment return will typically be added to the reserve to support future crediting rates. The proposed legislation provides that movements in the reserve require adjustment for shareholder income or loss. However, there should be 25 no adjustment where there is simply a transfer between different policyholder funds, both of which are subject to tax. Shareholder injections to support the capital guarantee, while rare, should have a revenue character for the shareholder base. Such guarantees, however, when paid by the shareholder may have a capital character for individual policyholders. However, CGRs also include a minimum return (investment guarantee) that is in excess of 0 percent on capital invested, and shareholder payments in respect of these are properly treated as revenue amounts. To be consistent with the capital character of the replenishment of loss to the policyholder capital savings account, the loss that caused the depletion of capital should not be deductible to the policyholder. These rules should apply to both participating as well as non-participating capital guaranteed investment contracts. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part, although officials recommend that payments representing a capital amount guaranteed should be deductible on the shareholder base, but not be taxable at the policyholder base. The loss that caused the depletion of capital is not deductible in the policyholder base. However, payments to maintain a minimum return should have revenue treatment on both bases. Issue: Treatment of tax credits Submission (53 – Ernst & Young) The application of tax credits and calculation of terminal tax between the policyholder and shareholder bases should be clarified. Comment Proposed section LA 8B provides for the apportionment of tax credits between the policyholder and shareholder bases. Proposed sections LA 8B(2), LE 2(1) and LE 2B(1) all provide rules for the treatment of excess tax credits. Officials consider that the rules are clear in their operation and require no further clarification. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 26 RESERVES The proposed new rules tax risk premiums and allow for deduction of risk expenses, including claims. However, the long-term nature of some life insurance contracts means that premiums derived may cover insurance services provided in the future. Therefore, reserves are required for unexpired risks to ensure equitable taxation. The nature of claims expenses also require estimation. Movements in the outstanding claims reserve (which includes estimations of claims incurred but not reported) should be incorporated into the new tax rules to ensure a clear and equitable deduction. The submissions received on reserves have generally not objected to the concept of reserves; rather they have concentrated on technical aspects of the proposed rules. Issue: Premium smoothing reserve Submissions (10 – New Zealand Society of Actuaries Inc, 41 – AXA New Zealand, 53 – Ernst & Young, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) A number of submissions were made on proposed section EY 25, entitled “Premium smoothing reserving amount: non-participation policies not annuities”. While submissions generally did not oppose the underlying policy behind the concept of the premium smoothing reserving (PSR), they made a number of technical submissions on its drafting and mechanics: • Every PSR calculated under subsection (3) has a zero result – for example, using the sub-headings in the definitions in (4) without the brackets. • It is not clear why there is a reference in section EY 23 (5) to “an individual policy of a class,” given the special grouping rule set out in section EY 25. (New Zealand Society of Accountants Inc) • How is the profit margin to be calculated from year to year? • How is new business to be grouped with existing business for the purposes of calculating the profit margin? • The definition of “PSR period” requires clarification. • How should a risk-free rate be determined? Comment The PSR is intended to allow life insurers to elect to allocate premium income that is taxable in the current period, and the portion that is taxable in future periods over different income years for any term insurance policies which: • have a level, or substantially level, premium for more than one year during the PSR period; or 27 • have a material mismatch between the incidence of risk and the premium payable during the PSR period. As the purpose of the PSR is to ensure life insurers are not taxed too soon on their premium income and is elective, the PSR can be seen to be taxpayer-friendly. Unintended tax results occurred because of difficulties in translating actuarial concepts into tax legislative language. The reason for the reference to an individual policy of a class in proposed section EY 23 (5) is to allow for classes of policies (for example, a yearly renewable term) where only some of the polices in the class may have periods of level premiums (for example, yearly renewable term policies where the premium is level for the first five years). Otherwise, officials agree with the submissions on the need for greater certainty around the PSR and have addressed issues raised in the submissions. A draft version of the recommended changes to the legislation has been circulated to the New Zealand Society of Actuaries Inc, and Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Calculation of reserves generally Submission (32 – KPMG) Proposed sections EY 23 to EY 27 should be amended to define a life insurer’s reserves in accordance with its financial reporting treatment. Comment The formulas in proposed sections EY 23 to EY 27 define what constitutes a life insurer’s reserves. In some cases the financial accounting reserves such as the outstanding claims reserve will be the same for both financial accounting and tax purposes. However, differences arise between accounting and tax for acquisition costs (mainly commission and other expenses paid on a person taking out a life insurance policy generally called deferred acquisition costs (DAC)) which are deducted upfront for tax, whereas for accounting purposes these expenses are spread over the life of the policy. This tax treatment of DAC was very important to the industry, but means that for most reserving requirements in the new rules the financial accounting reserves cannot be used. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 28 Issue: Calculation of outstanding claims reserve (OCR) Submission (32 – KPMG, 52 – Sovereign, 33A – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc) Reserving amounts, particularly the OCR, should be calculated on a gross basis using margin on services principles. Items included in the reserving amounts should not be present-valued. Comment An OCR is the provision in the balance sheet of an insurance company for all claims that have been made and for which the insurer is liable, but which had not been settled at the balance sheet date. For financial accounting purposes, the OCR is calculated on, amongst other things, a present value basis. This is consistent with general actuarial and accounting principles. Use of the accounting basis permits an accurate deduction of the true economic cost of the outstanding claim. Otherwise a tax deduction could be made for the face value of the claim, notwithstanding that the actual cash in respect of the claim is not paid out until a subsequent tax year. It is also consistent with other changes contained in the bill relating to the OCR of general insurers. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Opening value of outstanding claims reserve (OCR) Submission (32 – KPMG, 52 – Sovereign) As there are fundamental differences between the current and the new rules, it is important that opening reserves are established so there will be no opportunity for amounts to be double counted or not picked up. The simplest solution would be for opening reserves to be zero. However, this issue needs to be determined by an industry panel of experts. Comment Under the new rules, the opening claim position is an OCR and items within it are effectively excluded for tax. These items should be consistent with the claims that have been brought to account for tax under the old rules. 29 Because claims are often notified late and further time is needed to determine if a claim is valid, the mechanism of calculating the mortality profit for a year varies between life insurers: • some may include estimates of claim amounts they expect to pay; and • others may wait as long as possible before calculating the mortality profit and only include claims definitely settled up to that time. Furthermore, under the current rules, if in the first year of the start of a policy the life insured party dies, no amount of mortality profit is brought to tax. If any such claims are notified in the future and the date of death was during the period of the current rules, any such claim may end up being taxed under the new rules. Officials agree that this is not intended. Consistency between the current and new rules is relatively simple for non- participating businesses. The first opening OCR under the new rules needs to comprise claims which were not settled at the end of the last year under the current rules (including those incurred but not reported) but which were included in the calculation of mortality profit for that final year. No other claims should be included. These claims have effectively been deducted for tax and are excluded from a further deduction via the OCR mechanism. For participating businesses, no claim deductions are allowed under the new rules. Claims therefore cannot be counted twice, although it is recognised that late reported claims will miss out altogether without some adjustments. Recommendation That the submission for a zero opening OCR, or a review by a panel of experts, be declined. However, to ensure a correct opening OCR officials recommend proposed section EY 24(2)(a)(ii) be amended to clarify that the amount of the life insurer’s OCR for the first year in which the new rules apply is the sum of the outstanding life risk component of claims not yet paid. Issue: Outstanding claims reserve (OCR) for non-life policies Submissions (32 – KPMG, 52 – Sovereign, matter raised by officials) Officials consider the movements in the OCR for non-life policies held by life insurers should be treated in a consistent manner as for life insurers holding life insurance policies, and general insurers. KPMG and Sovereign do not agree. 30 Comment The OCR is a reserve of an insurance company to provide for the future liability of claims which have occurred but which have not yet been reported to the insurance company or not yet settled. The new rules propose that life insurers are able to claim a deduction for movements in the OCR on life insurance policies, and also propose to have similar tax treatment to general insurers who sell general insurance policies. One aspect of allowing the deduction is that the future claims (that is, claims recognised in the current accounting period that will be paid out in a future period) are discounted to their present value. Some life insurers hold policies that are not life insurance by definition – for example, disability income protection. These policies are therefore general insurance and not covered under the proposed life insurance rules. However, an unintended lacuna means that such policies do not fall within the general insurance OCR changes. This gap needs to be addressed. KPMG and Sovereign submit that their discounting the OCR to its present value is not consistent with common law concepts. However, officials consider there should be consistency of tax treatment between all life insurance and general insurance policies and so recommend declining KPMG’s and Sovereign’s submissions. Recommendation That the officials’ submission be accepted and the other submissions be declined. Issue: Unearned premium reserve (UPR) Submission (10 – New Zealand Society of Actuaries Inc) The unearned premium reserve should be clarified to confirm that: • the UPR includes the elements of premiums that relate to expenses, tax and profit, and is not restricted to the pure life risk element; and • the use of the UPR is not compulsory for any class of policies. Comment A UPR is a reserve that contains the portion of the premium that has been paid in advance for insurance that has not yet been provided. The new rules provide life insurers with the alternative of using the UPR or the premium smoothing reserve to spread the recognition of premium income. 31 The UPR is generally understood for financial accounting purposes. However, to ensure there is no misunderstanding, the UPR can be defined as the submission suggests in terms of the financial accounting treatment. Given the use of UPR and the PSR is elective under the proposed tax changes, there is no policy reason to be prescriptive in its use. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Transfer of business by non-resident and reinsurance Submissions (Matters raised by officials) Section EY 24(2)(ii), “Outstanding claims reserving amount: non-participation policies not annuities”, section EY 25(2)(ii), “Premium smoothing reserving amount: non-participation policies not annuities”, and section EY 26(2)(ii), “Premium smoothing reserving amount: non-participation policies not annuities” each provide an opening balance adjustment in the current income year where there has been no closing balance returned as income in the previous income year. A number of technical issues arise with these provisions in the context of transferring life insurance business: • The OCR calculated at the time of the transfer has been incurred for tax purposes and should be deductible to the seller, not the new owner. • The UPR or premium smoothing reserve (PSR) calculated at the time of the transfer records the premium income due and receivable that is not subject to tax at the time of the transfer. That portion of the premium should be taxable to the new owner. • When calculating the OCR, PRS or UPR on the date of transfer of a tranche of business reinsurance arrangements that do not qualify as life financial reinsurance, the purchaser’s opening transfer OCR, PRS or UPR should be reduced by the equivalent reinsurance closing transfer capital guarantee reserve used for tax by the seller. If the reinsurance is not assigned to the purchaser, there should be no adjustment. • The reference to closing balance and opening balances for business transfers is inappropriate. These amounts are calculated on the first day and the last day respectively of an income year. When a transfer occurs during an income year for the seller, the closing balance for that tranche of business is zero, and for the purchaser, the opening balance for that tranche of business is zero. The transfer amounts should not be closing or opening balance amounts but instead should be called transfer balances and calculated on the date of transfer. 32 Comment There is a real possibility that the reserve tax values calculated by each party to the transfer could be significantly different. In particular, if the purchaser wishes to make its own reinsurance arrangements and the vendor has a reinsurance arrangement that it cancels or reduces after the sale, the reinsurance balance as at the date of sale should not be deductible to the vendor and neither should it be taxable to the purchaser. The vendor should not be able to claim a deduction for the reinsurance value just because the reinsurance was still in force at the time of the sale. It would be unfair to tax a purchaser on the reinsurance reserve when the benefit of the reinsurance was never acquired. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 33 PARTICIPATING POLICIES A participating policy (also known as a “with-profits policy”) is a policy where the policyholder is entitled to participate in distributions of profit. Conversely, a non- participating policy (also known as a “without-profits policy”) does not enable the policyholder to participate in distributions of profit, examples being term life insurance and most unit-linked policies. Participating policies take the following forms (note they can also be in non-participating forms): • Whole of life insurance – Premiums are level throughout the life of the insured. The policyholder is entitled to bonuses that add to the amount of the benefit and are also received on death or maturity of the policy. The policy guarantees payment of the sum insured, while also providing a share in the life insurer’s profits. The policy can be cashed in or surrendered before maturity, although the time when the policy is cashed in will determine what amounts are received (which are generally at the discretion of the insurer). • Endowment insurance – These have features similar to those of a whole of life policy but the sum insured is payable upon the survival of the insured life to a certain age or date, or upon prior death. As with whole of life policies, there is considerable actuarial involvement as a result of the interplay between the insured’s mortality and investment return. Until the 1980s, the most common products offered by life insurance companies were the traditional whole of life and endowment products. Since then traditional policies have declined, with most life insurers ceasing to write new business several years ago. Nevertheless, the products still comprise a material part of many life insurers’ business. The current rules over tax policyholder savings (for reasons discussed in Chapter 2 of the discussion document, Taxation of the life insurance business: proposed new rules). Taxation of participating profits is a complex area of life insurance tax, with a variety of approaches adopted internationally. One of the key issues with the taxation of participating policies is in accurately allocating the economic returns to shareholders and policyholders. The scheme of the proposed rules contained in the discussion document was changed for the bill to take into account a number of submissions on the discussion document. The proposed rules on participating profits in concept have received support from Asteron. The New Zealand Society of Actuaries Inc, while noting that the rules contained in the bill were different from that contained in the discussion document, also noted that alternatives were being considered between officials and the industry, and so would not comment further. Some submissions offered an alternative model of allocating, (I)nvestment income minus (E)xpenses. Officials consider that the approach submitted by Investment Savings and Life Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc and some life insurers, with some modifications is suitable to be adopted for New Zealand purposes, in addition to incorporating the PIE rules for the policyholder base income. 34 Issue: Allocation of taxable profit Submissions (10 – New Zealand Society of Actuaries Inc) 41 – AXA New Zealand, 33A – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 55 – Asteron) The formula allocating taxable profit between the shareholder and policyholder bases should be amended so that the shareholder proportion is included to contain the present value of shareholder transfers that is part of the Margin on Services (MOS) liabilities. The shareholders’ interest should be defined as the proportion of the participating assets that are represented by: Shareholders’ retained funds + present value of future shareholder transfers These amounts are discernable from life insurers’ financial accounts. Defining r as (shareholder retained funds / total participating funds) and s as (Percent Value of future shareholder transfers / total participating funds) there should be three elements to the taxation of participating business and these should be reflected in the proposed rules: • Tax on the (1 – r) portion of the fund. This should be (1 – r) x (tax rate x (I pie – E)). • Tax on the r portion of the fund. This should be (r x tax rate x (Is – E) + s x tax rate x (Is – I pie)). That is the tax due on the shareholders’ funds plus the additional tax from (Is – I pie) on the shareholders’ interest contained in the policy liability). • The imputation credit account should be credited with (r + s) \* tax rate \* (Is – E) as this is the total tax paid by the shareholders. Comment The proposed formulas contained in the bill aim to allocate taxable profit between the shareholder and the policyholder, with the policyholders’ income being subject to the PIE rules. The proposed legislation attempts to separately identify shareholder and policyholder components via a number of formulas which use a combination of the “gate” (g) and the proportion of the fund that is attributable to the “liabilities proportion” (p). The “liabilities proportion” is intended to represent policy liabilities as applied in a MOS approach. Proposed section EY 17 provides the policyholders’ share of participating business gross income as (1+p x g)/(1+g). Proposed section EY 21 provides the shareholders’ share as (1–p) x g / (1+g). 35 While the principles underlying the proposed formulas are generally accepted by some submissions (and subsequent consultation with stakeholders) as theoretically sound, in practical terms, the formulas may not give the correct allocation because the liabilities proportion does not represent exclusively policyholder interests. In particular, assets backing the liabilities proportion include assets generating future transfers to the shareholders. These assets are exclusively shareholder interests. To the extent that the liabilities proportion includes shareholder interests, the formula will incorrectly allocate participating business income to the account of policyholders. On the other hand, ensuring the taxable profit is taxed in line with the split that actually occurs via the “gate” mechanism will better approximate the shareholders’ portion of profit. Officials accept that: • the calculation of “valuation premiums” (as required in the calculation of “Other Profit” in the draft legislation) would be very difficult in respect of existing business; and • the item of “premiums – premiums estimate” in the draft legislation seeks to identify the quantum of bonus loadings (and the shareholder profit element contained in the bonus loadings). Because most premiums rates were set at the time these products were popular and expense rates were considerably lower than current levels, the levels of bonus loadings are very small or almost non- existent for existing business. Consequently the element of shareholder profit realistically contained in premiums for existing business is very small or non- existent; and • because of the very existence of retained shareholder earnings and present value of future shareholder transfers (see above) in the with-profit fund there will be profits distributed to shareholders in the future, although it is almost impossible to identify how much of those distributions have been taxed in the past as they accrue; and • it is quite possible for shareholder profits to be generated in the future from existing business (for example, by favourable mortality experience of surrender profits). Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. That, for the application for the formulas, both r and s be calculated as the average values of the items at the start and end of the year. That it be noted that it may be necessary to re-visit the allocation of (I-E) on a change in accounting or actuarial standards. 36 Issue: Proposed formula – “other profits” Submission (41 – AXA New Zealand, 55 – Asteron) The inclusion of “other profits” should be removed or, alternatively, should apply only to new products. If “other profits” is included in taxable income for future contracts, the basis for calculating these items of this formula should be consistent with that used for current financial reporting (margin on services (MOS)). Comment The basis for taxation of participating policies is comprised of three main components: I(nvestment income) less E(expenses) Plus O(ther) P(rofit) For participating savings business, I-E is an appropriate basis and is consistent with that used in some other jurisdictions. “Other profits” was included in the bill to protect against potential manipulation of the items in taxable income with respect to future participating contracts. Officials accept that requiring insurers to calculate “other profits” will increase compliance costs in circumstances with existing participating policies, where there is no apparent ability to manipulate I-E. Accordingly, it is appropriate to find a simpler way of identifying and calculating (albeit approximately) “Other Profit” for existing business. A suitable method of calculating “Other Profit” for existing business, and one which officials have been advised is relatively simple to perform under current accounting and actuarial standards is to define “Other Profit” as: “Actual” less “Expected” for all cash flows and end-of-year policy liabilities Where: “Actual” is the actual cash flows and policy liabilities experienced, “Expected” is the expected amounts based on the prior year’s valuation assumptions. This calculation of “Other profit”, while not as rigorous as the calculation of “Other Profit” contained in the bill, is acceptable to officials for existing business – that is, policies sold prior to a date to be determined. Existing business would be defined to include policies taken out after the relevant date as a result of existing conversion rights (such as whole of life policies converting to endowment). 37 This method was discussed with members of the New Zealand Society of Actuaries and Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc and was generally accepted as being fair and workable. However, it may be possible for an insurer to develop products which could circumvent the intentions of the new tax rules. Therefore, the calculation of “Other Profit” contained in the bill will be retained for future business. Officials therefore recommend that life insurers be provided the option of excluding OP for participating policies sold by 30 June 2009 (being close to the likely date when the current bill is reported back). The legislation will allow this alternative treatment to continue for pre-1 July 2009 policies which are converted into other participating policies, such as when whole of life policies are converted to endowment. The legislation should also confirm that premium increases on pre-1 July 2009 participating policies to meet increases in the CPI will not affect the status of the policy. In these circumstances the use of MOS reporting will keep compliance costs down. Recommendation That for the purposes of existing business, “Other Profit” be replaced with an “Actual less “Expected” formula for policies sold before 1 July 2009. That existing business be extended to include new policies arising from conversion rights contained in any policies existing on 30 June 2009. That the draft legislation remains unchanged for new business (other than policies taken out under existing conversion rights). Issue: Gross or net of tax discount rate Submission (Matter raised by officials) Proposed section EY 28(9) defines policy liabilities using the expression “present value”. Present value is defined in section YA 1 and specifies “... discount rate, gross of tax ...” and “... face value, gross of tax ...”. For the purposes of section EY 28(9), the discount rate should be net of tax. A gross of tax is appropriate for the calculations of the premium smoothing reserve (proposed section EY 25); and outstanding claims reserve (proposed section EY 24) but a new definition is needed for proposed section EY 28 and other relevant provisions. 38 Comment Present value concepts should reflect whether the income will be subject to tax. Following discussion with the New Zealand Society of Actuaries Inc, officials agree: • the current definition of “present value” be renamed “present value (gross)” and also be amended by removing the words “gross of tax, “after the words “face value”; • a new definition be inserted “present value (net)” which is the same as “present value (gross)” except that “”gross”: is replaced with “net”; • in proposed sections EY 24 and EY 25, all references to “present value” be replaced with “present value (gross)”; • in proposed sections EY 28, all references to “present value” be replaced with “present value (net)”; and • in proposed sections EZ 56 and EZ 58, all references to “present value” be replaced with “present value (net)”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and the bill be amended as described above. Issue: Shareholder-base gross income – profit participation policies Submission (33A – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc) Proposed section EY 21 should be clarified to ensure that it does not require life insurers to treat the capital gains exclusion applied within wholesale PIE funds in which shareholder assets are invested, to be reversed in the calculation of shareholder tax. Comment Proposed section EY 21 defines how shareholder gross income from participating business is to be determined. Paragraph (a) of the formula in that section specifies that section CX 55 should be “ignored” so that gains from the disposal of directly held qualifying New Zealand and listed Australian equities should be included in that calculation. Submissions argue that it is not clear whether the instruction to ignore section CX 55 should be restricted to relevant equities held directly by the life insurer or be extended to include relevant equities held through a PIE. All shareholders in all New Zealand companies are able to take advantage of the exclusion from taxable income specified in section CX 55 by investing through a PIE. It would therefore be inequitable for a life insurer to be required to take these gains into consideration in the calculation of the profit from participating business. 39 Therefore, we agree that the legislation needs to make it clearer that this is not the intent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Claims estimates Submission (41 – AXA New Zealand) Surrenders should be included in claims estimates. Comment For the calculation of “other profits” in proposed section EY 28(5) surrender profits (or losses) arise when the surrender value paid is less than (or greater than) the policy reserve. As surrenders are already included in claim items, they are technically not required to be included in claims estimates. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Shareholder transfers Submission (2 – Murray Hilder, 41 – AXA New Zealand, 55 – Asteron) Shareholder transfers to assets supporting participating policies should be deductible in the shareholder base. Comment Although the circumstances are considered to be rare it is possible, when market values of assets supporting participating policies dramatically drop, the shareholder will have to make a transfer back to the fund to maintain its solvency. These injections should be deductible to the shareholder as they are part of the life insurance business and relate to the income earning process. Conversely, any transfers to the shareholder should be taxable in the shareholder base. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Transfers back to the shareholder should be taxable in the shareholder base. 40 REINSURANCE Reinsurance allows the insurance industry to spread its losses among more companies, lessening the impact of claims on any one company. The life insurer (the reinsured) reduces its possible exposure on either an individual life insurance policy (facultative arrangement) or a large number of life insurance policies (treaty) by giving (ceding) a portion of its liability to another insurance company (the reinsurer). Any reinsurance arrangement the life insurer makes does not affect the insurance policies that it writes for its policyholders and is still liable to pay its policyholders for insured losses regardless of the reinsurance coverage. The policyholder will most likely not even be aware that his or her coverage has been reinsured. The current and proposed rules treat reinsurance as life insurance by definition. Under the proposed rules a deduction is available to the reinsured for life risk for premiums paid, and life risk claims are taxable on reinsurance arrangements offered or entered into in New Zealand. The proposed new rules also contain an anti- avoidance provision to counter tax advantages for financial reinsurance – that is, financing arrangements more similar to financial arrangements than to financial reinsurance. Issue: Definitions Submissions (32 – KPMG, 56 – Swiss Re, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, matter raised by officials) A definition of “policy” should be inserted into the proposed rules and should apply to “reinsurance” as follows: 1. For transitional rules a “policy” refers to a reinsurance arrangement (whereby no looking through is required). (KPMG, Swiss Re, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) 2. For ongoing life insurance business (outside of the transitional rules), a “policy” should be apportioned in a manner similar that effectively relates to its different life insurance components. (KPMG, Swiss Re, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) 3. General insurance needs to be specifically excluded from the definition of “life reinsurance”. (Matter raised by officials) 4. Definitions are required for “life reinsurance premiums” and “life reinsurance claims”. (Matter raised by officials) 41 Comment All of the submissions under this heading raise related issues regarding the incorporation of reinsurance into the proposed life insurance rules. The intention of the rules is that the shareholder is taxed on life risk premiums with allowance for life risk reinsurance premiums and life reinsurance claims. Reinsurance is by definition life insurance. Section EY 12 provides a definition for “life reinsurance” which assumes the only purpose of life reinsurance is to secure against risk, including financial. This definition is so wide that general insurance cover undertaken by a life reinsurer would also fit this definition. This is contrary to the policy intent of the proposed rules which are aimed at the taxation of life insurers. To ensure there is no ambiguity contained in the bill, officials agree general insurance needs to be specifically excluded from the definition as generally insurance reinsurance is subject to its own specific rules. Proposed sections EY 19 and EY 20 make it clear that only the life risk portion of premiums and claims are included, but allow for the inclusion of “life reinsurance claims” and “life reinsurance premiums”. These two items are not defined anywhere and should be. They should be defined so that it is clear that “life reinsurance premiums” means the life risk portion of reinsurance premiums and “life reinsurance claims” means the life risk portion of reinsurance claims. The transitional provisions refer to life insurance “policies”. The use of the term “policies” does not fit with the business of reinsurance as technically, reinsurers do not offer “policies” but rather enter into reinsurance contracts or treaties directly with life insurers. From the reinsurer’s perspective the intention of the grandparenting rules apply to reinsurance as follows: • Reinsurance treaties should be subject to the five-year grandparenting period but only to the extent they do not cover the reinsurance of any savings part of savings policies. • Where the reinsurance treaty comprises level term policies, the reinsurer can elect to look through the treaty on a policy-by-policy basis. • Reinsurance of savings policies are not subject to the grandparenting rules. Therefore, for transition purposes, the terms applying to the individual reinsured policy, as set out in the treaty, should determine the extent of transition rules applying for that policy. On an ongoing basis, the reinsurer should be able to elect to look through to the underlying components of the treaty, as it may wish to look through for PSR purposes. It should not be a compulsory requirement, as to do so would place an unreasonable burden on reinsurers and it is not likely that there will be a great disparity between the reinsurer’s taxable income and accounting profit. Therefore, the submission is partly accepted. 42 Investor income that arises from savings policies reinsured should be taxed under the financial arrangement rules. In the reinsurer’s case, this should be included in policyholder base income. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part, with an election for a reinsurer to look through the treaty to the underlying policies. That appropriate changes be made to give effect to the policy intent discussed. Issue: Transition – looking through the treaty Submission (56 – Swiss Re) The rules should be clarified so that grandparenting should be available at the election of the reinsurer by treaty, for reinsurance treaties entered into before the application date for the greater of the duration of the treaty or five income years. Comment As discussed earlier, reinsurance often groups numbers of individually reinsured policies under one treaty. The transition rules should apply as if the individual policy was reinsured as a single reinsurance arrangement, even though it may be grouped with others under a treaty. Reinsurers who are able to identify the underlying policies can incur the additional compliance costs should they wish and look through the reinsurance treaty to the underlying policies. That is, the terms applying to the individual reinsured policy, as set out in the treaty, should determine the extent of transition rules applying for that policy. Recommendation That the submission be declined. The grandparenting rules in section EY 29 will be clarified to apply to the individual reinsured policy, as discussed earlier. Issue: Reinsurance transition – treaties Submission (52 – Sovereign) The proposed legislation should be amended to clarify that reinsurance agreements entered into before the application date of the proposed legislation are not subject to the new rules. 43 Comment Reinsurance involves spreading life insurance risk between other life insurers. Although, as discussed earlier, there are definitional ambiguities which we recommend be clarified, there is no policy reason to treat a reinsurance treaty any differently from the life insurance policies which it reinsures. The transitional rules contained in proposed section EY 29 therefore properly reflect the intention that reinsurance agreements are subject to the grandparenting rules, which, with appropriate qualifications discussed earlier, are consistent with the rules applying to life insurance policies. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: All reinsurance premiums and claims should be respectively taxable and deductible Submissions (32 – KPMG, 53 – Ernst & Young, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) All life reinsurance policy claims should be assessable income and all life reinsurance policy premiums should be tax deductible. Accordingly, proposed section DR 2 and the corresponding life reinsurance claims provision should not be passed into legislation. If this submission is not accepted, the proposed life insurance rules require amendments to ensure that a portion of reinsurance premiums derived by offshore reinsurers are subject to New Zealand tax, by way of a withholding tax. In this situation, all life reinsurance policy claims and premiums must still remain assessable and deductible. Comment Proposed section DR 2(3), which disallows a deduction for certain reinsurance premiums and the corresponding life reinsurance claims provision which relate to contracts offered and entered into outside New Zealand, essentially tax New Zealand- sourced life insurance (and reinsurance) on a portion of the profits derived by offshore reinsurance companies. However, submissions argue that offshore reinsurance companies are also subject to tax on the same income in their home country. Proposed section EY 12, including recommended changes, will provide that life reinsurance premiums will be deductible and reinsurance claims will be taxable to life insurers only when the relevant reinsurance policies are offered or entered into in New Zealand. 44 The submissions argue that reinsurance premiums are a normal cost incurred by a life insurer in carrying on its business of insurance and should be deductible on that basis, irrespective of whether the reinsurer is onshore or offshore. Officials consider the reference to policies “offered or entered into in New Zealand” relates to the current rules, under which non-resident life insurers and life reinsurers are taxable in New Zealand on life insurance policies offered or entered into in New Zealand under sections EY 48 and YD 4(17). The submissions argue that this will not result in the under-taxation of life insurance profits in New Zealand, where life insurance business is reinsured offshore, for the following reasons: • If the cross-border transaction takes place within the same group of companies, New Zealand (and offshore) transfer pricing rules will ensure that an appropriate profit margin is left in the New Zealand reinsurance company and will therefore be subject to New Zealand income tax. • If the cross-border transaction occurs between unrelated parties, commercial forces will work to ensure that the transaction occurs at market value and the New Zealand reinsurance company earns an appropriate profit margin which will be subject to New Zealand income tax. Officials are not convinced by these arguments. Most reinsurance companies which transact with New Zealand life insurers operate from outside of New Zealand. In addition, most life insurers operating in New Zealand are parts of internationally headquartered branches of multinational companies. If full tax treatment of reinsurance contracts is entered into or offered outside of New Zealand, there could be the possibility that a life insurer’s business was fully reinsured offshore, with no means (other than withholding tax, which is discussed later) to ensure a level of New Zealand taxation. The application of current transfer pricing rules in this situation is unclear, and would therefore require significant work to ensure sufficient base maintenance. The New Zealand reinsurer will be taxable on its reinsurance premiums less claims. In this situation, it is no different from the life insurer. How the foreign reinsurer is taxed, including on its foreign income, should not determine New Zealand tax policy. The submissions’ second suggestion, if the primary one is declined, is that the proposed life insurance rules be amended so that all life reinsurance policy claims and premiums are assessable and deductible but an “as agent” regime is overlayed to ensure that a portion of reinsurance premiums derived by offshore reinsurers is subject to New Zealand tax applying a specific withholding tax. However, withholding taxes are arbitrary in determining taxable profits, costly to administer, and create complexities when dealing with double tax treaties. A withholding tax system is therefore outside the scope of the current life insurance tax reform. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 45 Issue: Alternative tax treatment of reinsurers Submission (32 – KPMG) The proposed treatment of reinsurers (as opposed to life reinsurance contracts) should be as follows: • Life reinsurance premiums and claims will be netted off against premiums and claims in the shareholder income calculation. • Life financial reinsurance will be taxed under the financial arrangement rules (with no deduction for premiums). Legislative confirmation is required to make it clear the FIF rules will not apply to life financial reinsurance (that is, financial reinsurance should not be an interest in a foreign life insurance policy, for the purposes of the FIF rules). • The new rules will not apply to “existing” reinsurance contracts for a period of the later of five years or the duration of the contract. Comment The submission argues that the rules in relation to life reinsurance should be confined to “true” reinsurance (effectively defined as policies that transfer underwriting risk only and where there is a business purpose for the transfer of such risk). If this definition is not met, the contract would be treated as a financial arrangement. Officials do not see any major difference between this proposal and the proposed rules, and to create a special scheme as suggested would unnecessarily add to the complexity of the legislation. We are not aware of any case law ruling or generally accepted interpretation that financial reinsurance constitutes a foreign investment fund, and so it would be superfluous to clarify in legislation that it is not. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Consistency of life reinsurance premiums and claims Submission (32 – KPMG, 52 – Sovereign, 56 – Swiss Re) An equivalent provision to proposed section DR 2(3) (which disallows a deduction for certain life reinsurance premiums) should be included in proposed section CR 2 to ensure that life reinsurance claims received by a life insurer are not assessable income where the premium has been treated as non-deductible. 46 Comment Proposed section DR 2(3) states that a life insurer is denied a deduction for life reinsurance policy premiums if the policy was offered or entered into outside New Zealand. However, there is no corresponding section included in any of the income provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 or the bill, which states that life reinsurance claims received by a life insurer in relation to policies offered and entered into outside New Zealand are not assessable income. This is not an intended policy result and is the result of a drafting error. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 47 TRANSITION The transition rules recognise that moving from one taxing regime for life insurance products to another affects the pricing of products, and requires new systems and processes. The proposed transition rules cover grandparenting of existing term insurance policies, deemed realisation of policyholder investments before entering the portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules, and the treatment of tax balances (losses, imputation credits, and tax paid) carried into the new rules. Submissions, including those from KPMG, AXA New Zealand and Sovereign, expressly supported the policy underlying the transition rules. Other submissions related to PIE implications of entry in the new rules, extending the period of grandparenting, seeking grandparenting for specific types of policies, clarifying some aspects of the legislation, and miscellaneous technical matters. Issue: Deemed sale on entry to new rules Submission (33A – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 41 – AXA New Zealand, 52 – Sovereign, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The requirement to deem a disposal at market value in proposed section EZ 61 should not apply to assets where a gain would not normally be recognised or where it would be inappropriate, such as foreign shares, interests in PIEs and shares in subsidiaries. Comment Proposed section EY 61 provides that a life insurer is deemed to dispose of its assets that support the policyholder income formula on the last day of its income year under the current life insurance tax rules, for market value and immediately reacquire the assets for the same market value. The reason for this adjustment is to align the cost base of assets used in calculating the life office base income with that used to calculate the policyholder base income as policyholder base income has its assets marked-to-market each year in its tax calculation. This is to ensure that double- taxation does not occur under the new rules from recognising gains from historical cost basis when the assets had already been marked-to-market under the current policyholder income calculations. However, officials agree that it would be unusual for a life insurer to dispose of an interest in a PIE which would trigger taxable income when in other situations a PIE interest could be redeemed without triggering a tax liability. We therefore agree that the deemed disposal should not apply to an interest in a PIE. This should not apply to a PIE that is a portfolio-listed company as there is generally no way to transfer these shares without recognising taxable income. 48 Because disposals of foreign shares generally do not trigger a tax liability under the fair dividend rate (FDR) rules, officials note that the deemed disposal should be of no consequence. The deemed disposal does not mandate realisation for tax purposes, and the general provision in the FDR rules that a disposal is ignored for the tax calculation still applies. The deemed disposal is meant to apply only to investment assets held by the life insurer, so there should be no deemed disposal of a subsidiary unless the subsidiary is a vehicle for holding investments. This limited application is meant to be covered by requiring that there be a deemed disposal only of assets supporting the policyholder income formula. Therefore no change to the bill is required with respect to the sale of shares in subsidiaries of the life insurer. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part, by specifying that the deemed disposal on entry will not apply to interests in PIEs, other than portfolio-listed companies. Issue: The tax on the gain from the deemed sale on transition should be paid over three years Submission (52 – Sovereign, 53 – Ernst & Young, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The tax on the gain arising from the deemed disposal on entry into the new rules should be paid over three years. This was done for entry into the PIE rules and is meant to mitigate the cost arising from a large disposal which was not actually realised. Comment The transition rule for the PIE rules provided that all assets held by managed funds which elected to become a PIE were deemed to be sold at market value immediately before entering into the PIE rules. The resulting tax could be paid over the next three years to mitigate tax-flow concerns arising from a large deemed tax disposal which was not actually realised. Current rules effectively bring to tax (in the policyholder income calculation) realised and unrealised movements in investment assets which are used in the life insurance business. However, the impact on life insurers is likely to be appreciably less than it is for managed funds when they entered the PIE rules in 2007. This is because as discussed earlier, there will be two large categories of investment assets not taxed on realisation under current rules when they were before – PIE interests and foreign shares subject to the FDR rules. Hence the need for relief is much smaller. 49 Further, taxpayer experience has shown that the three-year payment rule in the PIE transition has been very difficult to comply with as it requires identifying the amount of tax attributable to a particular transaction and overriding usual provisional tax and use-of-money interest rules. Given the lower magnitude of tax at stake on transition into the new life insurance tax rules, officials do not recommend a three-year payment provision. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Tax balances carried into the new rules Submission (Matter raised by officials) Any overpayment of income tax under the current rules by a life insurer on the life office base, whether or not there is an imputation credit account balance of the same amount, should be carried into the new rules and be used to satisfy both shareholder- base and policyholder-base tax liabilities. An imputation credit will not be generated when applying the overpayment against any tax liability. Comment The initial intention of the new rules was that overpayments of tax by a life insurer on the life office base could be carried into the new rules to be used to satisfy shareholder base liabilities. These tax balances arise by overpayments of income tax on the current life office base, including those made to satisfy policyholder base liabilities (in which case, there would not be a sufficient imputation credit account balance to obtain a refund of the overpayment). However, as the shareholder base plus policyholder base is basically the continuation of I(nvestment income)-E(penses)+ U(nderwriting profit), which in very broad terms are constituents of the current life office base, it is equitable that any past tax overpayments can be used to satisfy liabilities arising from both the new bases. No imputation credits should be generated by the satisfaction of the tax liabilities, as there is no new payment of tax. Nor will any imputation debits arise in the policyholder base when the tax liability is satisfied. This recommended change is seen as being taxpayer-friendly. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 50 Issue: Allowances for increases to cover Submission (52 – Sovereign, 53 Ernst & Young, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Proposed section EY 29(1)(b) provides that the grandparenting provisions will not be affected if the amount of the insurance cover in post-application date years does not increase by more than the greater of 10 percent of the previous year’s insurance cover or a percentage change in the CPI index for the previous year. The provision should be clarified in respect of the following: • date(s) on which the actual measurement must be done; • date on which the previous year’s cover must be determined, and the effect of previous year’s increases or decreases in the cover; and • the position if the insurance cover, for a period in the income year, does not exceed the prescribed limits. Comment The purpose behind proposed section EY 29 is to ensure that only existing policies contracted under the current tax rules are subject to grandparenting. Life insurance contracts that have materially changed in nature, such as with increased levels of cover, are in substance new contracts, and so should not enjoy the benefits of the current rules over the grandparenting period. However, officials do recognise that many policies have a built-in increasing cover provision, generally to recognise the impact of increases in the CPI. For example: • An individual policy might be increased at any time (unconnected with any anniversary). • There may be no annual anniversary (some policies may have reviews which are not yearly). • New lives may be added to a policy at any time not connected with anniversary. • Group policies pose special problems because they may not have anniversaries as such; they may add new lives at any time and the amounts of cover may vary all the time. The transition rules should have flexibility when allowing life insurers to measure changes in the level of cover, depending on their own procedures. However, to prevent possible manipulation of increase in cover by using different review dates between income years, the life insurer should make a one-off election to determine the review date. The election should be made in the first year of the application of the grandparenting rules for each class of policy. 51 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. The test for changes to policies, whether individual or multi-life and group policies should be subject to a one-off election by the life insurer in the first income year of the application of the grandparenting rules on either the anniversary review date of the policy, or annually, for each class of policy. Issue: Meaning of “first entered into” Submission (10 – New Zealand Society of Actuaries Inc, 52 – Sovereign, 53 Ernst & Young, 55 – Asteron, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Proposed section EY 29 (1) refers to policies “first entered into before 1 April 2009”. The discussion document (page 6, para 1.10) refers to “policies taken out” and “product sold”. The commentary on the bill does not clarify the matter either and refers to “policies sold”. Comment The purpose of the provision is to isolate which policies have been sold before being subject to the proposed rules and which are therefore eligible for grandparenting. There is sometimes a lengthy process of the proposal for and issuing of an insurance contract. Often an insurer will cover the person for death by accident while the underwriting process is taking place. As a large number of policy applications are not accepted by the life insurer, to reduce compliance costs life insurers should be able to elect either that the grandparenting rules apply to a product “issued” (that is, the life insurer accepts the risk on the life of the individual) or when an application for cover is made and a deposit received in respect of that cover from an individual, if either is made before the application date. Note that if an application is made and deposit received and the policy is not accepted it would not be subject to grandparenting in any case. Recommendation That section EY 29(1) replace at the option of the life insurer, either when the policy is “issued by the life insurer” or “when the policy is applied for and a deposit is received in respect of the application”. 52 Issue: Grandparenting provision – risk portion Submission (53 Ernst & Young, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Proposed section EY 29(1) applies to life insurance policies (entered into before 1 April 2009) “for which the life insurer has no policyholder gross income or expenditure or loss”. This provides limited relief from the proposed rules for policies sold before the application date that include not only a life risk component but also a savings element. Comment The policy intent of grandparenting rules is to maintain the concessionary tax treatment for a certain period in circumstances where policyholders purchased products that were structured on the basis of the prevailing tax rules. However, savings products are not, in officials’ view, subject to concessionary tax treatment. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Negative amounts Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Proposed section EY 29(4) appears to conflict with subsection (6) because subsection (4) provides for an adjustment that is calculated for a class of policies, while subsection (6) implies that the calculation (referred to in subsection (4)) must be done on an individual policy basis. Comment Section EY 29 details the grandparenting rules for products acquired before the application date. Subsection (4) calculates the exclusion adjustment based on certain classes of policies while subsection (6) (which ignores negative amounts arising from the application of the adjustment formula) applies on a policy by policy basis. The intent of the legislation is that there should be no negative amounts applying to individual policies (which could otherwise be subsumed with positive amounts from other policies if included in a class).There is therefore no conflict between the two subsections. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 53 Issue: Full grandparenting of all risk policies Submissions (10 – New Zealand Society of Actuaries Inc, 33A – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 52 – Sovereign, 55 – Asteron) Proposed section EY 29 provides for five years’ grandparenting of risk policies that are not single, level, or guaranteed premium policies. A number of submissions were made for full grandparenting for all risk policies, based on the following arguments: • There is little practical difference between an annual renewable term (ART), also known as a yearly renewable term, or rate for age, policies, and a level premium or guaranteed premium products. All products are priced off the same mortality tables and the same assumptions are made with respect to the expected duration that the cover will be maintained. • Life insurers will be incentivised to write level premiums or guaranteed products, or to transfer existing ART policyholders to level terms. This amounts to an artificial preference based on tax treatment. • After the five-year period there will be price increases which will affect the affordability of premiums. • ART policies are long-term arrangements. • Full grandparenting will allow existing policyholders to maintain a level of premiums that was anticipated at the time the policy was taken out. • The five-year period is arbitrary and reference to international precedents of life-tax regime change (for example, that of Australia) is not relevant to New Zealand. Alternatively, if the proposed rules are not changed, the five-year minimum period should be extended to the average period that a life policy is held. In its written submission, Sovereign says this is 10 years, but in its oral presentation to the Committee on 19 March, it said that this was 7 years. Comment As with any major industry reforms, the new life rules are intended to apply immediately unless there are reasons, including that of fairness, to delay their effect. For example, existing arrangements may be grandparented and excluded from the scope of the new rules for a particular time. Officials consider such reasons apply in the case of single premium policies and level-term policies because policyholders had acquired policies on a price-certain basis, and this price had been determined by the life insurer based on the prevailing tax rules. Although there may be a legal ability for life insurers to ask for price increases on level term and similar policies, officials accept that for commercial reasons it is unlikely life insurers would request existing policyholders to pay extra premiums. In fairness to life insurers and policyholders, such policies are grandparented for the period of the policy or while there is a level term. 54 These circumstances are not the same with ART policies. The annual premiums on these policies are affected by a number of factors other than simply the mortality tables. These include tax changes. As ART premium prices may be immediately affected by non-tax factors, it could be questioned why tax should be treated in isolation. However, as a matter of fairness, officials accept that the proposed change should not immediately affect premium prices and therefore policyholder expectations resulting from tax changes. Officials consider five years is a sufficient transition period for ART policies. The need for tax reform has been discussed with the industry since mid-2006, and the broad changes to the rules have been in the public domain since February 2007. Given the likely enactment date of the legislation and our recommended application date for the new life rules, the period between enactment and the end of the five-year period will be very close to six years. This is not dissimilar to Sovereign’s industry’s calculation of the average life of a policy of seven years. With regard to specific arguments raised in submissions: • Policyholders choose between ART and level term policies based on their individual circumstances (such as age, family responsibilities, and financial commitments) and preferences. ARTs have lower premiums than a level term policy bought for the same level of cover at an equivalent time, and increase with age. Level term policies are higher than ART initially but at some point in time will be lower than the equivalent ART. The different types of policies are therefore not directly comparable. • Policyholders will have to determine whether they should convert an existing ART for a level term before application, taking into account matters listed earlier. • Officials have addressed the issue of affordability of premiums earlier. • Given ART premiums could change for any number of reasons, it is unlikely that policyholders have specific price expectations beyond a short period. In any case, given the average duration of holding a policy, it appears that the vast majority of policies contracted for before the enactment of the new rules will have terminated in any case. • Consistency with similar jurisdictions is a relevant consideration. It should also be noted as part of the most recent Australian life insurance tax reform, in respect of the taxation of management fees (one of the major changes), 50 percent of the fees were taxable under the new rules during the period. The full grandparenting under the proposed rules is concessionary in comparison. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 55 Issue: Group life policies Submissions (52 – Sovereign, 53 – Ernst & Young, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Proposed section EY 29 should be amended by including group life policies in force on the application date for a minimum of five years, regardless of whether employees join or leave and without regard to the 10 percent cap on increases in cover. Where rates are guaranteed before and/or during the grandparenting period, the policy should be grandparented for the life of the guarantee. Comment Group life comprises two broad categories – compulsory and voluntary. Voluntary business is broadly similar to individual policies in that employees may elect to take out cover and enter into a separate policy. The issue here is with compulsory business cover which is sold to employers via one master policy and the employer pays one premium in respect of all employees. Life insurers typically guarantee the underlying rate table for any employer scheme, and the rates vary by age and sex. Each underlying rate table is based on the mix of employee occupation classes at the time the policy is issued. The initial premium is set on the basis of who is employed at the time, using the underlying rate table agreed with the employer, and is typically guaranteed for a period. Despite any rate guarantee, the master policy’s premium changes every year to reflect: • the employees that have joined or left the employer’s company; • changes to the ages of those still employed; and • changes to the sums assured of those employed, which are usually based on a multiple of their salary. The nature of compulsory group life business gives rise to a number of unique considerations in relation to the application of the grandparenting rules, including the following: • Employees may join and leave a group compulsory scheme throughout the term of the policy. In these circumstances officials consider it appropriate if the relevant policy (being the master policy) is entered into before the application date. • When rates are guaranteed for a group compulsory scheme, the underlying rate table that the scheme will use in the future is guaranteed, but the insurer has no knowledge of who will be covered as a risk in the future, given the fact that employees come and go. As a result, the premiums could go up or down each year. In our view, the rates guarantee in existence at application date should be considered as being guaranteed for the purposes of the transition rules. 56 • Group compulsory schemes have only one master policy, and the total sum assured of the master policy is spread across a number of employees. If the number of employees increases in any year so that the total sum assured increases by more than 10 percent, then the 10 percent cap would be breached. Officials, consider that it is inappropriate for grandparenting to be lost in this situation. • The 10 percent cap could also be breached if employees are provided salary increases of more than 10 percent in any one year (because the sum assured is linked to salary). This does not represent any change in the amount of cover agreed at the inception of the policy – cover continues to be set at the same multiple of salary. Officials consider that breaches of the 10 percent cap as a result of increased salaries only should not result in the loss of grandparenting. • Schemes may be re-rated (that is go onto a new underlying rate table) within the five-year grandparenting period, thereby extending the guarantee beyond the five-year grandparenting period. Significant practical difficulties in terms of rating will arise if insurers are required to provide separate underlying rate tables for the periods before and after grandparenting applies. The most practical solution would be to extend grandparenting until the expiry of the five- year period of the group life policy provided the original guarantee was made prior to the application date of the proposed life tax rules. Proposed section EY 29(4) provides an adjustment from the shareholder base for the grandparented amount of the relevant class of policies using the formula: premium – total reserving amounts – (1.2 x expected death strain) “Death strain” is defined in terms of existing lives on the final day of each tax year. New group business does not contribute to the death strain as defined, as the new lives covered do not exist on the first day. But, under the proposed rules every death claim which relates to the new life will produce a loss to the extent of the amount of the claim, but with no associated income. Therefore, to include group policies as proposed will require an amendment to the adjustment formula to account for the new lives subject to grandparenting. The easiest way to achieve this is by excluding from “claim” the relevant grandparented claim arising from new lives. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted for employer-sponsored group life policies only, and that the guarantee period apply only to rates that are guaranteed at the time of application of the proposed life tax rules for a maximum of five years from the application date. Existing lives only can be covered under the grandparenting rules provided increases in individual cover are only for increases in salary or wages of the insured employees on terms applying on or before the application date of the proposed rules. The adjustment formula contained in proposed section EY 29(4), should be amended to exclude grandparented claims on new lives on employer group policies. 57 Issue: Master policies including credit card repayment insurance Submissions (10 – New Zealand Society of Actuaries, 52 – Sovereign) Master policies (other than group life schemes) with either a fixed level of cover per customer or a variable sum insured should not be subject to the 10 percent increase in cover rule contained in proposed section EY 29(1)(b)(i). (New Zealand Society of Actuaries) Fluctuations in insurance cover under credit card repayment insurance (CCRI) should be disregarded for the purposes of proposed section EY 29(1)(b)(i). (Sovereign) Comment Section EY 29(1)(b) provides that the transitional provisions contained in section EY 29 will apply to policies existing before the application date of the legislation if: “the amount of insurance cover does not increase for the relevant income year by more than the greater of– (i) 10% of the previous year’s insurance cover; and (ii) the percentage change in the consumer price index for the previous income year.” A “master policy” is a single contract coverage on a group basis issued to an employer (in the case of group life) or to another entity. Individual policyholders, however, are covered by the terms of the insurance. CCRI is provided by way of master policy and provides cover for the amount of credit card debt outstanding at the time a credit card statement is issued. The premium is also determined at that date. The amount of cover provided by a CCRI policy fluctuates on a regular basis and, from month to month, the amount of cover can increase by substantial amounts on a percentage basis. It is likely that many CCRI policies that would otherwise be subject to the transitional provisions would breach the 10 percent cover increase requirement. A further complication is that credit card providers may offer credit limit increases to cardholders that could result in insurance cover increases of over 10 percent. The insurer has no control over these credit limit increases. Master policies have similar considerations to employer-sponsored group life policies discussed earlier. Where the rates of cover are guaranteed at the application date of the proposed rules, and the terms of the master policy are unchanged from those applying at the application date, the master policy should be treated consistently with employer sponsored group life products. The maximum grandparenting period should be five years from the application date. Given the nature of CCRI policies and similar master policies, officials therefore consider that it is inappropriate to apply the 10 percent cover increase requirement to these policies. 58 Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, with the grandparenting period only applying to rates that are guaranteed only on the terms of the master policy at the time of the application of the proposed rules. The maximum grandparenting period will be five years from the application date. Issue: Meaning of “cannot be changed” and “guarantee” Submission (32 – KPMG, 33 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 41 – AXA New Zealand, 55 – Asteron) The requirement in proposed section EY 29(2) that the rate of premium for a level term insurance policy “cannot be changed” needs to be removed or clarified by applying to a policy for which the rate of premium is always the same amount. Comment Proposed section EY 29(1)(b) provides that the transitional provisions contained in section EY 29 will apply to a policy exceeding five years where the premium cannot be changed or during any period of guarantee. Level term policies do not always strictly guarantee premiums and may, in some instances, allow the premium to be changed at the insurer’s discretion. Generally, however, life insurers take into account commercial constraints to raising premiums and so do not intend to change the premium. Officials consider the policy intent of this provision can be achieved where premium prices are in fact not changed. Provided the rate of premium on the level term policies remained the same and subject to the other considerations included in the rules, officials agree that this transitional provision should continue to apply. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, provided the rate of premium does not in fact change. 59 Issue: Split policies Submission (52 – Sovereign) New policies entered into for the purposes of a division of relationship property should be treated as having been entered into on the same date as the original policy for the purposes of proposed section EY 29. Policies split for other purposes should also be treated as having been entered into on the same date as the original policy where the cover provided remains the same. Comment It is not uncommon for two (or more) lives to be assured under one policy – as happens, for example, when spouses are covered by a policy. In the event of a division of relationship property (for example, on dissolution of marriage), Sovereign advises that it “splits” the policy so that separate policies continue for each life assured. The terms of the “split” policies otherwise remain the same as the original policy. Policies may also be split in other circumstances. For example, where there is a desire for life cover provided in respect of a policyholder’s children to be split into a separate policy. As the bill is currently drafted, one of the “split” policies will constitute a new policy. Where the split occurs after the application date of the legislation, the transitional provisions would then not apply to that policy despite the fact that the original policy would continue to enjoy the benefit of the transitional provisions (assuming it was entered into before the application date). Officials consider the “split” arises from the actions of the policyholder. While the terms of the new policy may be similar to the original, it is a new contract and should therefore not enjoy transitional relief. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Reinstated policies Submission (52 – Sovereign) To the extent a reinstated policy would give rise to a new contract, the transitional rules should continue to apply if the policy was originally entered into before the application date of the bill despite the fact it lapses and is reinstated after that date. 60 Comment It is not uncommon for policies to lapse or be cancelled as a result of policyholders missing premium instalments. Sovereign advises its practice is to revive/reinstate lapsed policies within a minimal period after lapse (typically up to 90 days) if the unpaid premium is met. Its analysis indicates that approximately 4,000 policies are reinstated by Sovereign annually. Of those, approximately 2,400 policies are reinstated within 30 days of lapsing. As currently drafted, the transitional provisions may not apply to these policies if taken out before the application date despite the fact they are reinstated on the same terms and are treated by Sovereign as never having come to an end. If the transitional provisions did not apply to reinstated policies, reinstatement could be offered only on the basis of adjusted premiums reflecting the new tax rules. Officials consider that it is appropriate in these circumstances to treat policies that are entered into before the application date of the bill but reinstated after that date to continue to be subject to the transitional rules, subject to certain limitations. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, provided that the reinstatements are made within 90 days of lapsing and that the insurer does not treat the reinstated policy as a new policy. Issue: Application of transitional provisions where cover increases by more than 10 percent Submission (52 – Sovereign, 41 – AXA New Zealand, 33A – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc) Increases in cover pursuant to “special events” and “future insurability” options should be disregarded for the purposes of proposed section EY 29(1)(b). Comment The submissions advise that a number of policies issued by life insurers provide the policyholder with the option to increase insurance cover under the policy on the happening of a “special event” (for example, the birth of a child). In addition, in some cases the policy will provide a “future insurability” option that permits cover to be increased without further underwriting. If cover increases on exercise of these options by more than 10 percent (or CPI if greater), section EY 29(1)(b) will not be satisfied and the policy will cease to be subject to the transitional rules. 61 The submissions argue that tax considerations would drive policyholder behaviour to not exercise these options. In addition, increases of cover for “special events” or on exercise of a “future insurability” option are specifically contemplated by the policyholder at the time of entry into the policy and an expectation in respect of premium levels for that increased cover is also established at that time. The 10 percent cap was permitted to allow policyholders some flexibility in extending existing policies. Any relaxation of this concession would allow new policies to be created under “special” circumstances. Officials consider that the exercise of an option implies the creation of a new policy if made after the application date of the proposed new rules. These policies should not be subject to the grandparenting rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 62 MISCELLANEOUS TECHNICAL ISSUES Submissions were received on various sundry technical issues that are not covered under any of the preceding headings. Issue: Application of PIE rules to life fund PIEs Submission (32 – KPMG, 33A – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 41 – AXA New Zealand, 52 – Sovereign) When attributing PIE income for life fund PIEs, the rates to be used should be a 21% flat rate. Some submissions suggested a blended or composite rate which reflected the weighted average of the tax rates of policyholders in the particular fund. Comment The bill proposes to allow life insurers to elect into the PIE rules for “life fund PIEs to address concerns about the differing treatment of savings via life insurance products compared with other forms of saving. The bill prescribes that income will be attributed at the current company tax rate (currently 30%) unless the insurer elects to attribute income to policyholders at their individual PIE rates for unit-linked products. The submissions claim that a significant number of policyholders are on PIE rates of less than 30%. However, Sovereign considers few life insurers would elect into the PIE rules as the costs of implementing the systems required to comply with the PIE rules are expected to be significant. Therefore, Sovereign considers a 21% rate will be an appropriate pragmatic proxy. Officials consider that life fund PIEs should be treated consistently with other PIEs, which do not attribute income of the investors’ tax rates. This would not be achieved by adopting a proxy rate of tax. As the PIE rules are elective, life insurers will each have to make commercial judgements regarding entering the rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 63 Issue: Savings products with immaterial risk Submission (52 – Sovereign) Life insurers should have the option to elect to disregard the life risk component of a policy where the life insurer can establish that the life risk component of the premium received is likely to comprise less than one percent of the total premium. Comment The proposed legislation requires that for traditional/savings products that are not profit participation policies, life insurers must split premiums received between the life risk component and the savings component. Some products have only a very minimal life risk component, and officials consider that the compliance costs likely to be incurred in determining the split of premiums for these products will greatly outweigh any tax payable in respect of the life risk component. Officials consider these compliance costs could be removed if life insurers were entitled to elect to treat these policies as not including a life risk component when a life insurer determines on reasonable grounds, that the life risk component of the total premium is likely to be less than one percent. Officials anticipate that this election would only be made when the split of premiums is not required for financial reporting purposes. Therefore, officials recommend that the proposed legislation be amended to allow life insurers to choose to disregard the life risk component of a policy when the life insurer can establish, on reasonable grounds, that the life risk component of the premium received is likely to comprise less than one percent of the total premium. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: “Actuarially determined” Submission (10 – New Zealand Society of Actuaries Inc, 32 – KPMG, 41 – AXA New Zealand, 52 – Sovereign) The definition of “actuarially determined” contained in section YA 1 should be amended to remove the requirement for the determination to occur by the time of filing the return, and the consistency with general practice requirement should be amended to take into account that the bill requires modifications to general practice. 64 Comment The bill defines “actuarially determined” to include a requirement that the actuarial certification be done by the time for filing a return. This requirement presents some practical and technical difficulties. It would mean that a failure to calculate the required amounts using an actuarial method by the required time either leaves the (current) primary methods to apply inappropriately or leaves no amount of income or expenditure to be brought to account. It also would mean the Commissioner is unable to actuarially determine an amount unless that is done before the return is filed. This is contrary to the self- assessment system and would also make it impossible for the Commissioner to audit a life insurer. The definition also requires compliance with general practice. The proposed rules themselves mandate approaches to actuarial calculations which change general practice assumptions and approaches. This means that an actuarial determination cannot technically comply with the Act or the definition. Taking these considerations into account, officials are satisfied from discussions with members of the actuarial profession and Inland Revenue’s operations personnel that it is impractical to ask the life insurer to provide the assumptions, methodologies, bases and working calculations. The information is unlikely to improve the accuracy of the returns and will not provide any material assistance to the investigators when completing their life insurer risk reviews or audits. It is therefore not required. Paragraph (b) of the definition states that the definition will not be satisfied where the calculation of the amount (by an actuary): (i) does not accurately reflect the insurer’s business experience; (ii) is not made according to usual practice; or (iii) is part of a tax avoidance arrangement. The requirement to file a return is appropriately dealt with in the Tax Administration Act. Including a penalty for failure to meet deadlines in the substantive rules is inappropriate and against the principles of the recent rewrite of income tax law. That legislation also requires sufficient records to be maintained by the taxpayer to enable the Commissioner to access their tax liability if this is required. Officials consider section 22(7) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to make it clear that the Commissioner’s powers extend to request the documents and other materials required for the operation of the life insurance rules. Finally, there are no current actuarial standards which cover the calculation of tax, but there is a code of conduct for the actuarial profession with standards that could influence how tax calculations are carried out. However, officials consider that there should still be some objective standard by which the estimate is calculated, and which is consistent with actuarial practice. Subparagraph i) refers to “accurately” which is a higher standard than is usually used in tax law, and which is problematic to assess when dealing with an estimate. Accordingly, officials recommend retaining subparagraph (i) but substituting the word “reasonably” for “accurately”. 65 Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part, and the definition of “actuarially determined” in section YA 1 be amended by removing the anti-avoidance proposals except, as discussed earlier, and removing the certification requirements, and that the Tax Administration Act 1994 be amended as discussed above. Issue: Refunds of unexpired premiums Submission (10 – New Zealand Society of Actuaries Inc) Clarification of the intended tax treatment is sought in the following circumstances: • single premium policies that provide risk cover but may have some amount returned to policyholders if the policy is cancelled before its natural expiry; • refunds of premiums after various periods in respect of certain death cover-only policies. Comment The definition of “savings product policy” requires a policy to have a “surrender value”, and a “surrender value” specifically excludes refunds of unexpired premiums. A surrender value in ordinary circumstances only arises when there is some savings element in the policy. The two situations described do not refer to savings policies. Where the premium income has been returned as income in the shareholder base and is subsequently refunded, officials agree there has to be a mechanism to allow the life insurer a deduction in the shareholder base for the amount refunded. For premium payback products there may be a mis-match between the amount of risk premium returned as income and premium payback deducted as a claim. For example, a premium received before the commencement of the proposed new rules or under the new rules but subject to transitional relief, should not be the subject of a shareholder deduction when repaid. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and section EY 20(2), which outlines a life insurer’s shareholder base expenditure or loss for non-participation policies be amended to include “unexpired premiums” and “premium payback amounts”, but should only cover premium paybacks at the end of the contracted policy term to the extent those premiums have been returned as income under section EY 19(1), except where a transitional adjustment has been made under section EY 29. Both these terms will be appropriately defined in section YA (1) to encapsulate the types of policies noted in this submission. 66 Issue: Meaning of “class of insurance policy” Submissions (53 – Ernst & Young, 32 – KPMG, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The meaning of the phrase “class of policies” must be clarified. (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Officials should confirm that leaving “class” of life insurance policies undefined is intended and accepted so that disputes are minimised. If this is not intended, then what constitutes a “class” of life insurance policies should be defined. (KPMG) Comment The phrase “class of policies” is frequently used in the provisions relating to the reserves (see, for example, sections EY 23 to EY 27, and EY 30). Ideally, a life insurer should be able to apply the new rules in the most compliance-effective manner. Therefore classes of policies can be not only in terms of the broad types of risk policies (for example, annual renewable, level term and so on), but specific products, or even in terms of the dates issued (for example, those subject to grandparenting). While officials consider that the intention underlying “class of policies” is clear, a definition would ensure there is no ambiguity in interpretation. The Actuarial Standard PS 3 definition of “related policy group” provides guidance by referring to “substantially the same contractual terms and conditions and prices on a basis of substantially the same occupations”. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, and that “class of policies” be defined to be “substantially the same contractual terms and conditions and priced on a basis of substantially the same assumptions”. This follows the definition of “related policy group” in the Actuarial Standard PS3. Issue: Capital revenue boundary Submissions (32 – KPMG) • Inland Revenue practice needs to support the ability to apply the capital/revenue distinction effectively (and without dispute). • Consideration could also be given to providing the tax exemption on Australasian share trading gains, under the PIE rules, to shareholders. 67 Comment In a change from the current rules, where life insurers have been required to treat all their investments as being held on revenue account, ordinary principles will determine whether an asset held by a life insurer is held on capital or revenue account. Most of these principles were developed as a result of a long line of case law often referred to as the “banking and insurance” cases and which apply to life and general insurers and banks. In accordance with these cases, investments held for the purposes of a life insurance business are generally held on revenue account. Whether an item is on capital or revenue account has, however, always been a mixed question of fact and law. Application of these principles has been modified in certain cases by the PIE rules, including the tax exemption on Australasian share trading and FDR rules. However, to ensure consistency between life insurers and similar financial institutions, and with the earlier established principles, there are no policy reasons to extend further tax exemptions on trading gains to the shareholders of the life insurer. Recommendation That the first submission be noted. That the second submission be declined. Issue: Late elections Submission (32 – KPMG) Section EZ 62 should be amended to allow the Commissioner to accept an election at his/her discretion to treat an amount as policyholder base gross expenditure or loss after the time the relevant income tax return is required to be filed with Inland Revenue. Comment Consistent with the general loss offset provisions included in subpart IC of the Income Tax Act 2007, the Commissioner should be able to use his/her discretion in accepting late elections (that is, after the date in which a return is required to be filed) to allow an amount to be treated as policyholder base gross expenditure or loss, provided the other requirements of section EZ 62 are met. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 68 Issue: Remove references to schedular policyholder base Submission (32 – KPMG) All references to the “schedular policyholder base” should be changed to “life fund PIE base” and the taxation of each base should be made explicit and clear. Comment The submission argues that the description of a life fund PIE as the “schedular policyholder base” of a life insurer is confusing and misleading. This is compounded by the reference to two bases of taxation when there are in effect three: shareholder base, policyholder base and life fund PIE base. Officials consider the drafting is consistent with the core design principles of income tax legislation. The reference to “schedular policyholder base” is consistent with those core principles. Subject to the minor drafting clarifications discussed in this report, officials consider that the taxation of the various components of shareholders and policyholders income is clear, and do not require further clarification. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Treatment of annuities Submission (32 – KPMG) The tax treatment of annuities should be considered alongside any changes to the taxation of life insurance. Comment The bill proposes to approximate the current taxation of annuities by taxing the net income of annuity products in the shareholder base. However, subject to Ministers’ approval, an issues paper suggesting a basis for annuity taxation and inviting discussion, is planned for release in the near future. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 69 Issue: Definition of “surrender value” Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of “surrender value” in Section YA 1 should be clarified to include a gross-up for unpaid premiums, and loans advanced against the surrender value or interest charged on these amounts. Comment The proposed definition of “surrender value” is contained in section YA 1, and is also relevant, amongst other things, in the definition of “savings product policy”. The definition of “surrender value” is used in the calculation of policyholder base income in proposed section EY 15. “Surrender value” is also included in the definition of “savings product policy” which is also involved in section EY 15 when determining the apportionment of income under the formula in section EY 15(2). The unpaid premiums, loans advanced against the surrender value or/and interest are debts against the value of the policy and so should not reduce the surrender value of the policy for the purposes of investment income attribution. However, lapsed policies, where the gross surrender value is less than the policyholder debt, should be excluded from the savings policies as they have been legally terminated as a result of a breach in their contractual terms. Also, a loan on the policy and interest accrued on the loan is a liability of the policyholder and should not be netted off against the surrender value when apportioning with total assets that do not include those liabilities. Until such time as the policy lapses, the interest expense accrued on overdue premiums should be deductible to the policyholder base as a cost of investment earnings and deductible under section EY 16. Such a deduction should not be available for interest on a loan secured against the policy surrender value as the purpose of the borrowing is not connected to the policy and the policyholder base investment earnings. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 70 Issue: Definitions of “premium” and “claim” and sale of a life insurance business Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definitions for life insurance claims and premiums should expressly exclude any amount paid on the transfer or sale of a life insurance business; otherwise such a capital payment could be inadvertently taxed under section EY19(2)(b) or deducted under section EY 20(2)(b). Comment Proposed section EY 19(2)(b), entitled “Shareholder base gross income: non- participation policies”, includes as income “the life risk component of the premiums they derive”. This would potentially include the payment received by a seller on sale and transfer of a tranche of life insurance business. The components of such a payment will include all the components of the balance sheet (including any relating to non-life business), being assets less liabilities (including goodwill and reserves). For instance it may include: • general insurance business, including reserves (unearned premium reserve and outstanding claims reserve), other policy reserves, general expense provisions and goodwill on that business; • investments – assets and liabilities; and • life business reserves, including policy reserves. Under the new life rules, any gains or losses on sale or transfer will be subject to tax under the general tax rules; common law will prevail to determine whether profits or losses on sale of the investment assets will be subject to tax. Only gains on those investment assets held on revenue account will be subject to tax under the new rules. However, other assets net of liabilities, could perhaps be expected to be related to the long-term business of insurance and be held on capital account. Such net assets could be held by the life insurer on revenue account if, for example, that life insurer was in the business of buying and selling insurance businesses. Any such gain should be taxable to the shareholder under section EY 19(2)(e) as investment income derived. Thus, no special rules are required to deal with the sale except to ensure the same tax reserves are applied for the buyer and the seller. However, the definition of a life insurance “claim” under section EY 7(1)(b) “includes a payment made by a life insurer on the transfer of some or all of its life insurance business”. This is no longer appropriate because the common law distinction will apply to that transfer. On the other hand, the definition of “premium” under section YA 1 is very wide and potentially includes an amount received by a purchaser. It should therefore exclude a payment received by a life insurer on the transfer of all or part of a life insurance business. 71 In the definition of “claim”, officials recommend deleting the word “includes” and replacing it with the word “excludes”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 72 DRAFTING MATTERS Issue: Complexity Submission (10 – New Zealand Society of Actuaries Inc) Concerns are raised about the complexity of the drafting of the proposed legislation. Comment Concerns about the drafting have specifically been raised about deficiencies in the operation of the premium smoothing reserve and the difficulty for taxpayers in having to discern the meaning of the definition “policyholder base gross expenditure and loss” across an extensive number of cross-references. Life insurance presents drafting challenges in translating complex actuarial concepts (such as the “premium smoothing reserve”, which spreads the derivation of premium income in a manner fair to taxpayers) into appropriate legislative language. Life insurance is an inherently complex business, and any tax legislation will inevitably have an element of comparative complexity to adequately deal with the subject matter. Officials accept the comments raised about the operation of the premium smoothing reserve and have made specific recommendations in this report under the heading “premium smoothing reserve” to deal with the problems identified. Officials have also recommended a number of changes addressed in this report that help clarify some complex issues. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Technical review Submissions (10 – New Zealand Society of Actuaries Inc, 32 – KPMG, 33A and 33B – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 43 – Ascendant Consulting Limited) A range of concerns have been raised about the technical quality of the legislation and that a technical review by a panel of experts is required for the following reasons: • The quality of the legislation is questionable. (New Zealand Society of Actuaries Inc) 73 • The bill contains a number of drafting errors both substantive and remedial. The presence of these errors requires an increased level of scrutiny by taxpayers and makes it more difficult to discern the policy intent. A consultative approach to the legislation should have been adopted. (KPMG) • The highly technical and specialised nature of life insurance and life insurance taxation means that the legislation would benefit from further consultation by a recognised panel of experts. (Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc) • The errors in the legislation make it unworkable. It is not enduring or robust. (Ascendant Consultation Ltd) The Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc submitted that the life insurance provision be excluded from the current bill and included in a later tax bill. Comment Officials have received (and continue to receive) expert actuarial advice from senior actuaries from PricewaterhouseCoopers, about the technical accuracy and commercial practicality of the policy design and drafting of the legislative changes to the taxation of life business. Therefore, we consider that an expert review panel is not required. Also, as this officials’ report recommends a number of amendments that should address other concerns, there is no reason for delaying the reform of life insurance taxation by inclusion of the legislation in a later bill. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Officials to be flexible Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Officials should be flexible in dealing with drafting and technical issues as they arise over time. Comment Drafting and technical issues will arise over time as life insurers implement new systems and processes to cater for the new rules and in the transition period. Many issues are not yet known at this time. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 74 Issue: Consistency Submissions (10 – New Zealand Society of Actuaries Inc, 32 – KPMG, 33A – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc) A number of comments have been made about the consistent use of terms or the use of imprecise terms. Examples of what appear to be different words used for the same concepts are: • “Reserve” is used for business other than participating, and “policy liabilities” for participating business. • Claims are said to be “received” in section EY 28(6)(d) and to have “occurred” in section EY 24(4)(a). • Premiums are described as “always the same amount and cannot be changed” in section EY 29(2)(a), and “guaranteed” in section EY 29(2)(b). (New Zealand Society of Actuaries Inc) • Section EY 23(1) uses the phrase “risk component”. This term is not used elsewhere in the life insurance changes and should be changed to “life risk component”. Comment Submissions have made a number of useful suggestions and, where appropriate, these have been incorporated into the proposed legislation arising from the changes recommended in this report. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 75 CROSS-REFERENCES AND OTHER ITEMS OF A MINOR NATURE Submission (32 – KPMG, 53 – Ernst & Young, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, matters raised by officials) A number of omitted cross-references, misleading section headings and other items of a minor drafting nature have been identified.

Comment As part of the recommended amendments to the bill, the changes to the taxation of life business in the bill would be restructured to make them clearer and ensure that they achieve their intended effect. Officials consider that the missing cross-references and other minor items listed above should be taken into account as part of this work. Recommendation That the proposed minor remedial amendments be taken into account in amending the legislation. 78 OFFICIALS’ LIST OF DRAFTING CORRECTIONS Officials have noted the following minor drafting corrections to ensure the correct policy intent is reflected in the proposed legislation. Issue: Financial arrangement rules – exclusion of life financial arrangement from excepted financial arrangements needs correcting Submission Insert after the words “financial arrangement” in section EW 5(2) the words “to the extent it is not life financial reinsurance”. Replace the word “that” in proposed section EW 5(8) with the words “to the extent that it”. Comment Under current law, section EW 5 (2) excludes all annuities as excepted financial arrangements. Proposed subsection (8) excludes “life financial reinsurance” from the exclusion of “insurance contracts”. This is inconsistent because the annuities are also likely, at least in part, to qualify as “life financial reinsurance” but do not have an exclusion. The definition in proposed section EW 5(8) is also incomplete as life financial reinsurance may be only part of an “insurance contract” but is only excluded from the “excepted financial arrangement” definition where the whole contract qualifies as a “life financial reinsurance”. Life financial reinsurance arising on an annuity contract will not be subject to the financial arrangement rules. If a “life financial reinsurance” arrangement is a part of an “insurance contract” it will continue to be an “excepted financial arrangement”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 79 Issue: Reinsurance premium expenses incurred by a life insurer not offered Submission Replace proposed section DR 2(3) with: “A life insurer is denied a deduction for life insurance policy premiums if the policy was not offered or entered into in New Zealand”. Comment Proposed subsection DR 2(3)(a) denies a deduction for reinsurance premiums where the policies are not offered in New Zealand by a life insurer. However, a life insurer enters into a life reinsurance policy issued by a reinsurer who has offered that life reinsurance policy to the life insurer. The life insurer does not offer the reinsurance policy to anyone. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Shareholder income for non-participating policies Submission Insert at the end of proposed section EY 19(1) the words “or policyholder base gross income”. Replace the words “equal to” in section EY 19(2) with “includes”. Insert an extra section (3), “The shareholder gross income in section (2) is not intended to capture any savings portion of a premium that is notional capital of the policyholder”. Comment In proposed section EY 19(2) the words “equal to” should be “includes” so that it does not limit the income captured and to make it clear the policyholder gross income and the savings portion of income is excluded. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 80 Issue: Life risk claims incurred – ensure reserves not double counted Submission Insert at the end of proposed section EY 20(2)(b) the words “excluding life risk claims in the reserves referred to in section EY 23”. Comment Proposed section EY 20(2)(b) includes “the life risk component of the claims they incur” which would include by definition any reserving claims amounts also referred to under section EY 23. This may lead to double counting of the reserves in the calculation of shareholder base income. It was not intended to include the reserves in proposed section EY 20 so to prevent double counting they should be expressly excluded. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Wording changes Submissions Replace: • The word “to” in section EY 1(1) with the word “between”. • The word “apportioned” in section EY 1(2) with the words “allocated by apportionment”. • All the words after and including the words “actuarially determined” in sections EY 4(2) and EY 15(4) with the words “results in an actuarially determined amount that is more equitable and reasonable than the amount calculated using the basis described in subsections (...)”. • Section EY 24(4)(a) should be amended to insert after “...risk component of claims” the words “where the underlying event that gives rise to the claim has occurred prior to the end of the income year...”. Comment • Proposed section EY 1 uses the words “apportionment” and “apportioned” incorrectly. It is not correct to “apportion” something to either A or B. One would either apportion between A or B, or allocate to either A or B. • Proposed section EY 4 uses the words “basis” and “actuarially determined” incorrectly. “Actuarially determined” refers to an amount and the calculation thereof, it does not refer to a “basis”. 81 • In proposed section EY 6 the use of the word “matter” should be to “amount”. • In proposed section EY 15 the words “basis” and “actuarially determined” are incorrectly used. • Proposed section EY 24(4)(a) refers to “claims that have occurred”. A claim cannot occur; the event which results in a claim entitlement occurs. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Use of the defined terms “year” and “income year” Submission In proposed section EY 20(2)(f), insert the word “income” before the word “year”. Comment Proposed section EY 20(2)(f) refers to expenditure or loss “for the year”, whereas proposed section EY 19(2)(f) entitled “Shareholder base income: non-participation policies” refers to income “for the income year”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Outstanding claims reserve (OCR) Submission The calculation of the OCR contained in proposed section EY 24(4)(c) requires some minor refining. Comment Proposed section EY 24(4)(c) requires refining to more accurately describe the “best estimate” methodology. This can be achieved by replacing the words “reflects the inherent uncertainty in the relevant best estimate assumptions,” with “reflects the uncertainty of the estimates that arise from the use of the relevant best estimate assumptions”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 82 Issue: Unearned premium reserve (UPR) and formula definitions Submission The calculation of the UPR in proposed section EY 26 requires refining. Comment In proposed section EY 26 (1), a calculation is required without reference to the timing of the calculation and in subsection (3) the formula definition requires refining. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Capital guarantee reserve (CGR) words and timing Submission The calculation of the CGR in proposed section EY 27(1) requires refining. Comment Proposed section EY 27 (1) CGR is referred to as being a circumstance and a calculation is required without reference to the timing of the calculation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 83 Issue: Definition of “asset base” under a profit participation policy Submission Replace the words in the definition of “asset base” with: “asset base”, being a separately identifiable group of assets or proportion attributable to the profit participation policies, including any life financial reinsurance assets. Comment In proposed section YA (1), the definition of “profit participation policy” involves the words “asset base”. However, “asset base” is not clearly defined but should be amended as suggested. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 84 85 General insurance and risk margins 86 87 OVERVIEW Clauses 79 and 408 An amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007 is proposed to clarify that general insurers can claim a tax deduction for movements in the outstanding claims reserves (OCR) calculated under new New Zealand International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 4. The issue was brought to the attention of officials by the Insurance Council. Under IFRS 4 and actuarial practice, the OCR has two components. The first, the “central estimate”, is the mean value in the range of possible values for outstanding claims. The second is a risk margin, which is a prudential addition to reflect the inherent uncertainty of the central estimate. Most insurers already claim a tax deduction for the entire annual movement in the OCR. While it is clear that the movement in the central estimate is tax deductible, the law is unclear on the deductibility of the movement in the risk margin, though it is likely determined on the facts of each insurer. The proposed amendments remove the uncertainty and confirm deductibility for financial accounts prepared under New Zealand IFRS 4. The proposed amendment will have application from the income year that the insurer adopts New Zealand IFRS 4. As the standard was adopted by some companies for their 2009 income year, it will therefore have retrospective effect, but as it is taxpayer-friendly this should not cause any major problems. Three submissions were received which generally confirmed support from the general insurance industry for the amendments, and included submissions on some technical aspects of the rules. 88 APPLICATION DATE Submission (32 – KPMG) The provisions applying to movements in a general insurer’s outstanding claims reserve should apply retrospectively back to the first year a person adopts IFRS, unless insurers “opt out” of a retrospective application. Comment The retrospective application date before the 2009–10 income year (which applies if the person has adopted New Zealand IFRS 4) is intended to be taxpayer-friendly by clarifying the law that the movement in reserves calculated for IFRS 4 purposes can be deducted for tax purposes. However, this provision may not be taxpayer-friendly when a general insurer has filed income tax returns adopting a different approach for tax purposes than for accounting purposes. The provisions applying to movements in a general insurer’s outstanding claims reserve should apply retrospectively unless insurers “opt out” of retrospective application if they wish (that is, the provisions should apply unless a return is filed to the contrary). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 89 SOURCE DOCUMENT Submission (10 – New Zealand Society of Actuaries Inc) That legislation should refer explicitly to IFRS 4 as the source document rather than New Zealand IFRS 4. Comment A source document can be used as the primary source for technical interpretation and definitions. IFRS 4 (which is the international standard) and New Zealand IFRS 4 are parallel accounting standards. However, the definition of “outstanding claims reserve” contained in the bill refers specifically to paragraphs of New Zealand IFRS 4. There is no need therefore to refer to IFRS 4 as a source document. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 90 DEFINITION OF OUTSTANDING CLAIMS RESERVE Submission (10 – New Zealand Society of Actuaries Inc) The definition of “outstanding claims reserve” should include reference to the wider range of paragraphs 5.1 to 6.1.3 of New Zealand IFRS 4, Appendix D. Comment The definition of “outstanding claims reserve” specifies the value to be that as measured under Appendix D, paragraphs 5.1 to 5.1.12 of New Zealand IFRS 4. These paragraphs explicitly refer to the concept of discounting liabilities to obtain a present value, but do not provide any guidance on what interest rates should be used for discounting. As such guidance is set out in paragraphs 6.1 to 6.1.3 these paragraphs should be incorporated into the definition. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 91 OPENING BALANCES Submission (32 – KPMG) The definition of “opening outstanding claims reserve” in sections CR 4 and DW 4 should be amended to ensure that, in the year a general insurer transitions to the new tax rules, the opening outstanding claims reserve (OCR) is the prior year’s closing OCR used for tax purposes rather than financial reporting purposes. Comment In proposed sections CR 4 and DW 4, a general insurer’s “opening OCR” is defined to be the insurer’s closing outstanding claims reserve for the income year before the current year. “Outstanding claims reserve” is proposed to be defined in section YA 1 to mean the insurer’s reserve used for IFRS purposes. The proposed legislation will only deal with financial accounting treatment arising from the insurer’s adoption of New Zealand IFRS 4. In tax returns relating to periods before the insurer adopting IFRS, the insurer may have claimed a deduction for the movement in the OCR that was not based on the financial accounting treatment in which case the closing tax reserve will be different from the closing financial reserve. The opening reserves in the first year when applying the new rules must be those used in the previous year’s tax return. This is because the use of the new New Zealand IFRS 4 opening balance, if different from that used in the previous year for tax, would result over time in either a portion of the claim payment becoming non-deductible or the deduction being in excess of the actual claim as a consequence of the tax rule change. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 92 CALCULATION OF OUTSTANDING CLAIMS RESERVE Submission (32 – KPMG) The prescribed method for calculating the amount of assessable income or allowable deduction resulting from the movement in a general insurer’s outstanding claims reserve (OCR) does not accurately reflect payments made to settle insurance claims. This should be addressed by either: • amending the income and deductions formulas in sections CR 4 and DW 4 to take the amount actually paid to settle a claim into account (opening OCR – closing OCR – claims paid); or • alternatively, a “narrative approach” could be taken to provide that the tax treatment of outstanding claims and claims paid must follow IFRS. This could be further supported and explained by an Inland Revenue policy statement. Comment The intention of the bill is to align the tax rules with those of financial reporting. Previously, general insurers were allowed deductions for amounts incurred and included in their closing OCR and also for the amount of claims when eventually paid out, to the extent this differs from the amount reserved in earlier years. This is because, under the normal principles of deductibility, the expense incurred in settling claims was deductible whenever it was incurred, provided it satisfied the general principles of deductibility. The submission argues that the use of the formula will lead to unintended results, denying a deduction previously allowed. In the example provided by the submission: We have assumed that an insurer experiences and reserves only one claim. In this example, the general insurer initially creates a reserve of $100. However, the insurer actually ends up paying $120 to settle the claim the following year. Year 1 The general insurer creates an OCR provision for $100 (the opening provision is nil in this example). Under the ordinary rules of deductibility, a deduction of $100 would be allowed in Year 1, as this amount has been incurred for tax purposes. A deduction of $100 would also be provided by section DW 4 in this case under the new rules but only a single deduction of $100 would be allowed in Year 1. Year 2 In Year 2, the amount expended to settle the claim is actually $120. Under the old rules, a further deduction of $20 is allowed at this point as this additional amount has been incurred for tax purposes. The total allowable deduction between the two years is therefore $120 – this is the correct tax deductible amount. 93 Under the new rules, the bill has introduced a formula which has codified the method for calculating income and deductions for movements in a general insurer’s OCR. Under sections CR 4 (income) and DW 4 (deductions) the formula is as follows: Opening outstanding claims reserve – closing outstanding claims reserve Because the OCR of $100 was settled in Year 2, the closing OCR is now $0, giving the insurer income of $100 under the above formula. In addition to this, the insurer will obtain a deduction of $20 under ordinary principles, as this additional amount has been incurred for tax purposes. Accordingly, the new rules produce a net deduction over Year 1 and Year 2 of only $20, rather than the amount incurred of $120. Officials disagree with the conclusions. A claim expense is ordinarily deductible under general principles. The proposed legislation only deals with that portion of the claim that relates to a movement in the OCR. Officials accept however, that it is desirable to clarify that a general insurance company can deduct amounts paid during the year in respect of claims under general insurance policies as well as movements in the OCR. A provision of this nature is included in the equivalent Australian legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but that there be legislative clarification of the deductibility of both claims paid and movements in the OCR. 94 INLAND REVENUE GUIDELINES Submission (10 – New Zealand Society of Actuaries Inc) Inland Revenue’s General Insurance Reserving Industry Guidelines should be updated when the proposed amendments are enacted. Comment The definition of “outstanding claims reserve” specifies the value as that measured under Appendix D, paragraphs 5.1 to 5.1.12 of New Zealand IFRS 4 and includes in paragraphs 5.2(d) and 5.2.3 indirect claims handling costs. This is at variance with Inland Revenue’s General Insurance Reserving Industry Guidelines published on Inland Revenue’s website. Recommendation That the submission is noted. The need for guidelines will be discussed with interested parties. 95 “ACTUARIALLY DETERMINED” Submission (7 – PricewaterhouseCoopers on behalf of the Insurance Council of New Zealand) The proposed definition of “actuarially determined” contained in section YA 1 should be amended by removal of: • subparagraph (a)(iii); and • subparagraph(b). Comment The definition of “actuarially determined” is also relevant for the life insurance reforms and is separately commented on in that part of the report. The comments that follow are relevant for both general insurance and life insurance. Subparagraph (a)(iii) of the definition of “actuarially determined” requires, among other things, that the actuary has “provided to the Commissioner in writing, in the form prescribed by the Commissioner, if any, all assumptions, methodologies, bases and working calculations necessary to support the calculation of the amount”. The submission argues that detailed prescription of information is unusual and unnecessary as there are sufficient powers already given to the Commissioner to request all information in the Tax Administration Act. If this provision was enforced, the submission argued it would impose unnecessary compliance costs. Officials note that it was never the intention that the Commissioner would request all the information noted in the subparagraph (hence use of the words “if any”). Officials agree that, with a few minor clarifications to the relevant provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994 which would make it clear that the Commissioner’s powers extend to the documents referred to in this proposed provision, this provision is unnecessary. Paragraph (b) states that the definition will not be satisfied where the calculation of the amount (by an actuary): (i) does not accurately reflect the insurer’s business experience; (ii) is not made according to usual practice; or (iii) is part of a tax avoidance arrangement. Officials accept that actuarial standards require actuarially determined amounts must reflect the insurer’s business practice, and so in applying these standards the “usual practice” requirement is met. So, subparagraph (ii) is superfluous. Subparagraph (iii) duplicates the general anti-avoidance provision and is also superfluous, as any tax avoidance can be determined under that provision. 96 However, officials consider that there should still be some objective standard by which the estimate is calculated, and which is consistent with actuarial practice. Subparagraph i) refers to “accurately” which is a higher standard than is usually used in tax law, and which is problematic to assess when dealing with an estimate. Accordingly, officials recommend retaining subparagraph (i) but substituting the word “reasonably” for “accurately”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part, and the definition of “actuarially determined” in section YA 1 be amended by removing the anti-avoidance proposals except, as discussed earlier, and removing the certification requirements. The Tax Administration Act 1994 to also be amended as discussed above. 97 EXTENSION TO GENERAL INSURANCE PRODUCTS HELD BY LIFE INSURERS Submission (32 – KPMG) The provisions applying to movements in a general insurer’s outstanding claims reserve should not apply to the general insurance business of a life insurer (that is, accident, disability and health business). Comment As defined currently in the bill, the provisions which provide tax deductibility for movements in a general insurer’s outstanding claims reserve to be determined under IFRS 4 do not apply to non-life products held by a life insurer. This result is not correct from a policy perspective. While life insurers are not required by New Zealand IFRS 4 to apply prudential margins in calculating reserves, actuarial practice is to apply discounting. For this reason, the proposed life insurance provisions dealing with reserves require discounting. This appears to be generally accepted by the industry. If a deduction is allowed for a future claim, it is logical and fair that only the present value of that claim be deducted. However, a drafting error did not extend the risk margin and discounting criteria to general insurance products held by life insurers. Officials propose a new provision applying the tenor of the reserve calculations provisions contained in proposed section EY 24, that applies to non-life products held by life insurers. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 98 MINOR DRAFTING CORRECTIONS Submissions (Matter raised by officials) The following amendments should be made for the purposes of consistency: • In section CR 4 (1)(b), add after “..CR 3” – “(Income of non-resident general insurer)”. This would make it consistent with CR 4(2). • In section DW 3(2), add after “...year” – “(the current year)”. This would make it consistent with CR 3(2). Comment These amendments are minor, to ensure consistency in the headings. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted.
Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Bill Officials’ Report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on Submissions on the Bill Supplementary Paper to Volume 3 Non-disclosure right Tax treatment of reimbursements and honoraria paid to volunteers May 2009 Prepared by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue and the Treasury CONTENTS Non-disclosure right 1 Non-dislcosure right 3 Issue: In support of the amendment 3 Issue: Application date 3 Issue: Application to all forms of court order 5 Issue: Broaden the amendment to reflect original policy intent 5 Tax treatment of reimbursements and honoraria paid to volunteers 7 Overview 9 Relationship between proposed sections CO 1 and CW 62B 10 Reimbursement of expenses paid to volunteers to be treated as exempt income 11 Estimate of expenditure likely to be incurred may be reimbursed 12 Separation of reimbursement of expenses from honoraria 13 Definition of “volunteer” 16 Full or partial exemption for honoraria 19 Other matters raised 20 1 Non-disclosure right 2 3 NON-DISLCOSURE RIGHT Clauses 437–441 Issue: In support of the amendment Submission (38 – KPMG, 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) We strongly support the extension of the right of non-disclosure to discovery proceedings during litigation. (KPMG) The Group welcomes the amendment to extend the right of non-disclosure contained in sections 20B to 20G of the Tax Administration Act to apply to discovery and similar processes that occur during litigation. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Application date Submission (32and 32A – KPMG, 67, 67A and 67B– New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 68, 68A, 68B and 68C – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The amendment should have retrospective effect. (KPMG) The application date of this legislation should change to requests for information issued after 1 April 2009. An application date that applies to discovery orders requested after the date of Royal assent is the earliest practicable date. The application date of these measures should restore their original policy intent from the earliest available time. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The Group is extremely disappointed that these provisions are not backdated to when the non-disclosure rules were initially introduced, being 21 June 2005. We strongly submit that these changes should be retrospective to 21 June 2005. Failing reaching an agreement on the application date, we believe that the Ministers of Revenue and Finance should provide a public directive to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to administer the non-disclosure rules in the manner originally intended, to protect the integrity of the tax system under section 6 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Likewise, the Governor-General should make a similar direction by way of Order in Council in accordance with section 6B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The amending legislation should not only apply to challenge proceedings commenced after the date of enactment; rather it should apply to all undisclosed accounting advice 4 at the date of enactment (that is, even where the challenge proceeding is commenced before the enactment of the bill). (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment As drafted, the amendment will apply to challenges begun on or after the date of enactment. An alternative application date that had any element of retrospectivity would be problematic. In some cases parties may have already disclosed documents as part of the discovery proceedings. As with legal privilege, this could be treated as a waiver of their non-disclosure right or could mean that the discovery process would need to be revisited. Other parties who have not yet disclosed information could (subject to the weight judges give to proposed legislation) be protected by an early application date resulting in inconsistent treatment among taxpayers. Such a change would compound uncertainty and add complexity to proceedings. In developing this amendment, officials consulted extensively with the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants. The Institute’s submission on the bill suggested that the measure should apply if the Commissioner has made a request for information after 1 April 2009. We consider that the same issues that arise in respect of a retrospective application date would apply to this option. In their supplementary submission, the Institute suggested that the earliest practical time from which the right of non-disclosure could apply is in relation to discovery orders requested on or after the date of Royal assent of the bill. This application date is also problematic in that there may be several requests for information and/or discovery in a case. The provision would therefore be difficult to define. It could also result in application of the non-disclosure right to some but not all such requests in the same case and consequent confusion about which documents were or were not able to be used in litigation. However, the issue is of considerable concern to the Institute and other groups such as the Corporate Taxpayers Group. Officials have some sympathy for these concerns given that the policy intent of the non-disclosure right was to provide a level of parity of treatment between tax advice provided by lawyers and that provided by accountants/other tax advisers. Officials therefore recommend that the right of non- disclosure apply to future disputes and current disputes which have not advanced to the first conference required under the High Court rules or the Taxation Review Authority regulations as at the date of Royal assent. Discovery action is frequently the first agreed step after the initial conference and therefore this alternative application provision would in many cases be equivalent to one based on discovery, as sought by the Institute, but would provide more certainty. There is a concern about current cases which raise substantially similar issues to later cases. The concern is that if the earlier case has not had the protection of the non- disclosure right but the later cases do have this protection, the taxpayer may decide to proceed with the later cases given that they have the benefit of the non-disclosure right and could possibly result in a more favourable decision. This could incur significant costs of litigation for both parties. We therefore recommend that an exception be made to the recommended application provision where a substantially similar issue is being considered by the courts. The current application provision in the bill would apply in these cases. 5 Recommendation That the amendment apply to future disputes and current disputes which have not advanced to the first conference required under the High Court rules or the Taxation Review Authority regulations as at the date of Royal assent. This recommended application provision will not apply to cases where substantially similar issues are being considered by the courts. The current application provision in the bill will apply instead. Issue: Application to all forms of court order Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposed definition of “discovery obligation” should be broadened to a disclosure obligation that includes all forms of court order. The ability to request discovery is only one form of disclosure that courts can require of litigants. Comment The amendment includes a proposed definition of “discovery obligation” which is “an order of a court or Taxation Review Authority, or notice of discovery in proceedings before a court or Authority, requiring the disclosure of information to the Commissioner in relation to proceedings before the court or Authority”. Officials consider that the provision as drafted covers all forms of court order. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Broaden the amendment to reflect original policy intent Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The amendment should be broadened to ensure that the original policy intention of the legislation is successfully implemented and that it is not undermined again. There needs to be a substantive rewrite of the current provisions to ensure that Parliament’s original policy intent is actually carried forward into law, and is robust and effective for taxpayers. The non-disclosure rights are only protection against the Commissioner exercising powers under sections 16 to 19 of the Tax Administration Act. If Inland Revenue were barred from obtaining the information under the non- disclosure right the same information could be obtained from other government departments and passed on to Inland Revenue. We suggest that the non-disclosure right should apply no matter how the Commissioner obtains the information. 6 We also suggest that the non-disclosure right should be amended to apply also to oral communications. Comment Inland Revenue often receives information from third parties. In these cases, non- disclosure may not be possible or practical. We also note that the suggested amendment may go further than similar provisions that apply to legal practitioners. On the second issue, consultation prior to introduction of the legislation currently in place was premised on non-disclosure in relation to books and documents. Officials consider that further consultation should be undertaken before extending the rule to apply to oral communications, as practices would need to change as well as the legislation being significantly rewritten. However, officials are happy to discuss this further with interested parties. We note that oral communications are included within the ambit of legal privilege. Recommendation That the submission be declined in respect of applying the rule no matter how Inland Revenue obtained the information and that further consultation should be undertaken in relation to extending the rule to apply to oral communications. 7 Tax treatment of reimbursements and honoraria paid to volunteers 8 9 OVERVIEW Clauses 23 and 39 The bill introduces specific tax rules to treat payments that reimburse expenditure incurred in undertaking voluntary activities as exempt income, to remove current uncertainty about the appropriate tax treatment. The new rules will also make it clear that payments of honoraria will continue to be treated as schedular payments and subject to the PAYE rules. Twelve submissions were received. Nine explicitly expressed support in principle for the proposed changes. However, one questioned whether the changes are necessary. The remaining submissions gave no indication whether or not they supported the proposed changes. There is clear support for an unlimited tax exemption for payments that reimburse costs incurred by volunteers, with most agreeing this can best be achieved through a separation of reimbursement payments from honoraria. A new definition of “volunteer” is critical to the clarity of the proposals and the proposed definition was well-supported. However, three areas of concern were raised: whether a direct or indirect element of public benefit or common good is needed, whether the requirement of New Zealand residence is unduly restrictive of persons here on tourist or other temporary entry visas, and whether volunteers who have entered into an agreement with an agency or organisation about their volunteering role might inadvertently be excluded. Four submissions seek a partial exemption from income tax for honoraria, while one submission suggests that honoraria should be fully exempt. Of the submissions seeking a partial exemption, the range is from $500 per person per year to $5,000 per person per year. As a result of the submissions, officials propose the following changes to the bill, as introduced: • clarification of the relationship between section CO 1 (Income from voluntary activities) and section CW 62B (Voluntary activities); • allowing organisations to make combined payments of honoraria and reimbursements, provided the paying organisation maintains clear records that justify the treatment of the reimbursement portion of the payment; • enhancing the definition of “volunteer” to allow for benefits that apply more generally to a community; • clarifying the relationship between section CW 62B and existing section RD 8(3) that allows the Commissioner to determine the amount or proportion of expenditure that a person incurs in deriving a schedule payment, such as an honorarium. In addition, officials propose a minor modification to the definition of “volunteer” to ensure that certain volunteers are not inadvertently excluded from the tax exemption. 10 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROPOSED SECTIONS CO 1 AND CW 62B Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The relationship between the sections CO 1 and CW 62B should be clarified. Comment Under the current law an amount must first be income before it can be treated as exempt income. Over time, administrative practices in some organisations have evolved so that payments to volunteers have been subject to withholding tax at source. In some cases the tax withheld has incorrectly been assumed to be a final tax so that volunteers have not taken the opportunity to claim their expenses incurred as a deduction against their reimbursement payments. Officials consider that the relationship between the two provisions could be clarified by making it more explicit in section CO 1 that an amount received by a person in undertaking a voluntary activity is, in the first instance, income. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Section CO 1 should be amended to point to the relationship with section CW 62B. 11 REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES PAID TO VOLUNTEERS TO BE TREATED AS EXEMPT INCOME Submission (6 – Volunteering Auckland) It needs to be clear in the legislation that reimbursement for capital expenditure and maintenance of the volunteer’s equipment is also exempt income. Comment The proposed legislation draws no distinction on the nature of costs incurred by a volunteer for reimbursement. The tax treatment relates to the reimbursement payment, not to the costs which gave rise to it. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The principle that volunteers should not be subject to tax on the reimbursement of their expenditure and should not be required to file tax returns for reimbursements arising from their voluntary activities is supported. Comment The new rules will address long-standing concerns expressed by the community and voluntary sector that reimbursement payments to volunteers are taxed in an inconsistent manner and that volunteers and the organisations they provide voluntary services for incur unnecessary compliance costs. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 12 ESTIMATE OF EXPENDITURE LIKELY TO BE INCURRED MAY BE REIMBURSED Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The wording of the provision that would allow reasonable estimates of expenditure to be reimbursed should specifically provide for the amount to be less than the amount incurred by the volunteer. Comment The proposal that allows reasonable estimates of expenditure to be reimbursed was introduced to provide flexibility for organisations that prefer to reimburse their volunteers on a planned, regular basis, rather than as ad hoc responses when evidence of actual costs are presented. It is likely that in some periods the costs will exceed the reimbursement payment, while in other periods the payment may exceed the costs. However, on average, the costs can be expected to exceed the reimbursements. A 2007 survey carried out by Victoria University of Wellington showed that, on average, reimbursements received by volunteers represented only 4 percent of the total costs incurred by them. In addition, the technical and administrative information provided by Inland Revenue will make it clear that in estimating expenditure, a paying organisation must have in place adequate controls that would satisfy audit requirements. There are also inherent controls through the limited funding generally available to non-profit organisations to make these types of payments and their accountability to their stakeholders for expenditure of those limited funds. It is therefore considered unlikely that this flexibility would raise any risks to the tax base. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 13 SEPARATION OF REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES FROM HONORARIA Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Proposed section CW 62B(3) is too restrictive. Comment New section CW 62B provides that: • Reimbursement payments that are based on actual expenses incurred by volunteers in undertaking voluntary activities will be treated as exempt income. • If a paying organisation puts in place a process for making a reasonable estimate of the amount of expenditure likely to be incurred by a volunteer for which reimbursement is payable, then payments based on that estimate will also be treated as exempt income. This will provide flexibility, such as when it is not practical for organisations to reimburse their volunteers on the basis of actual costs incurred. It is intended that this will include reimbursements in non-cash form such as petrol vouchers. The submission considers that a payer who can clearly identify which part of a payment is honorarium and which part is reimbursement, should not be required to treat the whole payment as a schedular payment and withhold tax; that doing so will increase compliance costs for payers. Proposed section CW 62B provides for reimbursement payments to be made separately from honoraria for the reimbursement to attract the tax exempt treatment. This was considered necessary to provide certainty for the community and voluntary sector. An organisation that chooses to make a combined payment of honorarium and reimbursement to a volunteer would need to include only the honorarium portion in their return to Inland Revenue of schedular payments. They would, however, still be required to be able to account for the different nature of the separate parts of the payment for their own accountability and, if needed, audit purposes. Although only a few submissions on these provisions have raised concerns about the compliance cost aspects of the requirement to separate reimbursements from honoraria, 19 submissions on the November 2007 issues paper, The tax treatment of honoraria and reimbursements paid to volunteers, considered that there would be some or significant additional compliance costs incurred in separating the payments. These provisions were always intended to provide certainty and reduce compliance costs for volunteers and paying organisations. It therefore seems reasonable to introduce the additional flexibility that is sought. Officials consider that this would raise no additional compliance risks, provided the paying organisation maintains clear records that justify the treatment of the reimbursement portion of the payment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 14 Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Proposed section CW 62B(3) should be omitted as it will result in anomalous results due to the inability of some organisations to amend either their constitutions or the underlying legislation. Comment The submission considers that while some organisations will be able to reclassify payments as reimbursement of expenditure genuinely incurred or likely to be incurred by volunteers, others will not be able to do so until they are able to amend their constitution, or unless there is enabling legislation. The submission cites the example of honorary fisheries officers appointed under the Fisheries Act 1996. However, the relevant legislation (section 197(3) of that Act) specifically allows for reimbursement payments to be made separate from and in addition to honoraria. The Ministry of Fisheries has confirmed that honoraria are recognition of the services provided by their honorary fisheries officers and do not contain an element of reimbursement of costs. Actual and reasonable costs are reimbursed only on production of receipts or evidence of travel costs incurred. The proposed new rules do not require organisations to make changes that might be in conflict with their policies. Instead, they offer choices – to reimburse on the basis of evidence of actual costs incurred, or in anticipation of expenditure likely to be incurred. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The relationship between proposed section CW 62B(3) and existing section RD 8(3) should be clarified as to when the latter section would continue to apply. Comment Many organisations will choose to pay reimbursements separately from honoraria so that their volunteers gain the immediate benefits of the exempt treatment. However, it was not intended that the option of obtaining a determination from the Commissioner (provided for in section RD 8(3)) would be removed nor that the new provisions would override a determination that had been made under section RD 8(3). Officials acknowledge that the relationship between the provisions could be clarified. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 15 Submission (68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The words “to the extent” should be included in section CW 62B(3) to make it clear that a payment is exempt only to the extent that it reimburses expenditure. This would render the subsection that defines “honoraria” unnecessary so it could be omitted. Comment In part, the effect of what is proposed would be similar to the removal of the requirement to pay honoraria and reimbursements as entirely separate payments. Instead, this result can be achieved by allowing organisations to combine the payments provided they are able to account for the different nature of the separate parts of the payment for their own accountability and, if needed, audit purposes. We consider that the definition of “honoraria” currently in the bill is needed to provide the certainty sought by the voluntary sector. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 16 DEFINITION OF “VOLUNTEER” Submission (6 – Volunteering Auckland, 25 – Volunteering Canterbury, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposed definition of “volunteer” requires the addition of words such as, “for the public benefit” or “for the common good” so that the benefits are not exclusive of volunteers whose activities are of benefit to the environment or historic places, for instance. Comment There must be a reimbursement payment by another person for these provisions to be triggered. “Person” is defined in the Interpretation Act 1999 to include “a corporation sole, a body corporate, and an unincorporated body”. However, as the person making the reimbursement payment may not themselves receive the benefit of the volunteer’s activity, officials consider that the definition could be enhanced by also allowing for benefits that apply more generally to a community, rather than only to a person. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (37 – Inter-Church Working Party on Taxation) Members of the Working Party recommend a small addition to the definition of a volunteer’s activities to include in section CW 62B(4)(b)(ii) – “work improving the environment”. Comment Officials do not agree with this submission because it would narrow the scope of the definition of “volunteer”. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 17 Submission (24 – New Zealand Law Society, 62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) The definition of “volunteer” in proposed section CW 62B(4) should be amended to address the position of volunteers who have formal agreements governing their roles that refer to reimbursing allowances payable to them. Comment To be a volunteer for the purposes of the new rules, the definition of “volunteer” requires that a person freely undertakes an activity in New Zealand ... for which there is no purpose or intention of private pecuniary profit. The submissions are concerned that an agreement between an organisation and a volunteer that specifies in advance that the person may receive reimbursement payments could be construed to be in breach of that requirement. The ability for organisations to make reimbursement payments on the basis of a reasonable estimate of the amount of expenditure likely to be incurred was designed to provide flexibility for organisations and volunteers. A payment that reimburses expenditure incurred cannot provide a profit to the recipient. Research carried out towards the end of 2007 found that, on average, reimbursements paid to volunteers who participated covered only 4 percent of the costs incurred by them. One of the umbrella volunteer organisations that deals with the types of agreements referred to has advised that agreements are expressed in very general terms to cover the possibility that an organisation may, within the limits of its resources, endeavour to reimburse volunteers for their out-of-pocket expenses. However, it was considered highly unlikely that any organisation would commit in advance to an amount that would or might be paid. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) It is not clear what purpose is served by the first of the criteria, in section CW 62B(4)(b)(i), in relation to the activities of a volunteer. Comment The community and voluntary sector strongly advocated the adoption of a definition of “volunteer” that would align with examples proposed for the International Year of Volunteers, in 2001. Those examples all suggest freedom of choice in terms of when, where and to what organisations volunteers provide their services. The definition attempts to succinctly capture those ideas. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 18 Submission (6 – Volunteering Auckland, 9 – Rugby New Zealand 2011 Limited, 13 – New Zealand Federation of Voluntary Welfare Organisations, 19 – Volunteering New Zealand) Submissions are concerned about the restrictive nature of the requirement for a volunteer to be New Zealand-resident. They seek reassurance that tourists or others who are in New Zealand subject to the conditions of a temporary entry class visa will not be prevented from being reimbursed for actual costs incurred. Comment The conditions of temporary entry class visas, if applicable, would be contained in regulations made under the Immigration Act and is outside the scope of income tax legislation. Non-residents who earn New Zealand-sourced income are required, in accordance with sections 33A(2) and 33A(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, to furnish a return of income for a tax year. If a non-resident receives a reimbursement payment for their voluntary services, the payment must be declared as income and the expenditure incurred claimed as a deduction. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 19 FULL OR PARTIAL EXEMPTION FOR HONORARIA Submission (6 – Volunteering Auckland, 13 – New Zealand Federation of Voluntary Welfare Organisations, 19 – Volunteering New Zealand, 25 – Volunteering Canterbury, 32 – KPMG) Most of the submissions propose a partial exemption for honoraria, but one expresses disappointment that the government has not moved to treat honoraria as tax-exempt. Of those proposing a partial exemption, the range is from $500 to $5,000 a year. Comment Payments of honoraria are treated as income for tax purposes. They are paid not only to volunteers, but may also be paid to members of statutory and other bodies appointed by the Crown, and to board members and directors of private organisations. Payments of honoraria are treated as schedular payments – tax is deducted at source at 33 cents in the dollar. This is not a final tax. Under current rules, recipients of honoraria are required to file an income tax return and, if appropriate, claim a deduction for any expenses incurred in the production of the payment before their tax position can be finalised. The new rules will allow organisations to reimburse expenses separately so that volunteers gain an immediate benefit from the tax exemption. A partial tax exemption at a set level for honoraria would have to be implemented on a per volunteer per organisation basis as one organisation would not know what withholding tax was being deducted by another organisation. This could have the inequitable effect of increasing the total exemption available to individual volunteers to above that set level if they were receiving honoraria from more than one organisation. If a partial exemption for honoraria were set on a per volunteer basis it would also create resource-intensive and costly administrative problems for Inland Revenue. The fiscal cost of treating honoraria as fully or partially exempt from income tax, although difficult to quantify, would be significant, and could create broad behavioural changes to take advantage of the new rules, which would increase the fiscal cost. Such an exemption would create an undesirable precedent. It is therefore considered unfeasible to explore further in the current economic and fiscal environment. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 20 OTHER MATTERS RAISED Submission (6 – Volunteering Auckland) Consideration needs to be made for individual volunteers not “attached” to formal volunteer organisations. If \[the\] voluntary act is valuable to society and the labour is voluntary, the tax on transport and other items should be claimable as would be done if the task were carried out on a paid commercial basis. Comment Officials have spoken with Volunteering Auckland to clarify the submission’s intent. Individuals who carry out voluntary activities independent of any formal organisation are unable to claim any reimbursement of costs incurred. Volunteering Auckland is seeking a deduction against other income. Such costs would not meet the legal tests to be deductible for tax purposes. There could be a case for treating costs incurred in carrying out voluntary activities, where they cannot be reimbursed, as being equivalent to a cash “donation”. For this reason we recommend that this suggestion be further explored as part of the work on other tax incentives for encouraging a culture of generosity in New Zealand. Officials will report to Ministers on the most recent phase of that work in May 2009. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (6 – Volunteering Auckland) An alternative mechanism to fully achieve a “culture of giving” would be to fund charities so that they can fully reimburse the expenditure incurred by their volunteers. Comment Funding of voluntary sector organisations does not arise under any of the Revenue Acts. The proposal is therefore outside the scope of this bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 21 Submission (9 – Rugby New Zealand 2011 Limited) Low-value gifts, tokens or vouchers of appreciation should be incorporated within the tax exemption. Comment A similar submission was made by Rugby New Zealand 2011 Limited in response to the officials’ issues paper The tax treatment of honoraria and reimbursements paid to volunteers. The matter is not dealt with in the proposed amendments because in general, such items are not considered to be in the nature of “income” and therefore would not be included in the recipient’s taxable income. Therefore, they could not fall within the scope of the exemption for reimbursement of expenditure incurred by a volunteer. There have been discussions between officials and Rugby New Zealand 2011 Limited about the nature of the gifts that might be made to volunteers. Those discussions will be ongoing in the lead-up to the Rugby World Cup to achieve maximum possible certainty for volunteers in relation to the treatment of any gifts. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (25 – Volunteering Canterbury) Officials should use terms such as “involve” or “engage” when referring to the relationship between organisations and volunteers, as they more accurately describe the contribution that volunteers make than “use”. Comment The concern arose from the use in the explanatory note to the bill of the expression “volunteers and the organisations that use their services”. The term does not appear in the legislation. However, officials have noted the concern and will take it into account in the development of supporting documentation. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 22 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials consider that the proposed definition of “volunteer” in section CW 62B(4)(b)(iii) could operate to exclude a volunteer from the proposed tax exemption if the organisation making the reimbursement payment itself carries on a business for pecuniary profit. A simple modification of that part of the definition would resolve the potential difficulty. This can be done by making it clear there is to be no intention of private pecuniary profit for the volunteer. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (Matter raised by officials) As a consequence of clarifying the relationship between proposed section CW 62B(3) and existing section RD 8(3), officials noted a drafting oversight that had arisen in the rewrite of the Income Tax Act (the Income Tax Act 2007). The former legislation provided for a schedular payment to be reduced by the amount of a determination made by the Commissioner before calculating the amount of withholding tax. However, an equivalent provision was omitted from the Income Tax Act 2007. The oversight can be easily rectified by the introduction of a new subsection to section RD 11 that allows the Commissioner to reduce the amount of tax in prescribed circumstances. Recommendation That the submission be accepted.
