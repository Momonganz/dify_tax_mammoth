1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.7 (December 1994) Certifying NZ taxpayer as a taxable person in order to recover VAT refund from European Community Information needed by Inland Revenue in New Zealand Summary This item sets out the details that Inland Revenue needs in order to certify that a taxpayer is a taxable person. A taxpayer will need such a certificate to get a refund for VAT paid on goods and services in countries that are members of the European Community. Inland Revenue needs these details from a taxpayer who is seeking such a certificate: • the taxpayer’s name • the nature of the taxpayer’s activity • the address of the taxpayer’s establishment, central place of management, or place of abode • the taxpayer’s IRD number. Background - the European Community Directives The European Community (EC) has issued a series of directives which cover the taxation of the citizens of its territories. For VAT purposes, the directives require members of the EC to refund VAT to a “taxable person” in other EC member states and in non-member states. For the purposes of the EC directives, a taxable person is any person who carries on any economic activity in the form of a producer, trader, or supplier of services. These activities include mining and agricultural activi- ties and the activities of the professions. A taxable person must prove that he or she is a taxable person of a state by producing a certificate or letter from the official tax authority of that state which confirms these details: • that the person is carrying on an economic activity in that country • that the person is a registered taxpayer in that coun- try. A certificate or letter is effective for one year. European Directive 13 permits European countries to refund VAT to taxable persons who are established in countries outside the EC. This directive deems a person to be established outside the EC if that person does not have any of the following in the territory of the commu- nity: • A business or a fixed establishment from which business transactions are effected • A permanent address • A usual place of residence. Further, in order to qualify these are the only goods or services that the person may supply to the country of the EC: • transport services and ancillary services • services on which tax is payable solely by the recipi- ent. Information taxpayers need to supply to Inland Revenue If you want a letter from Inland Revenue to confirm that you are carrying on an economic activity, contact Taxpayer Services at your local Inland Revenue office. You will need to supply this information: • your name • the nature of your activity • the address of your establishment, or its central place of management, or your permanent residential address • your IRD number. Occasionally, Inland Revenue may have trouble certifying that an economic activity existed during the relevant period. If that happens, we may ask you to provide documents which show that you were running an economic activity, such as cashbooks, bank state- ments, insurance policies and/or ledgers. If you need further information on how to get a VAT refund from an EC country, ask your accountant or other tax adviser. 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.7 (December 1994) Details to be supplied to Inland Revenue when seeking a deduction for payments to spouse Summary This item states the Commissioner’s current policy on the information that a taxpayer must supply when he or she seeks to claim a deduction for payments made to a spouse. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1976. Legislation Section 106(1)(d) states that a taxpayer cannot claim a deduction for: (d) Payments of any kind made by a husband to his wife or by a wife to her husband: Provided that, with the consent of the Commissioner granted before the deduction is claimed by the taxpayer, and subject to section 97 of this Act, a deduction may be made in respect of any payment made by a husband to his wife or by a wife to her husband where the Commissioner is satisfied that the payment is for services rendered (not being domestic services or services performed in connection with the home) or is otherwise a bona fide payment, and that the payment was exclusively incurred in the production of the assessable income of the husband or wife, as the case may be, for the income year. In summary, all of these conditions must be met before the Commissioner will allow a deduction for a payment to a spouse: • The taxpayer must get the Commissioner’s permis- sion to claim a deduction before claiming it. • The payment must not be excessive - section 97 effectively allows the Commissioner to disallow so much of the deduction for wages as he considers exceeds a reasonable amount, having regard to the nature and extent of the services the spouse performs. • The payment must be for performing non-domestic services by the spouse, or otherwise be a bona fide payment. A deduction may be allowed for domestic services if the taxpayer is a farmer and the spouse cooks for permanent farm employees. Such a deduc- tion will only be allowed if the taxpayer complies with normal employer obligations. See page 5 of TIB Volume Six, No.1 (July 1994) for further information. • The taxpayer must incur the payment exclusively in the production of assessable income for the year. Policy Procedure To ascertain whether the payment meets the require- ments of section 106(1)(d), the Commissioner requires the taxpayer (or agent) to complete and sign a declara- tion which sets out these details: • the nature of the business in which the spouse is employed • precise details of the duties carried out by the spouse • the hours worked by the spouse during an average week and the number of weeks worked during the year • details of other labour employed by the taxpayer and amounts paid as wages • the method of payment to the spouse (e.g. cash at regular intervals or periodically, or by crediting an account) • the amount of wages to be paid to the spouse. If you want to find out how to make such a declaration, contact Taxpayer Services at your local Inland Revenue Office. Method of payment In most cases there must be an actual payment of wages to the spouse, rather than the crediting of an account. The essential consideration is that the spouse must have a say in the disposal or control of the wages. The crediting of an account will be acceptable if both of these conditions are met: • The spouse has control over the wages and consents to them being used in a certain way. • The spouse signs a statement which sets out how the wages will be paid and used, and submits this with the completed declaration (which is otherwise in order). In some cases the spouse may not be paid until after finishing the work, in order to tie in with cash flows. (This may be the case when the work is seasonal work.) So long as the payer complies with the other require- ments relating to the payment of a spouse this will probably not cause a problem. Excessive payments To determine whether a payment to a spouse is exces- sive, the Commissioner uses as a guide the current level of wages paid for comparable services in an arm’s length transaction. When to apply for approval The taxpayer must apply for approval before claiming for a deduction. The application may be for payments the taxpayer has actually made during the year or for payments the taxpayer will make in the future. Increase in spouse’s wages If the spouse’s wages increase because of an increase in duties or some other similar reason, the taxpayer will need to complete a further application for approval. 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.7 (December 1994) However, if the wage increase is because of a general wage increase in the particular occupation, the taxpayer won’t need to re-apply for approval. In this situation the taxpayer should note the reason on the return form. Taxpayer’s obligations The taxpayer must satisfy normal employer obligations if the Commissioner grants approval for the deduction. Specifically, the spouse must complete an IR 12 and the taxpayer must deduct PAYE (including ACC premi- ums) from the wages, and pay it to Inland Revenue. The taxpayer must actually pay the spouse a genuine wage on a regular basis (in the same manner as payments to other employees). Example 1 May employs her husband Jim to drive the delivery truck for her furniture business during his week- ends. She pays Jim market-rate gross wages of $120 per week. She deducts PAYE and ACC premiums and pays him by cheque at the end of each month. At the end of the income year, before filing her income tax return, May applies to the Commis- sioner for approval of the deduction of Jim’s wages. This approval is granted for these reasons: • The services which Jim performs are not domestic services, and May’s business incurs the payment exclusively in the production of assessable income. • May supplies the required details about Jim’s employment to Inland Revenue. • The payment is not excessive compared with the level of wages paid to people who perform similar services in an arm’s length transaction. May deducts the wages of $6,240 ($120 per week) from her income. Example 2 In the next income year Jim agrees to do the accounts for May’s business as well as the deliver- ies. May increases his gross wages to $800 per week because of the increase in his duties (market wages for the hours and duties performed by Jim are $400 per week). She does not get the Commissioner’s approval to deduct the increased payment before furnishing her income tax return. May deducts the full amount of the payments to Jim in her annual tax return. The extra deduction is not allowed because May did not receive the Commis- sioner’s approval before claiming the deduction. Even if May had applied for the Commissioner’s approval before increasing the payments it is likely that the full increase would not have been approved. This is because May’s payment to Jim is well above the market rate paid to an arm’s length employee. Section 97 states that the Commissioner can disallow so much of the deduction as he considers is excessive. GST and debt collection services Introduction This item states the Commissioner’s current policy on how goods and services tax (GST) applies to services provided by debt collection and other agencies. It deals specifically with these activities: • debt collection • credit reporting • mercantile activities such as process serving, investi- gations and tracing of debtors, and repossessions. The item also discusses how GST applies to legal services acquired by debt collection agencies. Such treatment will depend on whether the agency acquires the services as principal or as an agent of the person seeking to recover the debt. All legislative references in this item are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Legislation Section 14 provides that certain supplies are exempt from GST. Such exempt supplies include (under section 14(a)): The supply of any financial services (together with the supply of any other goods and services, supplied by the supplier of those financial services, which are reasonably incidental and necessary to that supply of financial services) ... Section 3(1) defines the term “financial services” to include: (ka)The payment or collection of any amount of interest, principal, dividend, or other amount whatever in respect of any debt security, equity security, participatory security, credit contract, contract of life insurance, superannuation scheme, or futures contract: (l) Agreeing to do, or arranging, any activities specified in paragraphs (a) to (ka) of this subsection, other than advising thereon. Policy Debt collection Services in relation to agreeing to or arranging the payment or collection of any outstanding debt constitute “financial services” under section 3(1)(ka) and (l), so they are exempt supplies under section 14(a) and not subject to GST. continued on page 4 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.7 (December 1994) debt. They are regarded as being reasonably incidental and necessary to the debt collection activity and part of the supply of financial services. However, if the services are undertaken in isolation, they are subject to GST. Mercantile activities Mercantile services are services generally undertaken as part of the debt collection process. In some instances, mercantile services do not relate to financial transac- tions and are undertaken in isolation. Investigation and document servicing in relation to matrimonial or criminal matters are examples. The following commen- tary discusses mercantile activities in relation to the credit industry. Process services This activity involves the serving of notices of legal proceedings on defendants or debtors in actions for the recovery of money. The service of debt recovery notices is a task that debt recovery agencies may either under- take themselves or contract out. When this activity is undertaken as part of the general debt recovery process (that is a client has engaged the agency to recover a debt) the service is part of a “finan- cial service” and is exempt from GST. The service is considered to be reasonably incidental and necessary under section 14(a) to the supply of financial services (being the collection of the debt). If the service is performed in isolation (that is, the agency or contractor is only instructed to serve the notice), the activity is taxable and the supply is subject to GST. Investigations and tracing of debtors This service involves the location of missing debtors by a person such as a mercantile agent, debt collector, or a licensed private investigator so that debt collection action can be commenced or legal documents served. When the location of a missing debtor is undertaken as part of the debt recovery process, the service is part of the financial service under section 3(1)(ka) and (l), and is therefore exempt. The service is regarded as being reasonably incidental and necessary to the collection of the debt under section 14(a). If the search for the debtor is undertaken in isolation (that is the agency is only instructed to locate a person), the service is subject to GST. Repossessions Repossessions are seizures by agents of credit cards or of chattels which are security for loan advances; they are generally performed by the agents for the lender or vendor of the chattels. When a debt collection agency is engaged to repossess property offered as security for a loan, the services constitute taxable supplies and are subject to GST. The services constitute the recovery of goods rather than the collection of debt. They are therefore beyond the scope of the term “financial services” in section 3(1)(ka) and (l). Any ancillary service charges relating to the repos- from page 3 Debt collection agencies often use legal services to arrange the collection of outstanding debts. Some debt collection agencies retain their own in-house legal staff. Others engage independent solicitors to undertake the necessary legal work. If the debt collection agency engages the services of an outside law firm, the debt collection agency generally passes those costs on to the client (that is, the person seeking to collect the debt) as disbursements. These legal services constitute taxable supplies by the law firm in the course of its taxable activity, so they are subject to GST. They are not “financial services” under the section 3 definition and are not exempt from GST. The outside law firm is providing a legal service, not arranging the collection of the debt. The debt collection agency is not the supplier of these services, so it cannot be said that it is supplying services that are “reasonably incidental and necessary” to the supply of financial services under section 14(a). A debt collection agency can act as agent or principal in acquiring the legal services from the outside law firm. TIB Volume 6, No. 1 (July 1994) at page 5 discusses how the GST Act applies to disbursements made by professional firms on behalf of their clients. The TIB item discusses the treatment of payments made by professional firms as agent and payments made as principal. The same treatment applies to debt collection agencies: • If the debt collection agency acts as a principal in receiving the supplies from the outside law firm, the debt collection agency cannot claim an input tax credit on the GST relating to the legal services. These services are not acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Rather, the services are acquired for the principal purpose of making exempt supplies of debt collection services. • If the debt collection agency is acting as the agent of its client, section 60(2) applies to deem the supply to have been made to the client. The client may deduct input tax on the supply if the client acquired the legal services for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. If the debt collection agency provides its own in-house legal services, the use of those services in collecting debts may form part of the supply of an exempt “finan- cial service”. However, if the debt collection agency receives specific instructions to provide legal services, as opposed to the general instruction to collect a debt, the supply of these legal services is subject to GST. This might include the situation in which the agency’s legal staff are engaged specifically to take court action in order to recover the debt. This ensures that the same treatment applies to both solicitors and debt collection agencies when only legal services are performed. Credit reporting Credit reporting involves the provision of certain financial and credit information upon which creditors assess credit applications. These services are exempt if they are provided to a client in the course of collecting a 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.7 (December 1994) session (such as tracing the debtor etc.) are also subject to GST. When an agency is engaged to repossess secured assets or chattels, and the debtor instead pays the outstanding debt, the service supplied by the agency is still subject to GST. The primary service provided by the agency is the repossession of the secured assets or chattels, rather than the collection of a payment. In other words, the repossession activity is not something which is reason- ably incidental and necessary to the supply of financial services (being the collection of the debt) within the terms of section 14(a). The agency is not arranging or agreeing to collect a debt, but is arranging or agreeing to repossess goods. Assessability of lump sum and pension payments made to employees and past employees Summary This item states the Commissioner’s current policy on the tax treatment of lump sum and pension payments that employers make to employees and past employees. The Commissioner’s policy is that all of these payments made in respect of employment are assessable, regard- less of whether they are made under a contract or voluntarily. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1976. Background Employers may pay pensions or lump sums to current or past employees. Some employers may choose to make payments which they are not required to pay under an employment contract. Employers and employees need to know whether these payments are assessable income. Legislation Section 65(2) lists amounts which are included in assessable income. Monetary remuneration is included under section 65(2)(b), and pensions under section 65(2)(j). “Monetary remuneration” is defined in sec- tion 2: “Monetary remuneration” means any salary, wage, allowance, bonus, gratuity, extra salary, compensation for loss of office or employment, emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer; ... “Salary or wages” is also defined in section 2. Amongst other things, it includes: (b)A periodic payment by way of superannuation, pension, retiring allowance, or other allowance or annuity in respect of or in relation to the past employment of that person or of any person of whom that person is or has been the wife or husband or a child or dependant; and... (bb) An ex gratia payment that is a pension within the meaning of section 65(1B) of this Act; ... The section 65(1B) meaning of “pension” includes any payment which a taxpayer receives from any person for whom the taxpayer (or certain family members of the taxpayer) has rendered past services if, in the Commis- sioner’s opinion, the payment would not have been made if those past services had not been rendered. Policy The definitions of “monetary remuneration”, “salary or wages”, and “pension” within the meaning of section 65(1B) include lump sums and pensions in respect of or in relation to employment. A lump sum or pension payment made by an employer to an employee in respect of or in relation to employment is monetary remunera- tion or a pension within the definition of those terms, and is assessable to the recipient under sections 65(2)(b) or 65(2)(j) respectively. The Commissioner’s view is that it makes no difference whether the employer pays the lump sum or pension payment voluntarily or under a contract. If the payment is made in respect of or in relation to employment, it is assessable. Similarly, it makes no difference if the employee is a current or past employee, or if the services are provided to someone other than the employer. If an employer makes a lump sum or pension payment in respect of or in relation to an employment relationship, the payment is assessable. Example Agnes worked for a church for 20 years. The church rules enable a committee of church members to pay a pension to retired church workers. Pensions are paid at the discretion of the committee and no employee can regard the pension as an entitlement. The committee’s rules state that each case is considered on its merits, and payment of a pension to one retired worker does not establish a precedent for any other worker. When Agnes retired she was granted a pension until death. The committee considered Agnes’ length of service made her deserving of a pension. The pension is assessable. It is monetary remunera- tion because it is paid in respect of or in relation to Agnes’s employment with the church. It makes no difference that the pension was paid at the discre- tion of the committee. 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.7 (December 1994) Revocation of qualifying company election - payment of qualifying company election tax Summary This item outlines how the legislation dealing with the revocation of qualifying company status affects the payment of qualifying company election tax (QCET). Generally, to remove a company’s QCET liability, the shareholders or directors of the company must revoke their qualifying company election before the end of the income year in which QCET is payable. An exception applied when companies became qualify- ing companies under the transitional provisions in the 1992-93 income year. The transitional provisions allowed such companies to delay paying QCET until the 1993/94 income year. A revocation of qualifying company status made in that income year was too late to remove the QCET liability. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1976. Background The qualifying company regime applies from the 1992/93 income year. It allows closely held companies and their shareholders to be treated in a similar way to partnerships for tax purposes. Legislation The legislation governing the qualifying company regime is contained in sections 393 to 393U. The transitional provisions are contained in sections 393S to 393U. We haven’t quoted the legislation in this item; our intention is to outline how relevant parts of the legislation apply. Application To become a qualifying company, a company must first meet the requirements of the qualifying company regime. (For full details of requirements see the Qualify- ing Companies Guide - IR 4PB - or items in TIBs Volume Three, No.7 (April 1992) and Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992)). Secondly, all the directors of the company and all shareholders who are sui juris (of legal capacity) must make written elections. The shareholders must also elect to be personally liable for a share of the income tax payable by the qualifying company. However, a majority shareholder can elect that a company becomes a qualify- ing company (but not a loss attributing qualifying company) on behalf of any minority shareholder and bear that shareholder’s liability. Effective date of election to become a qualifying company An existing company’s election to become a qualifying company takes effect on the first day of the income year following the income year in which the Commissioner receives the election, unless a later income year is chosen in the election. However, if the election is made in the first income year in which a company is required to file a tax return, the company can choose for the election to take effect from the start of that income year. Payment of QCET When an existing company becomes a qualifying company, it becomes liable to pay QCET. Any QCET payable is due by the terminal tax due date for the income year before the income year in which the election to become a qualifying company took effect. This means QCET is payable in the year the company becomes a qualifying company. QCET is charged at 33% and calculated by applying the QCET formula. (See IR 4PB booklet or TIBs Volume Three, No.7 (April 1992) and Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) for full details.) The application of the formula is similar to a notional winding up of the company. Example Small Co has a 31 March balance date. Small Co’s shareholders and directors elect on 4 March 1994 for it to become a qualifying company. The election takes effect from 1 April 1994, the beginning of the company’s 1994-95 income year. Any QCET payable is due by 7 February 1995, the terminal tax date for the company’s 1993-94 income year. Voluntary revocation of qualifying company election If a qualifying company wants to cease being a qualify- ing company, the initial election made to become a qualifying company has to be revoked. The election can be revoked voluntarily by the directors or the sharehold- ers. A voluntary revocation of an election to become a qualifying company takes effect from the first day of the income year in which the Commissioner receives it (unless a later income year is specified). 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.7 (December 1994) Deemed revocation of qualifying company election A deemed revocation of an election occurs by default if a company no longer meets the qualifying company requirements or there if is a specified change in the ownership structure or status of shareholders. A deemed revocation generally takes effect from the first day of the income year in which the event generating the deemed revocation occurred. However, any deemed shareholder revocation is given a period of grace before it takes effect. The period of grace is 12 months in the case of the death of a shareholder, and 63 days in all other cases. This period gives the shareholders time to take action to prevent the loss of the qualifying company status. Effect of revocation on QCET liability A revocation made at any time before the end of the income year in which QCET is payable normally removes a company’s QCET liability. This occurs because the effect of the revocation is that the company becomes a non-qualifying company throughout the income year in which the revocation was made. If such a revocation is made after QCET has been paid, the QCET must be refunded. Example Small Co became a qualifying company from the beginning of the 1994-95 income year and has to pay its QCET by 7 February 1995. On 13 January 1995 Small Co’s shareholders realise the company does not have enough money to pay its QCET and revoke their election. Small Co has its liability for QCET cancelled and is treated as an ordinary company for the 1994-95 income year. Transitional provisions The transitional provisions that applied to qualifying companies in the 1992-93 income year allowed elections to take effect earlier and the payment of QCET to be delayed. Qualifying company elections that were made by 31 March 1993 could take effect from the beginning of the 1992-93 income year, unless a later year was specified. However, the QCET resulting from an early election did not have to be paid until the 1992-93 terminal tax date (7 February 1994 for most balance dates). Once the 1993-94 income year had started it was, therefore, too late for the directors or shareholders to cancel QCET by revoking their election. Revocations made during an income year can take effect only from the first day of that income year. Because extra time was allowed for the payment of QCET, interest was charged at the specified rate (6%) from the third 1992-93 provisional tax payment date (7 March 1993 for a March balance date) until the earlier of the date QCET was paid or the 1992-93 terminal tax date. QCET payable for the 1992-93 income year was also calculated at a concessional rate of 7.5% rather than 33%. Example On 10 March 1993 the shareholders and directors of Tight Co elected that it become a qualifying company. This election took effect from 1 April 1992. QCET and interest accrued from 7 March 1993 were payable by 7 February 1994. On 14 January 1994 the directors realised Tight Co had insufficient money to pay its QCET and revoked their election. However, the revocation could only take effect from 1 April 1993. Tight Co’s QCET liability could not be cancelled because it had been a qualifying company during the 1992-93 income year. Penalties Unpaid QCET is treated as unpaid terminal tax for the purpose of calculating penalties. An initial penalty of 10 percent applies if QCET is not paid by the due date. A further penalty of 10 percent of the total amount outstanding is added every six months while any amount remains unpaid. Forms to be filed To revoke a qualifying company election voluntarily, the directors or shareholders must fill out the IR 4PR “Revocation of Qualifying Company Election” form and return it to the Commissioner. If a company is a loss attributing qualifying company, the IR 4PA “Revocation of Loss Attributing Qualifying Company Election” form is required instead. To revoke a foreign loss election only, section two of the IR 4PF “Foreign Loss Election/Revocation” form must be returned. 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.7 (December 1994) GST general time of supply rules - receipt of deposits Summary This item states the Commissioner’s current policy on how the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 applies when a supplier receives a payment for the supply of goods and services. It discusses the correct taxable period in which to account for GST. It also discusses the effect of a deposit being held by a stakeholder. A stakeholder may hold a deposit until it is determined whether the supplier or the recipient of a supply is entitled to finally receive it. A supply of goods and services is deemed to be made when the supplier or the recipient issues an invoice, or when the supplier receives any payment for the supply, whichever is the earlier. When an invoice has not been issued for the supply, the supply is deemed to be made on the date that the supplier receives any payment. Payment includes the receipt of a deposit. If a stakeholder receives a deposit, this is not considered to be receipt of the payment by the supplier. All legislative references in this item are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Background We have been asked to clarify the requirement for a supplier of goods and services to account for GST charged on supplies made, when that supplier has received only a deposit for the supply. There is some confusion as to how much GST (if any) should be accounted for when the supplier has not received full payment, or when the supply has not physically been made. A registered person must charge GST (output tax) on taxable supplies of goods and services made to other people. A recipient of goods and services is charged GST (input tax) on taxable supplies received - for example, purchases and day to day operating expenses. A registered person must account for the output tax attributable to a taxable period when filing a GST return for that period. Any input tax attributable to that period is deductible from the output tax, provided the goods and services are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. The amount of output tax still remaining after deducting any input tax is payable to Inland Revenue by the last working day of the month following the taxable period. If the amount of input tax exceeds the output tax, Inland Revenue will refund the difference. Legislation Section 9(1) sets out the general time of supply rule for GST purposes. It states: Subject to this Act, for the purposes of this Act a supply of goods and services shall be deemed to take place at the earlier of the time an invoice is issued by the supplier or the recipient or the time any payment is received by the supplier, in respect of that supply. Subsections (2), (3), (6), and (7) of section 9 set out time of supply rules for special circumstances. Section 20(4) determines when to account for output tax charged. In summary, persons who use the invoice basis or the hybrid basis must attribute the full output tax on a supply to the taxable period in which the supply is deemed to be made. Persons who use the payments basis must account for output tax on each payment they receive in the taxable period in which they receive it. Section 20(3) determines when to account for input tax. In summary, persons who use the invoice basis can claim input tax in the taxable period in which the supply is deemed to be made to them. Persons who use the payments basis or the hybrid basis can claim input tax on each payment they make in the taxable period in which they make the payments. Section 20(3) also contains a proviso which allows a recipient of a supply of goods and services to attribute the input tax deduction to a later taxable period. Policy Time of supply A supply of goods and services is deemed to take place when the supplier or the recipient issues an invoice, or when the supplier receives any payment for the supply, whichever is the earlier. The supply is deemed to be made on this date regardless of when the supply is physically made. Deposit received by supplier When the supplier receives a deposit before an invoice is issued, the goods and services are deemed to be supplied in full on that date. Section 9(1) refers to any payment the supplier receives. This includes a part payment of the purchase price by way of a deposit. There is no requirement that the supplier receives all of the purchase price. This principle is supported by the judgments in Case L67 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,391; Case N24 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,199; and Case R11 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,062. Deposit received by stakeholder A stakeholder may receive a deposit in terms of a conditional contract between the supplier and the recipient, and hold it until it is determined who is entitled to finally receive it. A stakeholder can be used in the supply of any type of goods and services, and is particularly common in the buying and selling of real estate. When a stakeholder holds a deposit, the supplier is not considered to have received the payment until it is applied to his or her 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.7 (December 1994) benefit. The payment is considered to have been applied to the supplier’s benefit when any of these events occurs: • The payment is paid to the supplier. • The payment is paid to the supplier’s agent. • The payment is credited against amounts owing by the supplier, for example legal fees or real estate agents’ commissions. If the supplier’s agent acts as the stakeholder and holds the deposit, payment is considered to have been received by the supplier when the contract becomes uncondi- tional. The Commissioner accepts that the supplier’s agent can act as a stakeholder while the contract is still conditional. However, when the contract becomes unconditional, the agent is no longer holding the deposit as stakeholder, but rather as agent for the supplier. The circumstances of each case will determine whether the supplier’s agent is acting as a stakeholder. The Commissioner considers that the supplier of the goods and services cannot act as stakeholder. A stakeholder must be an independent third party. Example 1 Interior Covers Ltd is a wallpaper retailer and hanger. It is registered for GST on the invoice basis, and files GST returns monthly. The company waits until it has finished hanging the wallpaper before it issues the customer with an invoice. However, a deposit of 10% is required from the customer before work begins. During July, Interior Covers Ltd receives orders from 10 customers to supply and hang wallpaper to the value of $7,000 each. The total value of the orders is $70,000 including GST. Deposits of $700 each are received from the 10 customers. The wallpaper is not physically supplied during July. GST Treatment Supplies of wallpaper to the customers who paid deposits are deemed to be made on the date the deposits are received. As the company is registered on the invoice basis of accounting, it must account to Inland Revenue for the full amount of output tax charged on the supplies. The company’s July GST return must include the following output tax details: Total value of supplies deemed to have been made: $70,000 GST accountable (one-ninth)$7777.77 Example 2 Reece Eaver repairs home satellite-dishes. He is registered on the payments basis, and files GST returns monthly. During May, Reece agrees to repair Mrs Scott’s satellite-dish for a fee of $300. She pays Reece a deposit of $50 on 14 May. Reece completes the job and returns the dish together with an invoice before the end of May, requesting payment of the balance of $250. Mrs Scott pays the balance in full on 20 June. GST Treatment When Reece receives the deposit on 14 May, the supply of his repair services to Mrs Scott is deemed to be made. As Reece is registered on the payments basis of accounting, he is only required to account to Inland Revenue for the output tax actually received on the supply. In addition to any other output tax received in May, Reece should include the $5.55 output tax (one-ninth of $50) received from Mrs Scott in his May GST return. Reece should include output tax of $27.78 (one-ninth of $250) received from Mrs Scott in his June GST return. Example 3 Rob LeBaron develops inner city apartments for sale, and is registered for GST purposes. On 1 November, a conditional contract to supply an apartment for $200,000 is signed between Rob and Graeme, who wants to purchase an apartment as his residence. Graeme pays a deposit of $20,000 to Rob’s real estate agent on 1 November. The real estate agent holds the deposit as stakeholder until the contract becomes unconditional on 5 December. No amounts are credited towards the agent’s commission before that date. Rob accounts for GST on an invoice basis and files his GST returns monthly. He has asked when he should return the output tax on the sale. Although the real estate agent is also Rob’s agent, the Commissioner considers that the deposit is not applied to Rob’s benefit until the contract becomes unconditional on 5 December. Rob is considered to have received the payment on 5 December, as from that point the payment is held by the real estate agent in the capacity of Rob’s agent, and not in the capacity of a stakeholder. As Rob accounts for GST on an invoice basis, he is required to account for the full amount of output tax charged on the supply in his GST return for the month of December. This amounts to one-ninth of $200,000, i.e., $22,222.22. 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.7 (December 1994) Gift duty - exemption for maintenance or education of relatives Section 72, Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 Summary This item discusses the general approach that the Commissioner takes when applying section 72 of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. Section 72 provides an exemption from gift duty for gifts made for the mainte- nance or education of relatives. The Commissioner must be satisfied that the gift is not excessive in amount, having regard to the legal or moral obligation of the donor to provide the maintenance or means of education. Each particular gift and its sur- rounding circumstances will be considered when deciding whether section 72 applies. However, the following general points can be made about applying section 72: • The exemption applies to gifts of money as well as gifts of other property: • The exemption can apply to gifts made to trusts as well as gifts made directly to a relative. Gifts of single capital amounts to a trust can qualify for the exemp- tion. • “Maintenance” includes everything a person requires to maintain his or her particular lifestyle. Factors such as the relationship of the parties, their wealth and position, and the environment to which they are accustomed are all relevant. • “Education” means the process involving the study of certain subjects by way of systematic teaching, training, instruction or research leading to an increase in a person’s store of knowledge and/or qualifications. • “Relative” has a wide meaning and extends to rela- tionships outside of the immediate family. • Whether a gift is excessive will largely depend on the donor’s moral obligations. Whether the donor owes a moral duty to the recipient of the gift depends on such factors as the wealth of the donor, the donor’s posi- tion in the community, the nature and circumstances of the family, the recipient’s age, state of health and financial position, and the character and conduct of the recipient. The moral duty owed to a spouse is different to that owed to children. • Moral obligations may change over time as social attitudes change. This will influence the application of section 72. All legislative references in this item are to the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 unless otherwise stated. Legislation Section 72 states: Where the Commissioner is satisfied that any gift is made for or towards the maintenance of the wife, husband, or any relative of the donor, or for or towards the education of any such relative, and is not excessive in amount, having regard to the legal or moral obligation of the donor to provide that maintenance or means of education, the gift shall not consti- tute a dutiable gift. Background Section 61 imposes gift duty on every dutiable gift. Section 63 states that a dutiable gift shall include and consist of: (a) All the property, wherever situated, comprised in any gift made by any donor to any donee, where the donor is domiciled in New Zealand at the date of the gift, or is a body corporate incorporated in New Zealand: (b) All the property, situated in New Zealand, comprised in any gift made by any donor to any donee, where the donor is domiciled out of New Zealand at the date of the gift, or is a body corporate incorporated out of New Zealand. Section 72 excludes certain gifts from gift duty even though the gifts would otherwise constitute a dutiable gift. For a gift to be exempted from gift duty under section 72, the Commissioner must be “satisfied” that certain requirements are met. These requirements are that: • The gift is made for the maintenance or education of a wife, husband or relative of the donor. • The gift is not excessive in amount having regard to the legal or moral obligation of the donor to provide that maintenance or means of education. There are two main points to make about these require- ments. Firstly, the donor’s legal or moral obligation must be considered. This means that the particular circumstances surrounding each gift must be consid- ered. Whether or not a gift constitutes maintenance depends on the nature of the legal or moral obligations of a particular donor. What may constitute a legal or moral obligation for one donor may not constitute a legal or moral obligation for another donor. Secondly, the words used in the section, such as “legal or moral obligation” and “excessive in amount”, are terms whose meaning changes and develops over time. Section 72 is a “living” piece of legislation. This means that there can be no definitive interpretation of the terms used. Notwithstanding the above points, some guidance can be provided as to the Commissioner’s general approach under section 72. The Commissioner can also provide some indication as to how specific terms will be inter- preted and whether particular circumstances fall within the section. 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.7 (December 1994) Guidelines Exemption when gift made to trust rather than directly to relative The exemption can apply to gifts made to trusts rather than directly to a relative. Section 72 speaks in terms of “any gift made for or toward the maintenance ...” of the relative. The section does not require that the donor make the gift directly to the relative. However, when a gift is made to a trust, it should be clear that the donor’s relatives are the beneficiaries and that the gift is for the maintenance or education of these beneficiaries. Gifts of single capital amounts to a trust can qualify for the exemption under section 72 if the gift is made for or towards the maintenance or education of a relative and the gift is not excessive in amount (having regard to the donor’s legal and moral obligations). Types of gifts to which section 72 applies “Gift” is defined in section 2(2) as follows: “Gift” means any disposition of property, wherever and however made, otherwise than by will, without fully adequate consideration in money or money’s worth passing to the person making the disposition: Provided that where the consideration in money or money’s worth is inadequate, the disposition shall be deemed to be a gift to the extent of that inadequacy only. A gift can therefore be any form of property. Money, housing, jewellery, and antiques are all examples of gifts that may qualify for the exemption under section 72. Meaning of “maintenance” The Commissioner will take into account the facts of each particular case to determine what is reasonable maintenance in the surrounding circumstances. Mainte- nance means more than merely what is needed to provide the necessities of life. Maintenance also in- cludes everything that a relative requires to maintain his or her lifestyle. In particular, the Commissioner will consider facts such as: • the relationship of the parties • the wealth and position of the parties • the environment to which the parties are accustomed. What amounts to maintenance will vary from case to case depending on a consideration of the above factors. Meaning of “education” The Commissioner interprets “education” as the process involving the study of certain subjects by way of system- atic teaching, training, instruction or research with the aim of increasing a person’s store of knowledge and/or qualifications. Schooling in primary, secondary and tertiary institu- tions will meet the definition of education. Other methods of gaining education will also meet the defini- tion of education if the methods involve the study of certain areas in a systematic way. Meaning of “relative of the donor” “Relative” is not defined in the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 and therefore takes on its ordinary meaning. The term has a very wide meaning and can include quite distant relatives and people connected by marriage rather than just blood relatives. Section 2(3) provides some guidance as to whether people have a relationship with each other, although the term “relative” is not limited to those discussed in that section. Section 2(3) states: For the purposes of this Act - (a) Persons are connected by blood relationship if within the fourth degree of relationship: (b) Persons are connected by marriage if one is married to the other or to a person who is connected by blood relation- ship to the other: (c) Persons are connected by adoption if one has been adopted as the child of the other or as the child of a person who is within the third degree of relationship to the other: (d) Illegitimate relationship shall be equivalent to legitimate relationship. The term “relative” extends to relationships outside the immediate family, but the greater the “distance” of the relatives the less likely it is that there is a moral obliga- tion on the donor to make a gift. Similarly, there is less likely to be an obligation towards an adult relative compared with a relative who is still “under age”. Meaning of “not excessive in amount, having regard to the legal or moral obli- gation of the donor to provide that main- tenance or means of education” Legal obligations Legal duties owed to family members are limited and few. Examples of legal duties owed to provide mainte- nance and education are: 1. In relation to spouses, section 63(1) of the Family Proceedings Act 1980 imposes a duty for each spouse to maintain the other “to the extent that such maintenance is necessary to meet the reasonable needs of the other party, where the other party cannot practicably meet the whole or any part of those needs” because of the effects of a limited number of circumstances. These circumstances are: •The division of marital functions •Custodial arrangements for any child of the marriage after the parties cease to live together •A physical or mental disability •An inability to obtain work •The undertaking of a reasonable period of education or training. continued on page 12 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.7 (December 1994) • The character and conduct of the recipient • Any special needs of the recipient, such as those associated with a disability. In addition to the above factors, a donor’s moral obligations could also be influenced by the donor’s ethnic and cultural background. Note that under the Family Protection Act, the Courts interpret the moral duty of a testator differently depend- ing on whether a spouse or child is involved. The moral duty to spouses stems from their undertaking to support each other when they marry. Therefore, the courts expect a husband or wife to provide for his or her spouse to enable the spouse to live in the style he or she has become accustomed to, without anxiety about present or future needs. However, the reasoning in relation to children is different. The Courts tend to interpret parents’ moral duty to their children as a duty to nurture and educate them to enable them to become productive members of society. This duty is regarded as ending when children become self-supporting. This will usually be when the children complete their education and no longer look to their parents for financial support. For Family Protec- tion Act purposes, a parent’s moral duty may extend beyond the stage when the child is self-supporting, but this duty relates to an obligation to leave a child a “fair share” of the estate and is not relevant for gift duty purposes. Therefore, it can be concluded that a parent’s moral duty to provide maintenance and education to his or her children ceases when the child becomes finan- cially independent. Payments excessive in amount Unless they are providing only for the necessaries of life, most gifts are likely to be excessive in amount if regard is had only to the legal obligations of the donor. Because of the limited extent of legal duties owed between family members, the extent of any moral duty is likely to be the most important consideration in decid- ing whether a gift is excessive in amount. Whether a payment is excessive will depend on the extent of the legal and moral obligations and the particular circumstances of a case. A gift of a large capital amount does not in itself mean a gift is excessive in amount. This will depend on the obligations of the donor and the purpose for which the gift is given. Note that changing social attitudes will influence the existence and extent of moral duties. This in turn will influence what amounts are considered to be excessive. No part of any gift that is excessive in amount can qualify for the exemption under section 72. The exemp- tion cannot be given for that part of the gift that is not excessive. In considering the reasonable needs of each spouse, the standard of living of the household is disre- garded, unless there are “special circumstances”. 2. In relation to children, section 152 of the Crimes Act 1961 imposes a legal duty on parents to provide the necessaries for any child under the age of 16. Section 14 of the Children Young Persons and their Families Act 1989 imposes duties on parents, albeit in a negative way, by providing that the State will step in when a certain threshold of harm to a child is reached. Section 20 of the Education Act 1989 imposes a duty on parents to ensure that their children attend school. 3. There appears to be no legislative requirement imposing a legal duty on people (while they are alive) to provide maintenance and education for their parents or any other members of their extended family. Moral obligations Determining the moral obligations of a particular donor is a subjective judgment because the duties are unique to each individual. There is no case law that assists in the interpretation of “moral obligations” in the context of section 72. The Family Protection Act 1955 and related case law does provide some indication as to what constitutes a moral obligation and can be used as a “benchmark” in the context of section 72. The Family Protection Act 1955 applies when a de- ceased person does not adequately provide for the proper maintenance and support of certain persons. The Court looks to whether there has been a breach of some moral duty owed by the deceased person. In Allardice v Allardice (1910) 19 NZLR 959, 973, Justice Edwards stated that the Court is required “to place itself in all respects in the position of the testator, and to consider whether or not, having regard to all existing facts and circumstances, the testator has been guilty of a breach of \[that\] moral duty”. The courts have identified a number of factors to take into account when considering whether the deceased owed a moral duty to a particular applicant. Considera- tions relevant to section 72 of the Act include: • The wealth of the donor (including both income and capital sources) and the donor’s position in the community • The nature and circumstances of the family, for example, the style of living to which the recipient of the gift is accustomed • The recipient’s age, state of health and financial position from page 11 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.7 (December 1994) GST - zero-rating of goods sold to persons departing NZ Summary This item sets out the GST treatment of goods sold in New Zealand to tourists and other persons departing from New Zealand. The item discusses six categories of goods that can be zero-rated: 1. goods sold to departing travellers by any shop operating in the Customs-controlled area of an airport, unless the goods are normally intended to be used within that area 2. goods sold to a customer before the customer leaves New Zealand, when the supplier delivers the goods to the Customs-controlled area of the airport, provided the customer does not take possession of the goods at any time outside the Customs-controlled area 3. goods sold to persons departing by sea, when the purchaser does not have access to the goods at any time before the ship has left the final New Zealand port 4. goods sold by a supplier licensed as an export warehouse, when the supplier has been licensed by the Comptroller of Customs to operate a sealed bag system 5. goods posted or couriered overseas by the supplier 6. goods sold by shops licensed as export warehouses which operate within the Customs-controlled part of an international airport, when the goods are sold to departing travellers who uplift the goods when they return to New Zealand. In each case the supplier must keep sufficient informa- tion, as outlined in this item, to provide evidence for the zero-rating claim. All legislative references in this item are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. Background Generally speaking, a GST registered person must charge GST on all supplies of goods made in New Zealand. This means that the registered person must charge GST on the supply of goods to a purchaser, even though the purchaser may be departing from New Zealand at some time in the near future. Purchasers cannot recover the GST charged on such supplies unless they are registered for GST purposes and the goods are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Purchasers cannot obtain a refund of GST paid on goods purchased in New Zealand when they leave the country. However, there are some situations in which the supply of goods to persons departing from New Zealand can be charged with GST at the rate of zero percent. The legislative authority for zero-rating the supply of goods in these cases is found in paragraphs (a) to (af) of section 11(1). In each of the cases in which the supply of goods may be zero-rated the supplier must retain sufficient information to support the zero-rating claim. Legislation Section 11(1) states: Where, but for this section, a supply of goods would be charged with tax under section 8 of this Act, any such supply shall be charged at the rate of zero percent where - (a)The supplier has entered the goods for export, pursuant to the Customs Act 1966, and those goods have been exported by the supplier; or (aa)The goods have been deemed to be entered for export, pursuant to the Customs Act 1966, and the goods have been exported by the supplier; or (ab)The supplier has satisfied the Commissioner that the goods have been exported by the supplier to a place outside New Zealand; or (ac) Subject to subsection (1B) of this section, the supplier will enter the goods for export, pursuant to the Customs Act 1966, in the course of, or as a condition of, making the supply and will export the goods; or (ad)Subject to subsection (1B) of this section, the goods will be deemed to be entered for export, pursuant to the Customs Act 1966, and exported by the supplier in the course of, or as a condition of, making the supply; or (ae)Subject to subsection (1D) of this section, the goods are supplied by a supplier licensed, pursuant to section 82 of the Customs Act 1966, as an export warehouse, and - (i) The supplier has been licensed by the Comptroller to operate a sealed bag system; and (ii)The goods are supplied in accordance with the sealed bag system; and (iii)The goods are entered, or are deemed to be entered, for export pursuant to the Customs Act 1966; or (af) The goods are supplied, by a supplier licensed pursuant to section 82 of the Customs Act 1966 as an export warehouse, to - (i) An inbound air traveller; or (ii) An outbound air traveller who uplifts the goods upon returning to New Zealand - within an area licensed pursuant to section 32 of the Customs Act 1966 as a Customs examining place for the Customs processing of international air travellers at an international airport; Policy The supply of goods may be zero-rated in the following circumstances. In every case, it is important that the supplier retains the evidence outlined in this item. If the evidence is not retained, the goods sold will be subject to GST at the standard rate of 12.5 percent. continued on page 14 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.7 (December 1994) 2. Goods sold to a customer before the customer leaves New Zealand, when the supplier delivers the goods to the Cus- toms-controlled area of the airport, pro- vided the customer does not take posses- sion of the goods at any time outside the Customs-controlled area The supply of goods can be zero-rated under section 11(1)(ab) if the supplier satisfies the Commissioner that the supplier exported the goods to a place outside New Zealand. The Commissioner accepts that the supplier exports goods for the purposes of section 11(1)(ab) if the supplier delivers the goods to a place which is very close to the departing aircraft, and if the purchaser of the goods has no practical choice but to take the goods out of New Zealand. This place is the restricted area of the airport controlled by Customs. The customer must not have access to the goods outside the restricted area at any time. If the customer does have access to the goods outside the restricted area, the Commissioner would not be satisfied that the supplier had exported the goods. The goods are subject to GST at the standard rate of 12.5 percent. The supplier must keep enough evidence to show that the goods were sold to a person departing overseas in the near future at the time of the sale. An example of such evidence is a photocopy of the purchaser’s airline ticket detailing the purchaser’s name, flight number and destination as well as a record of the purchaser’s address (whether it is a New Zealand or an overseas address). The supplier must also have proof that the goods were delivered to the Customs-controlled part of the airport, for example, a courier invoice or some documentation obtained from Customs. If the supplier does not keep this evidence, the vendor is liable for the GST at the standard rate of 12.5 percent. 3. Goods sold to persons departing by sea, when the purchaser does not have access to the goods at any time until the ship has left the final New Zealand port The supply of goods may be zero-rated under section 11(1)(ab). The supplier must have an evidence-keeping system which shows that the supplier sold goods to a person departing from New Zealand, and that the person did not have access to the goods until the ship had sailed from the final New Zealand port. For exam- ple, it would be acceptable if the supplier records the purchaser’s name and address (whether it is a New Zealand or an overseas address) and the ship’s name and departure date as well as obtaining a written undertaking from the ship’s purser that the purchaser will not have access to the goods purchased until the ship has left the final New Zealand port. The undertak- ing may be in a form produced by the supplier and then signed by the purser, or in a form produced by the purser. 1. Goods sold to departing travellers by any shop operating in the Customs- controlled area of an airport, unless the goods are normally intended to be used within that area The supply of goods can be zero-rated under section 11(1)(ab) if the supplier satisfies the Commissioner that the supplier exported the goods to a place outside New Zealand. Taking a narrow approach, it could be argued that it is the purchaser rather than the supplier who exports the goods because the purchaser physically takes the goods out of New Zealand. However, the Commis- sioner accepts that the supplier can be said to have exported the goods to a place outside New Zealand if the supplier is selling goods at a place that can only be entered by people who are imminently about to board an aircraft out of New Zealand. In this situation the purchaser has no practical choice but to take the goods out of New Zealand. To qualify for zero-rating, the shop must be in the area of the airport controlled by Customs (“the restricted area”), i.e. the part of the airport that only those people who have passed through Customs and are about to fly out of New Zealand can enter. A shop that operates in the general public access area (“the unrestricted area”) of an international airport is not able to zero-rate goods sold as discussed under this category, although they may be able to zero-rate goods under categories 2 or 5. If a shop is accessible only to those people who have passed through Customs, the Commissioner accepts that all goods sold can be zero-rated unless the goods are normally intended to be used or consumed within the restricted area. Examples of goods that are normally used or consumed within the restricted area include most food and beverage items sold by fast food outlets, cafes, restaurants, and bars. The Commissioner will allow the zero-rating of items that are reasonably capable of being used or consumed outside New Zea- land. Examples of items that are reasonably capable of being used or consumed outside New Zealand include newspapers, camera film and food items such as chew- ing gum and chocolate bars. If a shop has a frontage or counter opening into the unrestricted area as well as a frontage or counter opening into the restricted area, only those goods supplied to customers in the restricted area can be zero- rated. In this case the shop must have a system to obtain sufficient evidence to show that a person about to leave New Zealand purchased the goods. For example, it would be acceptable if the supplier obtains a photocopy of the purchaser’s airline ticket detailing the purchas- er’s name, flight number, and destination as well as recording the purchaser’s address (whether it is a New Zealand or an overseas address). If the supplier does not keep enough evidence to show that a person about to leave New Zealand purchased the goods, the supplier must account for GST at the standard rate of 12.5 per- cent. from page 13 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.7 (December 1994) 4. Goods sold by a supplier licensed as an export warehouse, when the supplier has been licensed by the Comptroller of Customs to operate a sealed bag system Section 11(1)(ae) provides for the zero-rating of goods under a sealed bag system. This section applies only to a supplier licensed as an export warehouse under section 82 of the Customs Act 1966, and when these three conditions are met: • The supplier has been licensed by the Comptroller of Customs to operate a sealed bag system. • The goods are supplied in accordance with the sealed bag system. • The goods are entered, or deemed to be entered for export pursuant to the Customs Act 1966. Section 11(1)(ae) only applies in the circumstances outlined above. A supplier cannot zero-rate goods using sealed bags if it is not licensed as an export warehouse and/or is not licensed to operate a sealed bag system by the Comptroller of Customs. It has come to Inland Revenue’s attention that some suppliers who are not licensed export warehouses are zero-rating the supply of goods under “unofficial” sealed bag systems. The suppliers are selling goods to customers and providing the goods to customers in a sealed bag that is taken by the customer through Customs. The supplier cannot zero-rate the supply of goods when the customer has access to the goods, even if in a sealed bag, outside of the restricted area of the airport. In this case it is the customer rather than the supplier who is the exporter of the goods. Suppliers who are not licensed export warehouses and/ or who do not sell goods in the restricted part of an international airport can, of course, still zero-rate the supply of goods when they are sold in situations that fall within categories 2, 3 or 5 of this item 5. Goods posted or couriered overseas by the supplier A supplier may undertake to post or courier goods sold to a person at an overseas address. In this case the supply of the goods can be zero-rated either under section 11(1)(ac) or (ad). Suppliers must keep one of the following types of evidence to show that they posted or couriered the goods to a person at an overseas address: • a copy of the numbered declaration prepared by Customs (the Customs export entry) if the goods have a value of $1,000 or more and are required to be entered for export under the Customs Act 1966 • a copy of an international parcels customs declaration supplied by New Zealand Post and stamped by the postal officer when the parcel is posted, or a New Zealand Post invoice for the overseas postage • a copy of the courier’s invoice. A copy of any registration and/or insurance papers could also be used as further evidence to show that certain goods were posted overseas by the supplier. 6. Goods sold by shops licensed as export warehouses which operate within the Customs-controlled area of an interna- tional airport, when the goods are sold to a departing traveller who uplifts the goods upon returning to New Zealand Section 11(1)(af) provides for the zero-rating of the supply of goods in this situation. Only those suppliers licensed as export warehouses under section 82 of the Customs Act 1966 that operate within the Customs controlled area of an international airport can zero-rate goods in this situation. Enquiries If you need more information about zero-rating goods under section 11, contact your local Inland Revenue office. However, you will need to contact New Zealand Customs if your enquiry concerns any of these matters: • entering goods for export • obtaining a licence to operate an export warehouse • obtaining a licence to operate a sealed bag system.

Murray McClennan Manager (Rulings - Tax Policy) 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.7 (December 1994) Depreciation - new asset classes and rates for medical equipment, medical laboratory equipment, and scientific and general laboratory equipment The Commissioner has issued a new general deprecia- tion determination called “Determination DEP8: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination 8”. The determination applies for the 1994/95 and subse- quent income years, to assets which are acquired on or after 1 April 1993. The determination makes these three changes: 1. It deletes the “Scientific, Medical and Laboratory Equipment” asset category and all the asset classes and depreciation rates listed under it. 2. It inserts a new industry category called “Medical and Medical Laboratory Equipment”. This new category contains the following: •Twenty-six new asset classes and depreciation rates. These new asset classes are: Medical, veterinary, dental, optical, chiropractors, funeral directors (excluding casket making machinery), and medical laboratory plant and equipment (default class) Analysers Beds (domestic type) Beds (Hi-Lo) Beds (standard) Blood warmers Chiropractors couches Dialysis / By-pass machines Fibre optic scopes Fitness equipment Infusion pumps (and the like) Laparoscopic equipment Linear accelerator / simulator Linen Saunas Solarium beds Solarium lamps Spa pools Treatment planning system (radiotherapy) Ultrasonic diagnostic equipment Ultrasonic scanners (used outdoors by veterinarians) Vaporisers / absorbers Washer Decontaminators Weighing equipment (for patients - elec- tronic) Weighing equipment (for patients - mechanical) X-ray cassettes •Two asset classes that have had the wording altered or transposed from the asset classes listed under the previous “Scientific, Medical and Laboratory Equipment” category. The Commis- sioner made these changes to correct a spelling error, or so the asset classes may be easily found in an alphabetical listing. The altered asset classes are: Gamma cameras Irradiation plant •Eighteen higher general depreciation rates for asset classes which were listed under the previ- ous “Scientific, Medical and Laboratory Equip- ment” category. The asset classes that have higher rates are: Medical, veterinary, dental, optical, chiropractors, funeral directors (excluding casket making machinery), and medical laboratory plant and equipment (default class) Crutches Defibrillators Diathermy equipment Electro-diagnostic equipment Electrosurgical equipment Flow measuring equipment Gamma cameras Humidifiers Infant incubators Operating tables Patient monitoring equipment Radiation detection equipment Splints Tools (power) Ventilators Wheel chairs (non-powered) Wheel chairs (powered) 3.

This item incorrectly stated that “employer contributions to superannuation schemes are only deductible if they are made to a scheme that is a super- annuation fund”. There are exceptions. A superannuation fund is any superannuation scheme registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. An employer contribution to an employee superannua- tion scheme that is not a registered superannuation scheme is deductible under section 150(2A) of the Income Tax Act 1976 if the superannuation scheme is deemed to be a company (as required by section 150(2B)). This means an employer contribution to a non-registered superannuation scheme that is defined as a unit trust under section 211 (and therefore deemed to be a company) is deductible. However, an employer contribution is not deductible if it is made to a non- registered superannuation scheme that is not a com- pany, such as a non-contributory scheme that is fully funded by the employer. The deductibility of employer contributions to superan- nuation schemes is governed by section 150 because deductibility under section 104 is precluded by section 106(1)(m). Calculating SSCWT payable Some readers found the example used in the item confusing. The example assumed that the employer was obligated only to make a gross superannuation contribu- tion that matched the employee’s contribution. The net contribution was less than the employee’s contribution because SSCWT was deducted from the gross contribu- tion.

Interpretation In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions have the same meaning as in the Income Tax Act 1976. This determination is signed by me on the 22nd day of November 1994. Murray McClennan Manager (Rulings - Tax Policy) from page 21 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.7 (December 1994) Fidelity fund levies - GST implications clarified Summary This item explains when to claim input tax deductions for payments to the New Zealand Law Society (NZLS) fidelity fund. It applies to practitioners who account for GST on the payments basis or hybrid basis, and who have elected to pay the fidelity fund levy (“the levy”) in instalments. In such cases, the deduction available for each instalment is limited to the tax fraction, i.e., 1/9th, of the amount actually paid. Practitioners who have overstated their deduction should advise their local Inland Revenue office, setting out the amendments required. All legislative references in this item are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Background In 1992 the NZLS imposed a one-off levy of $10,000 plus GST on practising members. The NZLS gave practitioners the option of paying the levy in five equal annual instalments. At the beginning of 1993, district law societies issued tax invoices on behalf of the NZLS for the full amount of the levy. In the case of the instalment option, the NZLS required the full amount of GST to be paid with the first instalment. Some confu- sion has arisen regarding the correct GST treatment for practitioners who account for GST on the payments basis or hybrid basis, and who have elected to pay the levy in instalments. Policy TIB Volume Four, No.7 (March 1993) sets out the application of GST to the levy. Application The time of claiming the corresponding GST input tax deduction depends on the accounting basis of the individual practitioner. Practitioners who use the invoice basis may claim the input deduction at the earlier of being invoiced or making any payment. Those registered on a payments basis or hybrid basis may claim the input deduction based only on the actual amount paid for the supply in each period. For these practitioners this means upon payment of the levy or part of the levy, regardless of whether a part or all of the GST component is paid at that time. GST on levy paid in instalments - practitioner on payments or hybrid basis The correct treatment is: LevyGST OutputTotalInput TaxDeduction Instalment 1 $2,000$1,250$3,250$361.11 (Jan 1993) Instalment 2 $2,000-$2,000$222.22 (Jan 1994) Instalment 3 $2,000-$2,000$222.22 (Jan 1995) Instalment 4 $2,000 -$2,000$222.22 (Jan 1996) Instalment 5 $2,000 - $2,000$222.22 (Jan 1997) $10,000$1,250$11,250 $1,250.00 Practitioners who have overstated the deduction avail- able for the first instalment payment (i.e., claimed an input tax credit of $1,250 rather than $361.11) should advise their local Inland Revenue office. They should detail the adjustments required for that return (i.e., a reduction in the available input tax deduction of $888.89) and the consequent amendment for the return for the period in which the second instalment was paid (i.e., an available input tax deduction of $222.22). No penalty or additional tax will be imposed, provided these steps are taken to amend the over-statement. If an employer is obligated to make a contribution to a superannuation scheme that is equal in net terms (i.e. after deducting SSCWT) to that made by an employee, the employer’s contribution will have to be increased by the amount of SSCWT payable. In this situation the SSCWT payable can be calculated from the employer’s desired net contribution by using the formula: SSCWT =x b a 1 - a In this formula: a is the SSCWT deduction rate b is the employer’s net contribution Example If an employer wishes to make a net contribution of $1,000 to an employee superannuation scheme, the SSCWT payable in addition to the net contribution is calculated as follows: 33 67 x $1,000 = $492.53 To calculate the employer’s gross superannuation contribution, the net contribution will therefore have to be increased by $492.53 to $1,492.53. This will ensure that $1,000 still remains to be contrib- uted to the scheme after SSCWT is deducted at 33 cents per dollar. 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.7 (December 1994) Questions we’ve been asked This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Income Tax Act 1976 “New Zealand” does not include Ross Dependency ........................................................................ 24 Deductibility of expenses incurred in selling a business .................................................................. 25 Deductibility of domestic mortgage interest against rental income ............................................... 25 Agent must deduct non-resident withholding tax if not already deducted at source ................ 25 Effects of income spreading on Family Support entitlement .......................................................... 26 Assessability of provisional tax use-of-money interest .................................................................... 26 Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Credit notes - how to complete GST return .......................................................................................27 Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 Is stamp duty payable on a franchise agreement? ............................................................................ 27 Income Tax Act 1976 “New Zealand” does not include Ross Dependency Section 2 - Interpretation of “New Zealand”: An Australian resident was em- ployed by a private company in the Ross Dependency in Antarctica. He has asked whether his employment income, earned solely in the Ross Dependency, is subject to New Zealand income tax. This will depend on whether his employment income, under section 243(2)(c), is income “earned in New Zealand” and whether the Ross Dependency is part of New Zealand for income tax purposes. (This question raises similar issues under sections 243(2)(o) and (r) of whether the employment income is income derived from contracts made or wholly or partly performed in New Zealand or income derived directly or indirectly from any other source in New Zealand.) The “New Zealand” definition in section 2 does not cover these questions. New Zealand in the definition refers only to the limits of the continental shelf as defined in section 2 of the Continental Shelf Act 1964 and certain water and airspace above the continental shelf. However, the definition is not exhaustive (being only inclusive). The definitions of “New Zealand” in section 4 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1924 and section 2 of the New Zealand Boundaries Act 1863 do not include the Ross Dependency. Accordingly, the definition of New Zea- land for income tax purposes does not include the Ross Dependency. The Australian resident is not subject to New Zealand income tax on employ- ment income sourced from the Ross Dependency. Note that a New Zealand income tax resident who derives employment or other income from the Ross Dependency would be subject to New Zealand tax. Sec- tion 242(a) imposes income tax on income of New Zealand residents, whether it is derived from New Zealand or from elsewhere. 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.7 (December 1994) Deductibility of expenses incurred in selling a business Section 106(1)(a) - Certain deductions not permitted - Capital: A partnership is about to file its final IR 7 partnership tax return after closing its business. One of the partners has asked if legal and real estate agents’ fees incurred in selling the business can be claimed as a deduction for income tax and GST purposes. Section 106 lists certain non-deductible types of expenditure. One of these is capital expenditure. The Commissioner’s view is that legal expenses and real estate agents’ fees incurred in the sale of a business are capital in nature and not deductible. For GST purposes, under section 6(2) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985: “Anything done in connection with the commencement or termination of a taxable activity shall be deemed to be carried out in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity.” If the partnership is registered for GST and tax invoices are available, it can claim an input tax deduction for the GST element of any expenses incurred in the sale of the business. Deductibility of domestic mortgage interest against rental income Section 106(1)(h) - Deductibility of interest: A taxpayer has recently purchased a house in Wellington with the aid of a mortgage. The house is to be used as her private residence. She has rented out her former home in Auckland, and wants to know if the mortgage interest that she pays on her Wellington home is de- ductible against income from the rental property. Section 106(1)(h)(i) allows an interest deduction in so far as the interest is pay- able in gaining or producing assessable income. The Commissioner will consider the use of the capital for which the interest is paid to determine whether there is sufficient nexus between the interest and the gaining or producing of assessable income to meet the test for deductibility. Interest will be deductible to the extent that both of these conditions are met: • In the period in which the interest deduction is claimed, the related capital is used to produce assessable income. • No identifiable part of the capital is used for private or domestic use, or a use that produces exempt income. In this particular case, the interest paid on the mortgage on the Wellington property is not deductible as is does not satisfy the test in section 106(1)(h)(i). The interest payable is not used in gaining or producing assessable income. It is expenditure of a private or domestic nature and prohibited from deduction under section 106(1)(j). A full statement setting out the Commissioner’s policy on interest deductibility and his interpretation on several leading cases on the subject has been published in TIB Volume Three, No.9 and its appendix. Agent must deduct non-resident withholding tax if not already deducted at source Section 312 - Deduction of Non-Resident Withholding Tax: A tax practitioner was acting as agent for a client who is no longer a New Zealand resident for taxation purposes. The practitioner has received payments of non-resident withholding income (dividends) for this client. continued on page 26 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.7 (December 1994) The company which paid the dividends did not know whether it should deduct RWT or non-resident withholding tax (NRWT), so it deducted neither. The practitioner wants to know who is now responsible for deducting the NRWT. An agent acting for a non-resident has a responsibility to see that NRWT is deducted from non-resident withholding income. Under section 312(2), if an agent receives income on behalf of a non-resident, and no (or insufficient) NRWT has been deducted from the income, the agent must deduct the shortfall and pay it to Inland Revenue. For more information on this subject, see Inland Revenue’s NRWT Payers Guide (IR 291). You can get a copy from any Inland Revenue office. Effect of income spreading on Family Support entitlement Section 374B(1) - Determination of assessable income (for Family Support Credit of Tax): A taxpayer has sold a right to take timber. She is considering applying for a spread of the proceeds under section 81A, and has asked how this would affect her Family Support entitlement. Section 81A allows a taxpayer who sells timber or a right to take timber to ap- portion income received between the income year of sale and any number of the three preceding income years. To apportion this income, the seller must apply in writing to Inland Revenue within 12 months after the end of the income year in which the timber was sold. Under section 374B(1)(d)(i), income which may be spread under the terms of section 81A is included as assessable income in the year in which the income is actually derived. For the purpose of calculating Family Support entitlement, section 374B(1)(e)(ii) excludes this income from the year to which the income was spread. If the taxpayer applies to spread this income for income tax purposes, her Fam- ily Support entitlement in the year the income was derived will be based on the income received before the spread took place. Assessability of provisional tax use of money interest Section 413A - Interest on overpaid provisional tax: A taxpayer has asked whether a payment of “use of money interest” from Inland Revenue is taxable income. Section 413A provides for the payment of interest (known as use of money interest) to a provisional taxpayer who overpays provisional tax. Whether or not the interest is taxable depends on the year of the provisional tax overpayment. The rule is: • Interest paid on overpaid 1994 (and earlier income years’) provisional tax - not taxable. • Interest paid on overpaid 1995 (and subsequent income years’) provisional tax - taxable. For the 1994 and earlier income years, use of money interest is not taxable be- cause section 61(13A) deemed such interest exempt from tax. However, section 61(13A) was repealed with effect from the 1994-95 income year onwards. In addition, from the 1994-95 income year, section 413A(8)(b) provides that use of money interest: “... shall be deemed to be interest derived by the person for the purposes of Parts IV and IXA of this Act.” from page 25 27 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.7 (December 1994) Section 65(2)(j), a section within Part IV of the Act, deems payments of interest to be assessable income. This means that use of money interest earned in 1995 or any later income year is taxable income. Inland Revenue will deduct resident withholding tax when we pay the interest. Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Credit notes - how to complete GST return Section 25 - Credit and Debit notes: A GST registered person has asked if she must reduce the output tax figure on her return when she issues a credit note, or whether she is allowed to increase the input tax figure. When the consideration for a taxable supply is altered, the GST portion of the transaction also needs to be adjusted. If a tax invoice was issued for that supply, a credit (or debit) note that complies with section 25(3) must be issued. A registered person has the option of accounting for an altered consideration by either reducing the output tax, or claiming a deduction of input tax. The effect of either method is the same. Example A seller invoices goods to a buyer for $1,000. The buyer pays the seller $900, as some of the goods were found to be damaged when they were received. The seller issues a credit note for $100. The seller’s GST return will include $1,000 in Box 5 (sales), and a $100 claim in Box 12 (purchases). This is the method most likely to be used when the sale is accounted for in one taxable period and the credit note is issued in another. The seller could have shown the net amount of $900 in Box 5 instead. This is usually the method used when the invoice and the credit note are issued in the same taxable period. Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 Is stamp duty payable on a franchise agreement? Section 10 - Stamp duty payable: A taxpayer asked whether stamp duty is payable on franchise agreements. Before 17 March 1988, section 10 provided that stamp duty was payable on every instrument executed after 1 January 1972. “Instrument” was defined for the purposes of the Act in such a manner that franchise agreements could fall within that definition and be held liable for stamp duty. The Stamp and Cheque Duties Amendment Act (No 2) 1988 amended the defini- tion of “instrument of conveyance”, so that stamp duty is no longer payable on franchise agreements. The Act also amended section 10, so that for instruments executed after 17 March 1988, stamp duty is payable only if the instrument conveys or leases land (other than certain residential land), or conveys shares in a flat- or office-owning company. 28 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.7 (December 1994) Legal decisions - case notes This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council.

Whether purchase of land for subdivision qualifies for conveyance duty exemption Rating:••• Case:I.C. Baillie v Commissioner of Inland Revenue, M.464/94 Act:Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 - section 24(1)(b) Keywords:Conveyance duty, residential land, dwellinghouse, subdivision into residential sections Summary:The High Court held on the facts that the objector was not eligible for the con- veyance duty exemption under section 24(1)(b) of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. The land was purchased for the purpose of subdivision and not that of erecting dwellinghouses. 29 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.7 (December 1994) Facts:The objector and his company Village Heights Limited (“VHL”), were regarded by the Court as synonymous. The objector purchased an area of undeveloped land that was zoned residential. VHL (as nominee for the objector) then entered into various contracts to contour the land and install roading and utilities to enable subdivision of the land into vacant residential sections under the Re- source Management Act 1991. VHL entered into sale and purchase agreements with sub-purchasers on “builder’s terms”. Under the “builder’s terms” each sub- purchaser had to settle in full on the first anniversary of the date of possession (five working days after notification that title was available) or upon settlement “of the sale of the proposed dwelling on the said land”, whichever was the earlier. The issue was whether the exemption from conveyance duty in section 24(1)(b) can apply if the purchaser seeking the exemption does not itself intend to erect a dwellinghouse nor to obtain a binding commitment from a sub-purchaser to erect a dwellinghouse “as soon as practicable”. Decision:The High Court found the scheme and purpose approach to statutory analysis argued by the objector was of limited assistance. The Court preferred to focus on the words of the section themselves. His Honour found that the case turned on the phrase “for the purpose of having a dwellinghouse erected on it”, and that the relevant purpose must be that of the person who is acquiring the land under the instrument of conveyance for which the exemption is sought. Justice Blanchard held that although a sub-purchaser purchased the vacant section with the purpose of building a dwellinghouse on it, that fact is not relevant to the first conveyance if the person to whom the property is conveyed under the first instrument does not meet the criteria for the conveyance duty exemption. An exemption may be available to a sub-purchaser who has the purpose of erecting a dwellinghouse, but the exemption would apply to the conveyance to the sub-purchaser, not the conveyance to the objector. On the facts, Justice Blanchard found that the objector’s purpose was to carry out a subdivision of the land into residential sections and to make those sections available to purchasers. It was a matter of relative indifference to the objector whether the dwellinghouse was built. Comment:We do not yet know whether the taxpayer will be appealing this decision. Whether transfer of land was part of a taxable activity Rating:••• Case:TRA No. 91/69 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 - sections 5, 6, 51. Keywords:Taxable activity, supply under matrimonial property agreement, supply to trust, subdivision Summary:Two transfers of land, one under a matrimonial property agreement and one to a family trust, were not in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. The taxable activity of land development had ceased before the transfers took place. Facts:In 1973 the objector purchased two blocks of land (2B and 2E) for retirement and lifestyle purposes. There was no road access to block 2B. The objector hoped to use the blocks for farming but soon realised that they were not an economic unit. He considered dividing block 2B into smaller blocks so that he could sell them. From about 1978 to the time when he sold the land the objector had tried to get road access to block 2B but was unsuccessful. From about 1978 to 1987 the objec- tor also tried to get approval to subdivide block 2B. All his applications were continued on page 30 30 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.7 (December 1994) rejected until 1987 when the district scheme was reviewed and multiple cross- leased housing on one title was permitted subject to approval of a management plan. The objector submitted a draft plan which was approved. However, this plan was not carried out as it was intended to be a feasibility study only. The objector tried once more in 1988 to sell the land but was unsuccessful. During this period the objector and his wife had separated. In 1988 they entered into a matrimonial property agreement to subdivide the property. A half share in block 2B was transferred to the wife and then both the husband and the wife transferred their half shares in block 2B to two family trusts. These trusts later formed a partnership to sell block 2B. These transfers took place in February 1989. Decision:The TRA found that the objector was engaged in the taxable activity of land development before the time of transfer but the transfer of block 2B under the matrimonial property agreement and to the trust were not supplies made in the course or furtherance of the taxable activity. The reason for this is that although the objector’s activities were intended to lead to subdivision the taxable activity had failed by February 1989. Therefore, the supplies were made in the course of a matrimonial settlement and also technically in the course of farming. Although it did not affect the decision, Judge Barber agreed with the Commis- sioner that if the taxable activity of property development had been in existence in February 1989 then the supplies could have been part of that activity and not within the proviso (c) to section 51(1). This proviso states that a person is not liable to register for GST if the total value of supplies exceeds $30,000 only “as a consequence of any cessation of, or any substantial and permanent reduction in the size or scale of any taxable activity carried on by that person.” Comment:Inland Revenue is not appealing this decision. Alienation of income from partnership Rating:••••• Case:TRA No. 92/16 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - section 75 Matrimonial Property Act 1976 - section 21 Keywords:Law partnership, alienation of income, personal exertion Summary:Partners in a law firm entered into agreements under the Matrimonial Property Act 1976. The partners claimed that the effect of the agreements was that a portion of the law firm income which would previously have been taxable in the hands of the partners was income of the partners’ wives. This income was there- fore taxable in the wives’ hands. The TRA addressed two preliminary issues, then decided that although the matrimonial property agreements were valid, for tax purposes they did not make the income assessable to the wives rather than to the partners in the law firm. Facts:Partners in a law firm entered into agreements under section 21 of the Matrimo- nial Property Act. They were equal partners and entitled to equal shares in the law firm’s net profits. The matrimonial property agreements transferred one half of each partner’s shares in the capital of the partnership. The main issue before the TRA was whether the partners could split their partnership income for tax purposes on the basis that the sums paid to the wives of the partners were a return on the wives’ ownership of a capital stake in the partnership. from page 29 31 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.7 (December 1994) Decision:Before the TRA addressed the substantive issue, it addressed two preliminary matters. The first preliminary matter related to objections by the partners to assessments for the 1989-1991 income years. The Commissioner had applied to the High Court for an order that a case stated in respect of the partners’ objec- tion be stated directly to the High Court. The partners submitted that under regulation 5(1) of the Taxation Review Authority Regulations 1974, the Commis- sioner must file a case stated within six months of receiving the objections. The Commissioner had not done this, so the partners submitted that the TRA should therefore allow their objections. The Commissioner submitted that under the proviso to regulation 5, a case stated need not be filed with the TRA until six months after the date on which the High Court refuses the application; other- wise the High Court would deal with the 1989 to 1991 assessments. Judge Barber found that, as the High Court had not yet (at the date of the TRA hearing) dealt with the Commissioner’s application, the Commissioner was not out of time for filing a case stated. Judge Barber dismissed the partners’ applica- tion to allow the objections for the 1989 to 1991 years. After the TRA hearing, Justice Penlington (High Court, Hamilton, M280/94) decided that the partners’ objections for the 1989 to 1991 income years should be referred directly to the High Court. The second preliminary matter related to the assessments for the 1986 to 1988 income years. This issue was whether the Commissioner had stated his grounds of assessment and disallowance of the partners’ objections so narrowly that the Commissioner was restricted to making an argument on section 75 of the In- come Tax Act 1976 only. Section 75 deems income to be derived by a taxpayer even though the income is not actually paid to or received by the taxpayer. If the argument was restricted to section 75, the Commissioner could not put forward an argument based on the general legal principle that income earned from personal activities cannot be effectively assigned for tax purposes. The partners argued that the Commissioner was now seeking to change the basis of his as- sessment and that principles established by the Court of Appeal in CIR v Farnsworth Ltd \[1984\] 1 NZLR 428 prevented him from doing so. Judge Barber stated that Farnsworth limits the Commissioner to the basis on which he arrived at an assessment and at the hearing he cannot rely on a differ- ent provision on which the parties have not joined issue. Judge Barber found that the Commissioner had not changed his ground or approach. Rather, the Commissioner had changed his emphasis without in any way creating surprise or prejudice to the partners. The Commissioner was not restricted to making an argument based on the application of section 75 only. The substantive issue before the TRA was whether the income assigned for the 1986 to 1988 income years should be regarded, for tax purposes, as income of the partners or of their wives. Judge Barber found that the partners could not assign the income for tax purposes. Judge Barber found that the partners’ legal partner- ship was a normal professional legal partnership and that the income generated by it was, as a matter of fact, predominantly generated by the personal exertion of the partners. The rule that income earned from personal exertion cannot be assigned for tax purposes has been conclusively determined by the Court of Appeal and Privy Council in Hadlee & Sydney Bridge Nominees Ltd v CIR \[1991\] 3 NZLR 517 and Hadlee v CIR \[1993\] 2 NZLR 385. This rule cannot be overcome by the Matrimonial Property Act 1976. The matrimonial property agreements do not take effect for income tax purposes until after the income is derived by the partners. Judge Barber found that nothing turns on the fact that the shares in the partner- ship were described as being disposed of by way of transfer as opposed to an continued on page 32 32 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.7 (December 1994) assignment. Any distinction drawn on the basis of the method used to dispose of the interest does not change the principle that disposition of the interest itself is ineffective for tax purposes. Comment:We do not know if the taxpayers are appealing this decision. Whether sale of Government stock by a finance company is assessable income Rating:••• Case:AA Finance Limited v CIR CA 204/93 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - section 65(2)(a) Keywords:Gains derived from business, capital v income, Government stock Summary:The Court of Appeal upheld the High Court decision finding that the acquisition and holding of Government stock was a necessary incident of operating as a finance company. Accordingly, any gain from the sale or realisation of Govern- ment stock was assessable income. Facts:The taxpayer is a finance company. The appeal concerned the assessability of gains derived by the taxpayer on dealings in Government stock over the income years 31 March 1984 to 1987 inclusive. Up until 1985 the taxpayer was subject to investment regulations that required it to hold Government stock. During the period in question, certain parcels of Government stock were sold or matured realising a gain over their acquisition price. In most instances the taxpayer had purchased the stock at a discount. The taxpayer’s trust deed contained borrowing restrictions, including limits linked to the lesser of market value or cost price of its Government stock. During the relevant period, the market value of its Government stock fell below its cost price. To avoid a possible breach of the trust deed, the taxpayer entered into a number of transactions involving the sale of Government stock, at a price in excess of cost. The taxpayer achieved this by selling stock, and then immediately purchasing securities having similar interest rates and maturity dates to the previously disposed of stock. These transactions were loosely described as “swap transactions” and recorded in the taxpayer’s accounts as having given rise to a gain. They were designed to ensure that the value of the taxpayer’s remaining Government stock could be demonstrated to be at least equivalent to its cost price. The Commissioner treated the difference between acquisition cost and the re- corded price on the maturity or sale of all Government stock during the relevant period as assessable income. This was as income derived from any business under section 65(2)(a), interest under section 65(2)(j) and income from any other source under section 65(2)(l). The taxpayer objected and a case was stated to the High Court. The High Court held that gains had been made. The gains were assessable income being profits or gains derived from the taxpayer’s business, and income from any other source. Decision:The Court of Appeal considered the primary argument related to the application of section 65(2)(a). The crucial questions were whether the realisation transac- tions were on revenue account, and if so, in relation to the swap transactions, whether the taxpayer derived any gains on those realisations. As to whether gains produced in a business are revenue or capital, the Court of Appeal was not persuaded that Justice Heron had erred in what it considered to be essentially a factual assessment. As a finance company the taxpayer derived from page 31 33 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.7 (December 1994) its income from the borrowing and lending of money. Money is the stock in trade of a finance company. The holding of Government stock was a necessary incident of operating as a finance company. There was nothing special in the taxpayer’s business to derogate from that conclusion. There was no basis in fact for the argument that Government stock represented an investment separate from, and unconnected with, the taxpayer’s ordinary trading activities. The Government stock dealings formed part of the totality of the business. The Court dismissed the taxpayer’s contention that, in respect of the Govern- ment stock involved in the swap transactions, it had only swapped securities for securities, not for cash. The Court looked to the legal arrangements entered into and carried out, and not the end economic result. It noted that the transactions were not constructed as an exchange of securities. The taxpayer’s accounts recorded the transactions as sales for cash, yielding cash gains and reflected the taxpayer’s intentions. The Court considered that the taxpayer “must live with the fiscal consequences of the way in which the transactions were structured”. The Court of Appeal thought it unnecessary to consider the possible application of sections 65(2)(j) and 65(2)(l). Comment:The taxpayer is not appealing this decision. Whether GST inputs credits claimable on development of a retirement village Rating:••• Case:Norfolk Apartments Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue HC Auckland M 296/94 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 - section 14, 20(3), 21(5) Keywords:Retirement village, principal purpose, common areas, dwelling, apportionment Summary:The High Court decided the Commissioner acted correctly in disallowing Nor- folk Apartments Limited’s (“NAL”) objections to an assessment. The assessment disallowed claims for input tax credits or refunds of GST associated with the acquisition of land and the expenses involved in constructing a retirement village on that land. Facts:NAL purchased land with local authority consent to build a retirement village. NAL entered into a contract for the construction of a retirement village. The facility was constructed on the basis that residents would have exclusive trans- ferable occupation licences to occupy an apartment and garage, and an ancillary right to enjoy common areas. Under the occupation licence the right to use the common areas was on the basis that an apartment service fee was paid. The fee was payable to an associated company, Norfolk Apartments Management Limited, for providing the service of running and administering the apartments. NAL contended that its principal purpose in acquiring the land and constructing the premises was to carry on a taxable activity. On this basis NAL claimed that the GST on the purchase of the land and the GST on the construction materials were deductions for which it was entitled to obtain a credit. Decision:Justice Robertson held that NAL’s principal purpose in purchasing, developing and constructing apartments on the land was to supply accommodation to residents in a retirement village. This is an exempt supply under section 14. There was an associated supplementary intention to carry on a taxable activity by providing additional services, but this was an ancillary or incidental purpose. Justice Robertson also held that the building was not a commercial dwelling. continued on page 34 34 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.7 (December 1994) Because the principal purpose of acquiring and developing the land was to make exempt supplies, no apportionment was available under section 21(5). Adjust- ments can only be made if there is a subsequent application for the purpose of making taxable supplies. Comment:The taxpayer is appealing this decision.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) Fringe benefits granted to employees of overseas branches of New Zealand companies Summary This item states how paragraph (i) of the definition of the term ìfringe benefitî applies to New Zealand employers who transfer employees to overseas branches. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1976. Background Fringe benefit tax (FBT) is a tax payable by employers on the value of fringe benefits that they provide to employees. The provision of a benefit is taxable if both of these conditions are met: ï The benefit or advantage is provided to an employee by an employer. ï That benefit is provided in relation to, in the course of, or by virtue of the employeeís employment with the employer. FBT also applies when another party provides the employee with a fringe benefit under an arrangement between that party and the employer, or when the employer provides a benefit to an associated person of the employee. Legislation Section 336N(1) defines ìfringe benefitî, ìemployeeî, and ìemployerî: ìFringe benefitî .... does not include-... (i) Any benefit to the extent to which the Commissioner is satisfied that it is a benefit received or enjoyed by the employee in a quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis pursuant to section 336TB of this Act) income year, as the case may be, in which the employee derives a source deduction payment that is or, as the case may be, source deduction payments all of which are, not liable for income tax under part IV of this Act... ìEmployeeî means a person who will receive, receives, or has at any time received, or who will be, is, or has at any time been entitled to receive, a source deduction payment (not being a payment of any of the kinds referred to in paragraphs (ba), (c), (ca), (d), and (da) of the definition of the expression ìsalary or wagesî in section 2 of this Act and not being a withholding payment of the kind specified in Part E of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 in respect of which the person is liable for income tax under Part IV of this Act. ìEmployerî means a person who will pay, pays, or has at any time paid, or who will be, is, or has at any time been liable to pay, a source deduction payment...; Section 6(1) defines ìsource deduction paymentî: Subject to this section, for the purposes of this Act the term ìsource deduction paymentî means a payment by way of salary or wages, an extra emolument, or a withholding payment. Section 242 provides the basic rules for the assessability of income in New Zealand. Section 242 is in Part IV of the Act and should be cross referenced to the definition of ìemployeeî. It states: Subject to this Act, - (a) All income derived by any person who is resident in New Zealand at the time when he derives that income shall be assessable for income tax, whether it is derived from New Zealand or from elsewhere: (b) All income derived from New Zealand shall be assessable for income tax, whether the person deriving that income is resident in New Zealand or elsewhere: (c) No income which is neither derived from New Zealand nor derived by a person then resident in New Zealand shall be assessable for income tax. Application “Fringe benefit” definition - paragraph (i) Paragraph (i) excludes from the definition of ìfringe benefitî benefits received by an employee in any FBT period in which that employee is not liable for New Zealand income tax on any source deduction payments received during that period. Paragraph (i) applies only when the ìemployeeî derives no source deduction payments liable to New Zealand income tax in the particular FBT period. If the em- ployee derives a source deduction payment which is liable to New Zealand tax in any FBT period, the exception in paragraph (i) does not apply. This exclu- sion may affect the FBT liability of New Zealand employers that transfer employees to overseas branches. Example 1 Phil, a US national, was appointed as the manager of the Bermudan branch of a New Zealand bank, Kiwi-Bank (Kiwi-Bank NZ). As a matter of com- pany policy, Phil was seconded to New Zealand for three months training before taking up her position. In that time she received source deduction payments from Kiwi-Bank NZ which are subject to New Zealand income tax under section 242(b). She received the first payment on 4 August 1993, and the last on 27 October 1993. Kiwi-Bank NZ ac- counts for FBT on a quarterly basis. Phil is an ìemployeeî as she receives a source deduction payment on which she is liable for New continued on page 2 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) However, if Phil was liable for New Zealand income tax on source deduction payments she received, then Kiwi-Bank NZ would have to account for FBT in that quarter. Example 2 Mike, a New Zealand resident, is appointed as Philís assistant manager at the Bermudan branch. Mike receives the same training in New Zealand and also receives a car on the same conditions as Phil. FBT treatment: When a New Zealand resident is transferred overseas to work for a branch of a New Zealand company, the analysis is different to that of a non- resident discussed above. If the New Zealand resident retains his or her resident status, a liability to New Zealand income tax continues under section 242(a). Therefore, any source deduction payments will be subject to New Zealand income tax, and paragraph (i) will not operate to exclude the fringe benefit from the definition of ìfringe benefitî. If the resident loses resident status (under a double tax agreement or the residence tests in section 241), the exclusion in paragraph (i) will apply. ï If Mike retains his New Zealand resident status, Kiwi-Bank NZ will continue to be subject to FBT on the provision of the car. ï If Mike loses his New Zealand resident status, Kiwi-Bank NZ will be subject to FBT in the same way as it is for Phil, as discussed above. GST on gaming machines Introduction This item explains how GST applies to gaming ma- chines. Background There are special GST rules which apply to gaming machines and to other coin- or token-operated ma- chines. Section†2 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977 defines the term ìgaming machineî to include machines operated by coins or tokens for use in a game of chance. Section 2 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act defines the term ìgame of chanceî as a game in which considera- tion is paid to participate with a view to winning money or moneyís worth. All legislative references in this item are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. Legislation Section 5(10) deems a supply of services to occur when money is paid to participate in a game of chance (as defined in the Gaming and Lotteries Act). Section 9 sets the time of supply rules for GST pur- poses. Section 9(2)(f) states that the time of supply for any coin- or token-operated machine is the time that the coins or tokens are taken from the machine by the supplier. Section 10 sets the valuation rules for GST purposes. Section 10(14) states that the value of a supply for a game of chance is the total proceeds less any cash prizes. This rule ensures that the prize money does not attract GST. These special rules mean that the supplier of a gaming or coin-operated machine is liable to account for GST from page 1 Zealand income tax. Kiwi-Bank NZ is accordingly Philís ìemployerî. When she returns to Bermuda, Phil is provided with a car which is paid for by Kiwi-Bank NZ. The car is completely at Philís disposal, and she can use it for private as well as business purposes. FBT treatment: Whether Kiwi-Bank NZ is subject to FBT on the provision of a car in Bermuda depends upon when the car is provided to Phil. Under paragraph (i) fringe benefits are subject to FBT if they are provided in the same FBT period in which the employee receives source deduction payments subject to New Zealand income tax. Once the employeeís source deduction payments cease to be subject to New Zealand income tax, the fringe benefit is not a ìfringe benefitî in terms of section 336N(1), and therefore is not subject to FBT. ï If the car is provided on Philís return to Bermuda on 1 November 1993, then Kiwi-Bank NZ is liable for FBT on that fringe benefit in the quarter ending 31 December 1993. This is because in that quarter Phil received source deduction payments liable to New Zealand income tax under section 242(b). She is an ìemployeeî for FBT purposes in that quarter. ï Kiwi-Bank NZ does not have to account for FBT in the quarter starting on 1 January 1994, because Phil does not receive any source deduction payment for which she is liable for New Zealand income tax in that period. Therefore, for that quarter, provision of the car is not a ìfringe benefitî within section 336N(1). 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) on the amount of money taken from the machine, at the time the supplier collects the coins or tokens from the machine. Site fee Gaming machine owners are usually required to pay a site fee for the machine to a shop or arcade owner. This fee may be paid straight from the proceeds of the machine. A GST registered machine owner must account for GST on the total proceeds taken from the machine, before the payment of any expenses. The machine owner may claim an input tax credit if the site fee includes GST and a tax invoice is received. Example Mary Smith owns two video game machines and is registered for GST. Her taxable periods are two- monthly, ending on the last day of the even- numbered months of the year. On 25 June she empties the machines and receives a total of $5,000 net of all prizes paid to participants. She pays $100 site fee for the machines to the shop where the machines are situated. The shop owner issues a tax invoice for the site fee. Mary will show $5,000 as taxable supplies made and claim an input tax credit for 1/9th of $100 in her May/June GST return. Expenses incurred in pollution control Summary This item sets out the provisions of section 124 of the Income Tax Act 1976. Section 124 allows a deduction for certain expenditure incurred to prevent or combat pollution of the environment. The section does not apply to taxpayers who are engaged in a farming or agricultural business, or to expenditure which is deduct- ible as depreciation or otherwise under any other provision of the Act. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1976. Legislation Section 124 applies to business taxpayers, except taxpayers who are involved in farming or agricultural businesses. In summary, it allows these taxpayers to claim a deduction for expenditure in constructing any of the following items on land in New Zealand, if the expenditure is to prevent or combat pollution of the environment: ï earthworks ï ponds ï settling tanks ï similar improvements primarily for the purpose of treating industrial waste. The amount of the deduction they can claim is 20% in the income year in which the expenditure was incurred, and 20% in each of the four succeeding income years. The Commissioner may reallocate the amount allowed so that a minimum of $1,000 or the balance of the expenditure is allowed in an income year, whichever is the smaller. No deduction is allowable under section 124 for ex- penditure which is eligible for a depreciation deduction or a deduction under any other provision of the Act. Application Expenditure on the construction of earthworks, ponds, settling tanks, or similar improvements is eligible for a deduction under section 124 as long as a deduction is not available under some other provision of the Act; the most likely deduction being depreciation. The new depreciation regime (which generally applies from the 1993/1994 income year) extends the types of property that may be depreciated. Because of this, it is now more likely that pollution control expenditure will not be deductible under section 124. Page 46 of Inland Revenueís booklet ìDepreciation Guide - 1994 Editionî (IR†260) explains which types of expenditure must be depreciated. Pollution control expenditure that is depreciable in- cludes such items as borewells, tanks, reservoirs, pipes, and screens. The only items of expenditure listed in section 124 that are not depreciable are earthworks and settling ponds, although there may be occasions when such expenditure qualifies for a depreciation deduction, e.g. in the case of a dam. Example In December 1993 Industrial Giant Ltd, which has a 31 March balance date, undertook certain ex- penditure for the purposes of treating its industrial waste. The expenditure consisted of certain earthworks, installing a settling tank, and pipes and pumping machinery at a total cost of $550,000. The settling tank, pipes and pumping machinery are able to be depreciated. The earthworks which cost $150,000 are not, and therefore Industrial Giant can claim a deduction of $30,000 under section 124 in each of the 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998 income years. 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) Overseas teachers and researchers deriving salaries and wages in New Zealand - income tax treatment Summary This item sets out the income tax exemptions on salary and wages derived by non-resident teachers and re- searchers in New Zealand. The item also sets out the Commissionerís current policy on collecting income tax from such teachers and researchers. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1976 unless otherwise stated. Background Non-resident teachers and researchers are normally subject to New Zealand tax on salary and wages they derive from New Zealand under section 242(b). How- ever, teachers or researchers may not be taxable if a legislative exemption applies to that income. Their income tax liability may also be altered if they are resident in a country that has a Double Tax Agreement (ìDTAî) with New Zealand and a provision of the DTA applies to their income. Note that the employer of the non-resident teacher or researcher may be liable to pay fringe benefit tax on any employment-related benefits provided to that teacher or researcher in New Zealand. Legislative exemptions Section 61 sets out two general tax exemptions which may apply to the personal services income of non- resident taxpayers, including non-resident teachers or researchers. The application of the exemptions to non- resident teachers and researchers can be summarised as follows: 1. Section 61(19) provides a tax exemption for personal services income if the teacher or researcher meets both of these conditions: ï He or she is in New Zealand for no more than 92 days in an income year (if the visit falls entirely within a single income year), or is in New Zealand for no more than 92 days in total (if the visit spans two income years, for example from 25 January to 15 April) ï He or she is paying tax on that income in the country of residence, and is performing the teaching or researching services for or on behalf of a person who is not a New Zealand resident. 2. Section 61(38) provides a tax exemption for personal services income if the teacher or researcher meets either of these conditions: ï He or she works for or on behalf of an employer who is not a New Zealand resident, ï He or she is paid an allowance under an assist- ance arrangement entered into by the New Zealand Government. (Section 60(1) sets out such arrangements, for example a United Na- tions programme for professional, expert, educational, technical, economic, or cultural assistance.) Double taxation agreements Some DTAs provide a specific exemption from New Zealand income tax for teachersí and researchersí remuneration, as well as a general exemption from New Zealand income tax for income from personal services. Other DTAs only contain the general personal services income exemption. The following table summarises the provisions of the various DTAs New Zealand has entered into which affect the taxation of teachersí and researchersí income. Note that a researcher is not necessarily covered by a DTA exemption that applies to teachers and professors. (continued in opposite column) Exemption A. Specific exemptions: (1) Teacher in NZ for less than two years: (a) General terms A teacher or professor who teaches in New Zealand, and who meets the following three conditions, is exempt from tax on his or her teaching income: ï He or she is teaching for a period which does not exceed two years. ï He or she was a resident of the other DTA country immediately before coming to New Zealand. ï He or she is subject to tax in the other DTA country. Country/DTA Article (1)(a) Australia (Article 15) Fiji (Article 17) Sweden (Article 19) 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) Exemption (1) Teacher in NZ for less than two years (continued): (b) Variations (i) Research The DTAs with these countries also exempt (on the same terms as set out in (1)(a)) the income of non-residents who carry out research in New Zealand. To be exempt such research must be undertaken in the public interest, rather than for the private benefit of specific person(s). The DTA with Philippines states that ìremunerationî includes remittances from sources outside New Zealand which are sent to enable the person to carry out the teaching or research. (ii) Tax in country of residence The exemption set out in (1)(a) applies, except these DTAs do not state that the teacherís income must be subject to tax in that teacherís country of residence. The DTAs with China, Germany, and Korea also exempt the income of indi- viduals who are engaged in research in New Zealand. The DTAs with Germany and Korea require that the research is primarily in the public interest and not for the private benefit of a specific person or persons before the exemption applies. (iii) Tertiary education only The exemption set out in (1)(a) only applies if the teacher is teaching at a tertiary institution. The DTA does not require the teacher to have been a resident of Japan immediately before visiting New Zealand or to be subject to tax on that income in Japan. (2) Income exempt for two years A teacher or researcher who meets both of the following conditions is exempt from New Zealand tax on that income for two years: ï He or she was resident in France immediately before coming to New Zealand. ï He or she is in New Zealand for the purpose of teaching or engaging in research. The DTA with France states that the exemption only applies to researchers whose research is in the public interest. B. General exemption - personal services: All countries with which New Zealand has a DTA contain a form of this general exemption for personal services income. This general exemption is subject to any specific exemption set out in (A) above. (1) General rule: A person who performs personal services in New Zealand and who meets all of the following conditions is not taxable in New Zealand: ï He or she is present in New Zealand for no more than 183 days in the income year. ï He or she receives remuneration paid by or on behalf of a New Zealand non- resident. ï He or she receives remuneration which is not borne by a permanent establish- ment or fixed base which the payer has in New Zealand. Country/DTA Article (1)(b)(i) India (Article 21) Indonesia (Article 20) Italy (Article 20) Malaysia (Article 15) Netherlands (Article 20) Philippines (Article 20) (1)(b)(ii) Belgium (Article 20) China (Article 20) Germany (Article 20) Korea (Article 21) (1)(b)(iii) Japan (Article 11) (2) France (Article 21) (1) Belgium (Article 15) Canada (Article 14) Denmark (Article 15) Finland (Article 15) France (Article 15) Germany (Article 15) Italy (Article 15) Korea (Article 15) Netherlands (Article 15) Philippines (Article 15) Singapore (Article 11) Sweden (Article 16) Switzerland (Article 15) 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) Policy In the following paragraphs the word ìemployeeî refers to a non-resident teacher or researcher. Employees exempt if in NZ for less than 92 days (section 61(19) exemption) or 183 days (general DTA exemption) The following policy applies when an employeeís employment is covered by the section 61(19) exemption (an employee who is in New Zealand for no more than 92 days, whose income is taxable in his or her country of residence, and who is employed by a non-New Zealand resident) or by the general ìless than 183 daysî DTA exemption (set out in B. in the table above - an employee who is in New Zealand for no more than 183 days, whose income is paid by a non-NZ resident). When it is clear (e.g. from the visa, passport, or contract of employment) that the employee will be in NZ for less than 92 days or 183 days, as the case may be, the employee may apply for a NIL special tax code certifi- cate (see procedure below). If Inland Revenue issues such a certificate, the employee will not be liable to tax in New Zealand on income earned from teaching or researching services in New Zealand. If it is not clear whether the employee will be in New Zealand for less than 92 days, or 183 days, as the case may be, the options set out in the following section apply. Employees exempt if in NZ for less than 92 days, 183 days, or two years The following policy applies when an employee quali- fies for an exemption under a DTA which contains a ìless than two yearsî rule (set out in A.(1) in the table above). It also applies when it is not clear whether the employee will qualify for the ì92 day ruleî (sec- tion†61(19)) or a ì183 day ruleî contained in the relevant DTA (set out in B. in the table above). In these cases, the Commissioner considers he can only properly ascertain whether an employee has a right to an exemption after the employee has left New Zealand. The Commissioner will not know until that time whether the employee has been in New Zealand for less than the applicable maximum period and has complied with the other criteria set out in section 61(19) or the relevant DTA. Exemption (2) Variations (a) 183 days in any consecutive 12 months The same rule as set out in (1) applies, except that the person must be present in New Zealand for no more than 183 days in any consecutive 12 month period. (b) Income not taxed may be taxed in NZ The same rule as set out in (1) applies, except that any income which is not taxed in Norway may be taxed in New Zealand. The DTA with Norway also provides that, for the exemption to apply, the recipient must be present in New Zealand for no more than 183 days in any consecutive 12 month period. (c) Tax in country of residence The same rule as set out in (1) applies, except that the remuneration must be taxable in the country of residence. (d) Performance of services for non-resident The DTA between New Zealand and Japan states that a person who performs personal services in New Zealand and who meets the following three conditions is not taxable in New Zealand: ï He or she is present in New Zealand for no more than 183 days in the income year. ï He or she performs the services for or on behalf of a Japanese resident. ï He or she receives remuneration which is subject to tax in Japan. Country/DTA Article (2)(a) China (Article 15) India (Article 15) Indonesia (Article 15) Ireland (Article 17) Malaysia (Article 11) Norway (Article 15) United Kingdom (Art. 16) United States (Article 15) (2)(b) Norway (Article 15) (2)(c) Australia (Article 11) Fiji (Article 12) Japan (Article 10) 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) The Commissionerís policy is that an educational institution which employs a visiting teacher or re- searcher who may fall under the section 61(19) or applicable DTA exemption should make normal PAYE deductions from that employeeís wages. Alternatively, the educational institution may enter into an arrangement under section 350A, whereby it pays Inland Revenue a bond or other security, in substitution for any liability to withhold PAYE. The amount of the bond is determined by the circumstances of the case. Once the bond is in place the educational institution is not liable to deduct PAYE from the employeeís wages. The institution will only be liable to deduct PAYE if the Commissioner specifies a date when the institution is to recommence deductions or if the employee outstays the time limit set out in section 61(19) or the relevant DTA and becomes liable for New Zealand tax. In some cases the employee may pay such a bond. The Commissioner will require an employee in this situation to file annual tax returns. At the end of the employeeís stay in New Zealand, the Commissioner will review the New Zealand tax liabil- ity. The employee will need to complete an application for refund by persons leaving New Zealand permanently or for more than 325 days (IR†50). This form requires the employee to sign a declaration that he or she is leaving New Zealand permanently or for more than 325 days, and to provide evidence of departure (e.g. air tickets or, if these are not available, a letter from the employeeís travel agent confirming departure). If the employee meets all the tests set out in section 61(19) or the relevant DTA one of the following situations will apply: ï If the educational institution made tax deductions, the New Zealand tax paid on the teaching income will be refunded to the employee. ï If the educational institution paid a bond to Inland Revenue instead of making PAYE deductions, the bond will be refunded to the educational institution. ï If the employee paid a bond to Inland Revenue, the bond will be refunded to the employee. If an employee stays in New Zealand beyond the maximum period, or otherwise does not comply with the terms of section 61(19) or the relevant DTA, he or she is liable for tax on his or her earnings from the date of arrival in New Zealand. The section 61(19) or relevant DTA exemption does not apply. If the educational institution paid a bond to Inland Revenue instead of deducting PAYE, Inland Revenue will refund the bond to the employer and collect the tax owing from the employee. The Commissioner will make an exception to this rule if the employee has arranged to leave New Zealand before the end of the relevant maximum period but is unable to do so due to circumstances beyond his or her control (e.g. illness or accident). As long as the circumstances are genuine and the employee leaves as soon as possible, the Commissioner will apply the article of the relevant DTA to exempt the income. France - income exempt for 2 years Employees who were French residents immediately before coming to New Zealand are not liable for New Zealand tax on their teaching income for a period of two years, even if they are in New Zealand for longer than two years (see A.(2) in the table above). Employees from France should apply for a NIL special tax code certificate (see the following procedure). Employers of such employees should not deduct PAYE during the first two years of their visit. Applying for a NIL special tax code certificate and other enquiries To apply for a NIL special tax code certificate, an eligible employee should contact Taxpayer Services at the local Inland Revenue office. The employee will need to produce evidence confirming appointment as a teacher or researcher in New Zealand, and of his or her current residence (e.g. the letter of appointment, work permit, certificate of residence from the country of residence, visa, or passport). If the local district office is not known because the employee has not yet arrived in New Zealand, contact Inland Revenueís Non-resident Centre in Dunedin instead. Once the employee has a special tax code certificate he or she must give it to the employer. The employee must still file an annual tax return. Other income Employees who are present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in a twelve month period become New Zealand tax residents under section 241(1). As New Zealand residents, they are taxable in New Zealand on their worldwide income. If such New Zealand resident employees are also resident in another country and a DTA exemption for teachers or researchersí income applies, the employees are taxable in New Zealand on their worldwide income, except for their income from teaching or researching. Teachers or researchers who receive contract payments The above policy applies to teachers and researchers who receive salary or wages in New Zealand. The non- resident contractors withholding payments rules may apply to teachers and researchers who receive payments under a contract for services. In certain circumstances such teachers and researchers may apply for an exemp- tion certificate from tax on the withholding payments. For more information about non-resident contractors withholding payments, contact the Corporates Unit (Oils and Minerals Portfolio) at Inland Revenueís Wellington District Office. 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) Depreciation claims mandatory Summary This item states the Commissionerís current policy on what options taxpayers have in claiming depreciation. It is now mandatory for taxpayers to claim at least the minimum amount of depreciation to which they are entitled. However, the Commissioner considers that taxpayers do not have to claim the extra depreciation on ìexcluded depreciable propertyî (generally property purchased before 1 April 1993). This extra depreciation is allowed in one of these ways: ï as a supplementary depreciation allowance under section 113A ï as a 25% interim loading under section 108N. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1976. Background The new depreciation regime was introduced from the 1993-94 income year. It removed the Commissionerís discretion and gave a statutory basis to depreciation. New economic depreciation rates were also introduced. Generally, the new depreciation rates can be used for assets purchased after 31 March 1993. Legislation Depreciation is governed by sections 107A to 117. Excluded depreciable property Excluded depreciable property is defined in section 107A. It means any taxpayerís depreciable property which meets any of these conditions: ï The property was used or available for use by the taxpayer within New Zealand, other than as trading stock, before 1 April 1993. ï Before 16 December 1991, the taxpayer entered into a binding contract to purchase the property or have it constructed. ï It is or has been a qualifying asset of the taxpayer under section 108N(1). ï It is or has been a qualifying improvement of the taxpayer under section 108N(1). ï It is an intangible asset that was used or was available for use by the taxpayer before 1 April 1993. Excluded depreciable property does not include property in existence at the end of the 1992-93 income year that was accounted for using the standard value, replacement value, or annual revaluation method. The annual depreciation rate for excluded depreciable property is given by section 108H(1). The rate is the depreciation rate that applied in the 1992-93 income year, excluding any additional depreciation allowed by sections 108N or 113A. However, section 108H(2) provides that the depreciation rate may be adjusted upwards to include any additional depreciation allowed by sections 108N or 113A. Section 108N Section 108N was inserted into the Act in 1992 (ini- tially as section 108A), and it applied from the 1991-92 income year. The purpose of the section was to add a 25% loading to the normal depreciation rates for most new assets purchased between 16 December 1991 and 31 March 1993. The loading was only an interim measure given in anticipation of the pending review of depreciation rates. Section 113A Section 113A was inserted into the Act with effect from the 1978-79 income year. Its purpose was to give an increased depreciation rate for machinery used for two or three shifts (i.e., 16-24 hours) per day. An extra three or six percent was allowed to be added to the normal depreciation rate for the first five years when the Commissioner allowed a higher rate for more than one-shift operation. Section 113A does not apply to the new basic economic depreciation rates. Depreciation rate for property acquired before the end of the 1994/95 income year Section 108D gives taxpayers a choice of two deprecia- tion rates for depreciable property (which is not ex- cluded depreciable property) acquired before the end of the 1994/95 income year. The depreciation rate can be either the new basic economic depreciation rate or the assetís ìpre-1993 depreciation rateî. This choice can continue as long as the taxpayer holds the property. The pre-1993 depreciation rate for any asset is the depreciation rate the Commissioner allowed to be used for that class of property in the 1992-93 income year. The pre-1993 depreciation rate always includes any supplementary depreciation allowance that would have been allowed under section 113A, and the 25% interim loading if it would have been allowed by section 108N. Policy For tax purposes, it is now mandatory for taxpayers to claim the whole amount of the depreciation to which they are entitled. However, taxpayers do not have to claim the extra depreciation on ìexcluded depreciable propertyî (gener- ally property purchased before 1 April 1993), when this extra depreciation is allowed in either of these ways: ï as a supplementary depreciation allowance under section 113A ï as a 25% interim loading under section 108N. 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) When a taxpayer has a choice between old and new depreciation rates (as generally occurs for property purchased between 1 April 1993 and the end of the 1994-95 income year) the taxpayer can choose to use the lower depreciation rate. Further, a taxpayer can choose between the diminishing value (DV) and straight line (SL) method of calculating the depreciation rate to be used for any income year (except for fixed life intangible property). Changing from one method to another part way through an assetís life will slow depreciation deductions. When switching from the diminishing value to the straight line method of calculating depreciation, the cost of property is deemed to be its adjusted tax value. Example 1 F Co owns a meat processing factory in which the machinery runs 24 hours a day. F Co has a 30 June balance date. Meat processing machine X was purchased new in June 1992. At that time the general depreciation rate for plant and machinery operating 24†hours a day was 15% DV. The depre- ciation rate was calculated as follows: Basic rate15.0% Supplementary Allowance (s.113A)6.0% 21.0% 25% Interim Loading (s.108N) 5.3% 26.3% An additional meat processing machine Y was purchased new in January 1994. The basic eco- nomic depreciation rate for meat and fish process- ing plant (for assets not described more specifically in the schedule) is 12% DV. However, under section 108D the higher pre-1993 depreciation rate of 26.3%, as calculated above, can be claimed instead. F Co expects to make a loss in the 1994-95 income year, and wants to know the minimum rate of depreciation that can be claimed on both machines in that income year. As Machine X is excluded depreciable property (because it was purchased before 1 April 1993 and is a qualifying asset under section 108N(1)), the minimum rate of depreciation that can be claimed is the old basic rate of 15% DV or the SL equivalent of 10%. For Machine Y, F Co can claim the new basic economic depreciation rate of 12% DV (or 8% SL) instead of the higher pre-1993 depreciation rate of 26.3% DV. Example 2 Mr A is a self-employed consultant with a 31 March balance date. He buys a personal computer on 5†April 1993 for $4,000. He claims the new basic economic depreciation rate of 40% DV, giving him a depreciation deduction of $1,600 (40% x $4,000) for the 1993-94 income year. Mr A expands his business and will make a loss in the 1994/95 income year. Mr A wants to know the minimum amount of depreciation he has to claim. Mr A can switch to using the straight line (SL) method of depreciation and use the pre-1993 SL depreciation rate of 16.9% (13.5% + 25% loading) for personal computers. SL depreciation is calcu- lated from the cost of an asset. However, because Mr A has switched from the diminishing value method, cost is deemed under section 108B(6) to be the adjusted tax value of $2,400 ($4,000 - $1,600). Mr Aís minimum depreciation claim is therefore $405.60 (16.9% x 2,400). Residential property exempt from conveyance duty Summary This item states the Commissionerís current policy on the exemption from conveyance duty for residential property. The Commissionerís policy is that the exemp- tion applies to flats and rest homes, provided the rest home residents are long term residents. The exemption does not apply to hotels, motels, boarding houses and similar buildings. When land is purchased for the purpose of erecting a dwellinghouse, the Commissionerís general policy is that the dwellinghouse must be erected and occupied within 24 months from the date of purchase of the land, if the conveyance duty exemption is to apply to the purchase of the land. However, the Commissioner will consider individual circumstances if a dwellinghouse cannot be built and occupied within 24 months of acquiring the land. All legislative references in this item are to the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. Background Some instruments of conveyance are exempt from conveyance duty if they meet the criteria set down in the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. The exemption from conveyance duty applies to instruments of convey- ance that convey dwellinghouses (as defined by the Act), land acquired for the purpose of building a dwellinghouse, and shares in a flat- or office-owning company that carry a right to use and occupy a dwellinghouse. continued on page 10 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) primarily and principally as a residence, and includes any land, improvements, or appurtenances belonging to the dwellinghouse or usually enjoyed with it. Policy Definition of “dwellinghouse” It is the Commissionerís policy that the definition of ìdwellinghouseî within the meaning of section 24(3) includes flats and rest homes, as long as the rest home residents are residents on a long-term basis. It does not include hotels, motels, or boarding houses. To qualify for the exemption, the purchaser must satisfy the Commissioner that the dwellinghouse will be occupied primarily or principally as a residence, but it is not necessary that the dwellinghouse is occupied as a principal place of abode. Nor is it necessary for the dwellinghouse to be occupied by the purchaser or a member of the purchaserís family. Occupied “as soon as practicable” When a dwellinghouse is purchased, the Commissioner must be satisfied that it will be occupied primarily or principally as a residence as soon as practicable after the date of execution of the instrument of conveyance. When land is purchased for the purpose of erecting a dwellinghouse, the dwellinghouse must be erected and occupied as soon as practicable. In this situation the Commissioner interprets ìas soon as practicableî to mean within 24 months from the date of purchase of the land. However, the Commissioner will consider indi- vidual circumstances if a dwellinghouse cannot be built and occupied within 24 months of acquiring the section. Example 1 JB purchases a house that is erected primarily and principally as a residence, and immediately rents it out as a residential tenancy. Conveyance duty is not payable on the instrument of conveyance that conveyed the house to JB, because the house is erected primarily and princi- pally as a residence and it is not a requirement of section 24 that the house is occupied by its owner. Example 2 A motel property is transferred. The total considera- tion is $600,000. The value of that part of the motel that is the managerís residence is $150,000. The value on which the instrument of conveyance of the motel will be assessed for conveyance duty is $450,000. Legislation In summary, section 10 makes stamp duty payable on all instruments executed on or after 17 March 1988 that convey or lease land, or convey shares in a flat- or office-owning company, unless the instruments are exempt under some other provision in the Act. Sec- tion†15(1) provides for stamp duty payable on an instrument of conveyance to be conveyance duty com- puted on the value of the property conveyed. Under section 24, conveyances of residential property are exempt from conveyance duty, and conveyance duty will be apportioned on an instrument which conveys a partly-exempt property: 24(1) Subject to subsection (2) of this section, no conveyance duty is payable on any instrument of conveyance where the property conveyed is- (a) A dwellinghouse; or (b) Land acquired for the purpose of having a dwellinghouse erected on it; or (c) Shares in a flat or office owing company that carry a right of use and occupation of a dwellinghouse, - and the Commissioner is satisfied that the dwellinghouse will, as soon as practicable after the date of execution of the instrument of conveyance, be occupied primarily of principally as a residence. 24(2) Where- (a) The property conveyed by an instrument consists partly of property referred to in paragraphs (a) to (c) of subsection (1) of this section, and partly of other property; or (b) The property conveyed is greater in area than - (i) 4,500 square metres; or (ii) An area that would be reasonably appropriate for residential purposes, having regard to the size and character of the dwellinghouse or dwellinghouses erected or to be erected on the property, and to the nature of the property, - whichever is the greater; or (c) Any building or buildings on or to be erected on the property are to be used partly as a dwellinghouse or dwellinghouses and partly for other purposes,- such proportion of the value of the property conveyed as the Commissioner determines is not attributable to the purposes of occupation as a dwellinghouse shall be subject to conveyance duty as if the instrument of conveyance related to that proportion of the property only. 24(3) In this section, the term ìdwellinghouseî means a building, or part of a building, that is a house, flat, townhouse, home unit, or similar dwelling erected from page 9 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) Persons eligible to apply for a RWT certificate of exemption Introduction This item lists the persons who are eligible to apply for a resident withholding tax (RWT) certificate of exemp- tion. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1976. Background Generally, a person who pays interest or dividends must deduct RWT. However, there are a number of situations in which the person making the payment is not required to deduct RWT. One of these situations is when the recipient of the interest or dividends holds a valid certificate of exemption. Paragraphs (a)(ii) and (b)(iv) of section 327B(2) remove such interest or dividends from being subject to RWT. Persons who hold a certificate of exemption are only exempt from having RWT deducted from the payments they receive. In most cases they must still deduct RWT from any dividends or interest they pay. Persons who wish to apply for a certificate of exemption should use Inland Revenue form IR†15E. Application Section 327M(1) lists a number of persons who may apply for a certificate of exemption. Further, section 327M(12) gives the Commissioner a discretion to grant a certificate of exemption to certain persons who do not fall within the subsection (1) list. Persons who may apply under sec 327M(1) The following list summarises the persons who may apply to the Commissioner for a certificate of exemption under section 327M(1). Persons who wish to apply for a certificate of exemption should check the specific provisions of section 327M(1) too see whether they are one of the persons listed in that section. ï Registered banks ï Building societies ï Trustee banks ï The Public Trustee (and, from 19 December 1989, any company that would be a member of the same wholly- owned group of companies as the Public Trustee if the Public Trustee were a company for the purposes of the Act) ï The Maori Trustee ï Trustee companies ï A person whose principal form of business is both of the following: - The borrowing of money or acceptance of deposits, whether on demand or for a fixed term, or the receiving of credit or the selling of any credit instrument - The lending of money or granting of credit or buying or discounting of credit instruments ï A solicitorís nominee company (effective 19 Decem- ber 1989) ï A brokerís nominee company (effective 19 December 1989) ï A solicitor (applies only to operations of that solici- torís trust account - effective 19 December 1989) ï A person whose tax returns are up to date, and whose most recent tax return includes total assessable income before deductions of more than $2 million ï A person who reasonably believes that his or her assessable income before deductions for the next accounting year will exceed $2 million ï A person whose income is wholly or partly exempt under section 61 because that person is one of the following: - A public authority - A local authority (effective 19 December 1989) - A friendly society - A society for scientific or industrial research - A charity - An estate applied for charitable purposes - A veterinary services promoter - A herd improvement promoter - An amateur sports promoter - A racing club - The trustee of a sick, accident, or death benefit fund (effective 19 December 1989) - A district improvement society - The trustees of Cornwall Park - A person whose income is exempted from income tax by an Act other than the Income Tax Act 1976 (effective 19 December 1989) (In these cases, the certificate of exemption relates only to the tax-exempt activity). ï A non-profit body whose income, in its last account- ing year, did not exceed the exemption threshold of $1,000. If an entity is seeking approval as a charity, amateur sports promoter, or other non-profit organisation, it must supply a copy of its constitution with the applica- tion. Any organisation without a constitution or set of rules controlling the use of funds by members will not be considered for a certificate of exemption. Any other person or entity who is applying for a certifi- cate of exemption will not generally need to supply any supporting evidence. continued on page 12 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) ï The person will or will be likely to be entitled to claim RWT credits exceeding his or her income tax liability by an amount of at least $500. Such an applicant must supply budgeted accounts detailing the projected income, deductions, RWT credits and income tax liability, as well as any other informa- tion required by the Commissioner. In some cases, the Commissioner will accept pro forma accounts rather than full budgeted accounts if the applicant is a com- pany in receivership or liquidation and is not able to produce full accounts to confirm the losses. The circum- stances in which the Commissioner will accept pro forma accounts are set out in TIB Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) at page 41. Part-time domestic work - tax treatment of payments Introduction This item states the tax treatment of payments made for domestic work. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1976. Background Many householders engage people such as gardeners, cleaners, or nannies to perform part-time work in private residences. Such workers often fall within the statutory definition of ìprivate domestic workerî. When they do, the householder does not have to deduct PAYE from the payment, as would be the case in a normal employment situation. The domestic worker is responsi- ble for paying the tax. Inland Revenue has received a number of enquiries as to when these provisions apply. This item identifies the type of worker who meets the definition of ìprivate domestic workerî, and explains the correct tax treat- ment of payments made to these people. Legislation Section 338 states: 338(1) For the purpose of enabling the collection of income tax from employees by instalments, where an employee receives a source deduction payment from an employer, the employer or other person by whom the payment is made shall, at the time of making the payment, make a tax deduction therefrom in accordance with this Part of this Act: Provided that no tax deduction need be made from any source deduction payment made to any employee in respect of his employment as a private domestic worker: Provided also that if a tax deduction is not made by the employer in any such case section 355 of this Act shall apply to the employee. Section 355 requires the employee to furnish a return and pay any tax due by the 20th of the month following the month in which the payment was made. Section 2 defines the term ìPrivate domestic workerî: ìPrivate domestic workerî means a person employed by any other person where - (a) The employer is the occupier or one of the occupiers of a dwellinghouse or other premises used exclusively for residential purposes; and (b) The employment is for the performance of work in or about the dwellinghouse or premises or the garden or grounds appurtenant thereto; and (c) The employment is not in relation to any business carried on by the employer or to any occupation or calling of the employer; and (d) The employment is not regular full-time employment. Section 2 defines the terms ìEmployeeî and ìEm- ployerî: ìEmployeeî means a person who receives or is entitled to receive a source deduction payment: ìEmployerî means a person who pays or is liable to pay a source deduction payment; and includes -... Section 6(1) defines the term ìSource deduction pay- mentî: 6(1) Source deduction payment ì...means a payment by way of salary or wages, an extra emolument, or a withholding payment.î Summary and application Generally, an employer must deduct PAYE from a source deduction payment (that is, from any payment that is salary or wages, an extra emolument, or a withholding payment). An exception to this general rule is a payment made to a private domestic worker. In no case is the person making a payment to a private domestic worker obliged to make a tax deduction from that payment. Section 355 imposes tax obligations on the worker. Commissioner’s discretion under sec 327M(12) The Commissioner has a discretion under section 327M(12) to grant a certificate of exemption to persons who do not fall within the section 327M(1) list. The Commissioner may do this where he believes that the person will meet one of the following conditions during the period covered by the certificate: ï The person will or is likely to incur a loss. ï The person will or is likely to have no taxable income because his or her aggregate tax deductions are equal to or exceed his or her assessable income from page 11 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) ìPrivate domestic worker ì is defined in section 2. It means a person who is employed by the occupier of premises which are used exclusively for residential purposes, to do work in or about the premises or the garden or grounds. The employment must not be related to any business carried on by the employer, and must not be regular full-time employment. For example, a student hired by a householder as a part-time nanny or gardener is a private domestic worker. The definition requires a ìprivate domestic workerî to be a person ìemployed byî another person, referred to in the definition as the ìemployerî. The terms ìemployeeî and ìemployerî are also defined in section 2. For the purposes of the Act, an ìemployeeî is a person who receives a source deduction payment. This is a person who receives a payment that is salary or wages, an extra emolument, or a withholding payment. With- holding payments are payments to people who are independent contractors, and which are made for particular kinds of work specified in the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979. “Private domestic workers” can receive withholding payments The concept of employment in the section 2 definition of ìemployeeî applies to ìprivate domestic workersî. This means that a person who does part-time work for a householder, and who is covered by the withholding payments rules, is a private domestic worker. An example of this is a freelance musician who is hired to play for a private party at a residence. Tax treatment A householder does not have to deduct tax from pay- ments made to a private domestic worker. This type of worker accounts for tax directly to Inland Revenue under section 355 on the 20th of each month, using forms IR†66N and IR†56. ACC earner premium Similarly, householders do not have to deduct earner premium from payments made to private domestic workers. The same rule applies as for income tax. Section 355 imposes the obligation on the worker. Payments by householders to other part-time workers The only people doing part-time work for householders who do not come within the definition of private domestic worker are those who can show that they are independent contractors, and not covered by the With- holding Payments Regulations. Such workers are provisional taxpayers, and the householder is not concerned with their tax. An example is a tradesman engaged to repair plumbing or electrical circuits. There is no obligation on the householder to deduct tax from payments made to these workers as they are provisional taxpayers and meet their own tax obliga- tions. Determination G27: Swaps The Director of Rulings recently signed a determination detailing the periodic recognition of income and expenditure from financial arrangements referred to as swaps. Swaps typically involve the exchange of payment streams without necessarily requiring an exchange of principal. This determination details the general principle of treating a swap as if it comprises two simultaneous loans. It provides methods to spread income or expenditure arising from the most commonly undertaken swap transactions. It does not apply to the more complex swaps such as those involving commodi- ties, equity, property, more than two currencies, or an amortisation or accretion of principal. Of the four methods, method C will most commonly apply: ï Method C requires the person to treat the swap as if it comprises two simultaneous loans and then to apply the normal accrual rules to these deemed loans. The other three methods recognise that persons may adopt alternative methods to method C subject to the specific statutory provisions that apply: ï Method A applies to persons who can have regard to market valuation under subsection 64C(4) of the Act. ï Method B enables the use of Determination G14, issued by the Commissioner under section 64E of the Act, if the swap involves a forward contract for the exchange of currencies. ï Method D acknowledges that a person may adopt an alternative method to method C, under the provisions of paragraph 64C(3)(a), if that method has regard to the principles of accrual accounting, conforms with commercially acceptable practice, is consistently applied, and the amounts are not materially different from those calculated under method C. The determination applies to all qualifying swaps entered into after 19 January 1995. This is the date of publication of the determination in the New Zealand Gazette. The full text of the determination is printed in the appendix to this TIB. 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) Income Tax Act 1976 Tax on diplomat’s private investment income sourced from within New Zealand Section 61(50) - Incomes wholly exempt from tax: A foreign diplomat serving in New Zealand has had resident withholding tax (RWT) deducted from the inter- est earned on his private bank account. The diplomat believes that diplomats are not required to pay tax in the host country. He has asked that the RWT be re- funded to him. The Income Tax Act imposes tax on all New Zealand sourced income, unless it is specifically exempted. Section 61(50) exempts any: “Income expressly exempted from income tax by any other Act, to the extent of the exemption so provided:” Under the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act 1968 and the Consular Privileges and Immunities Act 1971, income derived from employment as a diplomat and income from sources outside New Zealand is exempt from New Zealand income tax. That exemption does not apply to a diplomat’s private income, such as investments made or held in New Zealand. Unless the double taxation agreement between the diplomat’s home country and New Zealand specifies otherwise, the interest earned is subject to tax in New Zealand, and the section 61(50) exemption cannot apply. Questions we’ve been asked This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts.

He has asked if the cost of the course is tax deductible. Section 104 allows a deduction for expenditure incurred in gaining or producing assessable income, or necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for that purpose. If the expenditure incurred in attending a stress management course is necessarily incurred in carrying on the fashion designer’s business, a deduction is allowable for the course fee. However, if the course fee is not necessarily incurred in carrying on the business nor incurred in gaining or producing as- sessable income, a deduction is not allowed under section 104. Notwithstanding section 104, section 106(1)(j) also prohibits a deduction of, “Any expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature”. In this case, a deduction was not allowed as the stress management course was not necessarily incurred in carrying on the fashion designer’s business, but was undertaken as a result of his marriage breakdown and family problems. If the designer attended the stress management course due to stress in the work place, the expense would be necessarily incurred in carrying on the fashion designer’s business and would be deductible. Deductibility of viticulture expenses Section 104 - Expenditure or loss incurred in production of assessable income: A taxpayer asked if she could deduct the costs of attending viticulture training seminars and fees incurred in joining wine growers’ organisations. The taxpayer has already planted grape vines, but it will be some time before she will derive any income from her viticulture business. Currently she receives employment income. Section 104 permits a deduction for expenditure incurred in gaining or produc- ing assessable income for any income year, or necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for that purpose. Each case must be examined on its facts to deter- mine whether the expenditure is sufficiently linked to the taxpayer’s income- earning process. Whether or not a business is being carried on needs to be deter- mined on a case by case basis. In this instance, the training seminars and membership fees to the wine growers’ organisations are deductible, as the expenses are sufficiently connected with the viticulture business activities. Whether Lotto franchise fees are depreciable Section 107A - Interpretation - depreciation: A taxpayer has asked whether franchise fees paid to the New Zealand Lotteries Commission are depreciable under the new depreciation regime. Section 108 provides for an annual depreciation deduction for depreciable prop- erty. Section 107A defines “depreciable property” as property which might reasonably be expected in normal circumstances to decline in value while used or available for use in gaining or producing assessable income, or in carrying on a business for that purpose. The depreciation regime extends the definition of continued on page 16 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) “depreciable property” to the types of intangible assets listed in the 22nd Sched- ule to the Income Tax Act 1976. Before operating a New Zealand Lotteries Commission franchise, the franchisee must pay a one-off franchise fee to the New Zealand Lotteries Commission. Under the terms of the agreement entered into between the franchisee and the Commission, the value of the intangible property rights acquired by the franchisee is not reasonably expected in normal circumstances to decline in value while used or available for use by the franchisee. Therefore, the franchise fee does not fall within the section 107A definition of “depreciable property”, and the franchisee cannot claim a depreciation deduction on it. Public Information Bulletin 179 (May 1989) addresses the issue of whether the Lotto franchise fee is deductible. The Commissioner’s policy is that the franchise fee is a capital expense and therefore not deductible to the retailer. Deduction for new fencing on a forestry block Section 128B - Expenditure on land improvements used for forestry: A farmer is constructing new fences on a forestry block. In the past, she claimed a deduc- tion of 10 percent per year on the diminished value of her fences under section 128B. She has asked if the 10 percent deduction applies in the 1995-96 income year and subsequent years. Section 128B allows a yearly deduction for certain expenditure on land improve- ments in the forestry industry. Although depreciation is not allowed on land itself because land does not depreciate, certain land improvements are deprec- iable. The amount of land improvement expenditure which can be claimed as a deduction is reduced by the total of both of these amounts: • Every amount of the expenditure which has been allowed as a deduction to any taxpayer in any preceding income year • Every amount of the expenditure which has been allowed as a deduction under any other section of the Act in that income year. A deduction is not allowed in the income year in which the taxpayer sells or otherwise disposes of that land, or when the taxpayer ceases to carry on the forestry business on that land. The types of expenditure and the rates of deduction are set out in Part II of the Thirteenth Schedule to the Act. Paragraph (j) of Part II of the Thirteenth Sched- ule relates to expenditure incurred in the construction of fences on the land. For any expenditure incurred in the taxpayer’s 1995-96 income year, the rates set out in the Thirteenth Schedule are increased by 20 percent on the previous rate. In this case, the farmer is eligible for a deduction under section 128B for the new fences. In the 1995-96 income year, the rate set out under paragraph (j) of Part II of the Thirteenth Schedule is increased by 20 percent on the previous rate, e.g. the rate of 10 percent becomes 12 percent. Income tax consequences when land development encouragement loan remitted Section 172 - Specified suspensory loans: A farmer had a land development encouragement loan (a specified suspensory loan under section 172(1)), which was remitted by the Rural Bank. He has asked about the income tax conse- quences of this remission. The loan involved is a pre-accruals loan, so the accrual rules will not apply to it. from page 15 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) Under section 172(2), when a taxpayer’s liability under a loan is wholly or partly remitted, the amount remitted is deemed to be assessable income derived equally in three income years. Those three years are the year in which the amount is remitted, and the next two succeeding income years. However, the proviso to section 172(2) allows a taxpayer to elect to reallocate all or part of the amount which has been deemed to be income derived in either of the “next two succeeding income years”. This income may be reallocated to either the year in which the amount was remitted, or the year following that year. Such an election is irrevocable. A taxpayer who wants to make such an election must send it to the Commis- sioner within the time for filing the tax return for the year to which the income is to be allocated. The Commissioner may allow extra time for making this elec- tion. Example: Farmer Brown has a 30 June balance date. He had his land development encour- agement loan of $9,000 fully remitted in June 1994. Under section 172(2), the $9,000 is deemed to be assessable income derived as follows: • $3,000 in the year ended 30/6/94, being the year the amount is remitted • $3,000 in each of the years ending 30/6/95 and 30/6/96, being the next two succeeding income years. However, under the proviso to section 172(2), Farmer Brown could elect to have all or part of the $6,000 assessable in the “next two succeeding income years” treated as income in any earlier year of the three-year period. Definition of a “work related vehicle” for FBT purposes Section 336N(1) - Work related vehicle: A company director has asked whether the van that his company has purchased will qualify for the “work related vehicle” fringe benefit tax (FBT) exemption. The company director has advised that the van has seating for ten people and is signwritten with the company’s name. The company does not have adequate secure parking at its premises, so the company’s production manager is required to garage the vehicle overnight at his home. Benefits provided to employees are liable to FBT. Motor vehicles that are avail- able for employees’ private use or enjoyment are subject to FBT, unless other- wise exempted. One such exemption applies to work related vehicles. Under section 336N(1), a vehicle is a “work related vehicle” if it meets all of these conditions: • It is a motor vehicle, but not a motorcar • It has the employer’s name, logo, or acronym prominently and permanently displayed on it. • On the day in question, it is used (or available for use) by the employee, but only for travel between the employee’s home and work, or for other incidental private use arising through the performance of the employee’s duties. The terms “motor vehicle” and “motorcar” are defined terms, and the distinction is important in this case. A “motor vehicle” is a motor vehicle as defined in section 2(1) of the Transport Act 1962, but it does not include a vehicle that has a gross laden weight of more continued on page 18 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) than 3,500 kilograms. Most motor vehicles on New Zealand roads will meet the Transport Act’s definition of a motor vehicle. A “motorcar” is defined as: “... a motor vehicle (other than a motor cycle or a moped or a minibus) designed exclusively or principally for the carriage of persons; and includes a motor vehicle designed principally for the carriage of passengers but which has rear doors or collaps- ible rear seats; but does not include a motor vehicle that is a taxicab”. Note that the definition of motorcar excludes a “minibus”. A minibus is defined in section 336N(1) as being: “... a motor vehicle, designed exclusively or principally for the carriage of persons, the interior of which contains either- (a) Three seats, each of which is designed for the seating of 2 or more adult persons and each of which is permanently affixed to the motor vehicle and is neither collapsible nor capable of being folded down; or (b) Contains more than 3 seats, of which not less than 3 are each designed for the seating of 2 or more adult persons and are each permanently affixed to the motor vehicle and are each neither collapsible nor capable of being folded down.” The company’s van in this case qualifies as a minibus. The company director has confirmed that the van is signwritten with the company’s name, and that the only private use available to the production manager (the employee) is travel between his home and work. Therefore, as long as these conditions continue to be met, the work related vehicle FBT exemption is available and no FBT will be payable. Lump sum payment made by employee into superannuation fund Section 336ZB - Deduction of specified superannuation contribution withhold- ing tax: A taxpayer won a cash prize in a lottery. She decided to save some of the winnings for her retirement by paying a lump sum into the superannuation scheme run by her employer, so as to boost her eventual payments from the fund. Her employer has told her that a tax at 33 cents in the dollar is applied to contributions to a superannuation fund. She asks if her employer is correct. Under section 336ZB, an employer must deduct specified superannuation contri- bution withholding tax (SSCWT) from any specified superannuation contribu- tion. A “specified superannuation contribution” is defined in section 2 as: “an employer superannuation contribution (being a contribution in money) made to a superannuation fund on or after the 1st day of April 1989". An “employer superannuation contribution” is also defined in section 2, and means: “any superannuation contribution provided by an employer for the benefit of an em- ployee or employees of that employer”. As the taxpayer’s employer is not making the payment in this instance, SSCWT does not have to be paid. from page 17 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) Contracting out of the employment relationship Section 338 - Tax deductions to be made by employers: A taxpayer has entered into a contract to work as a full-time housekeeper. She and her employer have agreed that they will call the contract a contract for services (as opposed to a contract of employment) and that they will call her an independent contractor in that contract. She asks whether she can account for her own taxes on the pay- ments she receives. An employer is not required to deduct taxes from payments made to a “private domestic worker”. However, this taxpayer is not a “private domestic worker” because the definition of that term in section 2 excludes people in regular full- time employment. An employer must deduct taxes from salary or wages paid to an employee. Legal tests developed by the Courts determine whether a person is an employee or self-employed. Inland Revenue explains these tests in TIB Volume Four, No.7 (March 1993) in an article titled “Employee or Independent Contractor”. We also explain how to apply these tests in our “Employers’ Guide” (IR 184), and in our “Self-employed or an employee?” leaflet (IR 186). Alternatively, Tax Education Office Newsletter No.63 (18 November 1992) reproduces Inland Revenue’s checklists for guidance in deciding whether a taxpayer is self-employed or an employee. A close examination of the terms of the contract between the parties, in conjunc- tion with their intentions and actions, will determine whether a taxpayer is self- employed or an employee. The parties to a contract cannot contract out of what is an employment relationship simply by labelling the contract a contract for services and calling the employee an independent contractor. Family Support - effect of receiving free board and lodging Section 374B(1) - Assessable income or loss: An employee who worked for a religious order was assessed by Inland Revenue for the value of board and lodging supplied by his employer. The employee has asked how the value of board and lodging affected his Family Support calculation. The determination of assessable income for Family Support purposes is calcu- lated on the level of the family’s income for the year and the number of children cared for. When an employer provides free board or lodgings, the value of the accommo- dation is monetary remuneration (salary and wages) which must be added to the employee’s salary or wages. Therefore, the value of such board and lodging is included as income for the purposes of calculating Family Support. Use-of-money interest and companies with residual income tax of $30,000 or less Section 398A(2) - Interest payable: A company secretary has asked whether a company in its first year of operation is liable to pay use-of-money interest. The company’s residual income tax (RIT), i.e. tax to pay at the end of the year, was $13,000. Use-of-money interest is charged if RIT is greater than $2,500. All companies are charged use-of-money interest if RIT is greater than $2,500, and their provisional tax paid, including voluntary payments, is less than the RIT. continued on page 20 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) Section 398A(2) provides for the charging of use-of-money interest. The amount of interest charged is calculated on a daily basis at a rate set by Order in Council. The interest is charged on the difference between the provisional tax paid by the third instalment and the taxpayer’s actual RIT for the income year. The reverse also applies, so that Inland Revenue pays use of money interest on overpaid provisional tax. The Commissioner’s policy on the provisional tax rules for the 1994-95 year onwards is set out on page 14 of TIB Volume Five, No.11 (April 1994). Compa- nies which begin a taxable activity during the 1994-95 income year are liable for use-of-money interest if their RIT for the current year is greater than $2,500. If their RIT is $30,000 or less, two-way interest applies from the third provisional tax instalment date. Use of money interest applies from the first provisional tax instalment date for taxpayers whose RIT is over $30,000. Use of money interest is calculated using the following formula set out in section 398A(3): a x b 365 In this formula: a is the amount of income tax that is payable in an income year, less any provi- sional tax paid b is the specified rate of interest applying (currently 6%). In this case, the company is liable for use of money interest, charged as follows: a = $13,000 b= 6% $13,000 x 6%= $2.14 use of money interest payable for each day of the 365interest liability period specified in section 398A(2). Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Coverage of activities under GST registration Section 6 - Meaning of term “taxable activity”: A GST registered builder plans to buy a small farm. He has asked if his current registration will cover the farm- ing activity. Once a person is registered for GST, the registration covers all taxable activities undertaken by that person. However, each separate activity must be a taxable activity in terms of section 6(1)(a). A taxable activity is: “Any activity which is carried on continuously or regularly by any person, whether or not for a pecuniary profit, and involves or is intended to involve, in whole or in part, the supply of goods and services to any other person for a consideration; and includes any such activity carried on in the form of a business, trade, manufacture, profession, voca- tion, association, or club.” Section 6(3)(a) excludes from this definition: “Being a natural person, any activity carried on essentially as a private recreational pursuit or hobby.” Provided the farming activity is a “taxable activity”, and not a private recrea- tional pursuit or hobby, the builder’s original registration will also cover the farming activity. from page 19 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) Evidence of export for goods sent by mail Section 11(1) - Zero-rated goods: A GST registered person intends to export some products by mail. She asked what documentation she must hold as evi- dence of having exported those goods. If a supplier sends goods overseas, section 11(1) allows GST to be charged on the goods at zero percent. To qualify for this zero-rating, the goods must be (or be intended to be) exported by the supplier under the Customs Act 1966, or the supplier must be able to satisfy the Commissioner that the goods have been exported by the supplier to a place outside New Zealand. For exports with a value of $1,000 or more, a customs export entry is required. The export entry and a copy of an international parcels customs declaration (Form C2/CP3) stamped by a postal officer when the parcel is posted, are suffi- cient evidence of export. A customs export entry is not required for exports with a value of less than $1,000. Acceptable evidence of export is either an international parcels customs declaration, (Form C2/CP3 for parcels with a value of $620 or more, or Form C1 for parcels with a value of less than $620) stamped by a postal officer at the time of posting, or a till receipt for the overseas postage. The article on page 13 of TIB Volume Six, No.7 deals with the zero-rating of exported goods in more detail. GST input tax deductions - goods acquired before registration Section 20(3) - Deductions from output tax: A taxpayer owns two commercial properties which are rented. At present the total rental income is less than $30,000 each year and the taxpayer is not liable to register for GST. She is consid- ering registering voluntarily and has asked what input tax deductions she could claim if she were to register. Since no input tax deduction has previously been claimed, provided the proper- ties were acquired on or after 1 October 1986, section 21(5) permits an input tax deduction to be made when the taxpayer registers in her own name. The amount of input tax to be deducted is one-ninth of the lesser of these values: • The cost of the properties • Their open market value. No input tax can be deducted for properties acquired before 1 October 1986. In addition, some expenses, such as insurance and rates, relating to the two properties may have been paid in advance. Provided the taxpayer holds the relevant tax invoices (if more than $50), she may claim an input tax deduction for these expenses, on a pro rata basis, in her first GST return. Unclaimed Money Act 1971 Voluntarily paying unclaimed wages to Inland Revenue as unclaimed money Section 4 - Unclaimed money/section 5 - Holder: An employer has made sev- eral attempts to locate a former employee in order to pay wages owing. The employer has asked if he can pay the money to Inland Revenue as unclaimed money under the Unclaimed Money Act 1971. continued on page 22 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) Section 4 states what unclaimed money consists of, and section 4(1)(e) covers money such as wages. Under section 4(1)(e), the money must have been held by the holder (i.e. the employer) for a period of six years following the date when the wages became payable by the employer. Under section 4(3), if the holder has ceased business or died, and the holder (or the holder’s representative) has held or owed unclaimed money for six months or longer immediately after the date of cessation or death, the money can be paid to Inland Revenue together with particulars of the payment. Section 5(2) deems any person, firm, body, or institution to be a holder of such money held or owing by that person or entity. The employer must hold the unpaid wages for six years before passing them to Inland Revenue as unclaimed money, unless he dies or ceases business. In either of these circumstances, if the money remains unclaimed for six months follow- ing the date of death or cessation of business, it may then be paid to Inland Revenue. As a holder of unclaimed money, under section 13 the employer is also responsible for: • maintaining an unclaimed money register • notifying the owners and Inland Revenue of the register entries annually • paying unclaimed money to Inland Revenue when required • allowing Inland Revenue access to the register. An employer who does not meet these obligations can be fined up to $500 by the courts for each offence. See TIB Volume Five, No.7 (December 1993) for an explanation of how the Unclaimed Money Act operates. Upcoming TIB articles In the next few months we’ll be releasing policy statements on these topics in the Tax Information Bulletin: • Valuation of bailed livestock • Special tax codes - their use and operation • Tax treatment of directors’ indemnity insurance • Can a qualifying trust retain its status if there is no trustee income? • The valuation for gift duty purposes of a fractional interest in land • Imputation penalty tax and additional tax under the imputation rules • The Commissioner’s powers under section 400 • Eligibility of self-employed persons for Guaranteed Minimum Family Income (GMFI) • When Inland Revenue can grant relief from paying tax in cases of financial hardship • Meaning of terms “own” and “acquired” for depreciation purposes • GST and rates apportionment We’ll publish these statements as soon as we’ve finished consulting with commentators outside Inland Revenue. from page 21 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) Legal decisions - case notes This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council.

Although the taxpayer received indirect benefits as a result of on-lending the money (by way of increased salary from the company), the loan did not gain or produce income for the taxpayer in any direct sense. Facts:The taxpayer had extensive business interests, including a majority shareholding in a company, VHL. VHL distributed its profits to the taxpayer and his wife by way of salary. In 1984 the taxpayer borrowed money from an overseas lender which he on-lent to VHL interest-free and on-demand. VHL used the money to pay off mortgages over some of its land. The savings VHL made from not hav- ing to pay interest on the mortgages enabled it to earn larger profits than it would otherwise have earned. These increased profits were distributed to the taxpayer and his wife by way of larger salaries. There was no written agreement between the taxpayer and VHL concerning the terms of the loan. In 1990 the taxpayer and VHL agreed that VHL would pay interest to the taxpayer, retrospectively, for the period 1984 to 1990. The taxpayer sought to deduct the interest he paid to the overseas lender. The Commissioner denied a deduction for the 1987, 1988 and 1989 income years. continued on page 24 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) from page 23 Decision:Judge Barber confirmed the Commissioner’s assessment for the three income years. The taxpayer was not entitled to an interest deduction. Section 106(1)(h)(ia) allows a deduction for interest necessarily payable in carry- ing on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income. Judge Barber found that the taxpayer could not use section 106(1)(h)(ia) to de- duct the interest because he was not in the business of lending money or being a financier. Section 106(1)(h)(i) allows a deduction for interest payable in gaining or produc- ing assessable income. In applying section 106(1)(h)(i) the TRA looked at the actual use of the funds. Judge Barber found that the taxpayer could not deduct the interest under section 106(1)(h)(i) because the loan capital was not used by the taxpayer to gain income. There were indirect benefits to the taxpayer, through the increased salary, but no income from the loan itself. The indirect benefits were not sufficiently connected to the taxpayer’s own income-earning process to allow interest deductibility. Judge Barber said that deductibility does not flow from indirect or side benefits of a loan but from the direct financial advantage from the actual use of the loan capital. In his decision Judge Barber applied and extended the reasoning in Case Q35 (1993) 15 NZTC 5, 171, and cited with approval Pacific Rendezvous Ltd v CIR (1986) 8 NZTC 5, 146, Eggers v CIR (1988) 10 NZTC 5153 and CIR v Brierley (1990) 12 NZTC 7184 (CA). He did not apply the reasoning in the Australian case of FCT v Total Holdings (Aust) Pty Ltd 79 ATC 4, 279. The taxpayer’s attempt to retrospectively impose interest was ineffective. When taxpayers create records that do not accurately reflect the character of a prior transaction, they will not change the nature of that transaction. The TRA found that VHL was under no obligation to pay interest until 1990. The agreement in 1990 to retrospectively charge interest for the period 1984 to 1990 did not change this. The TRA also considered the issue of deductibility of exchange variation losses under section 71. Although this was not in issue, the TRA’s view was that the taxpayer would have difficulty satisfying the requirements of section 71(3). In particular, it would be difficult for the taxpayer to show his borrowings were in relation to a business he was carrying on in New Zealand. Judge Barber noted that it would have been reasonably straightforward for the taxpayer to achieve interest and foreign exchange variation deductibility by structuring the loan differently. However, he concluded that he had to apply the law to the arrangements actually undertaken, not arrangements that could have been used. Comment:The taxpayer is not appealing this decision. Former section 129: sale or disposition before 1 April 1983 Rating:•• Case:Peter McKay and Colin Malcolm Bell v Commissioner of Inland Revenue M681/94 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, former section 129 Keywords:Sale or disposition, oral agreement, interest deductions Summary:An oral agreement made before 1 April 1983 for the sale of land was later ef- fected by a written contract in December 1983. The oral contract was held to be a “sale or disposition” for the purposes of section 129, and the interest clawback provisions of section 129 did not apply 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) Facts:The appellants appealed a decision of the Taxation Review Authority reported as Case M73 (1990) 12 NZTC 2427. The appellants owned land from which they carried on the business of motor car dealing. In December 1982 they entered into an oral agreement to sell the land to a third party. In December 1983 the appellants and the third party executed a written contract with the same material terms as the oral agreement for the sale of the land. The appellants claimed they sold the land to a third party under the oral agree- ment in December 1982. The Commissioner claimed the sale or disposition did not occur at the time of the oral agreement, but in December 1983, at the time of the written contract. Because there was a sale after 1 April 1983, the Commis- sioner added back the amounts of interest previously allowed as deductions as assessable income under section 129. The issue was whether the oral agreement meant there was a sale or disposition of the land before 1 April 1983, such that the transaction was not caught by the “interest clawback” provisions of section 129. Decision:Justice Blanchard found that as at 1 April 1983 and down to the date of the final execution of the agreement in December 1983 there was no enforceable agree- ment for the sale of the land. However Justice Blanchard found that, on the unusual facts of the case, in enter- ing into the written form of agreement and in conveying the land pursuant to it the parties were simply implementing the original oral agreement of sale. Justice Blanchard thought that a “sale” in terms of section 129 meant there had to be a pre-April 1983 transaction which was at some time carried into effect. In other words, the transaction did not have to be carried into effect or performed before 1 April 1983. The question was therefore whether the December 1983 agreement was the same transaction as the December 1982 oral deal in all mate- rial respects. Justice Blanchard found that the terms and conditions contained in the Decem- ber 1983 written agreement were not materially different from the original oral agreement in December 1982. The written agreement was merely carrying into effect the oral agreement. In his view there was a sale of land before 1 April 1983 for the purposes of section 129 and the interest clawback provisions of section 129 did not apply. Comment:Inland Revenue is not appealing this decision. Allocation of profits in husband and wife rental partnership Rating:•• Case:TRA No. 94/116 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, section 97 Keywords:Partnership, allocation of profits and losses Summary:A husband and wife contributed $8,000 and $2,000 respectively to purchase a rental property. Outgoings were met from matrimonial money. Judge Barber held that losses from the property must be allocated 50/50, and not all to the husband as the taxpayers argued. Facts:A husband and wife contributed $8,000 and $2,000 respectively to purchase a rental property. The property was sold and another rental property purchased with the sale proceeds. They owned the properties as joint tenants. Outgoings continued on page 26 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) on the properties were met from matrimonial money. The husband was respon- sible for managing the properties. There was no written partnership agreement. The 1987 accounts were prepared for a partnership between the husband and wife, and losses were allocated on a 50/50 basis. However, from 1988 to 1992, the accounts allocated all rental losses to the husband. The Commissioner reassessed the losses and allocated them for the 1989 to 1992 years on a 50/50 basis. The Commissioner has discretion under section 97 of the Act to reallocate profits, income, or losses of a partnership between relatives if he is of the opinion that the share of profits or losses is not allocated reasonably. Decision:Judge Barber held that the husband and wife were partners carrying on a rental property business or income earnings process. The losses should be shared equally. Judge Barber rejected the submission that the rental losses should be allocated on the basis of the original contributions. His Honour’s decision was based on: • the further contributions from matrimonial property towards the mortgage and other outgoings • joint liability of the parties under the mortgage • the fact that both were ratepayers and on the Valuation New Zealand roll • the muddlement in the presentation of their accounts • the fact that the 100% allocation of losses to the husband could be viewed as self-serving from a taxation point of view. Comment:The taxpayer is not appealing this decision.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) - Appendix TIB Appendix Volume Six, No.8January 1995 Determination G27: Swaps This determination may be cited as ìDetermination G27: Swapsî. 1. Explanation (which does not form part of this determination) What is a swap? A swap is an agreement to exchange payment streams over a period of time, and these can involve different interest rate types, payment timing or intervals, currencies and/or commodities. However, this determination only applies to an interest rate swap, interest swap, currency swap (sometimes called a cross currency swap) or a swap that is a combination of these, where all payments are expressed in a currency or two different currencies and there is a fixed actual or notional principal agreed or implicit in respect of each side of the swap. This determination does not apply, for exam- ple, to commodity swaps, debt-equity swaps, debt- property swaps, swaps involving more than two currencies, or swaps involving the amortisation or accretion of principal. A swap has two sides (or legs). In the case of an interest rate swap, one side relates to the obligations of the parties to make payments of amounts calcu- lated by reference to the fixed rate of interest. The other side of the swap will be those obligations relating to the floating rate of interest. In the case of a currency swap, one side of the swap relates to those obligations expressed in one currency, and the other side of the swap will be those obligations expressed in the other currency. In the case of other types of interest swaps, the sides of the swap reflect the different bases upon which interest is payable. It is not necessary for there to be a physical ex- change of principal at the beginning and/or end of the swap, in addition to the interest or other pay- ments during the term of the swap. A swap is a financial arrangement subject to the accrual provisions of the Income Tax Act 1976. This determination sets out the method to be used to calculate income and expenditure under those provisions for swaps to which it applies. What methods can be used to calculate income and expenditure under a swap to which this determin- ation applies? Use A, B, C or D. A A method that has regard to market valuation under section 64C(4) of the Act. This method can be used where your business comprises dealing in swaps, or where the swap constitutes a forward or future contract for foreign exchange. Where the requirements of section 64C(4) are satisfied, and you choose to use a method under that provision, this determination ï requires that you adopt a mark to market method, ï requires that (so far as possible) you adopt that method in a consistent manner over the term of the swap, and ï specifies the markets and sources of informa- tion which you must use. B The method specified in Determination G14: Forward Contracts For Foreign Exchange And Commodities. Use this method where the swap involves a spot exchange at the current market spot rate and a future exchange of fixed amounts at a single fixed date and you do not adopt a method under section 64C(4). C The method provided for in this Determination. Use this method if you do not adopt a method under section 64C(4) and Determination G14 does not apply. This method requires you to ï treat the swap as if it comprised two simulta- neous loans, one from each party to the other, and ï then apply the normal accrual rules to these deemed loans. In this way, the appropriate recognition of income or expenditure under the swap (for income tax purposes) will result from the net effect of the combination of your accounting for the two deemed loans. D A method that satisfies the requirements of the proviso to paragraph (a) of section 64C(3) of the Act. You can use this method if it ï has regard to the principles of accrual accounting, ï conforms with commercially acceptable practice, ï (except to the extent that the Commissioner may otherwise allow under section 64C(4A) of the Act) is adopted, and is or will be consistently applied, by you in respect of all such financial arrangements for financial reporting purposes, and ï results in the allocation, to each income year, of amounts that are not materially different from the amounts that would be calculated under Method C. How to use method C Under this method ï ignore any offsetting of payments between the parties, so that every amount that would be payable under each side of the swap (if no provision was made for offsetting) is attributed to the relevant deemed loan and taken into account; 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) - Appendix ï treat each side of the swap as a separate loan of the appropriate amount, being the amount that is used to calculate the payments to be made under that side of the swap during its term. \[In situa- tions where the swap contract does not provide for the Principal Amount relating to each side of the swap to be both paid on the Effective Date and repaid on the Maturity Date, this Determina- tion treats such payment and repayment as taking place, by specifying the actual and deemed cashflows that are to be taken into account in the calculation of each partyís income or expenditure under each side of the swap\]; ï take into account, as cashflows subject to the yield to maturity or other method of calculating income or expenditure applicable under the accrual provisions or relevant determinations, fees payable in relation to the swap that qualify as Fee Amounts (reduced by the amount of item z in section 64BA(2) or 64BA(3) of the Act), any payment made that is intended to compensate one of the parties for a difference in the values of the anticipated cashflows under the swap, and any consideration paid in connection with the assignment of a swap by or to an assignee. \[Apply each of them to only one of the two loans that the swap is deemed to comprise. You must elect which of the loans is to be treated in this way.\]; ï then, calculate the income derived or expenditure incurred by you for each of these deemed loans by applying the accrual provisions of the Act and determinations that would be applicable to such cashflows; ï where the relevant deemed loan is denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars and the swap does not provide for any actual payment of principal on the Maturity Date, and you are applying Determination G9A in calculat- ing the income or expenditure, ignore any actual or deemed payments of principal on the Effective Date when applying Determination G9A (except for the calculation of base currency income and expenditure). \[This is to ensure that the calcula- tions do not take account of fluctuations in the New Zealand dollar value of principal amounts denominated in the other currency where there is no actual repayment of principal\]. How are the parties to a swap described? According to the definition in the Act, each party is a ìholderî in relation to the swap. However, since the swap is treated as if it comprised two simultane- ous loans, each party will be a ìholderî and an ìissuerî for the purposes of the calculations under this Determination. How is income or expenditure calculated in the year the swap matures or is disposed of? Calculate income or expenditure under the base price adjustment described in section 64F of the Act. Make that adjustment in relation to the swap as a whole, and treat each party as a ìholderî. 2. Reference This determination is made pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (d) of section 64E(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 3. Scope of Determination This determination applies to any arrangement that is an Interest Rate Swap, Interest Swap, Currency Swap, Interest Rate and Currency Swap, or Interest and Currency Swap entered into after the date upon which this determination is published in the New Zealand Gazette (except where it was entered into pursuant to a binding contract entered into before that date), where (a) all payments under the swap are expressed in a currency or two (but not more than two) different currencies; and (b) either - (i) a notional or actual principal is specified in the swap contract in relation to each side of the swap; or (ii) a notional principal is implicit in the compu- tation of the cashflows payable by the parties in relation to each side of the swap, and (c) the Principal Amount relating to each side of the swap is fixed in terms of the relevant currency; and (d) there are no payments made, or to be made, under or in relation to the swap other than payments that are (i) actual payments of the Principal Amount made on either or both of the Effective Date and the Maturity Date that form part of a Principal Exchange; (ii) payments made during the term of the swap of amounts calculated by applying the Agreed Rate to the Principal Amount; (iii) a payment made on the Effective Date of any Compensatory Amount; (iv) a payment made on the Effective Date of any Fee Amount that is less than the Principal Amount; or (v) a combination of any two or more of the payments referred to in paragraphs (i) to (iv) above. 4. Principle (1) Subject to sub-clauses 4(3) and 4(5) below, if you are a party to a swap to which this Determination applies, calculate income derived or expenditure incurred as if each side of the swap was a separate, simultaneous and mutual loan between you and the other party. Then apply the accrual provisions of the Act and determinations that would be applicable to such loans to calculate the income derived or expendi- ture incurred by you. (2) Take fees payable in relation to the swap that qualify as Fee Amounts (reduced by the amount of item z in section 64BA(2) or 64BA(3) of the 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) - Appendix Act) into account as cashflows subject to the yield to maturity or other method of calculating income or expenditure applicable under the accrual provisions or determinations made thereunder. Apply them to either one of the two loans the swap is deemed to comprise, at your option. Accord the same treatment to any payment made by one party to the swap to the other that is intended to compensate the latter for a difference in the values of the anticipated cashflows under the swap, and to any considera- tion paid in connection with the assignment of the swap by or to the assignee. (3) If your business comprises dealing in swaps, or if you are a party to a swap that constitutes a forward or future contract for foreign exchange, you may use a mark to market method to calcu- late the income derived or expenditure incurred under a relevant swap provided that the require- ments of section 64C(4) of the Act are satisfied. (4) For the purposes of sub-clause 4(3) above, a mark to market method is one that reflects the revaluation of the swap at its current market value. You must compute such market value by reference to or by interpolation from one or more rates or yields, published electronically by Reuters New Zealand Limited or Telerate New Zealand Limited on the relevant date, that are (a) relevant (as regards quality, term and cur- rency) to the particular swap or the relevant side of it; and (b) quoted with respect to markets that have been approved by the Commissioner by Determina- tion. (5) If you are a party to a swap that involves a spot exchange at the current spot rate and a future exchange of fixed amounts at a single fixed date, and you do not use a mark to market method under section 64C(4), use the method specified in Determination G14: Forward Contracts For Foreign Exchange And Commodities. 5.

(c) Where the swap is a Currency Swap, an Interest Rate and Currency Swap or an Interest and Currency Swap (i) the rights and obligations of the parties to the swap that relate to the payment and computation of amounts expressed in one currency constitute one ìside of the swapî; and (ii) the rights and obligations of the parties to the swap that relate to the payment and computation of amounts expressed in the other currency constitute the other ìside of the swapî. (3) A determination to which this Determination refers may be varied, rescinded, restricted or extended by a new determination made by the Commissioner. In such a case, the reference to the old determination is taken to be extended to the new determination. 6. Method (1) If you may adopt a method that has regard to market valuation to calculate income and ex- penditure in respect of a swap pursuant to section 64C(4) of the Act, and you choose to do so, you must use a mark to market method. That method must also satisfy the requirements of section 64C(4) of the Act. For these purposes, this Determination approves the use of any rates or yields quoted with respect to markets that have been approved by the Commissioner by determination, and approves the use of any sources of information that have been approved by the Commissioner by determi- nation. If you have adopted such a method for calculat- ing the income or expenditure in respect of a swap in one income year, you must, so far as is possible, apply that method consistently, and having regard to the same published rates and yields, for subsequent income years over the term of the swap, unless the Commissioner otherwise allows. (2) If you are a party to a swap that involves a spot exchange at the current spot rate and a future exchange of fixed amounts at a single fixed date, and you do not use a mark to market method 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) - Appendix under section 64C(4), you must use the method specified in Determination G14: Forward Contracts For Foreign Exchange And Commodi- ties. (3) If you are a party to a swap to which this Deter- mination applies and Determination G14 does not apply, and you do not adopt a method under section 64C(4), you must (unless the proviso to paragraph (a) of section 64C(3) of the Act applies) calculate income deemed to be derived or expenditure deemed to be incurred by you as if each side of the swap comprised a separate, simultaneous and mutual loan between the parties to the swap. Each of the loans is to be characterised and treated according to the principles outlined in sub-clauses 6(4) to (7) below. (4) If the terms of the swap provide for the netting off or offsetting of any amounts payable to or by one party to the swap with any amounts payable to or by the other party to the swap, ignore such netting off or offsetting for the purposes of sub- clauses 6(3), (5), (6), and (7) of this Determina- tion. (5) Subject to sub-clause 6(4) above, treat the deemed loans referred to in sub-clause 6(3) above relating to each side of the swap as comprising the following cashflows: (a) Where the terms of the swap provide for both the payment of the Principal Amount by the Deemed Lender to the Deemed Borrower on the Effective Date, and the payment of the Principal Amount by the Deemed Borrower to the Deemed Lender on the Maturity Date, (i) the payment of the Principal Amount made by the Deemed Lender to the Deemed Borrower, on the Effective Date; (ii) the payment of the Principal Amount made by the Deemed Borrower to the Deemed Lender on the Maturity Date; and (iii) payments of all other amounts that are payable by either party to the other under the terms of the swap contract, and that relate to the relevant side of the swap, on the dates on which they are specified to be payable in the swap contract. (b) Where the terms of the swap provide for the payment of the Principal Amount by the Deemed Lender to the Deemed Borrower on the Effective Date, and no payment of the Principal Amount by the Deemed Borrower to the Deemed Lender on the Maturity Date, (i) the payment of the Principal Amount made by the Deemed Lender to the Deemed Borrower, on the Effective Date; (ii) a deemed payment of the Principal Amount made by the Deemed Borrower to the Deemed Lender on the Maturity Date; and (iii) payments of all other amounts that are payable by either party to the other under the terms of the swap contract, and that relate to the relevant side of the swap, on the dates on which they are specified to be payable in the swap contract. (c) Where the terms of the swap provide for no payment of the Principal Amount by the Deemed Lender to the Deemed Borrower on the Effective Date, but a payment of the Principal Amount by the Deemed Borrower to the Deemed Lender on the Maturity Date, (i) a deemed payment of the Principal Amount made by the Deemed Lender to the Deemed Borrower, on the Effective Date; (ii) the payment of the Principal Amount made by the Deemed Borrower to the Deemed Lender on the Maturity Date; and (iii) payments of all other amounts that are payable by either party to the other under the terms of the swap contract, and that relate to the relevant side of the swap, on the dates on which they are specified to be payable in the swap contract. (d) Where the terms of the swap do not provide for the payment of the Principal Amount by the Deemed Lender to the Deemed Borrower on the Effective Date, or for payment of the Principal Amount by the Deemed Borrower to the Deemed Lender on the Maturity Date, (i) a deemed payment of the Principal Amount made by the Deemed Lender to the Deemed Borrower, on the Effective Date; (ii) a deemed payment of the Principal Amount made by the Deemed Borrower to the Deemed Lender on the Maturity Date; and (iii) payments of all amounts that are payable by either party to the other under the terms of the swap contract, and that relate to the relevant side of the swap, on the dates on which they are specified to be payable in the swap contract. (6) Subject to sub-clause 6(4) above, apply the following provisions for the purpose of calculat- ing the income derived and expenditure incurred by a party to a swap: (a) Subject to paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) below, apply the accrual provisions and any relevant determinations to each of the deemed loans described in sub-clause 6(5) above. (b) Although both parties to the swap will be ìholdersî under the swap, in relation to each of the deemed loans treat a party as either a ìholderî or an ìissuerî in accordance with the terms of the loan (as described in sub- clause 6(5) above) and the definitions of ìholderî and ìissuerî in section 64B. 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) - Appendix (c) Where (i) a deemed loan is denominated in a currency other than New Zealand Dollars and Determination G9A would be applied to calculate the income and expenditure under the deemed loan, and (ii) there is no actual payment of the Princi- pal Amount on the Maturity Date, and (iii) either paragraph (b) or paragraph (d) of sub-clause 6(5) of this Determination applies to deem amounts to be paid or payable on the Maturity Date, then \[notwithstanding the requirements of Determination G9A and the terms of para- graphs (b) and (d) of sub-clause 6(5) of this Determination\] apply Determination G9A, in respect of that deemed loan, on the basis that any actual or deemed payment of the Princi- pal Amount on the Effective Date is not included as ìconsideration givenî for the purposes of items b and d in the formula contained in sub-clause 6(1) of that Determi- nation G9A and items f and h in the meaning of ìclosing tax book valueî in clause 5 of that Determination. (d) Take into account any Fee Amount payable in relation to the swap (reduced by the amount of item z in section 64BA(2) or 64BA(3) of the Act), any Compensatory Amount payable, and any Assignment Amount payable to or by a party as the assignee of the swap, as an amount or amounts subject to the yield to maturity or other method of calculating income or expenditure applicable under the accrual provisions or determinations made thereunder. However, apply each such amount to only one of the two loans the swap is deemed to comprise. You must elect which of the loans is to be treated in this way. (7) Where the terms of a swap are varied after the date it was entered into, and that variation alters the amounts payable (or the basis upon which the amounts payable are to be calculated) under the swap, or the dates upon which they are payable, apply Determination G25: Variations In The Terms of a Financial Arrangement (in combina- tion with this determination) as if the corre- sponding variation and alterations occurred with respect to the deemed loans described in sub- clause 6(5) above. 7. Examples (1) Example 1 - Deemed Loans Background Information This example illustrates the method outlined in sub-clause 6(3) of this determination. The swap is treated as if it comprised two simultaneous loans from each party to the other. Income derived or expenditure incurred is then calcu- lated in accordance with the Act and relevant determinations. In this example, there is a 3 year interest rate and currency swap from 15 September 1993 to 15 September 1996 between - (a) A New Zealand corporate borrower who has arranged a floating loan in United States dollars, with interest at LIBOR plus a mar- gin, payable semi-annually on 15 March and 15 September, and (b) A counterparty who has a fixed rate loan in New Zealand dollars, with interest at 12.5% payable semi-annually on 15 March and 15†September. The swap involves the LIBOR interest only, not the margin. Draw down of both loans occurs on 15 Septem- ber 1993. There are no fees. If the New Zealand dollar amount is $20m and the spot rate on 15 September 1993 is 0.5900, then the cashflows of the two parties before the swap are as follows - CorporateCounterparty $m USD$m NZD 15 September 1993 11.8020.00 15 March 1994(6 months LIBOR plus margin)(1.25) 15 September 1994 (6 months LIBOR plus margin)(1.25) 15 March 1995(6 months LIBOR plus margin)(1.25) 15 September 1995 (6 months LIBOR plus margin)(1.25) 15 March 1996(6 months LIBOR plus margin)(1.25) 15 September 1996 (11.80 plus 6 months LIBOR plus margin) (21.25) (brackets denote payments) The notional principal specified in the swap contract is NZ$20.00m = US$11.80m as at the starting date, since these have the same value. There is no exchange of principal on that date. Deemed Cashflows for the Corporate under the Swap Under the swap, the cashflows for the corporate (for the purposes of applying this determination) are as follows: DateLoan byLoan to CorporateCorporate $US dollarsNZ dollars $m$m 15 September 1993 - Deemed principal exchange (11.80)20.00 15 March 19946 months LIBOR(1.25) 15 September 19946 months LIBOR(1.25) 15 March 19956 months LIBOR(1.25) 15 September 19956 months LIBOR(1.25) 15 March 19966 months LIBOR(1.25) 15 September 1996 - Actual principal exchange 11.80(20.00) - Interest6 months LIBOR(1.25) where brackets denote payments by the corporate to the swap counterparty. 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) - Appendix Accrual Calculations Therefore, in determining its assessable income, the corporate would, using a Yield To Maturity or other method acceptable under the Act and the determinations, calculate: (i) expenditure under the fixed rate loan in New Zealand dollars (this could be done by Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method, or Determinations G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods and G11A: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity Method); and (ii) income under the floating rate loan in United States dollars (this could be done using Determination G26: Variable Rate Financial Arrangements, Determination G9A: Finan- cial Arrangements That Are Denominated In A Currency Or Commodity Other Than New Zealand Dollars, and Determination G6D: Foreign Currency Rates). The corporate remains responsible for settling its floating rate US dollar based loan with the original lender, and for the margin above LIBOR. If the original borrowings were already in existence on 15 September 1993, the analysis would be the same. Again, no payments would need to be made between the corporate and the swap counterparty on that date, but a notional principal is still required to calculate the floating rate interest amounts, and this principal would be used in the two notional loans. Final Calculation To calculate income or expenditure for the final year of the arrangement, the base price adjust- ment (described in section 64F of the Act) must be applied. The formula is a - (b + c). In making the base price adjustment at 31 March 1997, both parties are considered to be ìholdersî. The corporate would bring into account the following items (assuming no exchange of principal on 15†September 1993) - a = consideration paid or payable to the holder = the NZ dollar equivalent of US$11.80m on 15 September 1996 + the NZ dollar equivalents of LIBOR payments made from 15 March 1994 to 15 September 1996 inclusive. b = acquisition price (assume no fees) = value of all consideration provided by the holder = NZ$1.25m x 6 + 20.00m = NZ$27.50m c = amounts of income deemed to be derived less expenditure deemed to be incurred in the years ending 31 March 1994 to 31†March 1996 inclusive. (2) Example 2 - Deemed Loans and a Fee Payment Background Information To illustrate the allocation of a fee payment, it will be assumed that, in the example in sub-clause 7(1), the corporate pays fees of 30BP contingent upon the implementation of the swap, and that the corporate wishes to pay interest in advance in relation to a loan in New Zealand dollars. Deemed Cashflows for the Corporate under the Swap Therefore, under the swap, the cashflows for the corporate (for the purposes of applying this determi- nation) are as follows: DateLoan byFeesLoan to CorporateNZ dollars Corporate US dollars$mNZ dollars $m$m 15 September 1993 - Deemed principal exchange(11.80)20.00 - Fees(.06) - Interest (paid in advance)(5.50) 15 March 19946 mths LIBOR 15 September 1994 6 mths LIBOR 15 March 19956 mths LIBOR 15 September 1995 6 mths LIBOR 15 March 19966 mths LIBOR 15 September 1996 - Actual principal exchange11.80(20.00) - Interest6 months LIBOR where brackets denote payment by the corporate to the swap counterparty. Accrual Calculations In determining its assessable income, the corpo- rate must take into account the fees paid and allocate them to one of the loans. If the fees are treated by the corporate as being attached to the US dollar loan, they may be spread on a straight- line basis over the three years under method A of Determination G26. If, on the other hand, the fees were allocated to the NZ dollar loan, they would be spread using a yield to maturity method acceptable under the Act. In addition, the same methods outlined in sub- clause 7(1) would be used to determine: (i) expenditure under the fixed rate loan in New Zealand dollars (for example, Determination G3, or Determinations G10B and G11A - under these methods the $5.5m will be spread over the term of the swap); and (ii) income under the floating rate loan in United States dollars (for example, Determinations G26, G9A and G6D). 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) - Appendix (3) Example 3 - Assigning a Swap Background Information The situation where a party assigns a swap can be considered by assuming that, in the example in sub-clause 7(1), the corporate (ìcorporate Aî) assigned the swap to another corporate (ìcorpo- rate Bî) for consideration of $250,000 on 31 December 1994. Final Calculation for the Assignor In such a case, corporate A would apply the base price adjustment in the 1995 income year. Therefore, corporate A would bring into account the following items (assuming no exchange of principal on 15 September 1993) - a = consideration paid or payable to the holder = the NZ dollar equivalents of LIBOR payments made on 15 March 1994 and 15 September 1994 + $250,000 b = acquisition price = value of all consideration provided by the holder = NZ$1.25m x 2 = NZ$2.5m c = amounts of income deemed to be derived less expenditure deemed to be incurred in the year ending 31 March 1994 The formula is a - (b + c) and if the result is positive it will be income derived by the corpo- rate. If the result is negative the amount is an allowable deduction. Deemed Cashflows for the Assignee Under the swap, the cashflows for the assignee, corporate B, (for the purposes of applying this determination) are as follows: DateLoan by “B”Loan to “B” US dollarsNZ dollars $m$m 31 December 1994 \[ìeffective dateî\] - Deemed principal exchange(11.80)20.00 - Assignment fee(0.25) 15 March 19956 mths LIBOR(1.25) 15 September 19956 mths LIBOR(1.25) 15 March 19966 mths LIBOR(1.25) 15 September 1996 - Actual principal exchange11.80(20.00) - Interest6 mths LIBOR(1.25) where the bracket denotes payments by Corporate B to the swap counterparty. The assignment fee was allocated to the NZ dollar loan. Accrual Calculations for the Assignee Therefore, in determining its assessable income for the years ended 31 March 1995 and 1996, corporate B would, using a Yield to Maturity or other method acceptable under the Act and the determinations, calculate: (i) expenditure under the fixed rate loan in New Zealand dollars (this could be done by Determination G3, or Determinations G10B and G11A, resulting in the spreading of the $250,000 assignment consideration over the remaining term of the swap); and (ii) income under the floating rate loan in United States dollars (this could be done using Determinations G26, G9A, and G6D). Final Calculation for the Assignee To calculate income or expenditure for the final year of the arrangement (ending 31 March 1997) the base price adjustment must be applied. Corporate B would bring to account the follow- ing items: a = consideration paid or payable to the holder = NZ dollar equivalent of US$11.8m principal exchange on 15 September 1996 + NZ dollar equivalents of LIBOR payments made from 15 March 1995 to 15 September 1996 inclusive b = acquisition price = value of all consideration provided by the holder = NZ$0.25m assignment fee + $20.0 m principal exchange on 15 September 1996 + NZ$1.25m x 4 c = amounts of income deemed to be derived less expenditure deemed to be incurred in the years ending 31 March 1995 and 1996 inclusive Under the formula described in section 64F of the Act, the exchange variation on the principal sums included in the assigneeís base price adjustment will be the total movement from the initial date of the swap until maturity. That is, any exchange variation prior to the assignment is taken into account. It is assumed that the effect would be included in any assignment fee paid or received by the assignee. This determination is signed by me on the 16th day of January in the year 1995. Simon Sherry Director (Rulings)
1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 (February 1995) Using a special tax code Summary This item states the Commissioner’s current policy on issuing special tax code certificates, those who are eligible for such a certificate, and how they may apply. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1976. Background The purpose of a tax code is to set the amount of PAYE to be deducted from an employee’s salary or wages. An employee who expects the amount of PAYE deducted at ordinary rates from salary or wages during the year to exceed or be less than the end of year tax liability may apply to Inland Revenue for a special tax code certifi- cate. Section 351 gives the Commissioner the authority to issue a special tax code certificate at his discretion. When a special tax code is granted, the taxpayer gives it to the employer making the payment. The special tax code will increase or decrease the rate of tax deductions made by the employer. Policy Who may apply for a special tax code Any employee who expects the amount of ordinary rate PAYE deductions from salary or wages during the year to exceed or be less than the end of year tax liability may apply to Inland Revenue for a special tax code certificate (IR 23). How to get a special tax code An employee applies for a special tax code by filling in an IR 23B application form, and returning it to the local Inland Revenue office. Inland Revenue will then consider the application and approve a special tax code if one is appropriate. These are typical situations in which a special tax code is appropriate: • An employee has two or more jobs and the secondary employment PAYE deduction rate is too low. In this case the certificate will specify an increased rate of PAYE deductions for the secondary income. • The employee has no regular full-time employment, works at a series of casual jobs, and has no “primary” employment. The certificate will be addressed to all the employee’s employers generally. This may help employees who perform agricultural work, if their overall income is such that the rate of PAYE deduc- tions for casual agricultural employees is inadequate. • The employee conducts a business (including as a partner) which is operating at a loss, and can deduct the losses from employment income, or the employee is entitled to deduct past losses carried forward from employment income. If Inland Revenue approves a special tax code, we will issue a certificate which shows the duration of the code, the employment to which it relates, and the rate of PAYE deductions. When the employee receives the special tax code certificate, he or she must give it to his or her employer. The special tax code may apply to primary or secondary employment income, or to both. It may specify that no tax deductions are to be made, or that the deductions are to be made from only part of each payment. Family Support and GMFI not taken into account Section 351(2A) ensures that when an employee applies for a special tax code certificate, his or her Family Support and/or Guaranteed Minimum Family Income entitlement is not taken into account when working out the special tax code rate. This is to prevent an employee from receiving any tax credit entitlement through a “certificate of entitlement” as well as receiving those benefits through reduced tax deductions under a special tax code certificate. Employer’s responsibilities When the special tax code relates to one specific employment, the employer keeps the certificate. The employer should later attach it to the completed top copy of the employee’s IR 12 PAYE deduction certifi- cate. The employer sends the top copies of the IR 12s for all employees to Inland Revenue with the annual reconciliation. The employees get the bottom copies of the IR 12s, to go in their income tax returns. When the special tax code certificate is addressed to several employers of the employee, each employer must record on the IR 12 the employee’s name, address, IRD number, the number of the special tax code certificate, and the tax code or rate of PAYE deduction authorised. The employer then returns the certificate to the em- ployee. The employer sends the top copy of the IR 12 to Inland Revenue with the annual reconciliation. When the special tax code applies The special tax code operates from one of these dates: • the current pay period (if this is the first pay period in which the employer employs the employee) • the pay period following that in which the employee produced the certificate (if the employer is already employing the employee). The special tax code then operates in place of the code shown on the IR 12 declaration. Expiry of special tax code Every special tax code will expire on 31 March at the end of the income year for which it is issued. If an employee wants a certificate for the following income continued on page 2 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 (February 1995) If the taxpayer’s circumstances change so that the entitlement to a special tax code certificate no longer exists, he or she must fill in an IR 12 in the normal way. Annual tax return Anyone with a special tax code must file an annual tax return, even if he or she earned less than $20,000 in salary and wages and could otherwise have been a pay- period taxpayer and not required to file a tax return. Return of certificate The Commissioner may cancel a special tax code certificate at any time. If this happens, the employee must return the certificate to Inland Revenue within seven days of receiving notice that it has been cancelled. Definition of a qualifying trust Introduction This item considers the definition of a “qualifying trust”. It looks at the situation when there is no trustee income because all the income of the trustees has been distributed to the beneficiaries as “beneficiary income”. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1976. Background We have been asked to explain how the definition of a qualifying trust applies. There is concern that if a trust pays out all its income as beneficiary income it would fall outside the definition of a qualifying trust. Broadly, the significance of being a qualifying trust is that distributions which are not beneficiary income are not assessable to beneficiaries. Most trusts which are established by resident settlors and whose trustees are resident in New Zealand are qualifying trusts. Legislation Section 226(1) defines a “qualifying trust” as: “Qualifying trust”, in relation to any trust, other than a superannuation fund, and any income year in which a distribu- tion is made from that trust, means any trust where all trustee income derived by the trustee of that trust in income years commencing with the income year in which a settlement was first made to or for the benefit of that trust or on the terms of that trust until the income year in which the distribution is made has been liable under this Act to New Zealand income tax (other than only as non-resident withholding income) or would have been so liable had it not been for- (a) The fact that no income was derived in any relevant income year; or (b) The application in any relevant income year of section 61 of this Act; or (c) Deductions allowable under this Act exceeding income derived by the trustee in any relevant income year or losses carried forward pursuant to section 188 of this Act offsetting all of the income derived by the trustee in any relevant income year,- and all the trustee’s obligations under this Act in respect of the trustee’s liability to New Zealand income tax have been satisfied: Provided that a superannuation fund shall be a qualifying trust on and after the 1st day of April 1990. Section 226(1) also defines “trustee income” as: “Trustee income”, in relation to any trust and any income year, means income derived in that income year by a trustee of that trust that is not beneficiary income for any beneficiary of that trust. What is a qualifying trust A trust is a qualifying trust if these two requirements are satisfied: 1. From the income year during which a settlement was first made on the terms of the trust until the income year in which the distribution is made, all trustee income derived by the trustees has been liable to New Zealand income tax other than only as non- resident withholding income. 2. The trustee’s obligations in respect of that liability have been satisfied. We have received an inquiry about the definition of a qualifying trust in section 226(1). It was suggested that a trust might fall outside the definition of a qualifying trust under paragraph (a) of the definition if the trust derived income but paid it all out as beneficiary income. In such a case the trust would derive income but the trustees would not pay income tax on it. year, he or she must apply for a new one before the current certificate expires. Before the start of an income year (or at the latest, before 4 April in the new year), employees must give to their employer either an IR 12 tax code declaration or an IR 23 special tax code certificate for the new year. The code on this new declaration or certificate will then apply from the start of the new year, when the old code ceased. When an old code has ceased to apply and the employee does not give the employer a new declaration or certifi- cate by 4 April, the employer must deduct tax at the “no declaration” rate until the pay period following that in which the employee delivers a declaration or certificate to the employer. This is inconvenient for both the employee and the employer, so it is important that the employee fills in an IR 12 or gets a new special tax code certificate in time for the start of the new income year. from page 1 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 (February 1995) This is not in accordance with the Commissioner’s view. The definition of a “qualifying trust” considers whether the trustee income has been liable to income tax or would have been liable if there had been any trustee income. Therefore, by implication, the reference to “no income” being derived in paragraph (a) of the definition of a “qualifying trust”, is a reference to “no trustee income” being derived. “Trustee income” is defined to exclude “beneficiary income”. If all the income is paid out as “beneficiary income”, the require- ments of paragraph (a) are satisfied because “no trustee income” was derived. The tax treatment of qualifying trusts is discussed in more detail in the Appendix to TIB Volume One, No. 5 (November 1989). The Commissioner set out his views in the Appendix at paragraph 4.82: The trustees may derive no income in terms of the trustee income definition in two situations. First, they may have derived no income at all because the trust was dormant or their investments yielded no income during the income year. Second, they may have derived income but there was no trustee income because all of the income was beneficiary income. In both situations the “qualifying trust” definition is applied on the basis of whether there would have been a liability to income tax if there had been trustee income. Where all of the income derived by the trustee is beneficiary income it is consistent with the purpose of the “qualifying trust” definition to ensure that the fact that there is no trustee income does not prevent the trust from being a qualifying trust. In cases where the trustee passes all of the income through to the beneficiaries there is no deferral of tax with respect to any New Zealand resident beneficiaries. Thus, if the trustee income would have been liable to New Zealand income tax in a particular income year if the income had not all been passed through to the beneficiaries it is appropriate to treat the requirements of the “qualifying trust” definition as having been satisfied for that income year. Example Mr Smith has set up a qualifying trust which was to provide for the education of his grandchildren. The trust has a number of investments from which the trustees derive income. In 1994 the trustees distrib- uted all of the income to the settlor’s only grand- child, Toby Smith. Toby Smith used the money to pay his university fees. The trust remains a qualify- ing trust and the trustees deducted tax from the beneficiary income as the agent of Toby Smith. Fractional shares in land - value for gift duty land, thus avoiding gift duty. Such a situation can arise if a person makes dutiable gifts exceeding $27,000 in any 12 month period, because gift duty would then be payable on the excess. Legislation Section 20 deals with the valuation of land included in a dutiable estate. Section 20(1) defines “capital value” and “land” as: For the purposes of this section, the terms “capital value” and “land” have the same meanings as in the Valuation of Land Act 1951. Section 20(2) states: For estate duty purposes, the value of any land situated in New Zealand shall - (a) Be determined by agreement between the Commissioner and the administrator; or (b) In default of agreement be determined by the Commis- sioner in accordance with - (i) The capital value of the land as it appears in the district valuation roll in force under the Valuation of Land Act 1951, at the date on which the value of the land is to be determined, together with the cost of any improvements not included in the valuation appearing in the roll; or (ii) A special valuation of the capital value of the land, made by the Valuer-General on the requisition of the Commissioner for the purposes of this Act, as at the date on which the value of the land is to be deter- mined. Introduction This item explains how the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 applies when valuing a fractional share in land for gift duty purposes. It sets out the factors taken into account when valuing a fractional share in land. If the legal title to a parcel of land is owned by two or more people, each owner holds a fractional share in that land. All legislative references in this item are to the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 unless otherwise stated. Background A transfer of property for inadequate consideration is a dutiable gift to the extent that the actual value of the property exceeds the consideration given for it. The Commissioner may examine transactions involving related parties to see whether any dutiable gifts are involved. If the Commissioner considers that the consideration given for any land included in the agree- ment is inadequate, he may request a special valuation from the Valuer-General of Valuation New Zealand. This applies regardless of whether the share being transferred is a full or only a fractional share in the land. If the Valuer-General determines a higher land value than the consideration provided for in the agreement, that value is substituted for the value originally shown in the agreement. Gift duty is payable to the extent that the consideration is inadequate. However, if the agree- ment contains provisions that allow it, the parties have the option to increase the consideration paid for the continued on page 4 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 (February 1995) not involved in the farming operation. She has agreed to transfer her half share to John for $325,000. At the date of the sale, the land’s total value is $875,000. The Commissioner considers that the value of $325,000 does not represent the true value of Carol’s half share and requests a special valuation by the Valuer-General. In determining the value of Carol’s half share, the Valuer-General takes into account the relevant factors listed above. The Valuer-General finds that a willing purchaser would consider these factors: 1. The fact that John is occupying the farm home- stead and actively engaged in farming the land. The purchaser would have to weigh up his or her own chances of participating in the whole farming operation. 2. The ability of the property to provide an income for two separate owners. 3. The suitability of the property for subdivision into two units, and the fact that subdivision is possible, even though one unit would then carry a surplus of buildings. 4. Whether the fractional share could be used as security for a mortgage loan. 5. What type of sole ownership farm could be acquired for a similar price. 6. The prospect of John wishing to sell in the future and gaining full ownership. After considering the above factors, the Valuer- General determines the value of Carol’s half share to be $400,000. Note that this is considerably less than one-half of the land’s total value, i.e. $437,500. Gift duty is payable on $75,000, which is the shortfall between the land’s value of $400,000 and the consideration being paid of $325,000. If Carol made no other dutiable gifts in the previous 12 months, the gift duty payable would be $6,600. (The rates of gift duty are contained in the Third Schedule to the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968, and are set out below.) If the agreement between John and Carol contains a provision which allows them to increase the consid- eration John is paying Carol for her half share, they would have the option of doing this and avoiding the gift duty liability. Each case is considered on its own facts, and will not always produce the same result as in the above example. Gift duty rates Value of giftDuty payable $$ 0 - 27,000Nil 27,001 - 36,0005% on excess over $27,000 36,001 - 54,000$450 + 10% of excess over $36,000 54,001 - 72,000$2,250 + 20% of excess over $54,000 72,001 & over$5,850 + 25% of excess over $72,000 from page 3 Section 67 deals with the valuation of property for gift duty purposes. It states: For gift duty purposes, and subject to sections 68 to 70 of this Act, the value of any property shall be ascertained by the Commissioner in such manner as he thinks fit. Section 68 concerns the application of other sections of the Act to valuations for gift duty purposes. Section 68(1) states: Sections 20, 22, 23, 24, and 25 of this Act shall, with all necessary modifications, apply with respect to valuations for gift duty purposes in the same manner as they apply with respect to valuations for estate duty purposes. Section 2 of the Valuation of Land Act 1951 contains the definition of “capital value” used in section 20. It states: “Capital value” of land means the sum which the owner’s estate or interest therein, if unencumbered by any mortgage or other charge thereon, might be expected to realise at the time of valuation if offered for sale on such reasonable terms and conditions as a bona fide seller might be expected to require. Application The value of a fractional share in a parcel of land is determined independently of the entire parcel’s value. The value is determined by arriving at the figure that a willing seller and willing buyer, who are unrelated, would agree on for the fractional share. A fractional share in land is not valued by valuing the property as a whole, dividing that total value by the owner’s share, and then deducting a set “rule of thumb” percentage discount to recognise the fractional share. This principle is supported in cases Re Jackson \[1961\] NZLR 50, Public Trustee for NSW v CIR \[1966\] NZLR 257, and CIR v Flaxbourne Trust (1983) 6 NZTC 61,953. In CIR v Flaxbourne Trust, the Court identified the relevant factors which would be taken into account by a willing seller and a willing buyer when determining the price of a fractional share in a parcel of land. These factors are: 1. The number of parts into which the land is divided and the manner in which they are held. 2. The nature of the property and its value. 3. The size of the interest and whether it is greater or less than a half share. 4. The income from the property. 5. Whether partition would be in the interests of all parties. 6. Whether physical partition is possible. 7. Whether there is any special demand for fractional shares. 8. The legal position regarding partition. 9. The costs involved in partition. Example This example is based on the facts as disclosed in CIR v Flaxbourne Trust. John Jones is a sheep farmer. The farm’s land is owned by John and his sister Carol equally as tenants in common. Carol is 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 (February 1995) Imputation credit account and dividend withholding payment account - penalty tax and additional tax Summary Companies that operate an imputation credit account (ICA) or a dividend withholding payment account (WPA) may be subject to penalty tax and additional tax. This item explains when the taxes apply, and the situations in which companies are entitled to relief from the taxes. • Companies are charged penalty tax when their ICA or WPA is in debit at 31 March in any year. • Companies are charged additional tax when they do not clear the debit balance in their ICA or WPA by the due date, or when they do not pay their ICA or WPA penalty tax by the due date. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1976. How the legislation applies Imputation credit account If a company has a debit closing balance in its ICA at 31 March in any year, the company must make a payment to clear the balance under section 394L(1). This payment is an income tax payment called further income tax. Dividend withholding payment account If a company has a debit closing balance in its WPA at 31 March in any year, the company must make a payment to clear the balance under section 394ZZF(1). This payment is called a further dividend withholding payment. If either the ICA or WPA is in debit, the company may be subject to penalty and additional taxes under the imputation and dividend withholding payment rules. Penalty tax Under sections 394N(1) and 394ZZG(1), imputation penalty tax and dividend withholding payment penalty tax are special taxes imposed when a company has to pay further income tax or further dividend withholding payments. Imputation penalty tax and dividend withholding payment penalty tax are due under sections 394N(2) and 394ZZG(2). They are calculated at the rate of ten percent on the amount of any further income tax or a further dividend withholding payment. Under sections 394N(3) and 394ZZG(3), the due date for payment is 20 June following the end of the imputa- tion year (31 March) in which the debit balance arose in the ICA or WPA. If the company fails to pay any of the penalty tax by the due date, it is liable to pay additional tax which compounds every six months until it is paid. Company ceasing to be an ICA company or resident in New Zealand A company that has a debit balance in its ICA when it ceases to be an ICA company is not liable for imputa- tion penalty tax imposed by section 394N. A company that has a debit balance in its WPA when it ceases to be a resident in New Zealand is not liable for dividend withholding payment penalty tax imposed by section 394ZZG. Additional tax Generally a company is liable to pay additional tax in either of these situations: • if it does not pay its income tax or dividend withhold- ing payments by the due date • if it does not pay its imputation penalty tax or divi- dend withholding payment penalty tax by the due date. Additional tax of ten percent is imposed on any amount outstanding after the due date. After that, a further ten percent is added, on a compounding basis, for every six months that the balance remains outstanding. Circumstances in which additional tax is charged 1. Additional tax is charged under section 394L(6) if the ICA has a debit balance at the end of the imputa- tion year (always ending 31 March), and this balance was not removed by payment of further income tax equal to the debit balance by the follow- ing 20 June. 2. If a company has a debit balance in its ICA immedi- ately before it ceases to be an ICA company, under section 394L(3) and (4) it is liable to pay further income tax to clear the debit balance by the last day on which it is still an ICA company. Additional tax is charged under section 394L(6) if the company fails to clear the debit balance by the last day on which it is still an ICA company. 3. Additional tax is charged under section 394ZZF(6) if the WPA has a debit balance at the end of the imputation year and this balance was not removed by payment of a further dividend withholding payment equal to the debit balance by the following 20 June. 4. Under section 394ZZF(3) and (4), if a company has a debit balance in its WPA immediately before it ceases to be resident in New Zealand, the company must pay a further dividend withholding payment to continued on page 6 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 (February 1995) Imputation credit accounts Imputation penalty tax can only be remitted in either of these situations: • The liability arose under section 394O(1)(a) from a debit to the ICA in respect of an arrangement to obtain a tax advantage, and a subsequent credit arises to the ICA when it is established that no such ar- rangement existed. • The liability arose under section 394O(1)(b) because a debit balance arose because an income tax refund was sent to the company, but was not received before the end of imputation year. The first situation occurs when the Commissioner applies the anti-avoidance provisions of section 394ZG and it is later discovered that section 394ZG does not apply. The second situation may occur when a company is sent a tax refund it is unaware of, and therefore does nothing to eliminate the debit balance which may be a consequence of the refund. Under section 394O(2), when the Commissioner remits any imputation penalty tax under section 394O, the Commissioner must also remit any additional tax imposed under section 394N(4) to the extent that he is satisfied that the additional tax was imposed on the imputation penalty tax remitted. Under 394O(3), when the Commissioner remits any imputation penalty tax under section 394O(1)(a), the Commissioner must also remit any additional tax under section 394L(6) to the extent that he is satisfied that the additional tax was imposed on the amount of further income tax that gave rise to the imposition of the imputation penalty tax remitted. Withholding payment account The Commissioner must remit any dividend withhold- ing payment penalty tax imposed on a WPA company under section 394ZZH in these two situations: • If the Commissioner is satisfied that under section 394ZZH(1)(a), the liability arose from a debit to the WPA in respect of an arrangement to obtain a tax advantage, and subsequently a credit arises to the WPA when it is established that no such arrangement existed. • If the Commissioner is satisfied that under section 394ZZH(1)(b), liability for the tax arose because a refund of a dividend withholding payment was been sent out, but the company did not receive it (or did not know that it had received it) before the end of the imputation year. Under section 394ZZH(2), when the Commissioner remits any dividend withholding payment penalty tax under section 394ZZH, he must also remit any addi- tional tax imposed under section 394ZZG(4) to the extent that he is satisfied that the additional tax was imposed on any dividend withholding payment penalty tax remitted. clear the debit balance by the last day on which it is still resident in New Zealand. Additional tax is charged under 394ZZF(6) if the company fails to clear the debit balance by the last day on which it is still resident in New Zealand. 5. Additional tax is charged under section 394ZN(4) and (5) if withholding payment liabilities were not paid on the due date of the 20th of the month following the end of the quarter in which the company became liable to deduct the withholding payment from foreign dividends received. 6. Additional tax is charged under sections 394N(4) and 394ZZG if any imputation penalty tax or dividend withholding payment penalty tax remains unpaid by the following 20 June. 7. Additional tax is charged under section 398 if default is made for payment of tax. Example Roseanne is the accountant for Dan’s Building Co. Ltd. The company’s ICA had a debit balance of $20,000 at 31 March 1994. The company would incur the following penalties and additional tax if the total tax was not paid until 21 December 1994: ICA debit balance 31 March 1994$20,000 Imputation penalty tax ($20,000 x 10%)$ 2,000 $22,000 Additional tax if not paid by 20 June 1994 ($22,000 x 10%)$ 2,200 $24,200 Additional tax if not paid by 20 December 1994 ($24,200 x 10%)$ 2,420 Total tax to pay if not paid until 21 December 1994$26,620 No ICA or WPA credits for penalty and/or additional tax payments Section 394D(1) and (2) state the situations when imputation credits arise and when they are recorded. A payment of imputation penalty tax or additional tax cannot be allocated to shareholders as an imputation credit. Section 394ZV(1) and (2) state the situations when dividend withholding payment account credits arise and when they are recorded. A payment of dividend with- holding payment penalty tax or additional tax cannot be allocated as a dividend withholding payment account credit. Remission The Commissioner has no general discretion to remit penalty and additional tax. However, in limited situa- tions there may be relief if certain statutory criteria are met. from page 5 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 (February 1995) Under section 394ZZH(3), when the Commissioner remits any dividend withholding payment penalty tax under section 394ZZH(1)(a), he must also remit any additional tax under section 394ZZF(6) to the extent that he is satisfied that the additional tax was imposed on the amount of the further dividend withholding payment that gave rise to the imposition of the dividend withholding payment penalty tax remitted. Assessments and objections The Commissioner can make an assessment for any of these things: • The closing balance of the ICA, if the Commissioner does not agree with the company’s calculation under section 19. • The amount of further income tax under section 394L(7). • The amount of any imputation penalty tax under 394N(5). Any assessment issued is subject to objection in the same way as an income tax assessment. Commissioner’s powers under section 400 of the Income Tax Act 1976 Summary This item explains how section 400 of the Income Tax Act 1976 applies. Section 400 enables the Commis- sioner to require people to pay to Inland Revenue funds which they are holding which are payable to a taxpayer who has defaulted on income tax liabilities. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1976, unless otherwise stated. Background The Commissioner has wide powers to recover out- standing income tax liabilities from taxpayers who have not complied with requests to make payment. Section 400 gives the Commissioner the power to require people holding funds payable to a taxpayer with outstanding income tax liabilities to pay those funds to him. The Commissioner does this by giving a written notice, called a “section 400 notice”. This notice requires a person to deduct a specified sum from any amount which is or will become payable to the defaulting taxpayer. The taxpayer also receives a copy of the notice, at his or her last known address. Section 400(7A) deems the person required to make the deduction to be acting under the taxpayer’s authority, and indemnifies the person in respect of the deduction. The person making the deduction must pay the amount to the Commissioner within the time stated in the notice. The Commissioner may issue section 400 notices to banks, building societies, legal practitioners, or others who may be holding funds belonging to, or due to become payable to, the taxpayer. The recipient must then deduct sums from client funds. The Commissioner also may require employers to recover unpaid tax from employees. There are similar provisions in other legislation - for example, section 43 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, section 46 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992, section 154 of the Child Support Act 1991, and section 130 of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992. Legislation Section 400(2) states: Where any taxpayer has made default in the payment to the Commissioner of any income tax (or any part thereof) payable by the taxpayer or any penalty (or any part thereof) incurred by him, the Commissioner may from time to time by notice in writing require any person to- (a) Deduct or extract, in one sum, from any amount that is, or becomes, an amount payable in relation to the taxpayer such sum as is equal to the lesser of - (i) The amount that, pursuant to the notice, is required to be deducted or extracted: (ii) The amount that, at the time at which the deduction or extraction is required to be made in compliance with the notice, is the said amount payable: (b) Subject to subsection (4) of this section, deduct or extract from time to time, by way of instalment, from any amount that is or, as the case may be, from time to time becomes, an amount payable in relation to the taxpayer such sum as is equal to the lesser of- (i) The amount that, at the time at which the deduction or extraction is required to be made in compliance with the notice, is the amount required to be so deducted or extracted: (ii) The amount that, at the time at which, pursuant to the notice, the amount of the instalment, is required to be deducted or extracted, is the said amount payable, - and require that person to pay to the Commissioner, within such time as is specified in the notice, every sum so deducted or extracted, to the credit of,- (c) To the extent that that sum is in respect of or in relation to income tax (or any part thereof) assessed on taxable income, the taxpayer who derived that taxable income: continued on page 8 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 (February 1995) bank. Section 400(1) excludes money in certain ac- counts (specified in the section) from the definition of “amount payable”, so that the Commissioner cannot require amounts to be deducted from these particular accounts. These accounts (which are no longer offered) are: • a Home Lay-by Account within the meaning of the Post Office Act 1959 • a Home Ownership Account within the meaning of the Home Ownership Savings Act 1974 • a Farm Ownership Account within the meaning of the Farm Ownership Savings Act 1974 • a Fishing Vessel Ownership Account within the meaning of the Fishing Vessel Ownership Savings Act 1977. A person commits an offence under section 400(9) if he or she does not comply with a section 400 notice. Example Ida owns the Plants ‘R’ Green Nursery, specialising in citrus trees. The nursery is expanding rapidly, so she employs Bella. Bella owes $1,768.50 in unpaid taxes from the time she had been self-employed as a line dance instructor. Ida receives a section 400 notice, requiring her to deduct amounts from Bella’s pay every payday. From Bella’s pay of $295 per week, Ida must deduct either: • $59, which is the lesser of 10% of the unpaid taxes ($176.85), or 20% of the wages ($59) • $10 whichever is the greater. As $59 is greater than $10, Ida must return this amount under the section 400 notice. Guaranteed Minimum Family Income - self-employed people’s eligibility Summary Section 374E of the Income Tax Act 1976 provides for Guaranteed Minimum Family Income (GMFI). This item sets how this section applies to self-employed people, as there has been some confusion in this area. There is a perception that self-employed people are not eligible for GMFI. This is incorrect. When determining whether a self-employed person is eligible for GMFI the issue is whether the person is in “employment” as defined in section 374E(1), not whether the person is self-employed. Most self-employed people will not be in “employment”, but some people may be, such as self- employed people who receive withholding payments. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1976. Background GMFI is one part of the Family Support scheme. It was introduced to ensure that full-time earners with depend- ent children receive a guaranteed minimum income. There is some confusion over whether people who are self-employed are entitled to receive a GMFI tax credit. How the legislation applies Under section 374E, GMFI is available to a qualifying person who is a full-time earner. “Qualifying person” is a defined term under the GMFI rules. This item sets out how the legislation applies to determine whether a self- employed person is a full-time earner for GMFI pur- poses. (d) To the extent that that sum is in respect of or in relation to the whole or any part of a tax deduction or a penalty, an account maintained by the Commissioner in relation to that tax deduction or, as the case may be, that penalty. Section 400(2) applies when a taxpayer has defaulted in paying any income tax payable or any penalty. The Commissioner may send a written notice to a person, requiring that person to deduct the lesser of these amounts from any amount payable to the taxpayer: • The amount specified in the notice • The amount payable to the taxpayer at the time the deduction is to be made. The section 400 notice can require the amount to be taken in one sum or by instalment. Regarding deductions from wages or salary, section 400(4) states: ...the sums required to be deducted therefrom shall be computed so as to not exceed the greater of- (a) An amount equal to the lesser of the following amounts: (i) An amount calculated at the rate of 10 percent per week of the income tax due and payable by the taxpayer at the date of the notice: (ii) An amount calculated at the rate of 20 percent of the said wages or salary payable: (b) The amount of $10 per week. This calculation is on the gross amount of wages or salary. Section 400(1) provides that “amount payable” means any amount payable by the person who receives the notice (whether on his or her own account, or as an agent, or as a trustee, or otherwise howsoever) to the taxpayer. It includes money (including interest) on deposit or standing to the credit of the defaulter in a from page 7 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 (February 1995) In summary, under section 374E(1) a person is a “full- time earner” in any week if he or she meets either of these conditions for that week: • He or she does not have a spouse and is engaged in employment for at least 20 hours. • He or she has a spouse and either the person or the person and the spouse between them are engaged in employment for at least 30 hours. “Employment” is defined in section 374E(1). A person who performs activities which entitle him or her to receive a source deduction payment which is not excluded by the section is in employment for GMFI purposes. Section 6 defines a “source deduction payment” as: “a payment by way of salary or wages, an extra emolument, or a withholding payment.” As stated, section 374E(1) excludes certain source deduction payments from the definition of “employ- ment” for GMFI purposes, and in this way excludes certain self-employed people from being full-time earners. In summary, a self-employed person is entitled to GMFI if he or she receives a withholding payment and is not one of the following: • A working partner in a partnership from which the amount of the payment to the partner does not exceed either: -the amount payable in the partner’s contract of service; or -the amount payable in the partner’s contract of service plus bonuses paid by the partnership to the partner • A non-resident contractor. • A major shareholder of a close company. A major shareholder is a person who owns, has the power to control, or the right to acquire 10% or more of the ordinary shares or voting shares of the company, or who has 10% or more of the control of the company by any other means. A “close company” is a company (other than a special corporate entity) in which five or fewer natural people hold more than 50% of the voting interests between them. If a market value circumstance exists, then a close company is a company in which five or fewer natural people hold more than 50% of the market value interests. If any of the natural people are associated, they are treated as one person. • A person who receives a payment from his or her spouse. • A person who receives a payment from the business of his or her spouse, if the business is carried on by two or more people either in partnership or otherwise. Example 1 A taxpayer is married and has two children. He runs a company with his brother; and they each own 50% of the shares. As managing director of the company the taxpayer works 35 hours a week and is paid a salary. The taxpayer is not entitled to receive GMFI because he is a major shareholder of a close com- pany. Example 2 A taxpayer is single and has two children. She is in partnership with two other people, running a plant nursery. She has a contract of service with the partnership, for which she works 25 hours a week and is paid the amount specified in her contract. She also works 10 hours a week in council gardens and is paid an hourly wage. The taxpayer is not entitled to GMFI as her pay- ment from the partnership is excluded from the definition of source deduction payment. Although she receives a source deduction payment (which is not excluded from employment) from her employ- ment with the council, she does not work 20 hours a week in that job. Comparative tables: section numbers of Income Tax Act 1994, Income Tax Act 1976, and other tax Acts The appendix to this TIB deals with the following Acts, which were enacted in December 1994: • Income Tax Act 1994 • Tax Administration Act 1994 • Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 These new Acts resulted from the Income Tax Bill 1994, the Tax Administration Bill 1994 and the Taxa- tion Review Authorities Bill 1994 respectively, which were introduced into Parliament in October 1994. The bulk of the appendix consists of comparative tables, to cross-refer between sections in the new tax Acts to their equivalent sections in the old Acts. You may wish to keep it in a handy location, to refer to when working with 1994 tax legislation. 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 (February 1995) Base price adjustment when a company purchases its own debt instrument Summary This item explains how section 64F of the Income Tax Act 1976 applies when a company purchases its own debenture, bond, or similar debt instrument, with the purpose of extinguishing the debt. Section 64F the Act requires the company to calculate the base price adjust- ment (BPA) amount and return it in the income year that the it purchases the debt instrument which it previously issued. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1976. Background A company may decide to issue a debt instrument to raise funds. At a later date it may decide to purchase back the debt instrument that it previously issued. For example, a company decides to expand its business, by investing in new technology in an industry related to one of its existing businesses. It decides to raise funds by issuing a debenture for a five-year term, rather than by issuing equity. After two or three years the new business venture has earned higher returns than fore- cast. The company decides to clear the debt, and so purchases the debenture it previously issued. Legislation Section 64F(2) states: Subject to subsection (3) of this section, where, in relation to any person, a financial arrangement matures or is remitted (other than by way of being written off as a bad debt), sold or otherwise transferred by the person in any income year, the amount of the base price adjustment in relation to that income year, that person, and that financial arrangement shall be an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: (Emphasis added) a - ( b + c ) Section 64F(2) goes on to define a, b, and c. The meaning of these amounts is summarised in the table under step 4 of the Appendix below entitled “Accrual Income & Expenditure - The Four Steps to calculate using the YTM Method”. Section 64B(1) defines the term Financial Arrangement: “Financial Arrangement” means (a) Any debt or debt instrument; and (b) Any arrangement ... whereby a person obtains money in consideration for a promise by any person to provide money to any person at some future time or times, or upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of some future event or events ...; and (c) Any arrangement which is of a substantially similar nature ..., - but does not include any excepted financial arrangement that is not part of a financial arrangement. Section 64F(1)(e) states: The term “maturity” in relation to a financial arrangement, means the date on which the last payment contingent upon the financial arrangement is made and the term “matures” has a corresponding meaning: Provided that where a financial arrangement has not matured and where the amount which has not been paid is immaterial and the financial arrangement has been structured to avoid the application of this section, the financial arrangement shall be deemed to have matured. (Emphasis added) Section 64B(1) defines the terms holder and issuer as follows: “Holder” means - ... a person who, if the ... amounts payable under the financial arrangement \[e.g. the debenture\] were due and payable at that time, would be entitled to receive, ... a pecuniary benefit .... “Issuer” means ... a person who is a party to the financial arrangement and is not a holder in relation to the financial arrangement: Under section 64B(1), debentures to which section 192 or section 195 apply are “excepted financial arrange- ments”. The accrual rules do not govern these deben- tures. Application A bond, debenture, or similar debt instrument is a “financial arrangement”, which is subject to the accrual rules in sections 64B to 64F. When a company purchases its own debt instrument (i.e. a debt instrument that it previously issued) section 64F requires it to calculate the BPA amount and return it, because the debt instrument has come to maturity. The BPA is a final adjustment. The accrual rules require this final adjustment to ensure that on the maturity of a financial arrangement, the taxpayer returns all income and expenditure attributable to the financial arrangement. To calculate the BPA for the final income year it is necessary to know the amount of item ‘c’ in the BPA formula. For the issuer, ‘c’ is the accrual expenditure he or she incurred (less the accrual income deemed to be derived) in previous income years on the financial arrangement. The issuer will know these amounts as he or she will have returned them in previous years’ income tax returns. The yield to maturity (YTM) method is one of the methods used to calculate accrual income and expendi- ture for the income years during the term of the finan- cial arrangement other than for the final year. For further information on how to calculate the accrual 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 (February 1995) income or expenditure using the YTM method see the section at the end of this item called “Accrual income and expenditure - the four steps to calculate using the YTM method”. Example Timber Plantations Limited issues a debenture with a face value of $750,000 on 15 November 1991 for a 5-year term. The debenture pays coupon interest at six-monthly intervals from the date of issue. The coupon interest rate is 14% per annum. Mutual Life Savings Society purchased the deben- ture for $735,000. On 15 May 1994 Timber Planta- tions Limited buys the debenture back from Mutual Life Savings Society for $770,000. Timber Planta- tions Limited has a 31 March balance date. To calculate the BPA for the 1995 income year it is necessary to know the amount of item ‘c’ in the BPA formula for the issuer - that is, the accrual expenditure incurred (less the accrual income derived) by Timber Plantations Limited in previous income years on this debenture. Timber Plantations Limited calculated its accrual income or expendi- ture for each of the income years during the term of the debenture using the YTM method. Timber Plantations Limited calculated and deducted accrual expenditure in the 1991-92, 1992-93, and 1993-94 income years of $(40,325), $(107,269), and $(107,696) respectively. (For details of how these amounts were calculated refer to “YTM Calcula- tions” at the end of the example.) Calculating Timber Plantations Limited’s BPA for 1995 income year Each coupon payment is $52,500 (i.e. $750,000 x 14% x .5). Mutual Life Savings Society is the “holder”, because it would be entitled to receive the payment if the amounts payable under the debenture were due and payable at that time. Timber Planta- tions Limited is the “issuer”. Calculating final year’s accrual income or expenditure by using BPA The BPA for Timber Plantations Limited (the issuer) in the 1994/95 income year is as follows: a = the five coupon payments of $52,500 each (paid on 15 May 1992, 15 November 1992, 15 May 1993, 15 November 1993, and 15 May 1994), and the purchase price of $770,000 paid by Timber Plantations = (5 x 52,500) + 770,000 = $1,032,500 b = the sale price of $735,000 received by Timber Plantations Limited = $735,000 c = the accrual expenditure incurred by Timber Plantations Limited in the income years ended 31 March 1992, 1993, and 1994 of $(40,325), $(107,269), and $(107,696) respectively = $255,290 BPA= 1,032,500 - ( 735,000 + 255,290) = $ 42,210 As the BPA is positive, Timber Plantations Limited has incurred accrual expenditure in the 1994/95 income year of $42,210. YTM Calculations The accrual income or expenditure for the income years ended 31 March 1992, 1993, and1994 was calculated using the YTM method as follows: 1. Calculate the Yield to Maturity %: Calculate the YTM on the cashflows in the table below. The YTM (i.e. the yield over the period from the date of issue (15/11/91) to the date of maturity (15/11/96)) on this debenture is 14.5771% per annum. 2.

Calculate the yield to maturity percentage The YTM method is described in Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method. The YTM percentage is the constant annual rate at which the cashflows accumulate to zero. It is calculated over the period of the financial arrangement from the date of issue to the date of maturity. Another name for the YTM is the internal rate of return. 2. Calculate the accrual income or expenditure and the principal outstanding for each period alternately The formulae to calculate these amounts are also set out in Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method. The formu- lae for these two amounts are: Principal outstanding for a particular period = Principal outstanding in the previous period + the amount payable by holder or receivable by issuer immediately before the start of this period + the amount of accrual income or expenditure in the previous period -the amount receivable by holder or payable by issuer immediately before the start of this period (1) 91-92 A.E. = ((53,571) / 182) x 137 = (40,325.42) (2) 92-93 A.E = ((53,571) / 182) x 45 = (13,245.58) (3) 92-93 A.E. = ((53,733) / 181) x 136 = (40,373.97) (4) 93-94 A.E. = ((53,733) / 181) x 45 = (13,359.03) (5) 93-94 A.E. = ((53,919) / 181) x 136 = (40,513.72) 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 (February 1995) Accrual income or expenditure=principal outstandingx YTM % for a particular periodat start of this period(100 x N) If all periods are of equal length, the variable ‘N’ takes the following values: Length of periodValue of ‘N’ 12 months1 6 months2 3 months4 1 month12 a fortnight26 a week52 If the length of one or two periods is different to the equal period, N = 365/No of days in the period (excluding start date and including ending date).

Apportion the accrual income or expenditure for each accrual period on a daily basis to an income year The apportionment method is set out in Determination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis. The formula is: The amount of accrual income or expenditure allocated to a given income year = a b x c a = the amount of accrual income or expenditure for a period which spans a balance date b = the total number of days in the accrual period which spans the balance date c = the number of days in the accrual income / expenditure period that relate to a particular income year 4.

When there is no Double Tax Agreement (DTA) between New Zealand and the foreign country in which the international aircraft operator is resident, the operator will need to apply for an exemption under section 64A so as not to be taxed in two countries. Section 64A(2) gives the Commissioner the authority to exempt from income tax any aircraft operator who meets all of these conditions: • It is resident in a country outside New Zealand. • It is not resident in New Zealand. • It is engaged in air transport from New Zealand. This exemption will apply to the aircraft operator’s income derived from air transport from New Zealand. However, the Commissioner must be satisfied that if a New Zealand resident aircraft operator was to operate in that country in similar circumstances, the New Zealand resident would not be liable to, or would be exempt from, income tax in that jurisdiction. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1976, unless otherwise stated. Background The tax laws of many countries tax both of these types of income: • the worldwide income of taxpayers who are resident in those countries • any income that is derived from those countries, regardless of whether taxpayers are resident in those countries. If there were no exemptions in the domestic tax laws and/or DTAs, this would result in people and businesses who earn income from several countries being double taxed; once by the country of their residence and a second time by the country from which the income was derived. For foreign international aircraft operators, this would mean that some of their income would be taxed twice. For example, without section 64A or the DTA between Australia and New Zealand, an Australian international aircraft operator would be subject to New Zealand income tax and Australian income tax on income derived from New Zealand. The Australian operator would be liable to New Zealand income tax under section 242(b), and to Australian income tax under section 25(1)(b) of the Australian Income Tax Assess- ment Act 1936. Legislation Section 242 sets out the source rules for determining the income tax liability of income derived from New Zealand and abroad. Section 242 states: Subject to this Act, - (a) All income derived by any person who is resident in New Zealand at the time when he derives that income shall be assessable for income tax, whether it is derived from New Zealand or from elsewhere: (b) All income derived from New Zealand shall be assess- able for income tax, whether the person deriving that income is resident in New Zealand or elsewhere: (c) No income which is neither derived from New Zealand nor derived by a person then resident in New Zealand shall be assessable for income tax. (emphasis added) Section 243 deems various classes of income to be “derived from New Zealand”. It states: Subject to section 244 and 245 of this Act, the following classes of income shall be deemed to be derived from New Zealand: ... (q)Income derived from the carriage by sea or by air of merchandise, goods, livestock, mails, or passengers shipped or embarked in New Zealand: ... (emphasis added) Section 64A(1) states: For the purposes of this section - “Aircraft operator” means a person engaged in the business of operating any aircraft for air transport from any airport: “Air transport” means the carriage by any aircraft of merchandise, goods, livestock, mails, or passengers emplaned or embarked on that aircraft at any airport: “Air transport from New Zealand” means the carriage outside New Zealand by any aircraft of merchandise, goods, livestock, mails, or passengers emplaned or embarked on that aircraft at any airport in New Zealand; and such carriage shall be deemed to be outside New Zealand notwithstanding that the aircraft calls at any one or more other airports in New Zealand before leaving New Zealand on the flight for which that emplaning or embarking occurred: “Income tax”, in relation to any country or territory outside New Zealand, means any tax which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, is substantially of the same nature as income tax imposed under this Part of this Act. Section 64A(2) states: Where any aircraft operator, or any class or classes of aircraft operators, being resident in a country or territory outside New Zealand and not being resident in New Zealand, is or, as the case may be, are engaged in air transport from New Zealand, the Commissioner may exempt in whole or in part such 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 (February 1995) operator or class or classes of operators from liability to pay income tax in New Zealand in respect of income derived from that air transport from New Zealand, if and so far as he is satisfied that in corresponding circumstances the like aircraft operator or, as the case may be, the like class or classes of aircraft operators, being resident in New Zealand, are not liable to or are exempt from income tax imposed by the laws of that country or territory outside New Zealand. \[emphasis added\] Section 294(1) states: Where arrangements have been made with the Government of any territory outside New Zealand with a view to - (a)Affording relief from double taxation; or (b)Exchanging information - in relation to income tax or excess retention tax and any taxes imposed by the laws of that territory included in the arrange- ments, the Governor-General may from time to time by Order in Council declare that those arrangements shall, notwith- standing anything in this Act or any other enactment, have effect in relation to income tax and excess retention tax accordingly. Application An international aircraft operator who is resident in a foreign country is liable to New Zealand income tax on all income “derived from New Zealand”, under section 242(b). This liability may be modified by the operation of section 64A or a DTA between New Zealand and the other country, as discussed below. Section 243(2)(q) deems income “derived from New Zealand” to include income derived from the carriage by air of merchandise, goods, livestock, mails, or passen- gers embarked in New Zealand. The Concise Oxford Dictionary defines “embark” to mean: 1. Put or go on board a ship or aircraft (to a destination). Section 64A Exemption If there is no DTA between New Zealand and the foreign country in which the international aircraft operator is resident then the operator will need to apply for an exemption under section 64A, to avoid being taxed in two countries. Section 64A provides an exemption from New Zealand income tax for an aircraft operator (or class or classes of operators) which meets all of these conditions: • It is resident in a country or territory outside New Zealand. • It is not resident in New Zealand. • It is engaged in air transport from New Zealand. The Commissioner may wholly or partly exempt the operator (or class or classes of operators) from any New Zealand income tax liability on income derived from air transport from New Zealand. The Commissioner may only grant the exemption if, and to the extent that, he is satisfied that in correspond- ing circumstances a like New Zealand resident aircraft operator (or class or classes of operators) is not liable to, or is exempt from, income tax imposed by the laws of that foreign country. The exemption only applies to income tax; it does not apply to goods and services tax. Double Tax Agreements The purpose of a DTA is to provide relief from double taxation and to facilitate the exchange of information between two countries. DTAs override the domestic tax laws of both countries. New Zealand’s DTAs override anything in the Income Tax Act 1976 or any other Act. New Zealand has 24 DTAs. They all contain an article dealing with international air transport. In most cases, the article on international air transport has these effects: • It grants the right to charge income tax on the profits derived by an international aircraft operator to the country: -in which the operator is resident (in some DTAs), or -in which the place of effective management is located (in other DTAs). • It prevents New Zealand from taxing the income of an aircraft operator who is resident in a foreign country. In practice, this means that if there is a DTA in opera- tion between New Zealand and the other country, a foreign international aircraft operator won’t have to apply for an exemption under section 64A. The countries with which New Zealand has DTAs are: AustraliaItaly BelgiumJapan CanadaKorea ChinaMalaysia DenmarkThe Netherlands FijiNorway FinlandPhilippines FranceSingapore GermanySweden IndiaSwitzerland IndonesiaUnited Kingdom IrelandUnited States of America Policy When considering whether to grant an exemption under section 64A (and whether to grant it in whole or in part) the Commissioner considers how the foreign country taxes a New Zealand resident international aircraft operator. In some cases the domestic tax laws of a foreign country may provide conclusively that a New Zealand resident international aircraft operator is not liable to, or is exempt from, income tax in that country. continued on page 16 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 (February 1995) Example 1 A Canadian resident aircraft operator has flights scheduled between Vancouver and Auckland. Under Article 8 in the DTA between Canada and New Zealand, Canada taxes the income derived from New Zealand by the Canadian aircraft opera- tor. New Zealand cannot tax this income. Example 2 A Samoan resident aircraft operator has flights scheduled between Apia and Auckland. There is no DTA between Samoa and New Zealand. If the Samoan tax laws provide that a New Zealand resident aircraft operator would not be liable to or would be exempt from income tax in Samoa, then the Commissioner has the authority under section 64A to grant an exemption from New Zealand income tax to the Samoan aircraft operator. In other cases the foreign tax laws may provide the foreign tax authority with a discretion to grant a New Zealand resident international aircraft operator an exemption from income tax in that country. In these cases, the Commissioner requires written confirmation from the foreign tax authority as to how it applies its discretion to a New Zealand resident international aircraft operator. The Commissioner’s policy is that he will not grant an exemption while a DTA is in force. If a DTA ceases to remain in force the Commissioner may grant an exemp- tion under section 64A, if he receives an application. A person who requests an exemption under section 64A must enclose conclusive evidence that a New Zealand resident aircraft operator (or class or classes of opera- tors) is not liable to or is exempt from income tax in the foreign country. Address any requests for an exemption under section 64A to: The Manager (Tax Policy) Rulings Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON from page 15 Student Loan scheme - repayment threshold raised The Government has reviewed the repayment threshold for the Student Loan scheme, and increased it to $13,884 for the 1995-96 income year. FBT - prescribed interest rate increased to 9.2% The prescribed rate of interest used to calculate the fringe benefit value of low interest employment-related loans has been increased to 9.2% for the quarter starting on 1 January 1995. This rate will also apply to all subsequent quarters unless it requires further revision. The new rate reflects the increased market interest rates. The prescribed rate was previously 8.4% for the quarter starting on 1 October 1994. 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 (February 1995) Questions we’ve been asked This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts.

Under an agreement with her employer, if she left the company’s employment within a year of completing the study leave, she would be required to repay a proportion of the study leave salary. As PAYE and ACC deductions are being made from her salary, she wonders if she can request a reassessment of her taxes if she ceases her employment upon the expiry of the study leave and is obliged to repay a part of her earnings. Any salary received while undertaking a full-time course of study is fully assess- able in the tax year in which it is received. The salary is assessable under section 65(2)(b), even though there is the prospect that some of it may need to be repaid if the employee fails to fulfil the terms of the study bond. Any amount that must be repaid for the non-fulfilment of the terms of the agreement is calculated by reference to the amount of salary paid. It is not a refund of the salary, so it does not entitle the employee to any reassessment. The salary becomes the taxpayer’s absolute property when it is paid to her, and what happens subsequently under the conditions of the bond does not change the character of the salary received. The case of Bowcock v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,062 is the judicial authority supporting this treatment. 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 (February 1995) Deductibility of new building ceremony expenses Section 104 - Expenditure allowed as a business expense, and section 108 - expenditure capitalised and depreciated: A business firm wishes to stage cer- emonies to mark the building of new premises. A representative of the company has asked what income tax deductions are available. There are three ceremonies usually associated with the erection of new build- ings. They are concerned with laying the foundations, the “topping off” cer- emony ( when the roof is put on), and the opening day. For income tax pur- poses, the foundation laying and the “topping off” expenditure should be capi- talised to the buildings’ account, and depreciation claimed at the appropriate building rate. Opening day expenses such as food and drink, hall hire, transport hire, special booklet costs, scaffolding and seating, entertainment for children, and labour can be claimed as a revenue expense. The rules about deducting entertainment expenditure may also affect any deduc- tions for expenditure on items such as food, drink, and entertainment. Gener- ally, only 50% of business-related entertainment expenditure, or loss, incurred for the purposes of providing food, drink, or recreation is deductible, unless the expenditure is specifically excluded or exempted from the rules. Deducting costs of travel between home and work base when business calls made en route Section 104 - Expenditure or loss incurred in production of assessable income: A self-employed real estate agent has asked how she should categorise the travel between her home and work when she visits clients en route. Section 104 allows a deduction for expenses incurred in the production of assess- able income, or necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for that purpose. If the real estate agent is merely using her car to commute between her home and place of business, the expenditure is of a private nature and not deductible. In this situation, the visit to the client is in the course of the journey to the tax- payer’s office base, and is necessarily incurred in carrying on her business for the purpose of gaining assessable income, so she is allowed a deduction for the cost of the travel between home and place of business. Depreciation recovered on sale of a building Section 117 - Gain or loss from disposition of depreciable property: A taxpayer read the item in TIB Volume Six, No.1, page 9 (July 1994) on spreading deprecia- tion recovered on buildings. He has a non-standard balance date of 31 October, and has asked if the new section 117 applies to him before 1 April 1993 for depreciation recovered on buildings. In the July TIB we said: The spreading provision does not apply to buildings or other assets sold on or after 1 April 1993. Depreciation recovered after this date is covered by the new section 117. Section 117 applies to intangible property from 1 April 1993, but for other assets it applies from the 1993-94 income year onwards. The taxpayer in the July item had a standard balance date of 31 March, so the new section 117 applied to him from 1 April 1993. However, in this case the taxpayer has a non-standard balance date of 31 October, so the new section 117 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 (February 1995) applies to him from 1 November 1992 (the start of his 1993/1994 income year) for depreciation recovered on buildings and any other assets (except intangible property). Assessability of gain made on depreciated property Section 117 - Gain or loss from disposition of depreciated property: A tax- payer has been renting a residential property for which she has been claiming a deduction for depreciation. Now that she is selling the property, she wonders if she is required to repay any depreciation claimed. Under section 117(2), when a property is sold for more than its “adjusted tax value”, the depreciation recovered is to be treated as assessable income. As depreciation cannot be claimed on land, the value of the land is excluded from the calculations. If the separate values of the land and buildings are not stipulated in the sale and purchase agreement, it is acceptable if the Government valuation prevailing at the time of sale is used to make the apportionment. The amount of depreciation recovered is the lesser of these two amounts: • the allowable depreciation deductions • the amount by which the sale proceeds exceed the “adjusted tax value” of the property at the date of disposition. The “adjusted tax value” of the property is the original cost price, less the depre- ciation allowed during the period of ownership. This calculation ensures that any capital profit made on the sale of the property is not included as assessable income. Example: Original purchase price (excluding land value)$100,000 Total depreciation allowed $ 10,000 Adjusted tax value$ 90,000 Sale price (excluding land value) $125,000 Gain on sale$ 35,000 Depreciation recovered (assessable income)$ 10,000 The depreciation allowable ($10,000) is less than the gain on sale ($35,000), and will be included as assessable income. Deductibility of mortgage repayment insurance taken out to obtain a business loan Section 136 - Expenditure incurred in borrowing money or obtaining lease: A business taxpayer had to take out a mortgage and mortgage repayment insur- ance, in order to borrow money which is to be used to produce assessable in- come. The taxpayer asked if the insurance premiums are deductible, and whether their deductibility hinges on the obligation to take out the insurance. Section 136 allows a deduction for expenses incurred in borrowing money to be used in the production of assessable income. This would include the cost of the mortgage repayment insurance. Examples of other expenses that may be claimed include: legal and registration fees, valuation fees, and solicitors’ fees. The deduction is not contingent upon the insurance being a condition of the loan. continued on page 20 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 (February 1995) Provided any payment received as a result of a claim against this policy is not of the nature of a “loss of profits”, it would be considered to be a capital payment, and would not be liable to income tax. Effect on New Zealand tax payable of overseas tax subject to a refund Section 305 - Recovery of excess credit allowed through not taking into ac- count refund of foreign tax: A taxpayer has advised that she received an unex- pected refund of overseas tax for which she had earlier claimed a credit against New Zealand tax payable. She has asked what the consequences are. Any refund of overseas tax can affect any related New Zealand tax credit al- lowed. Section 305 deems any refunds from overseas taxes paid, which have been allowed as a tax credit, to be income tax due and payable thirty days after the later of these dates: • The date of the notice of determination of the overseas tax credit • The date on which the taxpayer receives the overseas refund. However, if an overseas tax refund does not reduce the overseas tax paid below the amount of the credit allowed, there is no excess credit and the taxpayer is not required to make any payment. In simple terms, the amount of any overseas tax credit claimed is reduced by the amount refunded. If this adjustment results in further tax to pay, the tax is payable as set out above.

Section 336N(1) - Definition of “Emergency call”: As part of his duties, a freez- ing-plant maintenance engineer is required to inspect a client’s large freezing unit each day to ensure that the correct temperature is being maintained. The check is made at noon on each day. On Saturday and Sunday, the engineer travels from his home to conduct the check. The engineer has been provided with a vehicle by his employer to conduct the check, and the employer has asked whether the FBT emergency call exemption applies. Fringe benefit tax is payable for any day that an employer-supplied vehicle is used (or available for use) for the private use or enjoyment of an employee. Private use or enjoyment includes travel by the employee to or from his or her home. However, any day on which the employee is required to use the vehicle to make an “emergency call” is not counted as a day on which the motor vehicle is available for the private use or enjoyment of the employee. An emergency call is a visit that the employee is required to make, in the course of employment, from home. The purpose of the visit must be to provide services that meet one of these conditions: • They are essential to the operation of any plant and machinery of the employer or client or customer. • They are essential to the maintenance of any service provided by a public or local authority, or by any business which comprises the supply of any energy or fuel to the public. • They are emergency services relating to the health or safety of any person. Except for the third purpose above, the emergency call must be made between 6.00 pm and 6.00 am on any week day or at any time on a Saturday, Sunday, or statutory public holiday. In this case, the maintenance of the correct temperature is essential to the opera- tion of the client’s freezing unit. Therefore, the maintenance engineer’s visits on Saturday and Sunday qualify as emergency calls. Any Saturday, Sunday, or public holiday on which such an inspection visit is made will not be a day on which FBT is payable on the vehicle. Treatment of loss when determining income for Family Support Section 374B(1) - Assessable income or loss: A taxpayer conducted a number of allied activities, namely painting and decorating, and carpentry. Because of health problems he has found it necessary to give up those jobs and to take a lighter job; that of an insurance agent. During the income year, the allied activi- ties produced a loss of $14,000, the withholding income from insurance commis- sion totalled $8,000. When making his claim for Family Support, the taxpayer wanted to know if his entitlement could be based on a nil income figure. He believes that his “busi- nesses” should not be separately identified, i.e. the insurance selling should be included with the other activities. Because the taxpayer was registered for GST, he had to account for GST on all his sources of income, except for any exempt supplies. The taxpayer’s Family Support entitlement will be based on the withholding income of $8,000. It is true that GST must be accounted for on all taxable activi- ties, but this rationale cannot be used to link clearly separate sources of income for Family Support purposes. continued on page 22 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 (February 1995) Under section 374B(1)(f), for Family Support purposes the profits of each busi- ness are included for the purposes of calculating the assessable income or loss: the losses are not included and cannot be offset against income from other sources. LAQC shareholder must offset loss in year incurred Section 393 - Qualifying Company regime: A taxpayer was a shareholder of a loss attributing qualifying company (LAQC) which incurred a loss in the 1993 income year. He asked if he could offset his share of the loss against income derived in the 1994 year. The reason for this request was that the taxpayer was eligible to claim rebates for payment of a charitable donation and childcare fees in the 1993 year, and was not going to have tax to pay in that year’s income tax return. If he claimed the LAQC loss in the 1993 year he would get no tax saving from it. He was unable to claim any rebates in the 1994 year, and asked if it was possible instead to claim the 1993 LAQC loss in that (1994) year. A qualifying company (QC) is a closely-held company that meets the criteria of section 393B. An LAQC is a QC that meets the criteria of section 393N. In either situation, an election for QC or LAQC status will have been made by the share- holders and directors of the company concerned. Some of the features of the QC rules are that: • Dividends paid by a QC will either be tax free or will have maximum imputa- tion credits attached. • Capital gains (both realised and unrealised) can be distributed tax-free without winding up the company. • Shareholders of an LAQC can offset losses passed through from the LAQC against their assessable income. The QC rules are explained in TIB Volume Three, No. 7 issued in April 1992. Under section 393P, an LAQC’s loss is deemed to have been incurred by the shareholders in proportion to their effective interest in the LAQC. The LAQC’s loss is attributed to the shareholders, to offset against their assessable income, in that income year. Section 393P(1)(b) provides that the LAQC’s loss is treated for the purposes of the Act as if it were a loss incurred by that shareholder. If the shareholder does not have other assessable income in that year to offset the loss against, he or she may carry the loss forward to the following year in accordance with section 188. The loss of an LAQC is effectively the loss of the shareholders and not the com- pany. As such the shareholder cannot choose when the loss is attributed. As the taxpayer had assessable income in the 1993 year, he was obliged to offset the LAQC loss in that year. Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Whether share trading is a taxable activity Section 3 - Meaning of term “financial services”: A taxpayer is considering going into the business of trading in shares. She has asked if such trading consti- tutes a taxable activity under the Act. from page 21 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 (February 1995) Section 6(1) defines the term “taxable activity”. The ability to register for GST purposes depends upon whether or not a person is conducting a taxable activity. A person who is conducting a taxable activity must register if the total value of supplies made from all taxable activities exceeds $30,000 in any 12 month pe- riod, or may voluntarily register if that total is not exceeded. A taxable activity includes any activity which meets all of these conditions: • It is carried on continuously or regularly, whether or not for a pecuniary profit. • It involves or is intended to involve, in whole or in part, the supply of goods and services to any other person for a consideration. Section 6(3)(d) expressly excludes the making of exempt supplies from the definition of “taxable activity”. Exempt supplies are listed in section 14. An exempt supply includes the supply of financial services. Section 3 defines “financial services”, to include: 3(1)(d) “the issue, allotment, or transfer of ownership of an equity security or a participatory security.” A share is an equity security. Therefore, trading in shares cannot constitute a taxable activity for GST purposes, as it is a financial service which is an exempt supply. GST registered person receiving a benefit on a customer’s behalf Section 5 - Supply received: A taxi operator advised that one of his frequent customers was disabled and required special assistance when she was travelling. The customer was entitled to a disability allowance paid under Part I of the Social Security Act 1964. As the disability allowance was paid by the New Zea- land Income Support Service (NZISS) to cover the costs of the transportation, the disabled person considered it was more convenient to authorise NZISS to pay the allowance directly to the taxi operator. The taxi operator received a weekly amount from NZISS. If this amount was insufficient to cover the services provided during the week, the customer made further payment in cash. The taxi operator asked if receiving the disability allowance was for a taxable supply, and if he should include it in his GST return. If a disabled person arranges for a disability allowance to be paid directly to a third party to pay for services provided in the course of that third party’s taxable activity, the allowance is treated as a payment made in respect of a taxable supply. The taxi operator must include the disability allowance payments from NZISS in his GST return in the same manner as payments received from his other custom- ers. As the taxi operator accounted on the payments basis, he must account for the disability allowance when he receives it from NZISS. He must also account for any cash amounts received from the beneficiary at the time he receives them. Lost property sold by non-profit body Section 8(1) - Imposition of Goods and Services Tax on supply: The treasurer of a golf club that is a non-profit body has asked if the club must account for GST on the sale of unclaimed lost property. From time to time golfers leave personal items such as clothing, shoes, and clubs, on the course. After a reason- able time of holding and advertising the items, any items remaining unclaimed are sold. continued on page 24 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 (February 1995) Section 8(1) imposes GST at the rate of 12.5 percent on the supply of all goods and services made by registered persons, in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity. Section 14(b) exempts “the supply by any non-profit body of any donated goods and services”, from GST. The above exemption will not apply, as the lost property which was sold was not “donated” to the golf club. The golf club must account for the GST on the above sale. It can claim input tax to recover any GST incurred in advertising the lost goods or attempting to locate the owners, provided the usual tax invoice requirements are met. GST input tax deductions on secondhand goods where payment not in a lump sum Section 20(3)(a)(ia) - Deductions from output tax: A GST registered person accounts for GST on the invoice basis, and files returns 2-monthly. She has recently acquired a $12,000 secondhand asset from a non-registered person for use in her taxable activity. The supplier has provided an invoice for the goods, and the parties have agreed that the goods will be paid for over a 6-month period. The registered person has asked if she can claim a secondhand goods input tax deduction of one-ninth of $12,000 in her next GST return, as she holds the records required by section 24(7) in the form of the invoice. When a GST registered person purchases secondhand goods from a non-regis- tered person for use principally in a taxable activity, he or she can claim an input tax deduction of one-ninth of the purchase price. Under section 20(3)(a)(ia), that input tax deduction is limited to the extent that a payment for the supply has been made during the relevant taxable period. This limitation applies regardless of the purchaser’s accounting basis. To support a claim for the input tax deduction, the purchaser must record these details: • the name and address of the supplier • the date of purchase • the quantity of the goods • the price paid. In this instance, the registered person’s input tax deduction claim will be limited to the amount paid in each taxable period. Assuming the $12,000 is paid in six equal instalments, the input tax deduction will be limited to one-ninth of $4,000 in each 2-month taxable period. Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 Loan repayment obligations of a student going overseas Section 32 - Repayment obligations of non-residents: A student who has taken out a student loan plans to go abroad for five years and will be classed as a non- resident for tax purposes. He has asked for details of his repayment obligations during that period. Section 37 requires any student loan borrower going overseas for more than 3 months to provide the Commissioner with any information he might reasonably require to determine the borrower’s non-resident repayment obligation (if any). from page 23 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 (February 1995) In the income year the borrower leaves New Zealand, no non-resident repay- ment obligation is calculated. However, the borrower may have a resident re- payment obligation for the period of residence up to the date of departure, which is based on income earned up to that date. A non-resident’s repayment obligation is based on the outstanding loan balance at 31 March following the date of departure, e.g., the borrower departs on 17 June 1993 - the repayment obligation is based on the loan balance as at 31 March 1994 and calculated as at 1 April 1994. In April each year Inland Revenue sends a non-resident assessment to any borrower who has left New Zealand and ceased to be a resident. The amount payable by a non-resident borrower will be the lesser of the loan balance or $1,000 per annum (or 1/15th of the loan balance if this was $15,000 or over). Section 32B allows the Commissioner to estimate interest on a non-resident borrower’s loan balance. The interest estimate takes into account the payments that are due during the year. Any overpaid or underpaid interest will be added to, or deducted from, the outstanding loan balance except in the final year. The annual repayment is due in four instalments, which are due on 30 June, 30 September, 31 December, and 31 March. Example A Sam leaves New Zealand on 15 December 1994; his loan balance on 31 March 1995 is $4,990. If Sam remains a non-resident, his non-resident annual repay- ment obligation each year will be $1,000 plus estimated interest until the fifth year, when his repayment will be the remaining balance of $990 plus estimated interest. Example B Sally leaves New Zealand on 31 August 1994; her loan balance as at 31 March 1995 is $17,800. Sally’s non-resident annual repayment obligation is $1,186 (that is $17,800 di- vided by 15), plus estimated interest each year. 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 (February 1995) Legal decisions - case notes This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council.

Facts:The objectors, a husband and wife operating in partnership, purchased a yacht to operate as yacht charterers. They entered into a management agreement with a management company which handled all chartering matters. The use of the yacht for private purposes was no more than four or five days per 365 days. The Commissioner’s policy was to allow depreciation at the rate of 10% per annum with an extra allowance of a further 10% when the yacht was used exclusively for renting out to a series of lessees, both rates being on a diminishing value basis. The Commissioner argued that the management agreement was not a “lease” and also that, as the yacht was not exclusively rented out it did not qualify, under the Commissioner’s policy, for the extra 10% depreciation. Decision:The Court found that in terms of the Commissioner’s policy the taxpayers quali- fied for the extra 10% depreciation. The Court found that private use of the yacht, being just over 1% of the year, was immaterial and should be disregarded in this case. The Court also found that the fact that the management agreement 27 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 (February 1995) was not strictly speaking a lease was immaterial. The Court said that the Com- missioner’s policy recognised the extra wear and tear that leased assets were subject to and that the policy was applicable in this case. Comment:Inland Revenue is not appealing this decision. Company loss not able to be offset amongst group Rating:•• Case:TRA Nos. 93/93 and 93/96 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - former sections 188(4) and (6) and 191(5), (7A) and (7B). Keywords:Group company losses, loss of offset, remission/cancellation of debts Summary:The taxpayer companies could not offset certain losses derived from a loss- making group company. This is because those losses arose from deductions claimed for interest payable on debentures, when the interest had not in fact been paid and the underlying debt was subsequently cancelled. The Commis- sioner could deny the taxpayer companies the loss offset even though he could not issue amended assessments to the loss-making company as that company had been struck off. Facts:This case involves the offsetting of group company losses. For the period 1978 to 1983 losses incurred by one group company were offset consecutively against the profits of the taxpayer group companies. In 1991 the loss-making company was in liquidation and subsequently struck off the Register of Companies. Just prior to this, the Commissioner determined that certain debenture interest deductions, which had resulted in that company returning a loss for the 1981 to 1983 income years inclusive, were not deductible. This was because the interest had not in fact been paid, and the underlying debt was remitted or cancelled under section 188(6). The Commissioner calculated that the company had assess- able income for the 1981 and 1982 income years and a reduced loss in 1983. Before the Commissioner could issue amended assessments for that company, it was struck off. The Commissioner issued amended assessments for the taxpayer group companies, reducing their respective loss offsets. The taxpayers con- tended that, reading the relevant sections together, the Commissioner could not reassess them without first reassessing the loss-making company. Decision:Judge Barber confirmed the Commissioner’s amended assessments of the tax- payer companies. He found that in terms of sections 188(4) and (6) the payments by the receivers of the loss-making company to the relevant debenture holder must be treated as repayments of capital and not interest. Accordingly, no interest expenditure had been incurred and none would be incurred as that debt had been cancelled. Judge Barber applied the approach to statutory interpreta- tion outlined by the Court of Appeal in CIR v Alcan NZ Ltd (1994) 16 NZTC 11,175. He held that the proper interpretation of the linkage between sections 188(4) and 191(7B) permits the Commissioner to alter the taxpayers’ assess- ments. This is possible at any time so as to give effect to a reduction in available losses if those losses are not “genuine” because they have been wholly or partly remitted or cancelled. Comment:The taxpayers will be appealing this decision. 28 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 (February 1995) Assessable income for low income rebates Rating:•• Case:TRA Case No. 93/236 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - sections 50C and 50D Keywords:Assessable income, taxable income, loss carried forward, transitional tax allowance, low income rebate Summary:The case establishes that losses arising in previous income years are not taken into account in determining assessable income for the purposes of the transi- tional tax allowance and the low income rebate available under sections 50C and 50D of the Income Tax Act 1976. Facts:A farmer taxpayer incurred a substantial loss in the 1990 income year. This loss was partially offset in the 1991 income year, but the majority of the loss was carried forward and offset against the 1992 profit from the farm and other in- come of $87,622.61. The net income subject to tax in the 1992 income year, after deducting the losses, was $7,246.50. The taxpayer claimed both the transitional tax allowance and the low income rebate on the basis that his income for the purposes of the rebates was less than the limits set by the relevant sections. The Commissioner disallowed the claims and the subsequent objection to the assessments he issued, on the basis that the assessable income used to determine eligibility for the rebates is the income before the offsetting of losses carried forward. The taxpayer requested that a case be stated to the TRA. Decision:Judge Barber found in favour of the Commissioner. Sections 50C and 50D pro- vide a threshold of eligibility for the rebates based upon “assessable income derived by that taxpayer” and not on the basis of the taxable income. Assessable income is the income derived in any particular year before the offsetting of any losses carried forward from any earlier income year. In this case the taxpayer’s assessable income was the income before the losses carried forward were taken into account, so the taxpayer could not claim the rebates. The assessment made by the Commissioner was confirmed. Comment:The taxpayer is not appealing this decision. Assessability of profit on sale of shares Rating:•• Case:TRA No. 91/89 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - section 65(2)(a) and (e) (section BB 4(a) and (c) of the Income Tax Act 1994) Keywords:Sale of shares, business profit, dealer, purpose of resale, purpose of making a profit Summary:The issue in this case was whether the profit on the sale of shares was assess- able. On the facts of this case, the Taxation Review Authority decided that the taxpayer did not make a profit. Even if the taxpayer had made a profit, this was not assessable, as it did not meet any of the tests in section 65(2). Facts:The taxpayer subscribed for 16 million $1 shares of R Investments Ltd. Later, another group of companies acquired a majority shareholding in the group of companies to which the taxpayer belonged. The acquiring group had losses, and five companies in the taxpayer’s group (but not the taxpayer) agreed to make a 29 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 (February 1995) subvention payment to an acquiring group company. Concurrently, the tax- payer sold all its shares in R Investments to a subsidiary of the acquiring group for around $38.5 million. The Commissioner assessed the taxpayer on the profits of the share sales, on the basis that: • The profit was derived from the carrying on of a business; or • The taxpayer was a dealer in shares; or • The taxpayer acquired the shares for the purpose of resale; or • The profit was derived from a scheme entered into for the purpose of making a profit. The taxpayer objected to the assessment. Decision:The Taxation Review Authority decided, on the facts, that the taxpayer did not make a profit on the sale of the shares in R Investments. The difference between the price the taxpayer paid for the shares and the amount it received when selling was intended to restore a fair value to the companies making the subven- tion payment. The sale was to be treated as part of the larger transaction be- tween the two groups of companies. In the alternative, Judge Willy held that even if there had been a profit, none of the tests of assessability in section 65(2)(a) or (e) were satisfied for these reasons: • The taxpayer did not sell the shares in the course of carrying on its business. It was a one-off transaction of a capital nature. • The taxpayer was not a dealer in shares. • The shares were not acquired for the purpose of resale. The shares were ac- quired as an investment of surplus funds. • There was no evidence that there was any scheme or undertaking to make a profit on the sale of the shares. Comment:Inland Revenue is appealing this decision.

A guide to the Re-ordered Tax Acts An explanation of changes, and comparative tables of sections This TIB appendix deals with recent tax legislation. The following Acts were enacted in December 1994: • Income Tax Act 1994 • Tax Administration Act 1994 • Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 The new Acts resulted from the Income Tax Bill 1994, the Tax Administration Bill 1994 and the Taxation Review Authorities Bill 1994 respectively, which were introduced into Parliament in October 1994. These new Acts re-order the Income Tax Act 1976 and the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974. The comparative tables in this appendix cross-refer sections of the new and old Acts. Issued as an appendix to TIB Volume Six, No.9 (February 1995) 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 - Appendix (February 1995) Income Tax Act 1994, Tax Administration Act 1994, and Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 - the re-ordered tax Acts Introduction The three new Acts which will replace the Income Tax Act 1976 and the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 have been passed. Provisions relating to the calculation of tax liabilities are contained in the Income Tax Act 1994. Administra- tive provisions, such as return filing obligations and objection procedures from the Income Tax Act 1976 and other sections from the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974, are located in the Tax Administration Act 1994. Provisions relating to the establishment and operation of the Taxation Review Authorities have been transferred to a separate Act, the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994. Income Tax Act 1994 1 Tax Administration Act 1994 1 Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 1 Charging sections Administrative sections Sections covering TRA operation/establishmen Income Tax Act 1976 1 Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 1 The new legislation is not intended to change any law, apart from the two issues which are explained on page 4. A provision stating this is contained in each of the new Acts. The provisions of the new Acts have been arranged in a new and more logical order, and minor drafting changes have been made to modernise the wording of the legislation. When the new Acts come into force All three Acts come into force on 1 April 1995. The Income Tax Act and the Tax Administration Act apply, where appropriate, for the 1995-96 and subsequent income years. Certain provisions of the Income Tax and Tax Adminis- tration Acts can therefore apply earlier than 1 April 1995 to taxpayers who have early balance dates. For example, for a taxpayer who has a balance date of 30 October (an accounting year from 1 November to 30 October) the new Acts can apply from 1 November 1994. Other provisions which are clearly on an annual basis, such as section 92 of the Tax Administration Act \[Commissioner to make assessments\] and section NC 1 of the Income Tax Act \[Application of PAYE rules\], will apply from 1 April 1995 regardless of a taxpayer’s balance date. Background The Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital, chaired by Mr Arthur Valabh, released its Final Report in October 1992. In this report it recom- mended that the Income Tax Act and the Inland Rev- enue Department Act be reorganised into a more coherent scheme with a logical structure. A major deficiency in the current Acts is the lack of any logical order or structure that reflects the various roles of quantifying taxable income. Provisions are repetitive and cumbersome, and drafting styles are archaic and inconsistent. Advantages of the re-ordering are that it makes the legislation easier to understand and assists in interpreta- tion. It will also facilitate progressive revision of the legislation. The approach taken in the re-ordering is explained in the Second Report of the Working Party on the Reor- ganisation of the Income Tax Act 1976, released in September 1993. That Working Party was also chaired by Mr Valabh. No change to existing law The reorganisation is not intended to change the interpretation or effect of the existing income tax law. However, in order to create a coherent and logical scheme within the Acts, it has been necessary to break up provisions relating to specific tax regimes. Interpre- tational questions may arise about the effect of the provisions as they appear in the re-ordered Acts. Each Act includes a specific provision which stipulates that the reorganisation, and changes of style and language are not intended to change the law. The Courts will have regard to those provisions in deciding any issue which arises. Income Tax Act 1994 - key features Most changes occur in this Act. Departures from the current legislation relate to: • structure • numbering system • placement of definitions. Structure The structure reflects a coherent scheme and purpose by recognising that accounting records are the starting point for calculating tax liabilities. 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 - Appendix (February 1995) N Withholding Taxes and Taxes on the Income of Others Obligations of persons to withhold tax from or pay tax on income or income equivalents O Definitions and Related Matters Meanings of terms that appear in more than one section Y Amendments, Repeals, Savings, and Transitional Provisions Time savings and transitional provisions; Schedules Each Part of the new Act begins with Subpart B. Generic purpose provisions that contribute to a clearer understanding of the Part and facilitate an understand- ing of the structure of the Act will be drafted and inserted as Subpart A, as part of the re-write exercise - see “Future direction”, below. Other structural features are: • Grouping of Subparts within Parts has tended to be on the basis of moving from general to specific provi- sions. • Provisions that provided that references to income year included references to corresponding non- standard accounting years and so on have been amalgamated in section OF 2. (For example, section OF 2(2)(h)(iii) signposts the treatment which was previously reflected in section 75(4)). • Matrimonial property provisions have been amalga- mated in Part FF. Some of the original matrimonial property provisions have been archived, as they were reproduced in a slightly modified format. (For exam- ple, the effect of the proviso to section 65(2)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1976 is reflected in section FF 3, but the drafting is modified to reflect the format of the new Act). • Each Part contains a Subpart Z entitled “Terminating Provisions” which is reserved for provisions that have temporary operative effect and will cease to exist over the passage of time. Numbering system Each Part and Subpart within a Part of the re-ordered Income Tax Act is lettered alphabetically, and provi- sions have been ordered within each of those Subparts. Sections within each Subpart are numbered consecu- tively in ordinary numerals. Subsections, paragraphs and subparagraphs are either renumbered or relettered (refer to the Tables of Conversion, or “Keys”, later in this issue). The alphanumeric numbering system has two principal benefits: • Each section reference provides a guide to the content and subject matter associated with the relevant provision. • The system can easily accommodate insertions of new provisions each time the Act is amended. The approach (referred to as the “transactions ap- proach” in the Working Party’s report) is: Revenue less Expenditure (deductions)(Parts B - D) adjustedTiming/apportionment/ fortax avoidance(Parts E - G) equalsNet income(Parts H & I) givingTax liability rise to(including surcharges)(Part J) offset byRebates/credits for tax paid(Parts K & L) leavingTax to pay or be refunded(Part M) The new Act is divided into 16 Parts, with the short title and commencement provision (section A 1) falling outside the Part structure. The new Parts are: A Purpose and Construction Purpose and interpretation B Core Provisions Basic and fundamental provisions relating to the quantification and imposition of the tax liability C Income Further Defined Scope of taxable income or income equivalents D Deductions Further Defined Scope of expenditures; clawbacks E Timing of Income and Deductions When income is taxable and expenditure deductible F Apportionment and Recharacterised Transactions Treatment of transactions with more than one purpose; transactions where form differs from substance G Avoidance and Non-Market Transactions Treatment of tax avoidance; market value of non- market transactions H Treatment of Net Income of Certain Entities Net income or losses of different kinds of taxable entities IAssessment of Income and Treatment of Losses Calculation of assessable income and eligibility to, and restrictions from, carrying forward losses J Surcharges Imposition of surcharges K Rebates Entitlement of taxpayers to different types of rebates L Credits Entitlement of taxpayers to credits for taxes paid M Tax Payments Quantification and payment of provisional and terminal tax; operation of memorandum accounts under the full imputation, dividend withholding payment, and branch equivalent tax regimes continued on page 4 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 - Appendix (February 1995) 64M • RWT rules, previously Part IXA • SSCWT rules, previously Part XC • Time bar, previously section 25 • Trust rules, previously sections 227 to 233. Placing the definitions after the substantive provisions in an Act is a major departure from the normal treat- ment. This was done because of the very large number of definitions used in the Income Tax Act. Their placement in the front of the Act would detract from the substantive provisions. Tax Administration Act 1994 - key features The Tax Administration Act is a consolidation of the administrative and procedural provisions originally contained in the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 and the Income Tax Act 1976. This Act deals with the basic elements on which the operation of the tax system is based, and with the structure of the Inland Revenue Department. Structure The Act is structured around the relationship between the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and the taxpayer. Key elements of this relationship are: • the flow of information from taxpayers to the Com- missioner through tax returns • the assessment of tax liability by the Commissioner • the objection process • payments from taxpayers to the Crown • the obligations imposed on taxpayers to comply with the law and the consequences of failing to do so. The Tax Administration Act is divided into 15 Parts (each representing a key element in the relationship). The short title and commencement provision are outside the Part structure. Because this Act is much smaller than the Income Tax Act, it uses a conventional numbering system rather than the alphanumeric section numbering adopted in the Income Tax Act. The new Parts are: IPurpose and Construction Purpose and interpretation II Commissioner and Department Establishment of Inland Revenue Department; appointment of officers III Information, Record-Keeping, and Returns Commissioner’s powers to obtain information; taxpayer’s obligations to keep records; other obliga- tions to keep and provide records; requirements to file returns IVSecrecy from page 3 Reference to a section begins with an alphabetical reference to the Part and Subpart in which the provision is contained. For example, a reference to section MD 4 (previously section 394ZZZJ \[Refund of income tax not to exceed amount of imputation credit balance\]) indi- cates that the section appears in Part M - Tax Payments, Subpart D - Refunds. This type of section identifier is more informative than one entitled 394ZZZJ, and will enable users to become more aware of the modular structure of the Act, as they become accustomed to the numbering system. For example, over time users will become familiar with the notion that Part M “deals with Tax Payments”, and that Subpart D of Part M “deals with Refunds”. Another feature of the new numbering system is that it is more flexible. Unwieldy and cumbersome section references such as 394ZZZJ will be unnecessary in the future. Each Subpart of the Act will now be amended as a separate and discrete module. As new provisions are inserted in the Income Tax Act 1994, it will be possible to add new sections at the end of any relevant Subparts to which the new sections relate without interrupting the sequential numbering of provisions. Definitions Part O Subpart B, “General Definitions”, contains a dictionary of all terms that have specified meanings found in the Income Tax Act 1994. Definitions of terms which are used in more than one section are grouped in section OB 1. Generally, when a term is used in only one section, the definition is in that section, and a cross-reference to that definition is included in section OB 1. Sections OB 2, OB 3, OB 4 and OB 5 contain the meanings of source deduction payment, qualifying company, pay-period taxpayer, non-resident investment company and income tax. Subpart Z, “Transitional Definitions”, contains a list of new terms that are used in the Income Tax Act 1994 which refer to particular sections or Parts in the 1976 Act. For example, where the Income Tax Act 1976 referred to “sections 64B to 64L” the reference in the new Act reads the “accruals rules”, which is defined to mean those sections that were previously sections 64B to 64L. Similar terms have been defined for other commonly found references. These are: • Consolidation rules, previously sections 191C to 191WC • Dividend withholding payment rules, previously Part XIIB • FBT rules, previously Part XB • FIF rules, previously section 245R to 245RN • Imputation rules, previously Part XIIA • International tax rules, previously Part IVA • Life insurance rules, previously section 204 to 205F • NRWT rules, previously Part IX • PAYE rules, previously Part XI • Provisional tax rules, previously Part XII • Qualified accruals rules, previously section 64B to 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 - Appendix (February 1995) New policy The only new policy that arose in the re-ordering process is contained in this Act. Two changes have been made to satisfy Bill of Rights considerations. • If Inland Revenue seeks to enter a private dwelling to obtain information, and the occupier refuses entry, a judicial warrant must be obtained before entering (section 16(3) to (7) of the Tax Administration Act 1994). • Witnesses at a Commissioner’s inquiry will be protected if they give self-incriminating evidence (section 19 (3) and (4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994). These changes were also enacted in the Inland Revenue Department Amendment Act (No. 2) 1994. Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 - key features This Act contains provisions concerning the establish- ment and operation of Taxation Review Authorities. This Act contains five Parts, with the short title and commencement provision falling outside the Part structure. It also uses a conventional numbering system. As in the Tax Administration Act, definitions have been placed at the front of the Act in section 3. Other terms found in the Taxation Review Authorities Act, depend- ing on the context, import the meanings given to them by the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administra- tion Act 1994. Stylistic changes to the three new Acts All references to archaic terms such as aforementioned, thereof or thereon have been replaced with terms found in modern plain language. Other expressions such as as the case may be were edited from the legislation where their presence served no purpose and where this would not create any ambiguities. Other stylistic changes include: • the use of gender-neutral language unless the context required a distinction to be drawn between males and females • the use of “running heads” on each page of the new Income Tax Act which indicate the contents of each page of the legislation • the change in date format - for example, 1 January 1995 rather than 1st day of January 1995 • replacing the expression for the purposes of with in this section, in the context of definitions Officers’ responsibility to maintain secrecy VRulings and Determinations Commissioner’s determinations relating to financial arrangements and petroleum mining operations VIAssessments Commissioner’s authority to issue assessments and make determination of losses VII Interest Commissioner’s authority to charge and pay interest VIII Objections Taxpayer’s rights to object to assessments and determinations; right to apply for a case stated IXAdditional Tax Commissioner’s right to charge additional tax for late payment and to charge special additional taxes XRecoveries Methods of recovering unpaid tax and tax deduc- tions XIRemission, Relief, and Refunds Remission and relief from paying tax; Commis- sioner’s authority for making refunds XII Offences and Penalties Imposition of penal tax; objections to penal tax assessments; recovery of unpaid penal tax Description of offences; proceedings, evidence and penalties relating to offences XIII Miscellaneous Regulation making and other powers XIV Transitional Provisions and Savings Time savings and transitional provisions; Sched- ule Definitions Because there are fewer definitions in the Tax Adminis- tration Act than in the Income Tax Act 1994, the definitions in the former have been placed at the front of the Act, in section 3, instead of at the end of the sub- stantive provisions. Some cases specifically cross-refer to meanings given in section OB 1 of the Income Tax 1994. Other terms found in the Tax Administration Act, depending on the context, import the meaning given to them in the Income Tax Act 1994. An example would be the term “RWT rules”. Where a term is used in only one section, the definition is in that section, and a cross-reference to that definition is included in section 3. continued on page 6 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 - Appendix (February 1995) provides for the application of the rest of section 140AA with effect from 1 April 1989. The applica- tion provision is no longer necessary and has been omitted. 3. It may rely on a provision which has been repealed or has ceased to have operative effect. For example, section 63(2B) of the Income Tax Act 1976 provides that a dividend is exempt if fringe benefit tax is paid on it under section 336N(8). Since section 336N(8) has been repealed, section 63(2B) is no longer effective, and has been omitted. 4. It may have relied on a repealed regime, scheme or an office that no longer exists. For example, section 130 of the Income Tax Act 1976 allowed a deduc- tion to taxpayers approved under a stock unit increase programme approved by the Rural Banking and Finance Corporation of New Zealand. That programme has ceased, so section 130 is redundant and has been omitted. 5. It may have expanded or limited the meaning of a term used in the Act, and as a result been placed in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, or section 3 of the Tax Administration Act or the Taxation Review Authorities Act. For example, section 188C(1)(d) of the Income Tax Act 1976 provides information about the definition of resident mining operator and other terms. Since the defini- tions of those terms are now included in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, section 188(1)(d) has been omitted. 6. It may have been intended to be transitional in nature. For example, section 197D of the Income Tax Act 1976 was not re-enacted because the subject matter with which it was concerned, Harbour Boards, no longer exists. 7. It may duplicate or perform the same function as another provision. For example, see section 394ZC (1), (3), and (4) of the Income Tax Act 1976 and section CF 6(1) and (2) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Savings provisions The new Acts have comprehensive savings provisions which provide that a reference to a provision of the old Act may be construed as a reference to the correspond- ing provision of the new Act, if the context of the reference permits, and vice versa. (See sections YB 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and 227 of the Tax Adminis- tration Act.) Comparative tables Schedule 23 to the Income Tax Act 1994 lists: • sections of the Income Tax Act 1976 and correspond- ing provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 (Part A) • sections of the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 and corresponding provisions of the Tax Administra- • the use of numerals rather than words to express quantities (except where a sentence begins with an amount); • omitting redundant expressions such as of this Act or of this section where the context permitted this; All cross-references within a provision to other sections, Parts, or Subparts of the Income Tax Act 1976 that have been broken up in the re-ordering process have been rationalised and limited to those sections that were relevant. Example 1 Section 185(5)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1976 contained a reference to section 188. The new equivalent of section 188 of the Income Tax Act 1994 has been split into 4 new sections, IE 1, IF 1, GC 2 and OF 2. In the Income Tax Act 1994 a reference to section 188 therefore would be to sections IE 1, IF 1, GC 2, and OF 2. However, section EI 10(5)(b) (the equivalent of 185(5)(b)) only refers to IE 1, and IF 1. The other new sections that came from old section 188 are irrelevant in the context of section EI 10(5)(b) and have not been included. Example 2 The Income Tax Act 1976 contained references to Part IV and Part IVA (as a consequence of section 245X). Part IV has been broken up in the Income Tax Act 1994, and references to Part IV in the new Act have generally been replaced by the terms general assessment or general income tax assess- ment made by the Commissioner. In a few cases, the expression Part IV was replaced with a reference to Parts B, C, E, and F of the Income Tax Act 1994. See section OZ 1(2), (3), and (4). Redundant provisions Provisions that no longer had operative effect or that were identical and duplicated for no substantive reason were not re-enacted. A provision may have been redundant for any of the reasons listed below: 1. It may have ceased to have effect on a date before 1 April 1995. For example, section 61(3) of the Income Tax Act 1976 provided that the first $100 of interest, dividends, or investment society dividends earned between 1 April 1989 and 30 September 1989 was exempt from tax. As that section is no longer effective, it has been omitted. 2. It may have provided that a certain provision has an application date before 1 April 1995 (the applica- tion date for the Income Tax Act 1994). For exam- ple, section 140AA(2) of the Income Tax Act 1976 from page 5 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.9 - Appendix (February 1995) • sections of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 and corresponding provisions of the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 (Part F). These tables are reprinted in this TIB. Future direction The next step is to re-write the Acts in plain language. This task will be completed over a number of years. The re-write exercise will start with the Core Provisions (Part B of the Income Tax Act 1994). The rewritten legislation relating to that Part is expected to be intro- duced this year. Comparative tables of old and new provisions The following pages contain tables of old and new provisions of the tax Acts. These tables are taken from Schedule 23 of the Income Tax Act 1994. They show which sections of the previous tax Acts correspond to the provisions of the new Acts, and vice versa. Notes: 1. The letters “TAA” in the 2nd or 3rd column of any table indicate that the provision referred to appears in the Tax Administration Act 1994. 2. The letters “TRA” in the 2nd or 3rd column of any table indicate that the provision referred to appears in the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994. 3. The letters “IRD” in the 2nd or 3rd column of any table indicate that the provision referred to was a provision of the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974. 4.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.14 (June 1995) - Appendix Taxpayers in financial difficulties Section 177, Tax Administration Act 1994 1. Introduction 1.1This item sets out the Commissionerís policy in applying section 177 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Section 177 provides the Commissioner with the power to remit and/or defer the payment of certain taxes owed by taxpayers who are in ìfinancial difficultiesî. A copy of section 177 is attached as Addendum A. 1.2In preparing any policy statement, we consult with the NZ Society of Accountants, the NZ Law Society, the Tax Education Office and the Corporate Taxpayer Group if it is possible to do so. We did so in preparing this item. However, the policy statement represents the views of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 1.3The policy statement explains how we will use our powers under section 177 to enable taxpayers who are in financial difficulties to settle or rearrange their outstanding obligations. Section 177 allows the Crown to derive an effective return, and may enhance the taxpayerís prospects for financial recovery. 1.4Individuals, self-employed persons, companies, trustees, incorporated societies, or any other taxpayer can use section 177. 1.5It is important that taxpayers who may not be able to meet their tax liabilities see us at an early stage about using section 177. This allows us to explain their options to them. If they allow their financial problems to become too pressing they may be unable to make appropriate restructuring arrangements. Section 177 may help us preserve a taxpayerís future earning capacity and thus prevent recovery being hampered by increased tax liabilities. If we can provide relief under section 177, the taxpay- erís other creditors may join in a settlement arrange- ment and not resort to bankrupting the taxpayer or applying to the court to have the company put into liquidation. 1.6Unlike most other creditors, Inland Revenue is under a strict statutory duty to keep a taxpayerís affairs confidential. However, section 81(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 authorises the Commissioner to communicate such matters or information to other persons for the purpose of carrying into effect the Inland Revenue Acts and the Accident Compensation Act 1982, Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 and the New Zealand Superannua- tion Act 1974. This means that we are able to, and may well want to, discuss any proposed relief arrangement with the taxpayerís other creditors. We will, however, advise taxpayers if we are going to discuss their tax affairs with their other creditors. 1.7We do not charge for our advice or services. However, we do ask taxpayers to support their applica- tion with certain information - see Addendum B ìInformation required in an application for relief under section 177, Tax Administration Act 1994. 1.8Compiling the necessary information will probably involve some work on the taxpayerís part. However, we expect that the information may also be useful in seeking to negotiate arrangements with other creditors. 2. When section 177 can be used 2.1Section 177 gives us some of the flexibility that other unsecured creditors have. It allows us to crystallise a taxpayerís tax liabilities and to arrange with the taxpayer the best way of settling them. We can remit or defer the payment of some or all of the tax owing by taxpayers in financial difficulties. It also allows us to deal with tax that may arise from any restructuring arrangements. 2.2The key part of section 177 is subsection (1) which reads: (1) Subject to this section, on application for relief made in writing by or on behalf of any taxpayer who: (a) Is, or is likely to become, liable for payment of - (i) Any amount of income tax levied under section BB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 in respect of the income derived by that taxpayer (whether that income is income derived or deemed to be derived under the qualified accruals rules or otherwise); or (ii)Any amount of fringe benefit tax; and (b) Is at the time of the application in financial difficul- ties,- the Commissioner may, if the Commissioner considers it necessary or desirable to do so in order to maximise the net present value (calculated as at the date of application) of any recovery or likely recovery from the taxpayer of that amount of income tax or fringe benefit tax, or any part of the income tax or fringe benefit tax, grant relief to the taxpayer by either or both of - (c) The remission of the whole or part of that amount of income tax or fringe benefit tax; or (d) Entering into an arrangement with the taxpayer for the payment of the whole or part of that amount of income tax or fringe benefit tax. 2.3Section 177 (1)(a)(i) specifically refers to tax on income derived under the qualified accruals rules of the Income Tax Act 1994. Section 177 (1)(a)(i) is particu- larly relevant to any income that arises by virtue of debts being forgiven. The reference ensures that we can remit this assessable income as part of the arrangement. 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.14 (June 1995) - Appendix 2.4Section 177 can be used if: ï A taxpayer (or someone acting on behalf of the taxpayer) makes written application to us; and ï The taxpayer is or is likely to be liable to pay income tax levied under section BB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 or fringe benefit tax (ìFBTî); and ï The taxpayer is in ìfinancial difficultiesî; and ï The Commissioner considers it necessary or desirable to provide relief in order to maximise the net present value of any recovery or likely recovery from the taxpayer of that amount of income tax or FBT. 2.5 Application in writing We can only use section 177 if a taxpayer (or agent) applies to us for relief in writing. 2.6 Scope of section’s application We can use section 177 to provide relief from existing tax liabilities. We can also use it to provide relief from liabilities that are likely to arise. Thus we can also use it to remit taxes that are likely to arise from any debt remission that occurs under a debt restructuring ar- rangement. We will not normally use section 177 to remit future taxes yet to be incurred in the normal course of the taxpayerís business. We are unlikely to have sufficient information to reliably assess the taxpayerís long-term prospects. If future tax liabilities impact on the taxpay- erís recovery, the taxpayer can submit a subsequent application when those liabilities are incurred. 2.7 The applicable taxes Section 177 provides relief for income tax and for FBT. That includes: ï Income tax. ï Fringe benefit tax. ï Interest on FBT (sections 123 and 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994). ï Recovery of any family support tax credit given to reduce income tax. ï Any retirement tax part of any income tax (section 257A of the Income Tax Act 1976 (repealed)). ï Any penal tax on any of the above (section 187 of the Tax Administration Act 1994). ï Additional tax added to income tax (section 139 of the Tax Administration Act 1994) or FBT (section 144(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994). ï However, section 177 does not allow us to deal with any outstanding liability for: ï GST. ï New Zealand superannuitant surcharge. ï Withholding tax deductions. ï Any other ìincome taxî that is not levied under section BB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. (Not all taxes imposed under the Income Tax Act are levied under section BB 1.) 2.8 “In financial difficulties” 2.8.1Section 177 can only be applied where the taxpayer is in financial difficulties. This is not a defined term, nor is it an accepted legal or accounting concept. We will interpret the term in an expansive manner. 2.8.2We consider that a taxpayer is in financial difficulties if the personís financial situation is such that debts cannot be paid on time, and either ï There is a real prospect that creditors will be able to have the taxpayer put into liquidation, or adjudged bankrupt; or ï The taxpayerís debts are a substantial limitation on carrying out normal income producing activities. 2.8.3We will take account of contingent liabilities (that is, present liabilities to pay money on the happen- ing of some future event at some future date) or term liabilities (that is, those that have yet to mature, e.g., debentures payable 2 years from now) that the taxpayer may have. However, we will only take these into account where we can reliably estimate them and are satisfied that the taxpayer is obliged to pay them when they occur or mature. We will take a similar approach to any future income. We will be careful about contingencies. Sometimes contingent creditors can have a taxpayer put into liquidation or bankrupted. Also current creditors may have concerns if a taxpayer has large contingent debts. They may seek to bankrupt or put the taxpayer into liquidation when otherwise they would let the debt continue. Although these situations will not stop us from using section 177 to grant relief, we would expect the taxpayer to ensure that the contingent liability will not affect the payments to be made to us in the proposed debt restructuring. 2.8.4In order to confirm that the taxpayer is having, or will have, difficulties in meeting financial obliga- tions, we require the information referred to in Adden- dum B ìInformation required in an application for relief under section 177 of the Tax Administration Act 1994î to be supplied. We will need: ï A full list of the taxpayerís creditors. ï A list of the amounts owing to the creditors. ï A complete statement of the resources the taxpayer has available to pay those liabilities. 2.8.5Taxpayers will need to produce budgets, and explain the assumptions on which they base those budgets. They need to indicate if any assets will not be sold, and if so, explain why. We may want to see the taxpayerís bills and speak to any other creditors. We may also want to verify the budgets and the assumptions upon which they are based. 2.8.6We will want to know the priority of any out- standing debts. For example, the taxpayer must pay secured creditors before unsecured creditors such as us. 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.14 (June 1995) - Appendix We also want to know what money the taxpayer has available for paying bills. Taxpayers cannot put money aside for other purposes unless there is a legal require- ment to do so. An example of this would be PAYE deductions and GST which are moneys held in trust for the Crown. These are not available to taxpayers to satisfy their own debts. Examples of “in financial difficulties” A. A taxpayer is not likely to be in financial difficulties if: (a) Bills cannot be paid on time, but the taxpayer expects to be able to pay them late and creditors are not complaining. (b) Bills cannot be paid on time, but some creditors have complained (although none have threatened legal action.) (c) Bills cannot be paid on time and, although a creditor has threatened legal action, it is expected that the creditor can be paid in the very near future. (d) Bills cannot be paid on time, but the taxpayer disputes that the debt is owed and will defend the legal proceedings. (e) Bills are currently paid on time, but the taxpayer wants to expand the business, e.g., the taxpayer needs to buy another vehicle and some equipment to do so. A detailed budget shows that for the first few months of this expansion the taxpayer cannot pay bills on time, but will be able to pay them late. B. A Taxpayer may be in financial difficulties if: (a) The taxpayer cannot pay bills on time, but expects to be able to pay them late. Some creditors have complained. Some are taking legal action. This late payment practice is known locally and some suppli- ers refuse to supply on credit. As a result the tax- payer regularly cannot source supplies. This results in the taxpayer failing to fulfil some contracts that otherwise would be fulfilled. The taxpayerís staff are often idle as a result. (b) The taxpayer is a company that cannot meet its current debts without selling a fixed asset. Because the sale would be urgent, it would realise less than the normal sale price. The sale of the asset would threaten the future of the business. (c) A customer who owes the taxpayer a lot of money is in severe financial difficulty and is likely to close down. The taxpayerís budget shows that if the customer does not pay the taxpayer, the taxpayer cannot pay bills. We canít tell if this taxpayer is in financial difficul- ties without more information about what, and when, the customer is likely to be able to pay. (d) As in (c) above, but the taxpayer knows that pay- ment will not be made for at least seven months. The taxpayer will not be able to meet liabilities until the payment is made. In a case such as this the taxpayer may be in finan- cial difficulties. Other factors will also be considered (e.g., the impact of the liquidity problem on opera- tions). The time to expected payment is not neces- sarily the key problem. The taxpayer may be able to survive the liquidity problem for more than seven months, or might not be able to survive it for one month, depending on the circumstances of the case. If Inland Revenue is the only significant creditor, we might be prepared to consider deferring collection action until the insolvent debtorís position is clear and the applicant has received whatever payments the insolvent debtor is able to make. (e) Lenders have refused to advance any further funds to the taxpayer. As a result, the taxpayer cannot pay bills and is unable to source supplies reliably. This causes a failure to fulfil some contracts that other- wise would be fulfilled. The taxpayerís staff are often idle as a result of the taxpayerís financial position. (f) The taxpayer is a company and has not been able to pay its bills for some months. Its shareholders will not support it. It has received notice that one of its creditors is seeking to have it put into liquidation. (g) The taxpayer is an individual who has been unable to pay bills for some months. A judgment creditor serves a bankruptcy notice on the taxpayer who pays the debt owing to the judgment creditor but cannot pay other creditors. (h) As in example B(d), and the taxpayer companyís major shareholder fails and cannot honour the guarantee given to the bank for the companyís overdraft. 2.9 Living costs, including housing 2.9.1Where an individual applies for relief under section 177, we will need to consider how the taxpayerís living costs affect the ability to pay bills. We expect applicants to have prepared a personal budget based on reasonable living costs. We will not force the taxpayer into hardship, but section 177 only lets us consider ìfinancialî difficulties. We cannot take into account any social difficulties that may result from the taxpayerís financial position. For example, housing is important. It is a big part of the cost of living for most people. Within reason, we will try to assist taxpayers who own a house and want to try to keep it. However, if the house is particularly valuable and its sale could be used to meet debts without depriv- ing the taxpayer of adequate housing elsewhere, or affecting the rights of any secured creditors, we would consider asking the taxpayer to sell it. We will, how- ever, recognise a spouseís ìprotected interestî in a matrimonial home under section 20(2) of the Matrimo- nial Property Act 1976. The value of this ìprotected interestî will not be regarded as part of the taxpayerís available assets. We will also recognise any rights protected by the Joint Family Homes Act 1964. 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.14 (June 1995) - Appendix Where a couple or a family (whether a legal marriage or otherwise) depends on the taxpayerís housing, we will consider proposals to protect their interests. In any case we will take into account any other personís legal or equitable interest in property when considering any proposal put to us. 2.9.2A taxpayer may live in, or use, a property owned by a trust or a company that the taxpayer controls, is related to, or derives benefit from. We would examine such an arrangement and consider any proposal made for using that property to meet some of the debts. 2.9.3Where an individual makes an application for relief, we expect the application to identify any sources of financial support. We will want to know the extent to which those sources may be able to be used to support the taxpayer. We may ask potential contributors of support for details of the extent to which they are willing, or able (in the case for example of a trust) to meet the taxpayerís living costs, and which liabilities they could meet to prevent the taxpayer from being bankrupted or subjected to any other financial limita- tion. 2.9.4Each case will depend upon its particular circumstances. As we said above, we will not force a taxpayer into hardship. But as a creditor, the Crown cannot be expected to remit or defer outstanding tax obligations to allow the taxpayer or dependants to maintain a certain lifestyle. We will expect taxpayers to organise their affairs in good faith and in a manner consistent with their financial position. 2.9.5We will, therefore, examine any arrangement that appears designed to prejudice the rights of any creditor before we grant any relief under this section. 3. What we can do under section 177 3.1We can grant relief under section 177 by either or both: ï Remitting the whole or part of the amount of income tax or FBT: ï Entering into an arrangement with the taxpayer for the payment of the whole or part of that amount of the income tax or FBT in two or more instalments. 3.2We discuss the details of the relief available further in paragraph 6 of this item. 3.3In entering into such an arrangement we must ensure that we seek the best possible return for the Crown. Section 177(1) says the Commissioner may grant relief if the Commissioner ìconsiders it necessary or desirable to do so in order to maximise the net present value ...of any recovery or likely recovery from the taxpayer of that amount of income tax or fringe benefit tax, ..., or any part thereof...î. (emphasis added). The net present value of the recoveries and likely recoveries under any proposal will be the total of the present values of all the payments that will be made (or can reasonably be expected to be made) if we accept the proposal. Addendum C, ìCalculating the Net Present Valueî, sets out the procedure for calculating the net present value. The net present value of the recovery is calculated at the date that the taxpayer lodges the section 177 application. 3.4This means we compare the net present values of the various options available to us. We will take the option that provides the greatest net present value. We discount each expected recovery (including what we would get if we sought immediate payment) for the time value of money and for the likelihood of receiving the money. Therefore, we need to work out the amount, date, and probability of each recovery that the option will provide, and apply an appropriate discount rate. In determining the appropriate ìdiscount rateî for the net present value calculation, we use the rate of government securities for the appropriate term. Addendum D ìCalculating the Discount Rateî, explains the method of calculation. 3.5Where any payments are secured over, or rely on the realisation of assets, we expect an independent valuation of those assets to accompany the written application. The assets should have been valued no later than three months before the date of the application. 3.6If the net present value calculation is very close to what we would get if we sought immediate payment and we agree it is a ìborderlineî case, we will: ï Accept - if the net present value of the proposal is equal to or only just above the net present value of what weíd get if we sought immediate payment. ï Decline - if the net present value of the proposal is below the net present value of what weíd get if we sought immediate payment taking account of the time and expense of taking proceedings for immediate recovery. Where the net present value of the proposal is only just less than the net present value of enforcing judgment, we will be prepared to negotiate with the taxpayer and ask whether the value of the proposal can be increased so that it exceeds what we would get if we sought immediate recovery. 3.7We must make our own decision in evaluating any proposal under section 177. We may come up with a different result than that suggested by the taxpayer. For example, we might disagree about the probability of a payment being made. Where such a disagreement occurs, we will discuss the matter with the taxpayer and explain why we disagree with the calculations. We will revise our assessment if it can be shown that our evaluation or calculations were wrong. 3.8The following are examples of assessments of the probabilities of payment being made in particular circumstances. They are intended to enable both Inland Revenue staff and applicants to approach the assessment of the probability of payment in a systematic manner. They are not categories into which applications will be placed. Each payment will be assessed in accordance with its own particular circumstances. 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.14 (June 1995) - Appendix The examples are: Probability of repayment 100% Cash or any short-term asset held by or payable to the taxpayer on or before the date the Commissioner is to be paid. 100% Cash or any other short-term near-cash asset held in trust if the trustee has agreed to pay the amount to the Commissioner, alone or together with other creditors (where the trustee is in the Commissionerís view bona fide and controls net assets clearly sufficient to meet the pay- ment). 100% The payment to the Commissioner is uncondi- tionally guaranteed by a person whose net assets are clearly sufficient to meet the pay- ment. 90% The payment is secured to the Commissioner over assets to be realised within a year. The amount of all payments that are reasonably expected to be funded from that realisation is not more than 80% of the current market value of those assets. 80% The payment is secured to the Commissioner over assets that are readily realisable before the date of payment, which is more than a year away. The amount of all payments that are to be funded from that realisation is not more than 80% of the current market value of those assets. 60% The payment will be made within one year. It will be funded by a budgeted cash surplus from a currently trading business. The business has the written support of those creditors and major clients who could be reasonably expected to be crucial to the viability of the business over the term to the date of payment. 45-55% The payment will be made between one year and two years out. It is to be funded by a budgeted cash surplus from a currently trading business. The business has no major clients so it cannot rely for viability on the support of individual creditors and major clients (50%). However, having survived the first year of restructuring it should be capable of continu- ing, provided market conditions do not deterio- rate and the management is sound (55%). On the other hand, if the original problems were caused by poor management and market forecasts are only mediocre, the probability of the payment being made would only be about 45%. 20-30% The taxpayer expects to secure a sub-contract on a building development which is planned to commence between one year and two years out. The building industry is depressed and the taxpayerís plant is at the end of its economic life. 3.9Where this probability assessment is being attributed to the expected returns on a future project (such as completion of a construction contract), the assessment should be applied to the expected net cash flows from that project or contract - see Addendum C. 4. The application 4.1We can only use the powers in section 177 when the taxpayer (or the applicant, making application on the taxpayerís behalf) applies for relief in writing. 4.2There is a form (IR 40E) that can accompany any application. While using this form is not a statutory requirement, it details the information that we seek from the taxpayer. 4.3The application should outline the taxpayerís relief request. It should outline the payments for which remittance is requested. It should also outline the payments that the taxpayer proposes to make and when they are to be made. As previously indicated in para- graph 1.7 above, a more complete explanation of the information we require is set out in Addendum B. We do not expect taxpayers to undertake the calcula- tions involved in determining either the discount rates or net present value of their proposals. Our staff will undertake those calculations. However, there is no reason why taxpayers should not undertake the calcula- tion if they wish - Addenda C and D, at the end of the item, set out the formulae. 4.4Where another person makes the application on behalf of a taxpayer, we require evidence that the person has the necessary authority or legal right to act for the taxpayer. We must ensure that the person has the necessary authority to negotiate with us and to enter the taxpayer into a legally binding arrangement. This authority can take any of a number of forms, some of which include: ï Written instructions signed by the taxpayer or direc- tors (if the taxpayer is a company). A copy should be provided with the application. ï An agent of the taxpayer should provide a copy of the agency agreement (unless already provided for other tax matters). ï Someone with a power of attorney for the taxpayer should provide a copy of the power of attorney plus a certificate signed by the holder of the power of attorney to the effect that it has not been revoked. ï If the application is made by the taxpayerís employee, he or she should provide a signed copy of his or her employerís instructions with the application. ï An officer of the taxpayer with the power to act for the taxpayer (for example, a managing director of a company may have the right to bind the company) should provide a copy of his or her appointment to the office, (e.g., the articles of association, the company constitution, the company resolution authorising the officer to act or the contract under which the officer holds office). 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.14 (June 1995) - Appendix ï An applicant who is a trustee of the affairs of a taxpayer under a legal disability (e.g., mental incapac- ity), should provide a copy of the order or document appointing him or her as trustee, plus a statement to the effect that it remains in force. 4.5The net present value is ìcalculated as at the date of applicationî, the day that we receive the appli- cation, not when we decide whether to give relief under section 177(1). This means that the longer it takes to finalise the restructuring and negotiate with other creditors, the greater the discount factor will be. This will, in turn, reduce the net present value of the pro- posal. That is because the net present value of a pay- ment decreases as the time of payment is deferred. Taxpayers should settle as much as possible of any debt restructuring proposal (including negotiations with us) before they make a formal application for relief. It may be helpful to discuss the restructuring proposal with us before an application is lodged. Our staff can also help with any questions about the procedure for making the application. 4.6The taxpayer is not required to give us notice of an intended application. However, discussing the matter with us prior to making the application may prove beneficial to both parties. Ideally, for an arrangement to remit or accept instalment payments for tax up to $50,000 we would like at least: ï 5 working days notice of the intention to make an application and a general description of the proposal; and ï 10 working days from receiving the application (and all the required supporting information) to the day on which the arrangement takes effect. 4.7We cannot approve any arrangement to remit tax in excess of $50,000 without approval from the Minister of Finance. As this approval may take longer than 10 days, we suggest that we be given as much prior notice as possible of the intention to make such an application. 4.8There may be some cases where we will not be able to make our decision in the time indicated here. However, they should be rare. We will make every effort to review the application within this time frame. Where the likelihood of a delay is possible, we will endeavour to give the taxpayer prior warning of that fact. 4.9 Declaration We require the taxpayer (or the applicant on the taxpay- erís behalf) to sign a declaration that will accompany the section 177 application. That declaration is to the effect that the information contained in the application is, to the best of the taxpayerís knowledge, correct and not misleading whether by failure to disclose informa- tion or otherwise. Section 177(3) provides that we can cancel any relief granted where the information pro- vided by the taxpayer in the application was misleading. Although there is no statutory requirement for such a declaration, we consider that it is an indication of good faith on the taxpayerís behalf. If neither the applicant nor the taxpayer is prepared to sign the declaration, we will not be able to take the information supplied at face value. It will certainly affect our assessment of the likelihood of success in the proposed debt restructuring. The taxpayer may either sign the declaration in the IR 40E (which may be used as, or can accompany the application) or incorporate the declaration as part of the application. The specific requirements for the declara- tion are set out in Addendum B. 5. Crystallising the income tax liability - section 177(2) 5.1Section 177(2) allows us to ìcrystalliseî a taxpayerís income tax and FBT liabilities for any relevant period. The section provides that: The Commissioner may, if the Commissioner thinks fit, at any time after receipt of the application referred to in subsection (1), require any taxpayer to whom this section applies to make a return of income derived from any specified transaction or transactions, or during any specified period, and may assess the taxpayer for income tax on the income so returned and shall give notice of the assessment to the person so assessed, and subsections (3) to (6) of section 44 shall apply to such an assessment as if it were an assessment made in accordance with subsection (2) of that section. 5.2Section 177(2) enables us to determine the taxpayerís current tax position. This allows us to include all current liabilities in the relief arrangement. However, it may not always be either appropriate or necessary that we require a part-year return. Filing a part-year return is not a requirement of an application. Whether we require one will be determined on a case by case basis. 5.3Generally, we will seek to ensure that all the taxpayerís tax returns are filed up to date and that the taxpayer provides: ï A return for the income year in which the arrange- ment takes place, for the period from the beginning of the income year and ending near the time at which the arrangement takes place (we will negotiate an appropriate accounting period with the taxpayer); and/or ï A list of all debt remissions proposed under the arrangement in future income years (including those proposed by other creditors). 5.4Section 177(2) allows us to deal with any tax that might result from a debt forgiveness arrangement. Where a creditor forgives a debt owed by the taxpayer, the amount of the debt forgiven constitutes income in the taxpayerís hands. The taxpayer is assessable on that income. Section 177 allows us to ensure that the income tax arising from this debt forgiveness is remitted as part of the relief arrangements. We will not take advantage of other creditorsí remittances by pursuing extra tax. 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.14 (June 1995) - Appendix 5.5If the taxpayerís business is seasonal, a part-year return up to the date of the debt restructuring arrange- ment might not give a true reflection of the personís income-earning process. It may, for example, represent a disproportionate part of the annual income flow or expenditures. In such a case we may seek a return for the transactions that relate specifically to the debt restructuring arrangement. This will focus on any forgiveness of debt, expenditure or income relating to the debt restructuring arrangements. Other income or expenditure will be dealt with in the end-of-year return and assessment - see paragraph 5.8. 5.6 Fringe benefit tax Section 177(2) enables us to issue an assessment for FBT on fringe benefits provided right up to the date of application. If we remit an amount of FBT and origi- nally the taxpayer took a tax deduction for that FBT, the amount must be added back to the income of the year of the deduction. No deduction for FBT was available until 1 April 1989. After 1 April 1989 the deduction should have been taken in the year the fringe benefit was paid. This ìadd backî may impact on the taxpayerís income tax liability. If it does it should be taken into account in formulating the proposal put to us. 5.7 Notice of assessment and objection rights Where we require a return to be filed, we will provide the taxpayer with an assessment. Unlike our decisions to grant or remit relief under sections 177(1) and (3), normal objection rights apply to such an assessment. We discuss objection rights later in paragraph 9. 5.8 Later end of year return At the end of the income year in which any debt restruc- turing arrangement occurs, the taxpayer must file an income tax return for the whole income year in the normal way. This is the case even where a part-year return was required. The end-of-year return must include all income derived and expenditure incurred in the income year in question. That will include any income or expenditure included in the part-year assess- ment for the period up to the date on which the debt reconstruction arrangement took place. While the final assessment for the income year includes such income and expenditure, a tax credit will be given for tax already paid or remitted under the relief arrangement. This ensures that income tax is not paid twice on the same income. Example In the 1993 income year P Ltd underwent a debt restructuring. That restructuring arrangement came into effect on 1 June 1992. Because of the circum- stances of P Ltdís case, the Commissioner required P Ltd to file a return for the period 1 April 1992 to and including 31 May 1992. An assessment was issued for that period. In that period P Ltd derived assessable income of $3,000, thereby resulting in an income tax liability of $1,000. Under the restructuring arrangement, the Commissioner has agreed to remit the $1,000 income tax arising in the period. Assessable income$3,000 Income tax1,000 Less amount remitted1,000 Income tax ìpayableînil At the end of the 1993 income year (31 March), P Ltd is required to file a return that covers the whole income year. In the 1993 income year P Ltd derived assessable income of $12,000 (including the $3,000 in the period to the end of May). An income tax liability arises on that income of $4,000. However, the Commissioner has already remitted $1,000 of that liability, which is treated as if it was a tax credit for an amount paid: Assessable income$12,000 Income tax4,000 Less amount remitted††††1,000 Income tax ìpayableî$ 3,000 6. The relief: remitting tax or deferring payment 6.1We can grant relief by remitting all or part of the income tax or FBT owing, or by agreeing to an instal- ment arrangement, or both. We will advise the taxpayer in writing of the relief granted. The notice will explain the relief granted for each payment of tax for which the taxpayer is liable or likely to be liable (that is, income tax arising from future debt remissions by creditors pursuant to the restructuring arrangements). We will only deal with the proposals in the application for relief. The application must specify the relief sought. Only the relief specified in the letter is granted. The taxpayer is still liable for any outstanding liabilities which are not specified in the relief notice. 6.2If we agree to an instalment payment arrange- ment under section 177, we will seek the shortest possible deferral. We will remit any penal tax and ìuse of moneyî interest that arise on the tax that is subject to the instalment arrangement, if the taxpayer pays the instalments on time. 6.3 Tax arising from the remission of other debts 6.3.1If a taxpayer proposes a debt restructuring that will result in creditors forgiving their debts, income tax may arise on the amounts forgiven. This can happen in two different types of situation. 6.3.1.1First, if the taxpayer took a deduction for the debt when it originally incurred and the creditor later forgives the debt, the amount is added back to the income in the year the deduction was taken. 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.14 (June 1995) - Appendix 6.3.1.2Secondly, if the debt is a financial arrange- ment, the situation can be a little more complicated. Generally though, if a lender later forgives the debt the debtor must include the amount forgiven as income for income tax purposes in the year in which it is forgiven. However, if a material part of the debt remains out- standing, and either the amount forgiven is not mate- rial, or the taxpayer is a ìcash basis holderî, the amount forgiven is included in income for income tax purposes when the debt is finally disposed of. The local Inland Revenue office or a tax adviser can advise whether the taxpayer is a ìcash basis holderî. 6.3.2If the taxpayer had to pay income tax on the debt forgiven, the whole purpose of section 177 might be defeated. The other creditors may take the view that they have given up some of their rights, only for the Crown to get a tax benefit as a result. We will use section 177 to remit such tax. This prevents the taxpay- erís reconstruction from being hindered by these further taxes. 6.3.3If the taxpayer and the other creditors are acting in good faith and they are dealing at armís length, we will remit any income tax arising from the debt forgive- ness under the restructuring arrangements. If a creditor is associated with the taxpayer (a relative, by a trust arrangement, or through control of ownership (for companies)), we will accept that they are dealing at armís length if we can see that they will not gain any advantage over other creditors from the arrangement. We will presume that the parties are dealing at armís length unless evidence to the contrary exists. 6.3.4There are occasions when our conditional approval of a proposed restructuring scheme may be useful in dealing with other creditors. Where such a situation arises, we will provide such a conditional approval of the scheme. We stress, however, that our approval of the final arrangements is required before section 177 relief is granted. 6.3.5Where the debt forgiveness is conditional on the taxpayer fulfilling certain obligations to the creditors under the restructuring arrangement, we cannot know at the time of application whether there will ever be an actual tax liability. We explained at paragraph 2.8.3 how we will be cautious in dealing with contingencies. 6.3.6If we agree to remit any income tax arising from a debt forgiveness arrangement (that is, where other creditors agree to remit moneys owed to them as part of this arrangement), we will give the taxpayer a letter stating: ï That the creditorís debt remission will constitute assessable income; and ï That the income tax will be remitted; and ï That if the taxpayer suffers an income tax liability for the income year in which the debt is remitted by the creditor, the amount of the liability will be reduced by the amount of the income tax attributable to the debt forgiveness. The letter will identify the debt in question and the arrangements under which it will be forgiven. 6.3.7Keep the letter. Attach a copy to the income tax return for the relevant period. We will attribute the tax to the debt forgiveness on the basis that gives the greatest possible reduction in the taxpayerís tax liabili- ties. 6.3.8Section 177 does not, however, allow us to reduce assessable income by the amount of the debt forgiveness that is included in assessable income. Any carry forward losses available in the ordinary course will be applied against assessable income before the income tax liability is calculated. Losses available from other taxpayers will not be taken into account in calculating the assessable income. 7. Our aims: the Commissioner’s discretion and how we will use it 7.1 The discretion 7.1.1Subsection 177(1) provides that: ... the Commissioner may, if the Commissioner considers it necessary or desirable to do so in order to maximise the net present value...., grant relief ... 7.1.2This indicates that the provision provides a very wide discretionary power. We are obliged to exercise this power fairly and in good faith. We must give fair and reasonable consideration to any application for relief under section 177. 7.2 Internal procedures and the taxpayer’s opportunity to comment 7.2.1Any decision on an application for relief of less than $50,000 under section 177 will be made in the taxpayerís local Inland Revenue office. Where the relief sought exceeds $50,000, we have to get approval from the Minister of Finance to grant the relief. The applica- tions in both cases should be sent to the Debt and Return Management Section of the taxpayerís local Inland Revenue office. 7.2.2Irrespective of the amount of relief sought, where we decline an application we will provide the taxpayer with the reasons for the rejection. Taxpayers are free to discuss the decision with us and to renegotiate the proposed arrangements. 7.3 How the Commissioner will exercise the discretion 7.3.1We will be trying to get the best recovery for the Crown, so: ï We will want to have the least possible deferral; and ï We will want the least possible remission. We do not have a preference for deferred payment over remission (either partial or complete) or vice versa. We will look at each proposal as a whole. 7.3.2Legally we do not have an obligation to consider the likely prospects for payment to any other person who may be a party to the proposed agreement. We are simply responsible to the Crown for dealing with the outstanding income tax and FBT debts. However, we 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.14 (June 1995) - Appendix will always negotiate in good faith. We will not inten- tionally enter into arrangements that disadvantage other creditors. We will always want to know that: ï Any creditor who might be disadvantaged by the proposed arrangement; and ï Any creditor who might reasonably be expected to affect the success of the proposed arrangement, agrees to any arrangement that the taxpayer makes with us. This agreement will protect both us (that is, our arrangement with the taxpayer) and the taxpayer (by preventing the creditors petitioning for the taxpayer to be bankrupted or wound up). 7.3.3If a taxpayer has other tax or duty debts with a higher priority than income tax or FBT (such as PAYE or GST which are moneys held on trust for the Crown), we may insist that these are paid. This will not affect our consideration of the application for relief under section 177(1). 7.4 Priorities Where we agree to remit an amount of tax that is outstanding, we will remit that tax owing in the follow- ing order: First:FBT on which late payment penalties are accruing. Second:Any other FBT liabilities. Third:Income tax upon which late payment penalties are accruing. Fourth:Any other income tax liabilities. We will remit outstanding FBT liabilities first because the remission of FBT results in the derivation of assess- able income in the income year to which the FBT related. This may affect the taxpayerís income tax liability. As a result, consideration has to be given to remitting a greater income tax liability. Example T Ltd is a small printing firm that is in ìfinancial difficultiesî. For the income year ended 31 March 1993, it derived assessable income of $60,000, having an income tax liability of $19,800. For the FBT quarter ending 31 December 1992, T Ltd has a FBT liability of $1,000 for which it took an ex- penditure deduction in the 1993 income year. The Commissioner grants section 177 relief, and calculates the remittance as follows: Step 1:Remit the FBT for the quarter ended 31/3/94. Step 2: Recalculate T Ltdís assessable income for the 1993 income year (the FBT was paid in the 1993 income year) assessable income$60,000 plus FBT remitted ††††1,000 reassessed 1993 assessable income $61,000 Step 3: Remit 1993 income tax liability of $20,130 (61,000 x 0.33) 7.5 Tax Losses 7.5.1Section 177 only allows us to remit or defer a taxpayerís income tax or FBT liability. It does not allow us to reduce the personís assessable income by the amount of any debt forgiveness that is included in that assessable income. Any available losses carried forward will be applied against the assessable income in deter- mining the income tax liability. Section 177 does not require the taxpayer to surrender tax losses. If there are sufficient tax losses available to be carried forward following the assessment process, that will not affect whether we will grant relief or the extent to which we will grant it. The exception to this rule is that if the losses carried forward affect the taxpayerís potential cashflows or are a potential source of cash, we will take that into account. 7.5.2Complications arise if the taxpayer seeking relief is a company (or other body corporate) that: ï is a member of a group of companies for tax purposes; or ï could become a member of a group of companies for tax purposes without losing losses carried forward, and the other members of the group or potential group have profits that may be offset against the losses or anticipate such profits in the current income year. In these cases we will not grant relief until the losses have been extinguished and the company has received reasonable compensation for the tax relief that is lost by the company and gained by other group members as a result. Tax losses can be valuable and, as a creditor, we want to share in that value. We would expect that those tax losses would have a value to the parties of some- where between 16.5 and 33 cents in the dollar. 8. Can we cancel the relief? 8.1Section 177(3) allows us to cancel all or part of the relief granted under section 177(1). We expect that we will only use this power if the taxpayer (or a person acting on their behalf) has intentionally mislead us. 8.1.1Section 177(3) reads: Where - (a) The Commissioner has reason to believe that the informa- tion provided by the taxpayer to the Commissioner for the purposes of application of this section is misleading in any respect to an extent which, in the opinion of the Commis- sioner, renders it inappropriate for the Commissioner to have granted the whole or part of any relief granted under this section; or (b) The Commissioner receives further information relating to the taxpayerís affairs at the date relief was granted which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, renders it inappropri- ate for the Commissioner to have granted the whole or part of any relief granted under this section,- the Commissioner may, in relation to any amount of income tax or fringe benefit tax, cancel the whole or any part of any relief granted in accordance with subsection (1) (and this Act and the Income Tax Act 1994) shall apply as if such relief had never been granted. 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.14 (June 1995) - Appendix 8.2 When we can cancel relief 8.2.1Before we cancel any relief given under section 177(1), either of the tests in section 177(3)(a) or section 177(3)(b) must be satisfied. If either is met, the extent to which the relief is varied or cancelled is entirely at the Commissionerís discretion. 8.2.2Section 177(3)(a) deals with cases where the taxpayer has misled us. We must have reason to believe that the taxpayer has supplied us with information for the purposes of section 177 that is misleading. In cancelling or varying the extent of the relief, we must be of the opinion that it is inappropriate for the relief that was granted to have been granted. When considering whether we should cancel or vary the relief granted, we will give the taxpayer the opportunity to comment. The exception to this rule is where the delay would place the expected recovery unreasonably at risk, or where we cannot locate the taxpayer after reasonable enquiries. 8.2.3A taxpayer may mislead us unintentionally. For example, there may be an inadvertent error in the calculations. Section 177(3)(a) requires only that we are misled. There is no requirement that the taxpayer intended to do so. However, we will generally not cancel or vary the relief granted where we are mislead by an innocent error and the error does not result in a signifi- cant misstatement of the taxpayerís financial situation. 8.3 When we will cancel relief 8.3.1We acknowledge that debt restructuring for persons in financial difficulties is an unpredictable science. There are few certainties involved, as the risks of business for such people are increased by their financial position. Slight variances in amounts distrib- uted may therefore occur. We accept that such variances would not render it inappropriate for us to have granted relief. 8.3.2If we are considering applying section 177(3)(a), we will have entered into an arrangement with the taxpayer under section 177. We will expect to receive payments with a calculated net present value. Generally, we will not apply section 177(3) if the difference between the net present value of the recovery, given the new information, and the amount we expect to receive under the arrangement we have entered into is less than: ï $10,000; or ï 10% of the amount that we expect to receive under the arrangement, whichever is greater in the particular case. 8.3.3However, this is only a guideline. Ultimately the decision will depend on the circumstances of the particular case. 8.4 What happens if the relief is cancelled 8.4.1If the relief granted under section 177(1) is cancelled, it will be as if it were never granted in the first place. The original payment dates and penalties for late payment will apply. Example On 30 September 1991 X Ltd owed the Commis- sioner $100,000 in terminal tax due on 7 November 1991. There were no other tax liabilities. On 30†September 1991 the Commissioner agreed to remit $70,000 and accept the following payments for the remainder: 7 November 1991$10,000 7 February 1992$10,000 May 1992$10,000 plus accrued additional tax for late payment of the $20,000 that was not remitted and was not paid by 7 November 1991. On 15 January 1992 the Commissioner cancelled the remission and the arrangement for payment in instalments. We cancelled the relief after we found that the taxpayer had failed to disclose the proceeds from the sale of its interests in an offshore com- pany. The proceeds had been held offshore. The $90,000 unpaid of the $100,000 originally due on 7 November 1991 and deferred under the arrangement is once again due on 7 November 1991, along with accumulated additional tax and late payment penalties. 8.4.2Where we cancel the relief, we will attempt to maximise the net present value of any recovery or likely recovery. However, in doing so we will endeavour not to damage the interests of other creditors who are party to the restructuring arrangements. In turn we expect those creditors to act in good faith and not to jeopardise our interests as a creditor. 8.4.3Where a taxpayer has acted in bad faith, we will have no reason to believe that the person will deal with us in good faith in the future. Depending on the circum- stances of the case, we may decide to initiate bankruptcy proceedings or apply to the Court to have a company put into liquidation. Alternatively, we may simply seek to examine the taxpayerís tax affairs more closely in future, or enter into a practically enforceable agreement that will ensure future compliance. 8.5 What if things don’t work out? 8.5.1If a taxpayer acts in good faith and the restruc- turing fails we will not, and cannot, cancel the relief we have granted. That is the risk we take when we accept a proposal. There is only one exception to this: where the taxpayer has unintentionally mislead us, even if acting in good faith, section 177(3)(a) may allow the Commis- sioner to cancel or vary the relief (but see paragraph 8.2.3 above). 8.5.2If the restructuring fails, other creditors may seek payment of their debts in full. We will, however, only pursue the amount due under the arrangement. Also, we will not pursue any penalties that were remitted under the arrangements. 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.14 (June 1995) - Appendix 9. Objection rights 9.1Where the Act provides objection rights those avenues must be used. However, the objection rights for section 177 are very limited: ï Section 125(j)(iv) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that there is no right of objection to any provision in section 177 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that is left to the discretion, judgment, opinion, approval, consent, or determination of the Commissioner. ï Section 125(b) provides that there is no right of objection to any decision of the Minister of Finance under the Act (including in relation to relief granted in excess of $50,000 under section 177). ï Section 177(4) provides that there is no right of objection to any decision of the Commissioner to grant relief under section 177(1) or to cancel relief under section 177(3). 9.2The only objection right in relation to section 177 relief is the right to object to an assessment issued under section 177(2) (see paragraph 5.6). 9.3Although there are no rights of objection under section 177(1) and (3), where the taxpayer considers that we may have been unfair in our decision, we will discuss the case with the taxpayer and consider renego- tiating the proposed arrangements. 10. Examples of applying section 177 We have included some examples, in Addendum E, of how section 177 would apply in the specific fact situa- tions that are outlined. 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.14 (June 1995) - Appendix Addendum A The Law: Section 177, Tax Administration Act 1994 Discretion to grant relief from income tax or fringe benefit tax in cases of financial hardship (1) Subject to this section, on application for relief made in writing by or on behalf of any taxpayer who- (a) Is, or is likely to become, liable for payment of - (i) Any amount of income tax levied under section BB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 in respect of the income derived by that taxpayer (whether that income is income derived or deemed to be derived under the qualified accruals rules or otherwise); or (ii) Any amount of fringe benefit tax; and (b) Is at the time of the application in financial difficulties,- the Commissioner may, if the Commissioner considers it necessary or desirable to do so in order to maximise the net present value (calcu- lated as at the date of application) of any recov- ery or likely recovery from the taxpayer of that amount of income tax or fringe benefit tax, or any part of the income tax or fringe benefit tax, grant relief to the taxpayer by either or both of - (c) The remission of the whole or part of that amount of income tax or fringe benefit tax; or (d) Entering into an arrangement with the taxpayer for the payment of the whole or part of that amount of income tax or fringe benefit tax in 2 or more instalments. (2) The Commissioner may, if the Commissioner thinks fit, at any time after receipt of the application referred to in subsection (1), require any taxpayer to whom this section applies to make a return of income derived from any specified transaction or transactions, or during any specified period, and may assess the taxpayer for income tax on the income so returned and shall give notice of the assessment to the person so assessed, and subsec- tions (3) to (6) of section 44 shall apply to such an assessment as if it were an assessment made in accordance with subsection (2) of that section. (3) Where - (a) The Commissioner has reason to believe that the information provided by the taxpayer to the Commissioner for the purposes of application of this section is misleading in any respect to an extent which, in the opinion of the Commis- sioner, renders it inappropriate for the Commis- sioner to have granted the whole or part of any relief granted under this section; or (b) The Commissioner receives further information relating to the taxpayerís affairs at the date relief was granted which, in the opinion of the Com- missioner, renders it inappropriate for the Commissioner to have granted the whole or part of any relief granted under this section,- the Commissioner may, in relation to any amount of income tax or fringe benefit tax, cancel the whole or any part of any relief granted in accordance with subsection (1) and this Act and the Income Tax Act 1994 shall apply as if such relief had never been granted. (4) There shall be no right of objection to any decision of the Commissioner - (a) To grant relief in accordance with subsection (1); or (b) To cancel relief in accordance with subsection†(3). (5) No amount of income tax or fringe benefit tax in excess of $50,000 in any case shall be remitted or be subjected to an arrangement for payment by instal- ments under this section except with the approval of the Minister, given either specifically with respect to that case, or generally with respect to any class or classes of cases. 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.14 (June 1995) - Appendix Addendum B Information required in an application for relief under section 177, Tax Administration Act 1994 B.1You can use form IR 40E to make your applica- tion.

Declaration B.20We require the taxpayer (or an applicant making application on the taxpayerís behalf) to sign the declara- tion contained in IR 40E. That declaration is to the effect that the information contained in the application is, to the best of the taxpayerís knowledge, correct and not misleading whether by failure to disclose informa- tion or otherwise. The declaration is required in the following form: i. Where the taxpayer is making application on his or her own behalf (that is, an individual, a self- employed person, or a trustee): I have read all the information contained in and referred to in this application. To the best of my knowledge and understand- ing I declare that I am satisfied that: a. The information provided represents a true and complete statement of my current financial and taxation positions; b. The application contains a realistic and reasonable assessment of my future prospects; c. The assumptions upon which those future prospects are based are well founded and able to be substantiated; and d. No material information has been knowingly omitted from the application. ii. Where the taxpayer is a body corporate such as a company or incorporated society: We the directors \[or other persons who control the taxpayerís financial affairs\] are duly authorised to act for \[the name of the body corporate\]. We have read all the information contained in and referred to in this application. To the best of our knowledge and understanding we declare that we are satisfied that: a. The information provided represents a true and complete statement of \[name of the body corporate\] current financial and taxation positions; b. The application contains a realistic and reasonable assessment of \[name of the body corporate\] future prospects; c. The assumptions upon which those future prospects are based are well founded and able to be substantiated; and d. No material information has been knowingly omitted from the application. In the case of a body corporate, all the bodyís officers (e.g. company directors) should sign the declaration. If an officer declines to sign the declaration, the taxpayer can still lodge the application. However, we would expect to be informed if an officer refuses to sign the declaration. We would also expect that an explanation of the reasons for the refusal would accompany the declaration. We may wish to discuss it with the officer concerned. 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.14 (June 1995) - Appendix Addendum C Calculating the net present value C.1In calculating the net present value (ìNPVî), we allow for the time value of money interest. We also allow for the probability of payment: risk. We use a simple method to reduce the likelihood of misunder- standing. This calculation involves: ï The amount of the payment, multiplied by ï The probability of payment (for risk), divided by ï The discount factor appropriate to the term (for interest). Example Expanding Example 3 in Addendum D (the one involving the calculation of the Government Stock rate) - at 1 May 1992 the applicant proposes two payments: one of $38,000 on 30 September 1992 and one of $135,000 on 31 January 1994. The first payment will be made from a business cash surplus. The second will be made from the sale of a property to a person who is considered by the applicant and the creditors (including us) to be financially sound and reliable. 1. Take the two discount rates: (for 30 September 1992 and for 31 January 1994) in Addendum D, i.e., the rate for 30 September 1992 is 1.029 and the rate for 31 January 1994 is 1.131. 2. Find the probability of each payment being made. The first payment is being made in 5 months, somewhat less than the year referred to in the 60 % probability example at paragraph 3.8 of the policy statement. It will be financed from a cash surplus in the business. The applicant gives this a probability of 75%, starting with 60% for a payment up to a year out and adding 15%: ï Because the proposed payment is only 5†months out; and ï Because of the nature of the applicantís business there is a greater degree of certainty that the payment will be made. The second payment is to be funded by a sale of property that can reasonably be expected to proceed because there is a long-term agreement for sale. However, settlement is a year and 9 months away. This could have a probability of 90%, starting at 90% and recognising: ï That the sale has already been arranged (which increases the probability of payment); and ï That it will not be settled for some time (which is a source of increased uncertainty). 3. Now calculate the NPVs: AmountxProbability/Discount =NPV 1. $38,000x75%/1.029= ††$27,696.79 2. $135,000x90%/1.131= $107,427.06 3. To work out the NPV of the proposal, add the two NPVs together: 1.$††27,696.79 2. plus$107,427.06 Total $135,123.85 Note The method we have chosen to use as a general rule for calculating net present values is a simplified technique. There are methods that adjust for the probability of receiving a payment in setting the discount rate. The discount rate is then described as a ìrisk-adjustedî discount rate. These methods require a little more information, in particular some reliable means of estimating the risk adjustment. We are happy to use such methods of calculating net present value in any particular case if the information required to do so is available. 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.14 (June 1995) - Appendix Addendum D Calculating the discount rate D.1Taxpayers (or applicants on their behalf) are not obliged to calculate either the discount rate or the net present value of their proposal in submitting their application. However, they may do so if they wish - it may be helpful for the taxpayer to evaluate the likeli- hood of the proposal being accepted. We will use the following relatively simple method of calculating the discount rate. Requirements for the calculation D2.ï The time (in years and days) between the date of application and the date of the payment; and ï The market yield for Government stock with the same term; and ï A calculator capable of performing exponential calculations (it will have an ìxyî key or ìyxî or something similar. If you havenít got one, ring our Debt and Return Management staff with the necessary information and they will do the calculation for you). In order to perform this calculation it is necessary to first calculate the Government Stock Rate. This is discussed at D5 and D6. The basic calculation D.3The steps in calculating the discount rate are: Step 1: Add 100 to the Government stock rate Step 2: Divide the result by 100 Step 3: Calculate the term in years and fractions of years (using decimals) Step 4: Raise the result in step 2 to the power of the result in step 3 (easier with a calculator). D4.Example 1 The term is 1 year and 63 days and the Government stock rate is 7.25%. Step 1: Add 100 to the Government stock rate 7.25 + 100 = 107.25 Step 2: Divide the result by 100 107.25 / 100 = 1.0725 Step 3: Calculate the term in years and fractions of years (using decimals) The term is 1 year and 63 days. 63 days divided into 365 days is 0.173 (0.172602739726 rounded to 3 decimal places) The term is 1.173 years. Step 4: Raise the result in step 2 to the power of the result in step 3 1.0725 1.173 = 1.086 (Rounded to 3 decimal places - the actual result on our calculator was 1.085566550301). Example 2 If: (i) the Government Stock rate is 5.3% (then the rate per step 2 is 1.053); and (ii) if the term is 2 years, 61 days (then the term per step 3 is 2.167) the discount rate is calculated as follows: 1.053 2.167 (that is 1.053 to the power of 2.167) which equals 1.11843131902 or 1.118 The Government stock rate D.5The relevant rates can be obtained from a bank or from the business pages of a newspaper or from us. The ìbidî rates should be used. D.6Often there is no rate for the exact term. In these cases interpolate or extrapolate the rate by: Rule 1: Taking the rate for the shortest term if all the terms are longer than the one required; or Rule 2: Taking a weighted average of the rates for the terms each side of the required term; or Rule 3: Taking the rate for the longest term if all the terms are shorter than the one required. Example 3 On 1 May 1992 the taxpayer proposed offering the Commissioner an arrangement with two payments: one on 30 September 1992 and one on 31 January 1994. A discount rate for each payment date is needed. Newspapers for 1 May 1992 had no rates for either of those days, but had rates for: ìNov. 1993 7.18 (7.24) Feb. 1995 7.58 (7.64) Nov. 1995 7.80 (7.85) Nov. 1996 8.27 (8.31) Jul. 1997 8.37 (8.42) Mar 2002 9.90 (8.92)î The rate in brackets is the previous dayís rate. The Government stock redemption dates are always the 15th of the month. The ìNov. 93î rate was therefore the rate of the Government stock maturing 15 November 1993; the ìFeb. 95î rate is for the stock maturing 15 February 1995; and so on. All the terms are longer than 30 September 1992 so using rule 1, the shortest, (ìNov. 93î) rate (the rate of the Government stock rate maturing 15 Novem- ber 1993), gives 7.18%. That is a discount factor of 1.0718 for a whole year. 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.14 (June 1995) - Appendix However, the period is only 152 days (1 May 1992 to 30†September 1992), or 0.416 years. The dis- count rate is therefore 1.0718 0.416 , or 1.029 (rounded to 3†decimal places). 31 January 1994 is between 15 November 1993 and 15†February 1995. Interpolate between the rates for those two days. There are 77 days between 15 November 1993 and 31†January 1994. This is the weighting for the rate for 15 February 1995. There are 380 days between 31 January 1994 and 15†February 1995. That is the weighting for the rate for 15 November 1993. The number of days for the first date is the weight- ing for the second, and vice versa. There are 457 days in total. This is the divisor. The calculation is: (380 x 7.18) + (77 x 7.58) =7.25 457 The answer is 7.24739607127, rounded to 2 decimal places: 7.25%. That is a discount rate of 1.0725 for a year. However, the period is 1 year and 275 days (from 1†May 1992 to 31 January 1994), or 1.753 years. The discount factor is therefore 1.0725 1.753 , or 1.131 (rounded to 3 decimal places). 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.14 (June 1995) - Appendix Addendum E Some examples 1. We seek the best possible deal G is a lawyer and has the following assets and liabilities: Statement of assets and liabilities † AssetsTime for saleLiabilities Kiwifruit farm6 months$1,000,000 Mortgage over farm\*$1,900,000 Plant for farm6 months135,000 Mortgage over residence\*150,000 Fruit in store1 month183,000 Chattels security for hire purchase on car á 18,000 Cash in bankimmediate23,000 Overdraft secured over residence, Private carimmediate32,000 farm and cash in bank\*15,000 Residence6 months250,000 Unsecured debts1,122,000 Personal effects1 month15,000 Wages5,000 ††††††††††††††††††Income tax†††††††43,000 Total assets$1,638,000 Total liabilities$3,253,000 \* To bank á To dealer Ü Assets and liabilities are valued on the basis of an orderly sale commencing at the earliest reasonable time and taking into account holding costs (other than interest on borrowings) and costs of sale. The estimated time for sale is set alongside each asset. The income tax is overdue. G has $43,000 in tax losses available to carry forward. The estimated annual income from the kiwifruit farm before depreciation, interest and taxes is $300,000. Depreciation and interest total $450,000. If G is bankrupted he will be unable to practise as a lawyer. He could get a job at a lower salary, about $60,000 per annum. Gís income and living expenses are: Income and living costs IncomeLiving costs Salary$93,000 Residential mortgage$20,000 Kiwifruit farm(150,000) Hire purchase on car11,000 Food, power, insurance, etc.15,000 ††††††††††††††School fees††14,000 Total income$(57,000) Total living costs$60,000 G proposes the following arrangement to his creditors: Realisation of assets and use of funds ExpectedOther AssetWhenproceedsTo bankTo dealercreditors Cash in bankNow$23,000$15,000$8,000 CarNow32,000$18,00014,000 Fruit in store1 month183,000183,000 Plant6 months135,00090,00045,000 Farm6 months1,000,0001,000,000 Residence6 months250,000250,000 Personal effects1 month †††††††15,000†††††††15,000†††††††††††††††††††††††††††† Total$1,638,000$1,370,000$18,000$250,000 Employeesí wages will be paid in full from the cash in bank. This will leave G owing the bank $695,000 and other creditors $920,000. 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.14 (June 1995) - Appendix In addition G proposes to pay the following amounts for unsecured debts from his salary: This year$46,000 Next year$21,000 Year 3$18,000 The applicantís calculations for the amount were: For the first year After tax income, after taking into account: Tax losses, approx$93,000 Rent$18,200 School fees$14,000 Living Costs$14,800 $47,000 $46,000 For the second year After tax income, taking into account: Tax losses, approx$93,000 Rent$18,200 School fees$14,000 Living Costs$16,000 $48,200 $44,800 For the third year After tax income, taking into account: Tax losses, approx$67,400 Rent$18,200 School fees$14,000 Living Costs$17,200 $49,400 $18,000 The amounts he is offering are the remainder of his salary after living costs, rent of $350 per week and school fees. The higher amounts are available in the first and second years because tax losses carried forward will result in higher incomes after tax in those years. In exchange he asks: ï The bank to cease charging interest immediately. ï All creditors to forgive the balance owing once he has made the last of the proposed payments. ï Inland Revenue to forgive any tax that may arise when the debts are eventually forgiven. We expect that if we pressed G to bankruptcy: ï We would receive a smaller share from the disposal of his assets, at much the same time. ï He would be released from bankruptcy after about three years, having made the following payments for unsecured debts: First year$27,000 Second year$25,800 Third year$10,000 These amounts are the remainder of his likely salary in the new job after living costs and rent of $350 per week. Again, the higher amounts are available in the first and second years because the tax losses carried forward will result in higher incomes after tax in those years. The amounts available will be calculated in the same way as the calculations opposite, but the income is $60,000 and the school fees are excluded. ï G would pay no tax on the cancellation of his debts when he is released from bankruptcy. It is clear that every payment offered under the arrange- ment is greater than the payment that would be avail- able at the same time if we pressed G to bankruptcy. We donít have to do the calculations to see that the net present value of Gís offer is higher than what we would get if we pressed him to bankruptcy. G is offering more in every year. The difference is in the likely payments from his salary. He is offering more because he expects to be able to continue in practice. The advantages G will secure from his proposal are that he will retain his present position and his qualification to practise law and he could continue to meet his childrenís school fees. Although the net present value of Gís proposal is higher than the net present value of pressing him to bank- ruptcy, we would not accept it. Clearly G could further reduce his living costs by reducing the amounts spent on education and rent. We would agree if the proposed payments from his salary were increased by about $14,000 a year. 2. We will negotiate in good faith with all involved and we will press for compensation for the use of tax losses X Ltd is a manufacturing company with: Total assets$10 million Total liabilities$50 million Tax losses brought forward $8 million All assets are unencumbered and can be realised almost immediately. The total liabilities include $85,000 in overdue PAYE, $560,000 in overdue GST and $12,000 in overdue FBT. There is no income tax liability. X Ltd is a 100% owned subsidiary of K Ltd, which has taxable profits in excess of $8 million. The directors of X Ltd proposed that X Ltd pay 20 cents in the dollar to all creditors, and ask that creditors forgive the balance owing, $40 million in total. They offer separately to Inland Revenue that the company will pay all that is owing to Inland Revenue and ask that Inland Revenue agree to remit any tax that may arise when the other creditors forgive their debts. 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.14 (June 1995) - Appendix We could press X Ltd and K Ltd to come to an arrange- ment whereby K Ltd will use X Ltdís losses and will pay X Ltd a sum of money in compensation. With the current tax rate of 33% we would expect that K Ltd would pay X Ltd something between 16.5 and 33 cents in the dollar. At the very least we would expect to recover: ï All of the PAYE (from the company or from the person responsible for the companyís PAYE); plus ï $128,500 (about 22.47 cents in the dollar) for the balance of the debt. We would not accept the directorsí proposal as it appears that it will bar other creditors gaining the benefit of the recompense for K Ltdís use of the tax losses while advantaging Inland Revenue. We will not participate in any arrangement that might be contrary to the Companies Act or that will disadvantage other creditors without their knowledge of the arrangement. 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.14 (June 1995) - Appendix Policy Statement Section 177, Tax Administration Act 1994 Taxpayers in Financial Difficulties Issued as an appendix to Tax Information Bulletin Volume Six, No.14 June 1995 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.14 (June 1995) - Appendix Taxpayers in financial difficulties Section 177, Tax Administration Act 1994 1.

It also makes consequential amendments to several other Acts. See the inside front cover for a full list of this TIB’s contents. This TIB has no appendix.

It contains new core provisions which set out the key laws on which the rest of our income tax legislation is based. The core provisions: •provide an overview of the scheme and purposes of the Act •provide all the essential rules for taxpayers to calcu- late and satisfy their income tax liability •provide the basis for the application of other Parts. The new core provisions adopt a “global/gross” ap- proach to the calculation of an income tax liability. The core provisions have been drafted in plain lan- guage. The new drafting style for the core provisions minimises complexity, repetition and the use of redun- dant words. The structure of the core provisions is represented in diagrams in the Act. The legislation makes consequential amendments to all Parts of the Act to ensure that tax legislation conforms to the “global/gross” approach being implemented by the core provisions. This process has necessitated significant amendments to the Income Tax Act and other Inland Revenue Acts. Although the core provisions and consequential amend- ments are not intended to change policy, in a few areas it has been necessary to clarify policy. These are high- lighted in this TIB. Background In its final report, the Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital (the Valabh Commit- tee) noted the importance of a coherent scheme in tax legislation. The re-ordering and renumbering of the Income Tax Act 1976 and the subsequent enactment of the Income Tax Act 1994 was the first step in this process. The Working Party on the Reorganisation of the Income Tax Act 1976 recommended that the re- ordering be followed by a full rewrite of tax legislation in a number of phases over the next four to five years. The Government adopted this recommendation. The aim of the rewrite, as outlined in the December 1994 discussion document Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Objectives, process, guidelines, is to reduce the various costs (such as compliance, administrative and legal costs) incurred by taxpayers and society generally because of the way tax law is expressed. The new core provisions are the first step in the rewrite of the Act. Core Provisions: Rewriting the Income Tax Act, A discussion document, released in May 1995, outlined the Government’s objectives and proposals for the new core provisions. The Government received submissions and undertook further consultation before the introduction of the Taxation (Core Provisions) Bill, in December 1995. Further submissions were received at the Select Com- mittee stage. The new core provisions, which differ from the draft legislation in the discussion document and the commentary on the bill, are the result of an extensive consultation process. Key features The new core provisions are intended to give an over- view of the scheme and purposes of the Act. The core provisions also provide all the essential rules for taxpayers to calculate and satisfy their income tax liability. The core provisions provide the basis for the application of other Parts of the Income Tax Act. In particular, the role of each of the Parts in calculating and satisfying a taxpayer’s income tax liability is set out in the core provisions. The core provisions govern the application of the rest of the Act by referring readers to the later Parts of the Act dealing with particular steps in the calculation e.g., Part I for losses (see section BC 6 (4)). The global gross approach begins with the allocation of gross income and allowable deductions to income years under the relevant timing rules. The calculation of a taxpayer’s income tax liability then begins with the determination of “annual gross income”, being the total of all gross income for a particular year. The total amount of deductions for the year - “annual allowable deductions” - is then calculated. This is subtracted from annual gross income, resulting in a single net income or net loss figure. This approach is in contrast to the approach of under- taking separate calculations of net income or loss in respect of a number of sources of income. The new core provisions have been drafted in plain language. The plain language drafting style is intended to minimise complexity, repetition and the use of redundant words. Wherever possible, the legislation adopts words that are commonly used. The complexity of the subject matter means that the resulting legislation is not simple, but the complexity is reduced by the new drafting style. The new Part B includes charts, descriptive headings for subsections and, at the end of each section, a list of defined terms used in the section. These are aids to interpretation only and are not part of the operative text of the legislation. The interpretive sections in the new Part A make it clear that if there is a conflict between the new aids to interpretation and the substantive sections of the Act, the substantive section will apply. continued on page 2 HF 1 (2), relating to mutual associations, it has been necessary to clarify an ambiguity. The amendments confirm the Court of Appeal’s deci- sion in CIR v Inglis (1992) 14 NZTC 9,180: that a loss on disposition of personal property is in effect deduct- ible where, if a profit had been derived in the same circumstances, it would have been assessable. The savings provision inserted for the 1994 reordered Act has been retained in Part Y for sections that have not been amended subsequently. There are also new savings provisions in section 2 of the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act in relation to the use of the terms “gross income” and “exempt income” generally and, in particular, the replacement of the words “profits or gains” with “amounts” in section CD 3 relating to business income. Binding rulings issued before the application of the core provisions legislation may cease to apply if they were based on any provision amended or repealed by the legislation. A special process has been established for rulings affected by changes in the core provisions legislation only (as contained in section 3). The Com- missioner will: •reissue the ruling, if the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act has not substantially altered the way the tax law in the ruling applies; •at the taxpayer’s request only issue a new ruling if the ruling cannot be reissued along the same lines as the existing ruling due to the nature of the changes in the core provisions legislation (any substantial changes made to the tax law other than those noted in this TIB will be reported to the Government). Affected rulings will be reissued (or issued), free of charge, on the basis of the taxpayer’s original applica- tion. Application date The new core provisions and consequential amendments will apply to the 1997-98 and subsequent income years. from page 1 The new Part A contains a purpose provision, setting out the main purposes of the Act and a new interpreta- tion provision which emphasises the importance of the core provisions, purpose provisions and the structure of the Act in interpreting legislation. Part A also includes a provision stating in general terms to whom the Act applies which is not intended to alter the residence or source rules in the Act. Consequential amendments have been made to all other Parts of the Act and to other legislation to ensure that the body of tax legislation conforms to the global/gross approach being implemented by the new core provi- sions. Because these consequential amendments have been made to Parts that are yet to be rewritten, the drafting style of those Parts has been retained. Most of the consequential changes are terminological. The most frequent change is the replacement of the term “assessable income” with “gross income”, “net income” or “taxable income”. The term “assessable income” was used inconsistently throughout the pre-core provisions Act to encompass different levels of income. Sometimes it referred to gross income, other times to net income and occasionally to both in the same section (see for example, the former section BB 7). It is intended that the amendments will remove these inconsistencies. More substantial drafting changes have been made in the following areas: •Provisions which referred to “profit”, such as land transactions, personal property, forestry and minerals. These have generally been split into income, deduc- tions and timing components. The deductions and timing components have been made explicit through a new provision applying to “revenue account property” (section DJ 13) and a new matching provision (sec- tion EF 2); •Regimes containing net or schedular components, such as mineral mining and life insurance. In general the amendments are not intended to change policy. However, in some instances, as in section New Part A - Purpose and Application Section AA 1 - purposes of Act The new section AA 1 provides that the main purposes of the Income Tax Act 1994 are to: •impose tax on income •impose obligations in respect of tax •set out rules to be used to calculate the tax and to satisfy the obligations imposed. The new purpose provision distinguishes the Income Tax Act from other Revenue Acts. A purpose provision for the Income Tax Act as a whole was envisaged in the December 1994 discussion docu- ment 1 . The discussion document went on to say that: “Purpose provisions will be used where they assist taxpayers and other users of legislation to appreciate the general intention of the particular Part, Subpart or sections to which they relate. Purpose provisions can also assist in the resolution of unforeseen ambiguities.” This is consistent with the original recommendations of the Valabh Committee that led to a Subpart A being set aside, in each Part in the 1994 reordered Act, for the insertion of a purpose provision. New section AA 2 gives readers a preliminary indica- tion of the persons to whom the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 apply. Persons who are “resident in New Zealand or who (have) income from New Zealand” must satisfy the obligations 1. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Objectives, process, guidelines. New Part B - Core Provisions The structure of the core provisions is illustrated by the following diagram: continued on page 4 imposed by the Income Tax Act and the Tax Adminis- tration Act. The reference to “income” is to income in a non-technical sense rather than a defined term. This new provision is not intended to affect the application of the specific residence and source rules in the Act. Section AA 3 - Interpretation New section AA 3 introduces an interpretation provi- sion to the Income Tax Act. It requires the user to have regard not only to the words of a particular provision, but also to the purpose provisions, the core provisions and the way in which the Act has been organised. It is intended that each of these features of the re-ordered and rewritten Act be used to improve the reader’s ability to understand the meaning of a provision. Section AA 3 (2) makes it clear that diagrams and lists of defined terms at the end of sections are aids to interpretation only. They are designed to help readers follow the structure of a Part and its connection to other Parts of the Act. They are also designed to help readers identify the steps that must be taken to determine an income tax liability under the Income Tax Act 1994. If there is a conflict between these new aids and the sections of the Act, section AA 3 (2)(a) makes it clear that the aids to interpretation do not apply. If a defined term is inadvertently omitted from a list, and the term is defined for the purposes of the section (or the Act), the meaning conferred by the definition is still applicable, as the lists are an aid to interpretation only. Section AA 4 - Definitions New section AA 4 consolidates the provisions that were previously found in sections AA 2 and AA 3. Subsection (1) ensures that a reference to ‘this Act’ still includes a reference to the Tax Administration Act 1994, unless the context requires that it not be included. Subsection (2) refers the reader to Part O for definitions and for general provisions relating to the interpretation and construction of the Act. Old section AA 2 (2) provided that references to the definition of a particular word were references to the definition of that word as it appeared in section OB 1. Old section AA 4 provided that a reference, for exam- ple, to “paragraph (f)” was a reference to the paragraph (f) of the section, subsection, definition, or clause in which that reference was made. These sections were products of the re-ordering process. As they are now taken to be implicit, they no longer require legislative force and have been omitted from the core provisions. However, section AA 1 (2) has been saved as section YB 4 (3). Section AA 1 (2) provided that the re- ordering and changes of style carried out in the Income Tax Act 1994 were not intended to affect the interpreta- tion of the provisions of the Income Tax Act 1976 as they were included in the re-ordered Act. The new section YB 4 (4) provides that the changes in style and language carried out by the Core Provisions Act are to be applied to the interpretation of the provisions of the 1976 Act which continue to apply. Subpart A Purpose 1 Subpart B Income tax and resulting obligations 1 Subpart G Avoidance 1 Subpart H Double tax agreements 1 Subpart F Other obligations 1 Subpart E Withholding liabilities 1 Subpart C Calculation and satisfaction of income tax liabilities 1 Subpart D Gross income, allowable deductions and timing 1 agreements need to be considered as part of the process of determining a person’s income tax liability. Subpart BC - Calculation and satisfaction of income tax liabilities New Subpart BC sets out the methods for determining and satisfying a person’s income tax liability. Section BC 1 - Calculation and satisfaction The method of determining a person’s income tax liability depends on whether a person is: •a non-filing taxpayer (defined in section OB 1) •a taxpayer other than a non-filing taxpayer; or •a taxpayer with “schedular gross income”. New section BC 1 (1) directs these different types of taxpayers to the appropriate provisions in Subpart BC that govern the calculation of their types of income tax liability. New section BC 1 (2) states that the income tax liability for an income year may be satisfied by crediting any tax paid or withheld, or by paying terminal tax under section BC 9, or by both. Section BC 2 - Calculation of income tax liability of a non-filing taxpayer “Non-filing taxpayer” is defined in section OB 1 to include: •a taxpayer to whom section 33A of the Tax Adminis- tration Act 1994 applies (formerly known as “pay- period taxpayers”); (i)who does not elect to file a return; or (ii)whose income tax liability for an income year would be larger if determined under sections BC 4 to BC 8, than if it were equal to the total of all tax deductions required to be made from the gross income derived in that income year. •a non-resident entertainer who elects not to file; and •a taxpayer who derives only non-resident withholding income subject to NRWT as a final tax. Under section BC 2, non-filing taxpayers have their income tax liability determined by the amount of tax deductions required to be made from their gross income for the relevant year. Sections BC 4 to BC 8 - Income tax liability of all taxpayers other than non-filing taxpayers New sections BC 4 to BC 8 set out the general calcula- tion provisions for determination of an income tax liability. Taxpayers who are not “non-filing taxpayers” must follow this process. Taxpayers with schedular gross income must also apply this process in the manner described below. The first step to calculating the taxpayer’s income tax liability under the general calculation provisions is to calculate the taxpayer’s taxable income. The process is illustrated diagrammatically on page 5. Part B contains the main rules for calculating and satisfying income tax liabilities. While most of the detail is contained in other Parts of the Act, the other Parts are subject to the core provisions. Subpart BA - Purpose The new section BA (1) sets out the purposes of Part B. The purposes of core provisions are: •to impose income tax, provisional tax, withholding liabilities and other obligations in respect of taxes •to set out procedures to be followed to calculate the tax and satisfy the obligations imposed under the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 •to provide a basis for the application of the other Parts •to set up the scheme of the Act and the main links between its Parts. Part B is intended to be the only Part of the Act within which all the various taxes dealt with in the Act are imposed, so as to make it as straightforward as possible for users to locate charging provisions. Consequently, Part B contains the charging provisions in relation to FBT, PAYE, RWT, provisional tax and so on. Subpart BB - Income Tax and Resulting Obligations The new Subpart BB imposes income tax and provides the links with the later subparts. Section BB 1 - Imposition of tax New section BB 1 is the central charging provision, intended to retain the effect of the former central charging provision (section BB 1). Income tax is imposed on taxable income at the rate(s) of tax fixed by an Act and is payable to the Crown. Section BB 2 - Principal Obligations The new section BB 2 provides that: •income tax liabilities must be calculated and satisfied under Subpart BC •provisional taxpayers must pay provisional tax in respect of an income year in accordance with the provisional tax rules •any withholding liabilities under Subpart BE must be satisfied •any other taxes imposed under Subpart BF must also be satisfied. Section BB 3 - Overriding effect of certain matters The new section BB 3 provides that a person’s income tax liability may be affected by the existence of a tax avoidance arrangement or a relevant double tax agree- ment. The rationale for including the section in the core provisions is to reflect the fact that the implications of the general anti-avoidance rule and of double tax from page 3 Filing taxpayer - calculation of taxable income The definitions of “annual gross income” and “annual allowable deductions” in new sections BC 4 and BC 5 set the foundation for the global/gross approach. “Annual gross income” and “annual allowable deductions” are, respectively, the total amounts of gross income and allowable deductions allocated, under Subpart BD, to the year for which taxable income is calculated. Annual allowable deductions are deducted from annual gross income to arrive at the “net income” or “net loss” of a taxpayer. Under new section BC 6, if a taxpayer’s annual gross income is more than, or equal to, the taxpayer’s annual allowable deductions, the difference is the taxpayer’s net income for the year (subsections (1) and (2)). By contrast, if a taxpayer’s annual gross income is less than the annual allowable deductions, the difference is the taxpayer’s net loss. A taxpayer with a net loss is deemed to have net income of zero (subsection (3)). This avoids the neces- sity to refer continuously to “net income or net loss” throughout the Act. Section BC 6 (4) provides that a net loss may, in accordance with Part I, either be: •carried forward by the taxpayer to future income years along with net losses of previous income years and offset against net income of the taxpayer in those future years; or •made available to another taxpayer for offset against their net income (under the company grouping rules or the loss attributing qualifying company rules). continued on page 6 43 42 40 net income if positive or zero Less Subpart D BD 1 Gross income 3 BD 2 Allowable deductions 4 BD 4 Allocation of allowable deductions 5 BC 4 Annual gross income 6 BC 5 Annual allowable deductions 7 Net income 10 Sum Sum Part I Losses 11 net loss if negative less Available net losses 12 Taxable income 13 BC 8 Income tax liability 14 BD 3 Allocation of gross income 2 equals 41 BC 6 BC 7 equals income tax liability is the result of the following calcu- lations: •Multiplying taxable income by the applicable basic tax rate (set out in Schedule 1 of the Act) to arrive at the “unadjusted income tax liability” (section BC 8 (2)); •Subtracting the taxpayer’s allowable rebates from the unadjusted income tax liability, and adding the New Zealand superannuation surcharge (the applicable surcharge) to arrive at the “interim income tax liability” (section BC 8 (3)). If the result of these calculations is positive or zero, that amount is the income tax liability of the taxpayer. If the result is negative, the taxpayer’s income tax liability is zero (section BC 8 (5)). In the latter case, the Commis- sioner is then required, under section BC 8 (6) and section BC 10, to make a refund in respect of any refundable rebates (defined to include Family Support credits and rebates of non-resident investment compa- nies) to the extent that they exceed the interim income tax liability. The excess is called a “surplus rebate”. The steps for calculating the income tax liability that follow from the calculation of taxable income are illustrated in the following diagram: Section BC 8 - Income Tax Liability Under section BC 7 “available net losses” are deducted from net income to arrive at “taxable income”. An “available net loss” is defined in section OB 1 as an amount that a taxpayer is entitled at any relevant time to offset against net income under Part I. In addition to net losses referred to in the more general loss provisions in Part I, the term includes particular sources of loss such as CFC and FIF losses and specified activity losses. Section BC 3 - Income tax liability of a taxpayer with schedular gross income Section BC 3 introduces the concept of “schedular gross income”. This is defined in section OB 1 to mean income of the following types: •non-resident withholding income subject to NRWT as a final tax •policyholder income of a life insurer •certain income of non-resident entertainers •certain gross income of a non-resident general insurer that is not a company •Category A income of a group investment fund •gross income of a non-resident mining operator from a mining venture. In the absence of this section the preceding types of income would not fit within the global/gross approach because a separate income tax liability calculation is required for reasons such as separate return filing requirements or different tax rates. Section BC 3 requires taxpayers with schedular gross income to calculate, under the general calculation provisions, an income tax liability in respect of that income as if it were their only income. This amount determined under section BC 3 (2) is a “schedular income tax liability”. If the taxpayer has more than one type of schedular gross income for an income year, this calculation must be performed for each type of schedular gross income and all the schedular income tax liabilities added together. The schedular income tax liability or the total of the schedular income tax liabilities must then be added to the amount that would be the taxpayer’s income tax liability if the taxpayer did not have any schedular gross income and is other than a non-filing taxpayer. Taxpayers who act in separate capacities, such as agents and trustees, are dealt with elsewhere in the Act as separate taxpayers in respect of those capacities. This means that it is not necessary to aggregate their income from those capacities. Section BC 8 - remaining steps for calculation of income tax liability The remaining steps that must be followed in order to calculate a taxpayer’s income tax liability are set out in section BC 8. Broadly section BC 8 provides the process for calculating taxpayers income tax liability once their taxable income has been determined. It provides that the from page 5 45 44 less BC 8 (1) Application 15 Income tax liability calculated under this section Calculate unadjusted income tax liability Taxable income 16 Unadjusted income tax liability 18 Calculate interim income tax liability Applicable surcharges 21 equals plus BC 8 (4) Result positive Income tax liability 22 BC 8 (5) Result negative Income tax liability = 0 23 BC 9 Satisfaction of income tax liability 24 BC 8 (6) Surplus rebates 25 BC 10 Amounts owing to taxpayers 26 BC 7 Taxable income 19 multiplied by Applicable basic tax rate 17 (BC 8 (2)) (BC 8 (3)) equals 46 Allowable rebates 20 Section BC 9 - Satisfaction of income tax liability Having determined the income tax liability of a tax- payer, section BC 9 outlines the manner in which it must be satisfied. The liability is first satisfied by credits that are available to the taxpayer and then through the payment of terminal tax. If the total of the taxpayer’s credits for tax paid or withheld exceeds the taxpayer’s income tax liability, section BC 9 (2) requires the excess credits first to be set off against other tax obligations of the taxpayer. Any remaining excess is to be dealt with in accordance with Part L (credits), Part M (tax payments) or is to be refunded by the Commissioner under section BC 10. To determine the composition of any excess credits, new section BC 9 (3) provides that the taxpayer’s credits are to be treated as having been set off in the following order: •non-refundable credits (such as credits for foreign tax) •credits allowed to the taxpayer under Part L in respect of supplementary dividends •convertible credits (such as imputation credits) •refundable credits (such as PAYE and provisional tax). This ordering rule ensures that maximum credit is available for foreign taxes and other amounts which are capped at the level of domestic income tax liability. The following diagram illustrates the process for satisfying income tax liabilities: BC 9 - Satisfaction of income tax liability Section BC 10 - Amounts owing to taxpayers New section BC 10 gives the Commissioner the author- ity to refund surplus credits and rebates. Subpart BD - Gross income, allowable deductions and timing The new subpart BD contains the sections relating to gross income, allowable deductions and timing that must be applied to determine annual gross income and annual allowable deductions for the purposes of new Subpart BC. Section BD 1 - Gross income New section BD 1 defines gross income as all amounts included in gross income under various Parts of the Act. The main Part dealing with gross income is Part C, although currently items are included in gross income throughout the Act. Section BD 1 contains the exclusions from gross income. They are exempt income, amounts excluded under various later Parts of the Act and, if the taxpayer is a non-resident, amounts that are foreign-sourced. The last exclusion gives effect to the rules that determine liability to tax by reference to residence and source (former section BB 3). This approach is intended to place those rules more clearly within a global/gross context as income tax liabilities are now triggered through derivation of gross income. Section BD 2 - Allowable deductions New section BD 2 defines allowable deductions by inclusion of the general deductibility provision and reference to the Parts allowing other deductions. The replacement in the general deductibility provision of the words “gaining or producing” with the word “deriving”, and other changes in wording in the provi- sion, are purely drafting changes and are not intended to affect policy or interpretation. Section BD 2 (2) contains the prohibitions on deduct- ibility. An amount of expenditure or loss is not an allowable deduction to the extent that it is: •of a private or domestic nature •incurred in deriving exempt income •incurred in deriving income from employment •incurred in deriving non-resident withholding income subject to NRWT as a final tax •of a capital nature unless specifically allowed; or •disallowed as a deduction under any other provision of the Act. These exclusions generally reflect the exclusions in the previous legislation. The exception is the exclusion in relation to non-resident withholding income subject to NRWT as a final tax, which reflects current practice and case law as in Lambe v CIR (1980) 4 NZTC 61,599. continued on page 8 less 48 less less less Income tax liability 27 Credits to be set off against income tax liability BC 8 Income tax liability 28 Non-refundable credits 29 Convertible credits 30 Refundable credits 31 BC 9 (2) Surplus credits 33 BC 9 Terminal tax 34 Part M Tax payments 35 Part L Credits 36 BC 10 Amounts owing to taxpayers 37 BC 9 (2)(a) Excess due to convertible credits 38 BC 9 (2)(b) Excess due to refundable credits 39 if negative if positive Result 47 BC 9 (1) Section BD 3 and BD 4 - Allocation of gross income and allowable deductions New sections BD 3 and BD 4 outline the timing rules that allocate gross income and allowable deductions to income years. If a timing regime in Part E applies, the income or deduction must be allocated in accordance with that regime. Otherwise the test is when the income is derived or the expenditure incurred. Both sections contain provisions to ensure that there is no double assessability or deductibility. Subpart BE - Withholding Liabilities New section BE 1 imposes the various withholding liabilities dealt with under the Act. These include: •source deduction payments •resident withholding tax •non-resident withholding tax •fringe benefit tax •specified superannuation contribution withholding tax •dividend withholding payments. The section refers to those Parts of the Act that contain the detail of the relevant regime. Subpart BF - Other obligations New section BF 1 imposes a number of other taxes dealt with under the Act. These include: •qualifying company election tax •income tax on taxable distributions from non-qualify- ing trusts •withdrawal tax •further income tax •further dividend withholding payments Again, the section refers to the Parts of the Act that contain the detail of the relevant regimes. Subpart BG - Avoidance New section BG 1 contains the main aspects of the general anti-avoidance provision and is split into two essential components: the voiding of tax avoidance arrangements, and the ability of the Commissioner to counteract any advantage obtained under such arrange- ments. The rest of the general anti-avoidance provisions are contained in section GB 1 and section OB 1. The changes in wording to the various components of the provisions, including the reference in section BG 1 to the Commissioner being able to “counteract” an arrangement, are not intended to change existing policy. The reference to the Commissioner’s ability to “counter- act” was used in the illustrative core provisions drafted by the Working Party on the Reorganisation of the Income Tax Act 1976. Subpart BH - Double Tax Agreements Section BH 1 rewrites the previous section BB 11, as introduced in the 1994 Act, dealing with the overriding effect of double tax agreements and the provisions that may be contained in a double tax agreement. Subsection (3) provides that any reference in a double tax agreement to profits from a particular activity shall be read as a reference to the amount that would be the taxpayer’s net income if that activity were the taxpay- er’s only activity. This is to ensure that net concepts in double tax agreements are not inconsistent with the global/gross approach. from page 7 General consequential changes New terms and phrases The core provisions use new terms to describe the various components of the income tax calculation. The new terminology is now used consistently throughout the Act. The most common change is to the term “assessable income”, which was previously used to reflect both gross and net concepts. In some instances it was not clear which concept of income was being referred to. The term “assessable income” has been replaced with the more explicit terms “gross income”, “net income” or “taxable income”, as appropriate. Gross income is referred to as being “derived by” a taxpayer. In contrast “net income” and “taxable in- come” are the result of a calculation . Accordingly, the Act refers to the net or taxable income “of” (rather than “derived by”) the taxpayer. Gross income Section BD 1 defines gross income as an amount included in a taxpayer’s gross income under one of the various Parts of the Act that classify amounts as gross income. Gross income is not related to a particular income year until it is allocated to an income year under section BD 3 in accordance with the relevant timing principle. The following phrases have been used in provisions identifying amounts as “gross income”: •“xxx is gross income” •“the gross income of any person includes”; and •“xxx is included in the gross income of any person”. The use of these phrases interchangeably reflects that gross income can be one, or more than one, item. As noted above, total gross income for an income year is called annual gross income. In line with the drafting changes to the general deduct- ibility provision (section BD 2), references to the “production of assessable income” have been changed to the “derivation of gross income”. Similarly, references to “gaining or producing assessable income” have been changed to “deriving gross income”. Generally the Act no longer states the taxpayer is liable to tax in respect of a particular item. This is because the designation of an amount as gross income, by implica- tion, brings the amount into the calculation of an income tax liability. Examples of where “assessable income” has been replaced with “gross income” follow: Section ED 4.Accounting for goods and services tax - (1)...the gross income of any person shall not include - (a)Any amount of output tax charged, levied, or calcu- lated in respect of a supply of goods and services made by that person: (b)Any amount of goods and services tax payable by the Commissioner to that person. Section CH 3 Monetary Remuneration All monetary remuneration derived by a person is gross income. Net income The amount by which annual gross income exceeds annual allowable deductions is net income. An example of where the term “net income” replaces “assessable income” follows: Section KC 2. Rebate in certain cases for children In the assessment of every taxpayer (other than an absentee) who at any time during any income year - (a)Is under the age of 15 years .... there shall be allowed a rebate of income tax for that income year of the lesser of - (d)An amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: (x - y) x (15/100) where x is the net income of the taxpayer for that income year ... Taxable income “Taxable income” is calculated by deducting “available net losses” (see above) from “net income”. An example of where “assessable income” has been amended to “taxable income” follows: Section IG 2 Net loss offset between group companies ... (2)(g)(iii) The \[subvention\] payment would not (otherwise than under this subsection) be taken into account in calculat- ing the taxable income of either the loss company or the profit company; and ... Amount A number of provisions in the Act refer to net concepts of profits or gains, such as section CD 1, relating to land transactions. These references are inconsistent with the gross approach of the new core provisions. The term “any amount” has been adopted in substitution for “profits or gains” to refer to the total consideration derived by the taxpayer from a transaction. The word “amount” is intended to reflect that what is being referred to is a gross item. As noted above, there is a savings provision in relation to the use of the term “amount” in section CD 3 (the predecessor to which, section BB 4 (a), referred to profits or gains from a business). The term “amount” is used more generally to replace generic references to income except where this would change the meaning of a section. “Amount” is defined to include an amount in money’s worth. Allowable deductions The legislation authorising a deduction has been standardised. Consistent with section BD 2, the Act now refers to an amount being “allowed as a deduction” or a variation of that phrase. Terms such as “entitled” or “permitted” in deduction sections have been replaced with “allowed”. For example: Section DD 3. Deduction for interest where funds bor- rowed to purchase shares in amalgamating company - ... interest payable, in the income year in which the amalga- mation takes place or subsequently, on the money borrowed will be allowed as a deduction to the other company. Section DB 1. Certain deductions not allowed ... Under the new core provisions, the allowance of deduc- tions is incorporated as one aspect of the calculation of a taxpayer’s net income. Consequently, references to “in calculating the assessable income” are redundant and have been removed. For example, section DF 2 previ- ously read: Sect DF 2. Contributions to employees’ benefit funds - (1)In calculating the assessable income of any employer the Commissioner may allow a deduction of any amount set aside or paid by the employer as or to a fund (not being a superannuation scheme) to provide individual personal benefits to employees of that employer: That section now reads: (1)The Commissioner may allow a deduction to an em- ployer of any amount set aside or paid by the employer as or to a fund (not being a superannuation scheme) to provide individual personal benefits to employees of that employer: continued on page 10 Annual gross income and annual allowable deductions “Annual gross income” and “annual allowable deduc- tions” are, respectively, the total amounts of gross income and allowable deductions for an income year. These terms are only occasionally used in the Act outside the core provisions. Net loss/Available net losses The term “loss” in the Act previously meant one of two things: expenditure or loss arising from a particular event (for example, theft) or a year’s trading loss. The term “net loss” is now consistently used when referring to the amount by which annual allowable deductions exceed annual gross income. All losses dealt with in Part I, including pre-1997-98 losses are termed “net losses”. References to “a loss incurred by a taxpayer” have been changed to “a net loss of a taxpayer”. The phrase “offset against net income” has replaced “deduct/set off against assessable income”. Available net losses are, as noted above, the sum of losses available to a taxpayer for offset, including attributed foreign losses and specified activity losses. Income tax liability Under the new core provisions, taxpayers have an “income tax liability” in respect of their “taxable income”. When used in this context, the term “income tax payable” has been changed to “income tax liability”. No change has been made where “income tax payable” directly refers to the payment of (or the obligation to pay) tax. The terminology used for the recognition of the payment of an income tax liability is generally that an income tax liability has been satisfied. A liability is first satisfied by credits that are available to a taxpayer being “set off” or “credited against” that liability. Basic rate of income tax for companies As a result of the recent reduction of the tax rate on New Zealand branch income of non-resident companies, the phrase “rate of resident companies’ income tax” has been replaced by “basic rate of income tax for compa- nies”. Other consequential changes Hypothetical calculations As mentioned earlier, the core provisions require that all items of gross income are aggregated for an income year, regardless of their source or type. Net income is calculated by deducting annual allowable deductions from the aggregate amount of gross income for an income year (annual gross income). Therefore there can be only one net income figure. However, various provisions in the Act refer to a particular type or source of net income. In order to preserve the existing policy while conforming with the global/gross approach, it has been necessary to adopt a formulation for a hypothetical calculation of net income. The hypothetical calculation assumes that the gross income from one source is the only gross income of a taxpayer. Under section IH 1 a mining company which incurs a net loss from exploration in a mining licence area may offset the loss against net income for a succeeding income year only to the extent that the loss does not exceed the following amount: gross income derived from mining in the licence area - less - expenditure incurred in deriving that income. Mining income derived from another licence area and any non-mining income derived by that company is not, therefore, taken into account for the purposes of calcu- lating the amount of net loss able to be offset. Section IH 1 has consequently been redrafted as follows: Section IH 1. Losses of mining companies and petroleum miners (1)(b) .... offset against the net income of that company to the extent that it does not exceed the amount that would be the net income of the company if its sole source of gross income for the year of claim was from that licence area... Certain provisions calculate the amount of an allowable deduction by reference to particular types or sources of income. This quarantining is also preserved by the same hypothetical calculation. For example: Section DM 1. Treatment of petroleum mining exploration and development expenditure - (6)(a)The petroleum miner shall be allowed deductions under subsection (5)(b) in respect of that asset only to the extent that the deductions do not exceed the amount that would be the net income of the petroleum miner if the only gross income of the petroleum miner were from that disposition. This change has also been made in section DD 2 (Testamentary annuities charged on property) and HI 4(2) (Tax in respect of Maori authorities with 20 or fewer beneficiaries). The same principles apply to determine the amount of income tax payable on income from a particular source. In these instances it has been necessary to provide a hypothetical calculation of a person’s income tax liability. For example, Section LC 4 Foreign tax credits - controlled foreign companies (4)Any person ... is entitled to set off that credit against the person’s income tax liability - (a)For that income year, to the extent that it does not exceed the amount that would be the person’s income tax liability for that year if the person did not have any gross income for that year other than attributed foreign income ... from page 9 Provisions that previously referred to assessable income as a net concept before taking into account deductions to which the section applies, now use a formulation such as “the amount that would but for this section be the net income”. For example: Section DJ 4.Gifts of money by companies not closely held - ... the amount of the deduction allowed under this section - (a)In respect of the aggregate of all gifts made in that income year by any company not being a close company) to any one donee, shall not exceed the greater of - (i)1% of the amount that would but for this section be the net income of the company; ... Similarly: •The deduction allowed to a Maori authority under section DI 2 (deduction for donations to Maori associations) is expressed as not exceeding 5% of the amount that would be the net income of the Maori authority in the absence of this section. •The net schedular flavour of section DI 3 (2) (treat- ment of expenditure incurred by a superannuation fund if its funds are invested in another superannua- tion fund) has been removed by characterising the amount of the allowable deduction to the second superannuation fund by reference to notional taxable income of the second superannuation fund. “Notwithstanding” The core provisions provide all the essential rules for the calculation of an income tax liability and form the basis for the application of later Parts of the Act. For instance, for expenditure or a loss to be an allowable deduction it must satisfy the general deductibility rule in section BD 2 or the rule in that section defining allow- able deductions by reference to whether they are allowed in a later Part. Accordingly, the Act no longer contains the phrase “notwithstanding anything in section BB 7” (the predecessor to section BD 2). See section DB 1 (Certain deductions not allowed). As another example, section DI 3 (Expenditure incurred by superannuation funds) previously applied “notwith- standing section BB 8 (a)”. Section BD 2 (2)(e) ex- cludes a capital amount from the term “allowable deduction”, unless it is allowed as a deduction under either Part D or E. Therefore it is not necessary to override the capital deduction prohibition in specific deduction provisions. Provisions that replicate the core provisions As noted above, the changes confirm the Court of Appeal’s decision in CIR v Inglis (1992) 14 NZTC 9,180: if any profits or gains from a transaction would have been taxable under the Act, any losses are deduct- ible. This is because the total consideration derived from the sale of property is included in gross income and the cost of that property is identified as an allowable deduction. Consequently, in addition to the changes made to the land, personal property and other “revenue account property” provisions as discussed below, provisions dealing with losses by reference to what the treatment would be if a profit had arisen have been removed. For example: •The proviso in paragraph (c) of section DD 1 (Certain deductions not allowed - rents, interest, and premises) previously stated that in the case of a disposal of premises, the deduction for a loss would not be denied if a corresponding profit would have been assessable. •Sections IE 1 (5) and IG 2 (1)(c) previously provided that a tax loss is not available if no gross income has been derived, as in the case of non-residents. Terminating provisions The core provisions legislation will apply from the 1997-98 income year. The approach taken to amending terminating provisions is to amend only those that have application in the year the core provisions will apply. In the case of provisions that have historical application only, the old terminology is retained. Consequential amendments to Part C - Income Further Defined Subpart CB - Exempt income The new term “exempt income” is used in Subpart CB for consistency with section BD 1 (2) of the core provisions, which excludes “exempt income” from the meaning of gross income. Section CB 1 (Exempt income - interest) incorporates changes that are illustrative of the changes to all the provisions in Subpart CB. It employs the new term “exempt income”, which has been adopted to replace references to items (or persons 2 ) that were previously “exempt from tax”. 2. See section CB 14. Section CB 1 also introduces a new formulation at the beginning of each section that exempts an item from tax. It reads: “to the extent that in the absence of this section the following amounts would be gross income, they are exempt income”. This ensures that there is no overlap between items of exempt income and capital gains. It is also intended that the exempt items are gross amounts. Section CB 1 further illustrates a change which has occurred frequently throughout the consequential amendments: the reference to “income derived” has been replaced with a specific reference to the character of the income being referred to. For example, in section continued on page 12 CB 1 (b), “income derived” has been replaced with “interest on post-war credits derived”. Similarly, references to “income derived by a person” throughout the consequential amendments have often been replaced by “any amount derived by a person”. See, for example, section CB 2 (1)(c) (Non-residents’ exempt income). Section CB 4 (1)(k), which provided for a $1,000 exemption for non-profit organisations, has been repealed and replaced with a $1,000 deduction provi- sion in Part D (limited to the amount of net income of the organisation - see section DJ 17 (Non-profit bod- ies)). For consistency with the global/gross approach, the reference to “exempt income” should be to a gross amount since exempt income is limited to amounts that would otherwise be gross income. Hence, it is not possible to have net amounts as exempt income. To draft the provision on a gross income basis would effectively deny non-profit organisations a deduction for the portion of expenditure that was incurred in relation to their exempt income. This is not the current policy. The redrafting of this provision is a change in mecha- nism only and involves no change to the actual tax position of non-profit organisations. The proviso to section CB 8 (1)(b) (Certain income from Niue exempt) replaces “income or gains derived” with “any amount derived”. Subsection (1)(b) provides that no dividends are exempt income under that para- graph to the extent that those dividends constitute distribution of any amount derived by the company from sources in New Zealand. The substitution of the word “amount” does not alter the capital/revenue boundary inherent in the section: the introductory words of section CB 8 limit the exemption available in subsection (1)(b) to items that would otherwise be gross income, in this case dividends paid by certain New Zealand companies deriving profits from Niue to non-residents. The intention of the proviso is to ensure that the exemption provided under the section does not extend to companies that derive some profits from New Zealand sources. The words “income or gains from New Zea- land” are used in the generic sense (as in profits from New Zealand) rather than in a tax sense. Consequently, the changes have not altered the application of the section. In section CB 12 (Exempt income - employee allow- ances and expenditure on account of an employee), the phrase “deductible in calculating the employee’s assessable income for any income year” has been replaced by the phrase “an allowable deduction to the employee”. This illustrates two generic changes which are consequential to the enactment of the core provi- sions: •The removal of the term “assessable income”. •The use of new terminology for allowing a deduction or providing that an amount is deductible is “allowed as a deduction” for consistency with Subparts BC and BD of the core provisions. Section CB 12 also removes the reference to section DE 1 (formerly Deduction for expenditure or loss incurred in production of income from employment), and replaces it with a reference to section BD 2 (2)(c) of the core provisions (Exclusion from allowable deduc- tions for expenditure incurred in deriving income from employment). Subpart CC - Compensation, Benefits and Grants All provisions in Subpart CC have been placed on a gross basis so that compensation payments and benefits, payments to former service employees, and the labour portion of the forestry encouragement grant are gross income. Section CC 1 (Certain compensation, benefits, and other payments are gross income) now begins: “The gross income of any person includes”. This phrase and the phrase “is included in the gross income of any person” have frequently been added to provisions designating amounts or items as “gross income”. Subpart CD - Activities in the nature of trade A number of significant changes have occurred in Subpart CD. Subpart CD now contains the core assess- ability provisions relating to business and personal property. Sections CD 3 (Business), CD 4 (Personal property) and CD 5 (Gross income according to ordi- nary concepts) replace the former sections BB 4 (a), BB 4 (c) and BB 4 (d) respectively. In line with the core provisions, all the sections in Subpart CD have been placed on a gross basis. Section CD 1 (Land transactions) illustrates two generic changes which are consequential to the enactment of the core provisions: •First, the words “unless (or save so far as) express provision is made in this Act to the contrary” have generally been omitted (see also section CG 1, for example). The accepted rules of statutory interpreta- tion, the new interpretation provision in Part A (section AA 3 (1)) and the Acts Interpretation Act 1924 generally make this phrase redundant. •Second, as mentioned above, generic references to “profits or gains” have for the most part been replaced with a singular reference to “any amount” placing the section on a gross basis. Section CD 3 provides that an amount derived from a business is now “gross income”. Cases such as Califor- nian Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 and more recently CIR v City Motor Service Ltd \[1969\] NZLR 1010 have established the common law principle whereby the assessability of business profits in an income tax statute is determined by focusing on whether the receipt in question is derived from the current operations of a business. Accordingly, the use of the term “amount” instead of “profits or gains” should not from page 11 disturb the application of this principle. A savings provision has, however, been inserted in section 2 of the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act for the avoidance of doubt on the matter. It states that the use of the word “amount” in section CD 3 is not by itself intended to change whether an amount derived by a person is taken into account or disregarded in calculating the person’s income tax liability for an income year. The changes to section CD 4 involve substituting the words “amount derived from the sale ... of personal property” for the existing terminology of “profit or gain derived from the sale ...of personal property”. A provi- sion has also been included in Part D that has the effect of authorising a deduction for the cost of that property under the general deductibility provisions. Section CD 5 (Gross income according to ordinary concepts) replaces the former section BB 4 (d). Section BB 4 (d) included in assessable income “income derived from any other source”. The Act did not contain an exhaustive definition of assessable income, instead determining assessable income on an inclusive basis by listing (for example, under the former section BB 4) the principal sources of income assessable under the Act. In order to maintain, in substance, an inclusive definition of income under the global/gross approach, section CD 5 has been included to provide that the gross income of any person includes “any amount that is included in gross income under ordinary concepts”. This ensures that where any transaction gives rise to an amount that is of an income nature, that amount will be gross income even where that amount would not otherwise fall within the scope of any other specific gross income provision. The comment was made at page 17 of Taxation (Core Provisions) Bill - Commen- tary on the Bill, December 1995 that the intention of this change is to ensure that the courts “recognise and give effect to the full scope of the income concept”. A general provision applying to revenue account property has been inserted in Part D to ensure a deduc- tion for cost under the general deductibility rule in section BD 2. Any specific deduction provisions have been relocated to Part D (for example, former subsec- tions CD 1 (5), (8) and (9)). Relevant to the sections in subpart CD is the insertion in Part E of a new matching provision which requires the allowable deduction for the cost of the property to be deferred until the later of, disposition of the property, or derivation of gross income from the disposition (see comment under section EF 2). Subpart CE - Investment and land income The provisions in Subpart CE have been placed on a gross basis and any related deductibility provisions contained in this Subpart have been relocated to Part D. For example, new section CE 3 (1)(a) provides that the gross income of any person includes the amount re- ceived on the redemption of a commercial bill. Com- mercial bills are, therefore, revenue account property as that term is defined in section OB 1. The corresponding allowable deduction for the cost of the commercial bill was formerly contained in old paragraph CE 3 (1)(a). Now, where the commercial bill is not a financial arrangement to which the accrual rules apply, the cost of the commercial bill will be an allowable deduction under section BD 2 (1)(b)(i) or (ii). New section DJ 13 prevents any such expenditure incurred by a taxpayer as the cost of revenue account property being prohibited from deductibility by the capital exclusion of section BD 2 (2)(e). The cost of the commercial bill will also be subject to the allocation rules set out in section EF 2. Finally, section DJ 16 provides that for the purposes of determining the deduction allowed for the cost of a commercial bill, the taxpayer is treated as having acquired it at a cost equal to its value on the date of acquisition. Section CE 4 (Amounts remitted to be gross income) has been inserted to replace the former section BB 5 (Amounts remitted to be taken into account in comput- ing income). This new section deems any expenditure or loss incurred by the taxpayer and allowed as a deduc- tion, that is subsequently cancelled or remitted, to be gross income in the year in which it was remitted or cancelled. Subpart CF - Dividends Section CF 1 provides that the gross income of any person includes “all dividends”. Other minor changes have been made to the dividend rules to ensure consist- ency with the core provisions. For example: •Sections CF 2 (9) and (10) (Meaning of term “divi- dends”) have been amended so that if dividends are subsequently repaid to the company the Commis- sioner may amend the assessment of the “income tax liability” of the shareholder accordingly. •Section CF 2 (15)(a)(ii) replaces the phrase “rate of resident companies’ tax” with the phrase “basic rate of income tax for companies” (see general consequen- tial changes above). •Sections CF 3 (1)(ia)(iii) and (j)(iii) (Exclusions from term “dividends”) referred to dividends for which a person has been “assessable and liable for tax”. This is replaced with “is included in gross income”. Any amount that is gross income is, by implication, assessable for income tax. •Section CF 3 (7) has been re-structured and re-drafted so that it no longer refers to “profits or gains”. The changes are not intended to alter the application of the section. •Section CF 6 (1) (Amount of dividend includes credits and certain foreign tax) deletes “for the purposes of determining the amount of income derived by a person” because the core provisions explicitly deter- mine the amount of gross income of a person. continued on page 14 Subpart CG - Attributed foreign income Section CG 1 provides that attributed foreign income and foreign investment fund income are gross income. Section CG 11 (5)(b)(ii) (Branch equivalent income calculation), relating to the adjusted base price of financial arrangements, replaces “accrued expenditure” with “expenditure deemed to be incurred” and replaces “accrued income...less consideration received by the holder” with “gross income”. This ensures consistency with the consequential amendments made to Subpart EH (Financial arrangements). Subpart CH - Employment-related income A new section CH 3 (Monetary remuneration) has been added. This replaces the former section BB 4 (b) and provides that all monetary remuneration derived by a person is gross income. Subpart CI - Fringe benefits Section CI 3 (2)(b) (Value of fringe benefit) replaces “amount of income” with “amount of gross income”. Also, the “amount accruing from that loan” has been replaced in that section with the “gross income accruing from that loan”. This clarifies the type of income that is being referred to and makes the terminology of the section consistent with core provisions. Section CI 9 (Application of fringe benefit tax provi- sions) has been removed as section BE 1 (4) (Fringe benefits) makes the section redundant. Income from minerals, timber, or flax The former section CJ 1, dealing with a net concept of profit or gain in relation to the extraction or sale of timber and minerals, has been split into its income, expenditure and timing components. The income component has been retained in Part C. The effect of the phrase “reduced by the cost of those minerals or of that flax or timber” and the proviso to section CJ 1 has been relocated to Part D (see section DJ 13, which provides that the cost of “revenue account property” (as defined in section OB 1) is not a capital cost to which section BD 2 (2)(e) applies. See also Part E (including the new section EF 2) in relation to timing). Group companies The former section CK 1, relating to companies within a group and the recharacterisation of profit as assessable income, has been split into its income and deduction components. The related deductibility provision is section DI 4. Life insurer income The former section CM 1 (Assessable income of life insurers) provided for a net schedular taxation regime for life insurance companies. It is repealed, since the regime has been significantly restructured to enable the life insurance rules to fit within the global/gross frame- work. New section CM 3 (Exclusions from life insurer’s gross income) preserves the tax treatment of life insurance premiums and reinsurance claims received by life insurers as not being of a taxable nature. These were exclusions from the “item i” in the old CM 3 formula. The life insurance regime is, therefore, no longer a code that exists independently of the core provisions. This change does not involve any change to the existing policy. The deduction provisions in the life insurance regime are now all located in Part D. For example, section CM 4 (Adjustment for superannuation policies in respect of property acquired before 1 April 1988) provided a deduction for life insurers, and has been relocated to Part D (see section DK 3C). Section CM 11 (Certain property not trading stock) has also been relocated to Part D as section DK 3E. New sections CM 5, CM 6, CM 7 respectively deem “mortality profit”, “premium loading”, “discontinuance profit” to be gross income. In section CM 12 certain amounts relating to full reinsurance are deemed not to be gross income. This is consistent with the change to section CM 3. Section CM 9, which prohibited double deductions, is repealed because the schedular nature of the regime has been removed and because section BD 4 (4) provides a prohibition on double deductions. Section CM 10 (Sales or disposals of property) is substantially amended to treat as gross income all consideration derived from property subject to the section. The timing of the deduction for the cost of the property is dealt with in Subpart DK. Subsection (4) is relocated to Part E as section EG 19 as this subsection relates to the depreciation rules. The calculation for policyholder income is performed under section CM 15 (Policyholder base income or loss) is termed “the policyholder base calculation”. Policy- holder income is deemed to be gross income (and is included by definition within schedular gross income). A policyholder net loss may only be deducted in accord- ance with sections II 1 and II 2 because of the separate basic rate of income tax for “schedular taxable income in respect of policyholder income” (see clause 1 of Part A of Schedule 1). Former sections CM 15 (3) and (4) have been relocated to section CM 18 (Transfer of life insurance business). from page 13 Loss on disposal of premises Paragraph (c) of section DD 1 denies a deduction for a loss in relation to the demolition, destruction or disposal of premises. As noted above, the proviso stated that in the case of a disposal, the paragraph would not apply if a corresponding profit would have been assessable. The effect of the proviso is achieved by the core provi- sions: deductions in respect of a disposal transaction producing a loss will be allowed if a profit from the transaction would have been liable to tax. The consid- eration in respect of the transaction is included in gross income and the cost of the transaction is separately included in allowable deductions. The proviso has, therefore, been removed as unnecessary. If a profit from the transaction would not have been liable to tax, the consideration in respect of it would not be included in gross income, and no corresponding deductions would, therefore, be allowed. The reference to the term “disposal” is, therefore, also unnecessary as its effect is inherent in the core provisions. The decision in Lyttelton v CIR 3 confirms that “disposal” is distinct from demolition: a building cannot be “disposed of” by demolition because disposal carries with it connotations of sale, assignment or transfer. Expenditure incurred by employees Subsection (1) of section DE 1 is repealed as the exclusion for expenditure in relation to income from employment is now contained in section BD 2. Section DE 1 is now titled Depreciation for asset used in employment. Group companies Section DI 4 is a new deductibility provision required as a result of separating the income and deduction compo- nents of section CK 1, relating to companies within a group and the recharacterisation of profits as assessable income. Section CK 1 treated the profit of a wholly- owned group of companies as if the group of companies were one company. Section DI 4 provides that when any company in a wholly-owned group derives gross income under section CK 1, a deduction is allowed for the cost relating to that gross income. The allowable deduction is matched to the year of allocation of gross income, in line with the effect of the former “profit” terminology. Expenditure of trustees New section DI 5 (Taxpayer who derives beneficiary income) denies beneficiaries deductions in relation to expenditure incurred by a trustee in deriving beneficiary income. This is not intended to change current policy. 3. HC (ChCh) 17 May 1996, at 28. The need for the section arises from the definition of “beneficiary income” as gross income derived by the trustee to the extent that it is vested in or paid to beneficiaries. The new section is intended to remove any doubt on the point. New section DI 6 (Expenditure incurred by trustee) ensures that the deduction is available to the trustee (see also the commentary under Subpart HH). Bad debts, share losses, indemnities Under paragraph (b) of section DJ 1 a share loss deduction is denied if the benefit of the loss has already been taken under the grouping rules - a loss in this sense does not fit within the global/gross approach. This has been dealt with by referring to a decline in the value of the shares and by differentiating between unrealised and realised losses. The latter are expressed as being where gross income in respect of the shares is less than the deduction (if any) allowed for the cost of the shares. Irrecoverable book debts Deductions under section DJ 2 (Deduction from estate income of irrecoverable book debts) were previously allowed first against trustee income and any balance against certain income of a beneficiary. The net schedular aspect of the section has been removed by placing the emphasis on the person obtaining the deduction, rather than on an offset against particular income. Gifts of money The amount of the deduction for charitable donations by companies under section DJ 4 (Gifts of money by companies not closely held) was formerly based in part on the assessable income of the company. The reference to assessable income has been changed to net income, which clarifies the previous treatment. Patent expenses Some minor drafting changes have been made to section DJ 6 in addition to consequential changes to the section. As the section could apply both before and after the 1997-98 income year, paragraph (b) refers to “gross income or assessable income”. Cost of revenue account property New section DJ 13 has been inserted as part of the separation of the following sections into their income, deductions and timing components: Consequential amendments to Part D - Deductions Further Defined continued on page 16 •section CD 1 (Land transactions) •section CD 4 (Personal property) •section CE 3 (Commercial bills) •section CJ 1 (Income from minerals, timber or flax). Section DJ 13 deals with the deductibility of expendi- ture on “revenue account property”, which is defined in section OB 1 as “property... in respect of which any amount derived on disposition would be gross income”. Rather than allowing a specific deduction, section DJ 13 ensures that deductibility is not excluded by reason of the prohibition on expenditure of a capital nature under section BD 2 (2)(e). Deductibility of the cost of revenue account property is, therefore, provided for by a combi- nation of sections BD 2 (1)(b) (the general deductibility provision) and DJ 13. There has been some concern about whether the treat- ment of the cost of minerals has been affected. Inland Revenue’s policy as set out in Chapter 19 of our old series Technical Rulings is not intended to be affected by the Core Provisions Act. Other deductions for revenue account property New sections DJ 14 to DJ 16 and section DL 1 deal with other deductions in relation to revenue account property. They are intended to preserve existing deductions in respect of certain land transactions, dispositions of personal property, commercial bills and timber. Section DJ 14 (Expenditure on acquiring land) provides a deduction, limited to the amount of profit, if amounts are brought into tax in respect of the sale of land because of profit being attributable to zoning changes. The corresponding gross income section is CD 1 (2)(e). Subsection (3) of section DJ 14 deals with the amount that is allowed as a deduction in relation to development work of other than a minor nature. Section CD 1 (2)(g) corresponds. It preserves the deduction for market value of the land at the time of the commencement of the undertaking of the scheme by deeming there to have been a sale to an unrelated third party, and reacquisition, at market value. Section DJ 15 (Expenditure incurred in acquiring personal property) preserves the deduction for market value in respect of undertakings or schemes to which the third limb of section CD 4 (profit making undertak- ings or schemes) applies. Section DJ 16 (Expenditure incurred in acquiring commercial bills) determines the amount of the deduc- tion allowed in respect of the acquisition of a commer- cial bill from another person. The deemed acquisition cost is the value on the date of disposition. Consistently with the changes to section CB 4 (1)(k), noted above, section DJ 17 (Non-profit bodies) converts the $1,000 exemption for non-profit bodies previously provided for in section CB 4 (1)(k) to an allowable deduction of the lesser of $1,000 or a non-profit body’s net income. The reference to net income clarifies existing policy. Deductions for life insurers New sections DK 3 to DK 3E, relating to life insurers, contain the deduction provisions which correspond to the income provisions in Subpart CM and are required as a result of removing the schedular nature of the life insurance regime. Forestry expenditure Section DL 1 (Cost of timber) contains the deductibility provisions relating to forestry expenditure. These include the deduction for planting and maintaining trees, the specific deductions for overheads, weed and pest control under subsection (3), the deduction for access tracks and the restrictions on deductibility for cost of timber if timber is sold to an associated person. They do not include the deduction for cost of timber itself, which is provided in the deduction for cost of revenue account property in section DJ 13. Petroleum mining expenditure The petroleum mining regime had some schedular aspects relating to deferred deductions on seal and abandonment and to sales to associated persons. Minor changes have been made to section DM 1 (Treatment of petroleum mining exploration and development ex- penditure) to conform with the global/gross approach. Mineral mining expenditure Subpart DN, which related to mineral mining expendi- ture, is repealed and replaced as significant drafting changes to the regime were necessary, primarily to bring it into line with the global/gross approach. The changes are intended to preserve existing policy. The main features of the new Subpart are: •Because of the overriding effect of the core provisions, provisions that treat the mineral mining regime as a code, or as overriding the rest of the Act, such as the former sections DN 1 (1) and (3), have been repealed. •The former section DN 1 (5)(a) provided that mining expenditure was deductible first against mining income and then to the extent of two-thirds against other income. The subsection is replaced with a new provision providing that if a mining company has allowable deductions that exceed its gross income from mining, it may include those deductions in its annual allowable deductions only to the extent that they do not exceed the lesser of: –two-thirds of the “mining outgoing excess” (defined in section OB 1 to mean expenditure relating to mining, less mining income); and from page 15 –the company’s gross income other than from mining, less allowable deductions incurred in deriving that gross income. •Under the global/gross approach, the former section DN 1 (5)(b), dealing with non-mining expenditure and the order of offset, was considered unnecessary given that there is no limit on the amount that can be deducted. This provision has, therefore, been re- moved. •Paragraphs (a) and (b) of section DN 1 (17), which give the Commissioner certain powers to deal with the situation where an offset against either mining or non-mining income places the taxpayer at a disadvan- tage, are repealed as they relate to the time when there were differential rates of tax for mining and non- mining income. •Section DN 2 deals with amounts from the sale of mining shares. The section has been redrafted to remove the reference to profits, in line with the global/gross approach. •Changes in section DN 4 to the treatment of a mining outgoing excess for a resident mining operator follow those in section DN 1 for mining companies. Attributed foreign losses and foreign investment fund losses A new subpart DP has been inserted to allow a deduc- tion in the year incurred for attributed foreign losses and foreign investment fund losses. Under section DP 1 a person is allowed a deduction for an attributed foreign loss of the lesser of the loss or the total of the following, arising from the same jurisdiction as the loss: •any attributed foreign income •any foreign investment fund income calculated under the branch equivalent method. Section DP 2 applies to a foreign investment fund loss calculated other than under the branch equivalent method. The loss is allowed as a deduction to the extent that it does not exceed the total of: •any foreign investment fund income calculated other than under the branch equivalent method •the excess of the loss over that income to the extent that the excess does not exceed the total of that income derived by the person in any previous income years. Section DP 3 provides that section DP 1 applies with certain modifications to a foreign investment fund loss calculated under the branch equivalent method. These new sections replicate the current treatment of attributed foreign losses and foreign investment fund losses in Part I (treatment of net losses). However, they clarify that the offset is in effect against a gross amount of income. If the loss is not fully absorbed it can be carried forward and dealt with according to Part I as either an “attrib- uted foreign net loss” or a “foreign investment fund net loss” (both defined in section OB 1). continued on page 18 Consequential amendments to Part E - Timing of Income and Deductions Throughout the Act, references to “apportion” and “attribute” are changed to “allocate” where they are used in a timing sense (see section EB 2 (1), for exam- ple). The use of the word “allocate” follows the new general timing rule in section BD 3 of the core provi- sions. Also, references to “any income year” when referring to gross income have been omitted where timing is not a factor. Further, the words “in calculating the assessable income derived \[by a company\] in any income year” have been omitted, because under the core provisions an allowable deduction will be allocated to an income year and included in annual allowable deductions. It is the amount of annual allowable deduc- tions which is subtracted from annual gross income (see section EG 1, for example). Income credited in account or otherwise dealt with Subpart EB sets out how gross income received in advance or in anticipation is to be allocated to an income year. Section EB 1 (Amounts credited in account or otherwise dealt with) now applies the derivation rules to generic “amounts” instead of “in- come”. This change in terminology is not intended to change policy but is consistent with the use of a generic concept of “income” under the previous section EB 1. Consequences of change in accounting practice Section EC 1 (Adjustment for incorrect accounting practice in previous years) has been substantially redrafted. Previously, section EC 1 applied to assessable income from a business. This is inconsistent with the global/gross approach, in which all sources of income for a particular year are aggregated for tax purposes. In essence, the section as redrafted gives the Commissioner power to adjust the gross income or allowable deduc- tions of a taxpayer from a business. Moreover, if an adjustment made by the Commissioner results in an increase in net income of $1,000 or more, the taxpayer has the ability under section EC 1 (4) to elect that the amount of the adjustment be allocated equally between that year of adjustment and the three subsequent (or preceding) years. The amount so allocated is deemed to be gross income derived in those years. Trading stock Section EE 1 (Valuation of trading stock, including livestock) has been amended to separate out the income and deduction components of the trading stock regime. Section EE 1 (8) includes the value of a taxpayer’s trading stock at the end of an income year in gross income. Section EE 1 (9) provides that the opening value of the taxpayer’s trading stock is allowed as a deduction for that income year. Accrual expenditure Section EF 1 (Accrual expenditure) is amended by replacing subsections (1) and (2) with a new subsection (1) using the new core provision terminology. It pro- vides that if a person has incurred accrual expenditure, that expenditure is allowed as a deduction and the unexpired portion of that expenditure is included in gross income of the person for that income year. The amount of that unexpired portion will then be allowed as a deduction in the next income year. Matching provision The assessability provisions (including sections CD 1, CD 3 and CD 4 have been amended to apply explicitly to gross items rather than to “profits or gains” from a business or from property transactions. An allowable deduction is separately authorised for the cost of the property under sections DJ 13 and BD 2. This has necessitated the insertion of an explicit matching requirement for dispositions of revenue account prop- erty. Section EF 2 (Matching regime for cost of revenue account property) requires deductions for the cost of certain revenue account property to be deferred until the later of: •the year of disposition of the property; or •the year gross income is derived from the disposition of the property. If the gross income from the disposition is derived in more than one income year, the corresponding allow- able deductions must be proportionately allocated to each of those years. Each year’s allocation of allowable deductions is based on the “proportion of the allowable deduction which the gross income derived in that income year represents as a proportion of the total gross income in respect of the disposition” (section EF 2 (3)). If that total gross income cannot be identified with certainty, subsection EF 2 (4) requires the allocation to be on the basis of what the taxpayer “reasonably expects to derive from the disposition”. This change enables taxpayers to calculate their income tax liability (and file a return accordingly) on the basis of a reasonable estimate. Section BD 4 ensures, however, that the total allowable deductions do not exceed the amount of expenditure incurred. Without an explicit matching requirement, the legisla- tion would, on the face of it, allow taxpayers to deduct the cost of revenue account property at the time of purchase rather than at the time of sale. This would produce a mis-match between the expenditure incurred and the income to which it relates. The insertion of section EF 2 is not considered to be a policy change, however, as various decisions of the courts have re- quired such matching. In Murray Darnill Ltd v TRA (No 2) 1994 16 NZTC 11, 126 and Garwen Holdings Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,396, the courts inter- preted the Act as requiring taxpayers to match their expenditure with the consideration derived from property transactions by adopting a common law trading stock approach. Further, the accrual expenditure rule in section EF 1 was applied to a land transaction in Thornton Estates Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,230. Section EF 2 will not apply to property held on revenue account that is subject to the trading stock rules, the accrual expenditure rules, the accrual rules applying to financial arrangements, or the specified lease rules. Depreciation Depreciation deductions are now “deductions allowed on account of depreciation” (see sections EG 1, EG 3, EG 11 and EG 12). Section EG 15 (4)(a) (Additional depreciation in respect of certain new assets acquired of improvements made between 16 December 1991 and 1 April 1994) is amended for consistency with amendments to Subpart CB relating to exempt income. Financial arrangements The changes made to this Subpart mostly involve re- terming “income” as “gross income” to make the Subpart consistent with core provision terminology. Section EH 6 (Post facto adjustment) has been amended so that a taxpayer’s “income tax liability” rather than the “assessable income derived or loss incurred” is recalculated (taking into account the substituted amounts of gross income or expenditure from the post facto adjustment). Under subsection (5) the Commis- sioner has the right to reassess the taxpayer’s “income tax liability”. Section EH 9 (f) (Application of accruals rules) has been amended so that interest is payable in relation to the “income tax liability”, not the “tax on income” of the taxpayer. Under the core provisions, taxpayers have an income tax liability in respect of their taxable income. Where the term “income tax payable” (or “tax on income”) is used in this context it has been changed to “income tax liability” for consistency with the core provisions. However, where the term refers directly to an obligation to pay income taxes (including withhold- ing taxes) no change has been made. from page 17 Income equalisation The phrase “without taking into account the value of trading stock at the beginning or at the end of that accounting year, and before the allowance of any deductions under this Act” in section EI 17 (4) is redundant as gross income, by definition, does not include deductions allowed. Spreading of farm income Significant amendments have been made to section EJ 1 (Spreading of income derived from sale or other disposi- tion of timber) to ensure that if a taxpayer spreads back the gross income derived from the sale or other disposi- tion of timber over previous years, the same proportion- ate amount of the cost of the timber is spread back as well. This approach is similar to that employed in sections EF 2 (3) (Matching regime for cost of revenue account property), EN 2 (3A) (Sums received from sale of patent rights) and EN 4 (2) (Spreading of gross income derived and allowable deductions incurred on acquisition of land by Crown). Livestock The reference to “income derived” in section EL 1 (2)(b) (Valuation of livestock generally) is re- placed with “gross income derived”. Bloodstock Significant changes have been made to section EM 3 (Replacement breeding stock) to improve consistency with the core provisions. For example, the term “assess- able gain” has been replaced by the term “net gain”, and definitions of “gross proceeds”, “net gain” and “value of breeding stock” have been added to section OB 1. In addition, references to the inclusion of a net amount in gross income have been changed. The changes are of a drafting nature only and are not intended to affect the application of the section. Other gross income The reference in section EN 4 (1) (Spreading of gross income derived and allowable deductions incurred on acquisition of land by Crown) to the “payment of all income tax that is or may become payable” is no longer appropriate and has been changed to “satisfaction of all income tax liabilities that have arisen or may arise”. The terminology for recognition of tax paid has been changed generally so that an income tax liability is “satisfied” which is consistent with section BC 9 of core provisions. Section EN 4 has been changed substantially along the same lines as section EJ 1 (Spreading of gross income derived and allowable deductions incurred from sale or other disposition of timber) as discussed above. Foreign source income Section EP 1 (Option to use foreign tax balance date) has been substantially amended for consistency with the global/gross approach. This has involved clarifying that the election under subsection (1) applies to both foreign source income and foreign expenditure (being expendi- ture incurred in deriving that foreign source income). In addition, clarification of the limit applying to the election in section EP 1 (8) has been undertaken. The $100,000 threshold is calculated on the following basis: “if...the taxpayer’s net income for the year, but for this subsection, would exceed $100,000 if the only gross income of the taxpayer were foreign source income”. This wording retains the former inclusion of allowable deductions in respect of domestic expenditure relating to that gross income in the calculation of the $100,000 threshold. Apportionment Section FB 1 (Apportionment of expenditure or loss) is repealed as it relates to the time when there were differential rates of tax for dividends and other forms of income. It consequently no longer has any practical effect. Recharacterisation Section FC 3 (Dividend from share dealing) reflects a net schedular concept of income and has been signifi- cantly redrafted to create consistency with the global/gross approach. Assignments of income No change has been made to section FC 11. This section refers to a generic concept of income which would be inappropriately restricted if described as gross or net income. Consolidation The references to “attributed foreign income” and “foreign investment fund income” in section FD 2 (Interpretation) have been removed as they are implicit in the term gross income. References to “attributed foreign loss” and “foreign investment fund loss” are Consequential amendments to Part F - Apportionment and recharacterised transactions continued on page 20 replaced with “attributed foreign net loss” and “foreign investment fund net loss”. References to “loss” are replaced with references to “net loss” where appropriate. The term “profit or gain” in section FD 10, dealing with transfers within a consolidated group, has been replaced with “gross income”. The deduction inherent in the term “profit or gain” is allowed under the new general deductibility provision, section BD 2 (1)(b)(i) and (ii). It was, therefore, considered that a separate deductibility provision was unnecessary. Amalgamation In section FE 4 (Amalgamated company to assume unexpired accrual expenditure, and gross income of amalgamating company), the term “profit or gain” is replaced by the term “amount”, the latter being a gross concept. Again, deductions inherent in the term “profit or gain” are provided by the new core general deduct- ibility provision, section BD 2 (1)(b)(i) and (ii), so a separate deductibility rule is not necessary. Thin capitalisation Sections FG 3, 4 (2) and 8, containing the new thin capitalisation rules, have been consequentially amended to make them consistent with the core provisions. from page 19 Consequential amendments to Part G - Avoidance and non-market transactions Avoidance - general References to income in the detailed part of the general anti-avoidance provision, section GB 1 (Agreements purporting to alter incidence of tax to be void), have been changed to references to gross income, allowable deductions and net losses, as appropriate. This is not intended to change the ambit of the section. Section GB 1 should be read with section BG 1 of the core provisions, which provides for the voiding of tax avoidance arrangements and the Commissioner’s power to counteract such arrangements. The previous section BB 9 has partially been replaced with a definition of “tax avoidance arrangement”. Tax avoidance arrangement means: “an arrangement, whether entered into by the person affected by the arrangement or by another person, that directly or indirectly- (a)Has tax avoidance as its purpose or effect; or (b)Has tax avoidance as one of its purposes or effects, whether or not any other purpose or effect is referable to ordinary business or family dealings, if the purpose or effect is not merely incidental:” The minor changes to existing wording are drafting changes only and are not intended to affect the existing interpretation. The definition of “tax avoidance” in section OB 1 has not been materially altered. Avoidance - specific Section GC 19 (c), which provides for the general anti- avoidance provision to apply to resident withholding tax, has been amended to make it consistent with the amended section GB 1. Non-market transactions Consequential changes to section GD 3 (1), dealing with excessive remuneration to relatives, have been kept to a minimum as the section is largely concerned with generic items of profit, income or loss. GD 10 (2) now provides that section GD 10 (Leases for inadequate rent) applies with respect to any leased property only and to the extent that it is used by the lessee in the derivation of gross income or exempt income. The previous reference was to “income” which could encompass both types of income. New section GD 13, containing the new transfer pricing rules, was inserted by the Income Tax Act 1994 Amend- ment Act (No 3) 1995. Consequential changes have been made to the section, so that it is consistent with the new core provisions terminology. continued on page 22 Consequential amendments to Part H - Treatment of net income of certain entities Consolidated groups of companies Section HB 1 (d) (Returns, assessments, and liability of consolidated group) is amended to refer to the taxable income of the companies in a consolidated group for an income year as if the companies were a single taxpayer. This change was necessary as the core provisions refer only to single taxpayers. In section HB 2, also relating to consolidated groups, the term “relevant period” is deemed to be an income year for the purposes of the section, to enable the terms “gross income”, “amount” and “taxable income”, which relate to an income year, to be used. Special partnerships The special partnership regime is schedular in nature. This has been dealt with in the Subpart by creating three new terms - “partnership gross income”, “partner- ship net income” and “partnership loss”, defined in section HC 1 (12). The latter two definitions refer to net income or a net loss as if the partnership were a tax- payer resident in New Zealand. Section HC 1 (2) provides that if a special partnership sustains a partnership loss, no deduction will be allowed to any partner for any outgoing of the partnership and the partnership gross income will be deemed not to have been derived by the partners. Instead, in line with the original intention to treat special partnership losses as company losses, the loss may be carried forward by the special partnership to be offset against partnership net income in accordance with section HC 1 (3) to (5). If a partnership loss is so offset against partnership net income, section HC 1 (6) allows each of the special partners a deduction of an amount equal to each part- ner’s share of the partnership loss. This deduction is intended to be offset against the proportion of the income included in each partner’s gross income so that the quarantining is removed to the extent that the partners have income from the partnership against which to offset the loss. Partnerships Section HD 1 (Assessment of partners, co-trustees, and joint venturers) prescribes the process for calculating income tax liabilities of taxpayers deriving or incurring amounts jointly. Paragraph (b) relating to partnerships refers only to gross income and not allowable deduc- tions of the partnership. This is intended to avoid any perceived implications that partnerships and similar bodies are tax entities in their own right. In line with the Court of Appeal’s decision in the Hadlee case 4 , only taxpayers can obtain deductions, and the allowable deductions are those of the individual partner, not of the firm. The practice of partnerships filing returns of net 4. Hadlee & Sydney Bridge Nominees Ltd v CIR (1991) 13 NZTC 8116. amounts is not intended to be changed, however. This is dealt with more specifically in the changes to section 42 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Unit trusts Under section HE 2, group investment funds were required to file separate returns in respect of their category A income and category B income. This re- quirement is reflected in the amended section. The previous section also imposed the liability to tax in respect of each type of income. This schedular aspect is now dealt with in section BC 3, which requires group investment funds to calculate separate liabilities in respect of category A income and category B income and add those liabilities together to calculate a single income tax liability. Mutual associations The rules relating to mutual associations provided that rebates paid by mutual associations to members in respect of member transactions were deducted from the profit from member transactions, to the extent of that profit. The amount of the deduction for an income year is now expressed in a formula as the lesser of: •the rebates paid by the association in the year in respect of member transactions •gross income from member transactions less deduc- tions relating to that gross income and distributions in accordance with section ME 35 (1)(a) (cash distribu- tions with imputation credits attached). There was some ambiguity as to whether “profit” meant a taxation concept of profit or accounting profit. The clarification in favour of a taxation concept of profit was based on the underlying purpose of section HF 1 (Profits of mutual associations in respect of transactions with members) to allow the imputing to members of that part of an association’s assessable income arising from member transactions that is distributed to members by way of rebate. It is consistent with that purpose to interpret profit as a tax concept. Trusts Subpart HH for the most part refers to gross income derived by a trustee that is categorised as trustee income or beneficiary income. Pivotal to the trust regime are the definitions in section OB 1 of “trustee income” and “beneficiary income”. “Beneficiary income” is broadly defined as gross income derived by a trustee of a trust to the extent that it is vested in the beneficiary or is paid or applied within 6 months after the income year for the beneficiary’s benefit. The words “to the extent that” are intended to reflect that deductions may be taken by the trustee. The definition has also been amended to include amounts that vest to a beneficiary that would have been gross income of the trustee if any settlor of the trust had been resident in New Zealand. This change was necessary as, since gross income excludes amounts derived by non-residents (under section BD 1 (2)(c)), the definition of beneficiary income may otherwise have become narrowed as a result of the global/gross approach. The change makes it clear, for example, that resident beneficiaries of a foreign trust (one for which no settlor is resident at any time in New Zealand) can still derive beneficiary income, even though the income is not gross income for New Zealand purposes. “Trustee income” is defined as gross income derived by the trustee of a trust that does not vest in the beneficiary or is not paid or applied for the benefit of a beneficiary within 6 months after the end of the income year. The change from the previous definition (which referred merely to income that was not beneficiary income) was necessary because of the change to the definition of beneficiary income required as a result of the global/gross approach as described above. As a consequence of treating all income derived by a trustee at the gross level, two new provisions (sections DI 5 and 6, discussed above) further clarify that deduc- tions are to be taken by the trustee rather than the beneficiary, regardless of whether the corresponding income is trustee or beneficiary income. The following example compares the pre- and post-core provisions treatment for a trustee who distributes net rental income to a beneficiary. Example Pre 1997-98 treatment Revenue Non-taxable gain from the sale of shares$3,000 Rental income$5,000 Interest$2,000 Dividends$2,000 $12,000 Expenses Accounting fees$1,000 Property costs$2,000 Legal fees (lease renewals)$1,000 $ 4,000 Net profit$ 8,000 Adjustments Non-taxable gain from the sale of shares$3,000 $5,000 Beneficiary income$2,000 Trustee income$3,000 Global/gross approach from 1997-98 Gross income derived by the trustee Rent$5,000 Dividends$2,000 Interest$2,000 $9,000 less beneficiary income$2,000 Annual gross income of trustee$7,000 Allowable deductions Accounting fees$1,000 Property costs$1,000 Legal fees (lease renewals)$1,000 Annual allowable deductions of trustee$4,000 Net income of trustee$3,000 Calculation of beneficiary income (for both methods) Rent$5,000 less property costs$2,000 less legal fees$1,000 $3,000 $2,000 Under the settlor regime, section HH 4 brings certain non-resident trustees deriving foreign-sourced income into the New Zealand tax net. The section has been amended to treat this type of income as gross income. This was necessary because such income is excluded from gross income under the core provisions (section BD 1 (2)(c)). New section HH 4 (3A) ensures the retention of the treatment of non-resident trustees of a trust with a New Zealand resident settlor relating to foreign tax credits, financial arrangements, foreign investment fund income, attributed foreign income and BETA accounts. New section HH 4 (3B) is intended to retain the treat- ment of foreign-sourced amounts of a trust with no New Zealand-resident settlor by providing that these amounts are not gross income. Subsection (2) of section HH 5, relating to the cost base for trustees of trusts who in that capacity are new taxpayers, is repealed. That subsection excluded exist- ing trusts which had no income or made losses from the cost base rules. As the test in subsection (1) is whether or not gross income was derived before the relevant date, it was no longer necessary to exclude such trusts. As mentioned above, this Subpart generally refers to gross income derived by a trustee. However, there are two exceptions: •The income tax liability of the trustee is expressed as being in respect of the taxable income of the trustee, as is required by section BC 8 of core provisions. •Generic references to income have been retained in the ordering rules (section HH 6) as these references would be inappropriately restricted if described as gross or net income. from page 21 Amendments have also been made to the definition of “qualifying trust”. The former focus of the definition was on income derived by the trustee of a trust where that income has been liable to New Zealand income tax. Consistently with the core provisions, the focus of the definition is now on whether or not gross income has been derived. The amended definition is also intended to ensure that a foreign trust cannot be a qualifying trust under the global/gross approach. Maori authorities Section HI 2 in effect provided, with certain exceptions, that the Maori Authority regime was a code. As it is inconsistent with the global/gross approach to have independent codes within the legislation, section HI 2 (Maori authorities and Maori) has been repealed. The specific exclusions from former section HI 2 were in relation to the application of section GC 14 (essentially an anti-avoidance provision applying to distributions to beneficiaries), and sections HH 3 and HH 4 (the trust rules regarding trustee and beneficiary income). These sections have been specifically amended to make it clear they do not apply to Maori authorities or any Maori to whom Subpart HI applies 5 . The legislation, in relation to Maori authorities with more than 20 beneficiaries (section HI 3), taxed undistributed income rather than taxable income. The difference between the two concepts is that undistributed income is the amount remaining after 5. See sections GC 14 (2), HH 3 (6), and HH 4 (8). deducting distributed income from net income. Taxable income is defined in section BC 7 to mean net income less available net losses. The redrafted section HI 3 taxes Maori authorities on taxable income, but with an allowable deduction for distributed income, and makes it clear that the net income of a Maori authority is determined after, rather than before deduction of distributions. Agency Under section HK 1 (Agent to make returns and be assessed as principal), agents are deemed to be separate taxpayers with respect to the income of each principal for which the agency applies. This means that a separate calculation of income tax liability must be made for each agency. The retention of the term “income” reflects the fact that agencies will not generally be restricted to gross in- come. Section HK 15 (Recovery of tax payable in respect of alimony or maintenance) is repealed because alimony payments have been exempt from income tax since 1939. The reference to “income” in section HK 26 (Agents in New Zealand of principals resident abroad) has not been changed as the section is concerned with amounts which might not otherwise fall within the New Zealand tax net, and would not, therefore, be included within “gross income”. Consequential amendments to Part I - Treatment of net losses The former Part I has been replaced with a new Part I because of the substantial number of changes required to the Part. The previous section numbers have been largely retained. Like its predecessor, the new Part I deals with with- drawal tax as well as net losses. As withdrawal tax is a terminating regime, the withdrawal tax provisions have been relocated (with consequential changes for consist- ency with core provisions) to Subpart IZ. The charging section (section ID 2) has been amended so that with- drawal tax is imposed in core provisions (section BF 1 (c)). Part I has been renamed “Treatment of net losses”. Subpart IB, containing administrative provisions, has been removed. The effect of sections IB 1 (Basic rates of tax) and IB 4 (Change of return date) is contained in the definition of “applicable tax rate” as used in the core provisions and the Tax Administration Act 1994. The effect of sections IB 2 and IB 3 (Income derived by non-resident mining operators) is contained in the definition of “schedular gross income” and section BC 3 of the core provisions. Subpart IC (Pay-period taxpayers) has also been re- moved. The effect of Subpart IC is contained in section 33A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (Annual income tax returns not required from taxpayers) and in section BC 2 of the core provisions (Non-filing tax- payer). “Pay period taxpayers” are now referred to as “taxpayers to whom section 33A of the Tax Administra- tion Act applies”. Section OB 4 (Meaning of “pay period taxpayer”) was consequentially repealed by the Income Tax Act 1994 Amendment Act 1995. In Part I the term “net loss” has been adopted to encom- pass all instances where the result of the net income calculation is a negative figure. Further, this Part refers to “the net loss of \[a taxpayer\]” and “offset against net income”. As well as any net loss arising from the global/gross calculation if annual allowable deductions exceed annual gross income, net losses include losses from specified activities, mineral mining losses and policy- holder losses of life insurers. They also include attrib- uted foreign losses and foreign investment fund losses to the extent that they cannot be taken as a deduction continued on page 24 under the new Subpart DP in the year of incurrence. Subject to the specific rules under a particular regime, the key general provisions in the Part (section IE 1 (the loss carry-forward provision), section IF 1 (the continu- ity rules) and section IG 2 (the grouping provision)) apply to all such losses. Subpart IE - Net losses New section IE 1 (3) (Net losses may be offset against future net income) replaces the former subsection (4), which dealt with the ordering of losses. It clarifies that it is the sum of net losses (in the core provisions re- ferred to as “available net losses”) that cannot exceed net income. Section IE 2 deals with losses from specified activities. The aspects of the regime dealing with the incurrence of the losses are repealed as they are of historical signifi- cance only. “Specified activity net income” and “speci- fied activity net loss” have been defined in subsection (8) as hypothetical calculations of net income or net loss in relation to a specified activity. Sections IE 3 and IE 4 (Attributed foreign net losses and Foreign investment fund net losses) have been significantly amended to ensure that, whilst retaining the existing policy, the treatment of attributed foreign losses and foreign investment fund losses is consistent with the global/gross approach. If the balance of an attributed foreign loss or a foreign investment fund loss has been carried forward from the year of incurrence under new sections DP 1, DP 2, and DP 3 (see above), the maximum amount that can be offset against net income is determined by reference to gross amounts of attributed foreign income or foreign investment fund income as the case may be. Subsections IE 3 (5) and IE 4 (6) provide that if there is insufficient net income to offset the attributed foreign net loss or foreign investment fund net loss, any excess becomes a net loss and ceases to be an attributed foreign net loss or foreign investment fund net loss. This will ensure that any further offset of the excess will not be subject to ring-fencing. This maintains the effect of existing policy whereby attributed foreign and foreign investment fund losses are directly offset against the relevant foreign-sourced income. The following example shows the previous treatment of an attributed foreign loss and the new treatment of the same loss under the new global/gross approach: Previous treatment Year 1 Attributed foreign income$3,000 less attributed foreign loss($6,000) Attributed foreign loss to carry forward($3,000) (ring-fenced) Other income $1,000 less deductions($1,000) Net incomenil Year 2 Attributed foreign income$2,000 Less attributed foreign loss c/forward($3,000) Attributed foreign loss to carry forward($1,000) (ring-fenced) Other income$2,000 less deductions($3,000) Loss to carry forward (not ring-fenced)($1,000) Year 3 Attributed foreign income$2,000 Less attributed foreign loss c/forward($1,000) Attributed foreign income$1,000 Other income$2,000 less deductions($1,000) Other assessable income$1,000 Less loss carried forward($1,000) nil Global/gross treatment Year 1 Attributed foreign income $3,000 Other gross income $1,000 Annual gross income $4,000 Annual allowable deductions($4,000) (incl. $3,000 attributed foreign loss) Net income nil Year 2 Attributed foreign income $2,000 Other gross income $2,000 Annual gross income $4,000 Annual allowable deductions($3,000) Net income$1,000 Maximum attr. foreign net loss for offset($2,000) Loss to carry forward (not ring-fenced)($1,000) Attr. foreign net loss to carry forward($1,000) (ring-fenced) Year 3 Attributed foreign income$2,000 Other gross income$2,000 Annual gross income$4,000 Annual allowable deductions($1,000) Net income$3,000 Less max. attr. foreign net loss for offset($1,000) Less loss carried forward($1,000) Taxable income$1,000 Subpart IF - Losses - companies Some sections (for example, sections IF 1 (4) and IF 4 (d) (Net losses may be offset against future in- come)) refer to the portion of assessable income which is derived during a part of an income year. This termi- nology is changed generally to “the net income which is attributable to that part of the income year”. The changes to section IG 2 (Net loss offset between group companies) include the removal of subsection from page 23 (1)(a), which provided for losses to be ascertained in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The subsec- tion was unnecessary as the core provisions provide for the application of Part I. Subsection (1)(c) has also been removed, as noted above, as the core provisions provide a corresponding treatment for profits and losses. In subsections (2)(h)-(j), the treatment of group loss offsets or subvention payments as assessable income to the loss company and a deduction to the profit company has been changed to, respectively, a reduction in available net losses to the loss company and an offset against net income of the profit company. This is in line with the approach in the core provisions to offset net losses only after net income is determined. Other amendments made to section IG 2 are consistent with this approach. Subsection (6) of section IG 2 deals with, among other things, losses from the sale or valuation of shares. The provision is amended, in the case of a disposal of shares, to refer to gross income from the disposal being less than the allowable deduction for the cost of the shares. Sections IG 4 (Group of companies attributed foreign net losses) and IG 5 (Group of companies foreign investment fund net losses) specify the amount able to be offset by another company and modify the applica- tion of section IG 2, primarily to reflect the quarantin- ing of such losses. Subpart IH - Losses - miners and petroleum miners Substantial drafting changes have been made in Subpart IH because of the complex and schedular nature of the mining loss rules. Again the intention is to retain existing policy. Section IH 1 (Losses of mining companies and petro- leum miners) deals with the offset of mining losses against particular sources of income. Amendments are made, as noted above, using terminology such as “the amount that would be the net income of the company if its sole source of income was from that licence area”. In section IH 3 (Loss carry back by petroleum miners) the reference to “expenditure or deferred deductions that cannot be deducted in full” has been changed to “allow- able deductions...reduced by the amount that would otherwise be a net loss”. This has been done both for reasons of consistency with the core provisions and to improve the drafting. A mining company which is entitled to carry forward a net mining loss in accordance with sections IE 1 and IF 1 or section IH 1 must do so subject to section IH 4 (1) (Companies engaged in exploring for, search- ing for, or mining, certain minerals). Section IH 4 (1)(a) provides that the amount which may be carried forward from the year of loss may not exceed the amount of the “mining outgoing excess” in the year of loss (see the comments under Subpart DN) less 150% of the amount of that mining outgoing excess as was deducted in the year of loss under section DN 1 (3). Paragraph (1)(b) in effect, provides that the maximum amount of mining losses carried forward that can be offset against non- mining income is the lesser of: •“net non-mining income”; and •two thirds of the result of the following calculation: net mining losses carried forward less “net mining income”. The new formula reflects current policy within the global/gross context. Paragraph (c) provides a formula for determining the amount available for further carry forward. This repli- cates the effect of subsection (1)(a), which was to ensure that the carried-forward loss was reduced by 150% of the losses used. Section IH 5 (Resident mining operators) has been consequentially reworded to conform to the approach in the new section IH 4. These amendments, as well as being consistent with the global/gross approach, better reflect the accepted approach to the application of these sections regarding the adjustment of net mining losses to carry forward as a result of the offset of any net mining losses in an income year. Subpart II - Losses - life insurers Section II 2 (1A) has been replaced by a new section II 3 (Carry forward of policyholder net loss) following the Income Tax Act 1994 Amendment Act (No 4) 1995. Consequential amendments to Part K - Rebates Where classes of income are referred to, the terminology is generally changed to “gross income”. Subpart KB - General Section KB 1 is repealed, along with section BB 10, due to the insertion of the new definitions of “allowable rebates”, “surplus rebates” and “refundable rebates” . These terms are inserted to clarify which rebates may be refunded. The effect of former sections KB 1 and BB 10 meant that only KF 1 & 2 rebates could be refunded. This effect is now reflected in the way the core provisions link “allowable rebates”, “surplus rebates” and “refund- able rebates”. In addition because the Family Support tax credit is effectively treated as a refundable rebate it has been included within the meaning of the term “refundable rebate”. Subpart KC - Individual rebates The rebate provisions in Subpart KC were subject to section BB 10, which limited the amount of rebate to the amount of tax payable by the taxpayer. As section BB 10 is replaced by the core provision concepts of “allowable rebates”, “refundable rebates” and “surplus rebates” (see section BC 8), the words “subject to section BB 10” are omitted in this Part. Section KC 1 (Low income rebate) is an example of a change from “assessable income” to “net income” in this Part, on the basis that rebates are calculated on the basis of net income. Section KC 1 is also amended by inserting a formula which provides that a taxpayer who is entitled to the low income rebate will calculate the amount of that rebate by excluding from gross income any interest, dividends, royalties, rents, beneficiary income or taxable distributions. Also excluded are the corresponding allowable deductions. Under the core provisions, the transitional tax allow- ance is not a refundable rebate. Therefore it is unneces- sary to retain the criteria of paragraph (b) within the definition of eligible person as the core provisions ensure that a person with no taxable income cannot obtain any benefit from the transitional tax allowance. Subpart KD - Family Support Section KD 1 (Determination of net income) has been amended to clarify that the Family Support tax credit is based on net income or net loss as calculated under the core provisions, but subject to the specified adjustments within section KD 1. The purpose of section KD 1 (1)(f) is to ensure that if a person carries on more than one business, each business is treated separately so that there is no offsetting of losses made in one business against the income of another business. The term “assessable income” in sections KD 1 (4), KD 2 and in the definition of “specified income” in section OB 1 has been replaced with “net income”. Section KD 4 (Allowance of credit of tax in end of year assessment) has been amended to reflect the fact that the Family Support tax credit is a “refundable rebate’” under the core provisions. Section BC 10 (1) of the core provisions states that any surplus refundable rebates must be refunded to the taxpayer, subject to section KD 4. Rebates (including Family Support credits) are set off against the income tax liability of the taxpayer under section BC 8 (2) of the core provisions. Accord- ingly, section KD 4 (1) is repealed as redundant. The requirement that the taxpayer provide prescribed information and make an application to the Commis- sioner to apply an allowable Family Support tax credit against income tax payable is inserted in section 41 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (Annual returns by persons who receive a Family Support credit of tax). The issue of whether the Family Support tax credit should be renamed the “Family Support rebate” will be addressed during the rewrite of Part K. Section KD 4 (4) gives the Commissioner the power to recover excess family support credits that are paid out to taxpayers and to treat them as income tax payable. The words “under this section” were removed as the set-off Consequential amendments to Part J - Surcharges Sections in this Part which refer to income from a particular source have been changed to “gross income derived” from that source. Section JB 1 (New Zealand superannuitant surcharge provisions) is amended to ensure that the imposition of the New Zealand superannuitant surcharge liability is made in accordance with the core provisions. The amendments to specified exemption provisions (Section JB 4) mean that in certain cases the New Zealand superannuation is not treated as gross income in some parameters of the calculations. This ensures that the specified exemption is correctly calculated in a manner which is consistent with the core provisions. Section JB 3 (3) (Determination of “other income”) gives the Commissioner power to treat payments received by a superannuitant as received in a different income year in certain circumstances. The allocations formerly applied on a gross basis, so the references to “income” in this subsection have been changed to “gross income”. of credits and refund is authorised by core provisions. Nevertheless, a reference to sections KD 2 and KD 3 was added to section KD 4 (4) for clarification. The reference in section KD 5 (2) (Credit of tax by instalments) to “a complete statement of the assessable income (if any) that is expected to be derived” has been changed to a reference to the net income that is ex- pected to be “attributable”. Under the core provisions, gross income is “derived”, and allowable deductions are incurred. The word “attributable” was chosen because net income is not, by definition, “derived”. Section KD 8 provides that the Family Support tax credit is not gross income. This section has not been repealed as it is necessary to ensure that Family Support credits that take on the characteristics of “income”, namely that they are regular receipts and are treated by the recipient as income, are not treated as “gross income”. Consequential amendments have been made to section KF 1 (2) and (3) to ensure that the savings provision in section KZ 3 is consistent with the core provisions. Consequential amendments to the remaining subsec- tions in section KF 1 and to section KF 2 are not necessary given their repeal. Under the global/gross approach, credits are “set off” or “credited against” the income tax liability of a taxpayer, rather than in payment of income tax that is “payable” or that a taxpayer may be “liable for”. Changes in Part L reflect this new approach. There is no concept in the core provisions of an income tax liability arising in respect of a particular source of income. This creates a potential conflict with Part L, which refers to credits in respect of tax payable on income from a particular source or of a particular nature. For the purposes of determining credit limita- tions, taxpayers, in claiming a credit, may, therefore, be required to calculate the amount that would be their income tax liability for an income year, if their only gross income was the income for which the credit is claimed. This result is then fed back into the credit limitation rule. Subpart LB - Imputation credits - shareholders and imputation system The definition of quantity ‘c’ in section LB 1 (4) (Determination of amount of credit in certain cases) has been changed to the “gross income jointly derived by the partners of the partnership for the income year”. This ensures consistency with both the core provisions and the consequential amendments made to section HD 1. Section LB 2 (Credit of tax for imputation credit) has been substantially redrafted so that any imputation credits available to a taxpayer are credited against the income tax liability of that taxpayer, calculated in accordance with core provisions. Any excess imputation credits are converted into a net loss for the year which is then available for offset against net income in a suc- ceeding income year. Subpart LC - Foreign tax Section LC 1 (Credits in respect of tax paid in a country or territory outside New Zealand) has been amended by providing generally that persons subject to the section are able to credit foreign tax credits against their New continued on page 28 Consequential amendments to Part L - Credits Zealand income tax liability. The words “subject to this section” in former LC 1 (1) have been removed as the limitation on the maximum foreign tax credits granted is now contained in section LC 2 (see below). The new subsection LC 1 (4) provides for the calcula- tion of the maximum foreign tax credit in respect of an interest in a foreign investment fund using the formula in section LC 14. Section LC 2 (Maximum credits) is amended so that it is explicit that the maximum amount of foreign tax credit allowed shall be the amount calculated under section LC 14 (Ascertainment of New Zealand income tax liability on foreign source income). The cross- reference to section LC 14 retains the existing source by source basis for calculating foreign tax credits in a manner consistent with the core provisions. Sections LC 4 (Foreign tax credits - controlled foreign companies) and LC 5 (Group of companies controlled foreign tax credits) have been substantially redrafted to make them consistent with the core provisions. The effect of the rewording is to carry out a “side calcula- tion” of a taxpayer’s income tax liability as if the only gross income derived by the taxpayer were attributed foreign income in respect of the controlled foreign companies in question, and to calculate the credit limitation by reference to that amount. These changes are necessary because, as mentioned above, there is no concept in the core provisions of an “income tax liability” in respect of a particular source of income. In section LC 6 (Election in respect of foreign tax in dividend), a reference to “assessable income” has been retained since the double tax agreements which apply to section LC 6 make specific reference to “assessable income”, and a continued use of the term is considered necessary. The new section LC 14 provides a prescriptive approach to determining the maximum amount of tax credit that may be credited against the NZ income tax liability. It also incorporates a policy change which ensures that group tax losses do not reduce a taxpayer’s entitlement to a foreign tax credit. The general approach in section LC 14 to determining the maximum foreign tax credit examines the ratio of foreign sourced “net” income (foreign sourced gross income less applicable allowable deductions) to the net income of the taxpayer. However, where the taxpayer has losses, this general approach can give rise to distorted results and a secondary approach is necessary. The secondary approach fixes the maximum amount of credit by reference to the ratio of the tax credits for any single type or class of foreign sourced gross income calculated under the general approach to the sum of those tax credits for all types and classes.. Section LC 16 (Foreign tax credits of consolidated group members) has been amended by inserting a cross- reference to section LC 4, enabling redundant wording to be deleted. The addition of the “side calculation” used generally in this Subpart is also necessary in section LC 16 (2). Sections LD 1 (Tax deductions to be credited against tax assessed) and LD 3 (Resident withholding tax deduc- tions to be credited against income tax assessed) contain ordering rules by which tax deductions are credited against an employee’s income tax liability. A new paragraph (d) has been inserted in subsection (2) of each section since, under section BB 2 of the core provisions, a person’s income tax liability (dealt with by an amended paragraph (c)) is distinct from the person’s liability to pay provisional tax (now dealt with under paragraph (d)). The changes are not intended to alter existing policy or practice. Amendments are made to section LD 2 (Non-resident withholding tax - credit allowed) so that credits allowed for non-resident withholding tax are credited against the income tax liability of the taxpayer in a manner consist- ent with the core provisions. Similarly, section LD 7 (Provisional tax to be credited against income tax liability) is amended so that any provisional tax paid is credited against income tax liability. Section LD 6 (Allowance for provisional tax paid by agent) has been amended so that any provisional tax paid on behalf of a principal by an agent is credited to the principal’s account. Changes are made to section LD 9 (Refund to non- resident or exempt shareholders) to follow changes in the core provisions and in Subpart CB, relating to the treatment of exempt income. Subpart LE - Non-resident investors Sections LE 3 (10) and LE 3 (11) address the situation where an LE 3 holding company offsets losses and reduces its terminal tax below supplementary dividends received. These provisions ensured that the effect of the offset of losses was countered by setting a minimum terminal tax liability before taking into account Foreign Investor Tax credits and provisional tax. In effect, the result of these two provisions was that to the extent a supplementary dividend derived by an LE 3 holding company remained undistributed (generally due to the effect of loss offsets), the LE 3 holding company was required to pay to the Commissioner the undistributed amount as income tax. Under the global/gross approach, it is inappropriate to set a minimum terminal tax liability outside core provisions. Therefore sections LE 3 (10) and LE 3 (11) have been replaced by a new section LE 3 (10). This change, combined with the new section IF 7 (Offsetting supplementary dividend against net income) and the amendments to section LC 14, achieve the policy objective by restricting the amount of net loss which may be offset against net income in any income year. This approach would ensure that any undistributed supplementary dividend is repaid to the Commissioner as income tax. Consequential amendments have been made to other subsections of section LE 3 to render it consistent with core provision terminology. Section LF 7 (Interest paid in conduit financing ar- rangements) has been amended so that interest paid in conduit financing arrangements is now an “allowable deduction” in the calculation of “net income”. from page 27 Consequential amendments to Part M - Tax payments Subpart MB - Provisional tax Section MB 1 (Application of provisional tax rules) has been removed as the application of the provisional tax rules is covered by section BB 2 of the core provisions. Provisional tax is a separate obligation from an income tax liability in the core provisions. Part M previously incorporated provisional tax with general references to income tax. Where appropriate, the two concepts have been separated as part of the consequential changes (see sections MD 4, ME 9, ME 13 and ME 19, for example). Changes have also been made to Subpart MB in recog- nition of the fact that provisional tax will be credited against the income tax liability of the taxpayer rather than against the income derived by the taxpayer. In section MB 2 (5), life insurers are required to distin- guish between provisional tax paid in respect of the life insurance base income and the policyholder base income. This is because provisional tax paid on the policyholder base is attributable only to benefits accru- ing to the policyholder, whereas a life insurer can attribute provisional tax paid on the life insurance base to either the life insurance base or the policyholder base. For this reason, it remains necessary to distinguish provisional tax payments attributable to the policyholder base from other payments of provisional tax. This is achieved by requiring life insurers to identify the amount of provisional tax payable in respect of the policyholder base. The term “policyholder base” rather than the term “policyholder base income tax liability” is used because it is not possible to require taxpayers to state, at the time of payment, the extent to which provisional tax represents the policyholder base income tax liability as this liability is not known until after all provisional tax is required to be paid. Changes are made to section MB 10 (Offset of further income tax) to make the section consistent with the rewritten section ME 9 (Further tax payable where end of year debit balance). The amendments to these sections reflect the core provisions approach to treating provisional tax obligations as distinct from income tax obligations. Section MB 12 (Application of other provisions to provisional tax) illustrates a change consequential to the terminology used in section BB 1 of the core provisions. As income tax is now “imposed” many references to “tax levied” have been changed to “tax imposed”. Subpart MC - Terminal tax Section MC 1 (1) (Assessment and payment of terminal tax) is repealed as part of a general removal of all references to “general assessment”. Changes made to the remainder of section MC 1 and MC 2 (Payment of tax) use the term “terminal tax” to specify when the tax is due and payable. Subpart MD - Refunds Section MD 4 is amended to provide consistency with the distinction drawn in the core provisions between income tax obligations and provisional tax obligations. Section ME 1 (2), which outlines the types of companies that are not allowed to establish imputation credit accounts, is amended to make the terminology consist- ent with the core provisions. Section ME 4 (Credits arising to imputation credit account) outlines a number of situations where a credit does not arise to an imputation credit account for income tax paid. This section and section ME 5 (Debits arising to imputation credit account) have been signifi- cantly reworded to make them consistent with core provisions. For example, a hypothetical calculation of an income tax liability in section ME 4 (1) (a)(iv) to exclude the income tax attributable to the period before a company becomes an imputation credit account company. Sections ME 9 and ME 13 relate to further income tax payable when an imputation credit account is in debit for companies and consolidated groups. They have been amended to provide that any further income tax paid under those sections may be credited against any income tax liability that arises or any instalment of provisional tax that is payable in accordance with section MB 10. The amendments to sections ME 9 and ME 13 reflect that any amount of further income tax paid may be credited against either income tax or provisional tax obligations. This change is to provide consistency with the distinction in the core provisions between provi- sional tax obligations and income tax obligations. Sections MF 8, MF 10 and MF 13 have been signifi- cantly amended to make them consistent with the core provisions. For example, a taxpayer’s income tax liability is calculated before any foreign tax credits and rebates are deducted. In addition, changes have been made to sections MF 4 and MF 5 to ensure that the legislation relating to the BETA account of a company is consistent with the new provisions on the BETA account of a consolidated group. Consequential amendments to Part N - Withholding taxes and taxes on the income of others Subpart NF - Resident withholding tax In section NF 9 (Certificates of exemption), the $2 million resident withholding tax exemption certificate threshold is expressed as an annual gross income figure in paragraph (g) of subsection (1) and later subsections. As section CB 4 (1) (k), which relates to the exemption for non-profit bodies, is being changed to a deductibility provision in the form of section DJ 17, necessary consequential changes are made to paragraph (j) of section NF 9 (1). Subpart NG - Non-resident withholding tax Under section NG 3 (Non-resident withholding tax to be final tax in certain cases), the former reference to non- resident withholding income subject to non-resident withholding tax as a final tax being excluded from assessable income is removed. Instead, consistently with section BC 3 of the core provisions (Taxpayer with schedular gross income), section NG 3 specifies the method for calculating the income tax liability of a person with income subject to final non-resident withholding tax as the sum of the: continued on page 30 from page 29 •non-resident withholding tax in respect of that non- resident withholding income; and •the amount that would be the person’s income tax liability if the person had not derived that non- resident withholding income. The removal of the reference to the income being excluded from assessable income has necessitated two changes: •the insertion of a new subsection (2) providing that the taxpayer is not entitled to a credit against income tax liability for any imputation credit attached to the dividend; and •a prohibition on deductions in section BD 2 (2) for expenditure incurred in deriving non-resident with- holding income subject to final NRWT. Neither of these provisions is intended to change the law. The removal of the reference to non-resident withhold- ing income, to which section NG 3 relates, not being included in assessable income has also highlighted an issue about the applicability of the general anti-avoid- ance provision as now contained in sections BG 1 and GB 1. There was an argument that section NG 3 was, before the enactment of core provisions, not subject to the Commissioner’s general anti-avoidance powers because section GB 1 only gave the Commissioner power to adjust the “assessable income” of a taxpayer. The change in wording in section NG 3 removes any ambiguity that may have existed in relation to the applicability of the general anti-avoidance provision to income, to which section NG 3 applies. Accordingly, the general anti-avoidance rule applies to non-resident withholding income. The removal of the words “shall not be included in the assessable income” does not in the Inland Revenue Department’s view, represent a departure from its existing policy. Section NG 4 (Non-resident withholding tax to be minimum tax in certain cases) has been amended so that it provides a method for calculating a global/gross income tax liability for persons with non-resident withholding income for which non-resident withholding tax is not a final tax. The formula is the greater of: •the sum of: –all non-resident withholding tax for which the person is liable; and –the amount that would be the person’s income tax liability if the person had not derived any non-resident withholding income •the amount that would but for the application of the section be the income tax liability of the person. Consequential amendments to Part O - Definitions and related matters Subpart OB - General definitions A considerable number of new definitions have been added to section OB 1, and a large number of previously existing definitions amended for consistency with the core provisions. Some of the new definitions do no more than refer to the section in the core provisions that describe the substance of the relevant items. For example, “net income” means met income for an income year deter- mined under section BC 6. The more significant new or amended definitions have been discussed above under the relevant Parts. Other definitions to note are: Applicable basic tax rate This is a new definition which is used in the core provisions relating to the calculation of a taxpayer’s income tax liability. The definition has the effect of apportioning the relevant tax rate on a pro rata basis when a return of income covers a period greater or less than 12 months. Eligible company/qualifying amalgamation Reference to companies whose income is exempt under section CB 10 is added to paragraph (b). This ensures that companies whose sole income is from dividends which are subject to dividend withholding payment, and inter-corporate dividends, are not excluded from the consolidation/amalgamation regimes. This was the intention of those regimes. “Qualifying company” - section OB 3 In paragraph (d)(i) a reference to “assessable income” is changed to “gross income”. The change reflects the original policy intent of the legislation to treat the $10,000 limitation in respect of foreign non-dividend income as a gross amount. The definition of “foreign non-dividend income” has been amended accordingly. Consequential amendments to Part Y - Amendments, repeals, savings and transitional provisions As also mentioned above, the former section AA 1 (2) has been retained as section YB 4 (3), to clarify that the re-ordering of the 1976 Act, and minor wording changes effected by the Income Tax Act 1994 (as enacted on 23 December 1994) are not intended to affect the interpretation of the Act. This section will continue to apply to provisions that have not been amended by legislation subsequent to the enactment of the 1994 Act. In the case of income years preceding the 1997-98 income year, the 1994 Act (or the 1976 Act as the case may be) will apply. Accordingly, it has not been neces- sary to “save” the old terminology for prior income years. The new section YB 4 (4) provides that the changes in style and language carried out by the Taxation Core Provisions Act 1996 are to be applied to the interpreta- tion of those provisions of the 1976 Act which continue to have application by virtue of section YB 4 (1). For example in considering the application of section 232B of the 1976 Act to a disposal of property in the 1998 income year, the term assessable income would be read as being the core provisions term “net income”. Consequential amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 The consequential amendments made to the Tax Administration Act 1994 in essence follow the concepts and terminology in the new core provisions. For exam- ple, as described in the section on general consequential changes, the new terminology of “gross income”, “net income”, “annual gross income”, “annual allowable deductions” and “taxable income” have all been adopted in the Tax Administration Act as appropriate. The meaning of these terms are outlined in detail earlier in the TIB in the core provisions discussion. Some sections required certain entities to file returns. Amendments have been made to ensure that the annual return relates to the taxable income of the entity for that income year (see section 57, for example, dealing with the filing requirements for Maori authorities). Section 42 Significant amendments have been made to section 42 (Returns by partners, co-trustees and joint venturers) to make it consistent with core provisions and case law relating to the taxation of partnerships. A partnership is not a taxpayer and so is unable to derive gross income or claim deductions for expenditure incurred by the partnership business. The amendments clarify that each partner derives their share of gross income of the partnership and each partner separately claims their share of the allowable deductions relating to the part- nership business. Accordingly, the partners are required to make a joint return of income including “the gross income jointly derived from the firm ... and a summary of the allowable deductions of each partner that relate to the gross income.” (See also the comment under section HD 1.) Section 92 Section 92 (Commissioner to make assessments, determinations of net loss, and other determinations) is amended to clarify that the Commissioner issues a single assessment in respect of a taxpayer’s taxable income, income tax liability and the tax payable by the taxpayer. Further, subsection (3) refers to the Commis- sioner making a determination of “net loss” instead of “loss”. Section 129 Section 129 (Determination of objection not to affect other matters) has been redrafted to omit terminology that is inconsistent with the core provisions. The redrafted provision is not intended to change the application of the section. It now provides that the determination of the objection on one matter does not affect the right of the Commissioner to make or amend assessments on any other matter. Binding rulings A private or product ruling issued under section 91E or 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994 before the passing of the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act may cease to apply on the application of the core provisions because of changes made by the latter Act. Such a ruling is to be called a “terminated ruling”. In its consideration of the proposed legislation, the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee recommended that a special process be established for rulings affected by the changes in the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act. As a result, the Commissioner will: •reissue a terminated ruling, to the same effect as, and for the remainder of the period in, the terminated ruling, if the core provisions legislation does not substantially alter the way the tax law applies in the ruling (any substantial changes made to the tax law other than those noted in this TIB will be reported to the Government); •issue a new ruling if the terminated ruling cannot be reissued and the taxpayer requests a new ruling. Taxpayers will not be charged for these rulings and a ruling will be issued on the basis of the taxpayer’s original application. (See section 3 of the Core Provi- sions Act). Comparative tables of old and new provisions The following pages contain comparative tables of the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996, the Income Tax Act 1994, and the Income Tax Act 1976.

TIB - October 1996
==================

The Taxpayer Compliance, Penalties, and Disputes Resolution Bill was introduced into Parliament in October 1995 and passed in July 1996. The compliance and penalties provisions of the legislation resulted in amendments to these Acts:

*   Tax Administration Act 1994
*   Income Tax Act 1994
*   Goods and Services Tax Act 1985
*   Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971
*   Gaming Duties Act 1971
*   Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968
*   Student Loan Scheme Act 1992
*   Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992
*   Child Support Act 1991

This Tax Information Bulletin deals with the legislative changes relating to compliance and penalties. The changes pertaining to the new disputes resolution procedures were addressed in TIB Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996).

The main features of the new legislation are:

*   a clear statement of taxpayer obligations
*   new interest rules for overpayments and underpayments of tax
*   new penalty and remission rules.

All section references in this document relate to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated.

These reforms follow on from the Government discussion documents Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties (August 1994), and Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties 2 (April 1995).
