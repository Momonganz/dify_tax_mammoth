Appendix II: Summary of recommendations 191 1 GST on low-value imported goods 2 3 OVERVIEW In principle, Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) should apply to all consumption that occurs in New Zealand, as this ensures that the system is fair, efficient and simple. Under the current rules, however, GST is not typically collected on imported goods below the customs de minimis of $60 of duty owing (this typically equates to a parcel with a value of $400 if GST is the only duty). When GST was introduced in 1986, few New Zealand consumers purchased goods from offshore suppliers, and online shopping did not exist. At that time, the compliance and administrative costs that would have been involved in taxing imported goods under the de minimis outweighed the benefits of taxation. The growth of e-commerce means the volume of imported goods on which GST is not collected is becoming increasingly significant. Many are concerned that the current tax settings place New Zealand suppliers of low-value goods at a competitive disadvantage relative to offshore suppliers. The non-collection of GST on low-value imported goods has also resulted in a growing gap in New Zealand’s GST revenue base (estimated to be around $130 million in 2017–18). The amendments proposed in the Bill apply GST to imported goods valued at or below $1,000 supplied by offshore businesses to consumers in New Zealand. They would require the offshore supplier to register for and return GST on these supplies. Offshore suppliers may have the option to also charge GST on their supplies of goods over $1,000 to consumers in New Zealand. The New Zealand Customs Service (“Customs”) will cease to collect any form of duty on consignments valued at $1,000 or less, except for tobacco products or alcoholic beverages. Customs will however continue to collect GST and other duties on imported parcels valued above $1,000 and undertake risk assessment on all consignments for prohibited goods and accurate valuation. The proposed amendments contain rules to prevent double taxation by requiring Customs to not collect GST on goods that have already had GST collected on them at the point of sale by the offshore supplier. Offshore suppliers would not be required to return GST on supplies to New Zealand GST- registered businesses, nor would they be required to provide tax invoices. Furthermore, as with domestic suppliers and offshore suppliers of remote services, offshore suppliers would only be required to register for and return GST when their taxable supplies to New Zealand consumers exceed $60,000 in a 12-month period. A range of other amendments are also proposed focusing on implementation. The overall package of amendments is intended to maintain the broad base of New Zealand’s GST system and to create a level playing field between domestic and offshore suppliers of low-value goods. Submissions expressed general support for collecting GST on low-value imported goods supplied by offshore businesses. However, a number of submitters expressed the view that the proposed application date of 1 October 2019 does not provide enough time for offshore suppliers and electronic marketplaces to make the required systems changes. In addition, several submitters consider that where double taxation occurs (that is, GST is collected by both the supplier at the point of sale and by Customs at the border), the responsibility for providing a refund should not be on the supplier, but instead either Customs or Inland Revenue should provide refunds to consumers. 4 The proposed rules for electronic marketplaces were another major focus in submissions, with a number of submissions noting that the proposed regime imposes a significant compliance burden on operators of electronic marketplaces. Other submissions suggested technical changes to improve the certainty or practicality of the rules. This included suggestions for allowing the affected suppliers more flexibility with how they apply the rules to accommodate their different business models and processes. All legislation references within refer to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, unless otherwise noted. 5 GENERAL SUBMISSIONS Clauses 4 to 19 and 23 to 39 Issue: General support for collecting GST on low-value imported goods Submission (Amazon, CAPEC New Zealand, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, Gurpreet Gill, KPMG, PwC, Retail NZ, Steve Cornwall, Trade Me) Most submitters expressed in-principle support for applying GST to low-value imported goods supplied by offshore suppliers to New Zealand consumers. A number of these caveated their support with specific concerns, which are set out below. Some submitters specifically expressed support for the proposed offshore supplier registration system. (CAPEC New Zealand, Gurpreet Gill, Retail NZ) Comment Officials welcome the support but acknowledge the concerns with various aspects of the GST proposals. This report notes the specific concerns raised by submitters as separate issues. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Not in favour of the proposed collection model/other collection models preferred Submission (Alibaba and eBay, Amazon, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Ian Sanders, R Perry, Sven Frontin-Rollet, Trade Me) Submitters expressed a range of different concerns with the proposed offshore supplier registration system, most notably around the potential impacts on trade and consumers’ access to goods from offshore. Some of these submitters disagree with the rationale for the proposals, noting there are non-tax reasons why consumers shop online from offshore suppliers and that in many cases the goods are simply not available within New Zealand. (Ian Sanders, R Perry, Sven Frontin-Rollet) Others have expressed in-principle support for collecting GST on low-value imported goods but consider there are fundamental problems with the proposed collection model (Amazon, Trade Me). As outlined below, three submitters have referenced alternative collection models based on collection by goods transporters (that is, freight carriers and New Zealand Post) or an extension to the existing border collection system, which they consider would better achieve the Government’s objective of competitive neutrality between domestic and offshore suppliers 6 with less unintended consequences (Alibaba and eBay, Amazon, Trade Me). One submitter felt that other options (based on collection at the border or collection by goods transporters) were not fully considered (Trade Me). Four submitters were concerned that the proposals (if enacted) may result in some suppliers and electronic marketplaces ceasing to ship goods to New Zealand, or reducing the range of products they ship to New Zealand. (Alibaba and eBay, R Perry, Sven Frontin-Rollet, Trade Me) While being generally supportive of the proposed offshore supplier registration system, one submitter considered it to be an interim solution that will eventually be superseded by technology that will allow the government to receive information about the flow of goods in real time and impose tax accordingly. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment A number of alternative collection models – including lowering the de minimis under the existing collection system and collection by goods transporters – were analysed by officials. Collection by Customs or by goods transporters were also both considered by the Tax Working Group which, consistent with the finding of the Productivity Commission in Australia, concluded that offshore supplier registration is the most viable model at present for collecting GST on low-value imported goods. This finding is also consistent with New Zealand officials’ own analysis, which found that the total cost of collection would likely exceed the extra revenue collected and the flow of goods across the border would be impeded, potentially resulting in significant delivery delays for consumers and substantial costs for the goods transportation industry. The extent to which collection by transporters may eventually become a viable alternative is uncertain. At present, the current lack of electronic advance data in the international postal system poses a major limitation. Even once electronic advance data becomes fully available in the international postal system, the extent to which the de minimis could realistically be lowered under a logistics-based collection model is not clear. Given the overwhelming majority of goods imported by consumers are valued at less than $150, there is a chance that any feasible reduction in the de minimis under such a system may not be sufficient to address the problem. However, officials will continue to monitor developments to see if this model (as well as other models) may become a superior option in the future. Officials acknowledge the risk that consumer choice, trade and competition may be adversely affected if compliance is too onerous for offshore suppliers and marketplaces. To minimise this risk, the proposals in the Bill have been designed to minimise compliance costs to these businesses as much as is practicable. Officials are encouraged by the direct engagement that has taken place to date with businesses affected by the proposals, who have made it clear in their discussions with officials that their intention is to comply with the rules. Officials also acknowledge the point that consumers purchase goods online from offshore suppliers for a number of reasons, including convenience and access to a wider product range. However, ideally the tax treatment should not be a factor in consumers’ purchasing decisions. 7 Recommendation That the submissions opposing the proposed offshore supplier registration system be declined, but the point that the proposed collection system may only be an interim solution and submitters’ concerns about the potential impact on consumer choice be noted. Issue: Trade issues Submission (Alibaba and eBay, R Perry) Submitters have voiced concerns about the potential impact of the proposals on New Zealand’s diplomatic relationships with its trade partners, as well as the compliance of the proposed legislation with New Zealand’s free trade obligations. One submitter considered that the proposals would be detrimental to trade relations with China. (R Perry) A joint submission from two electronic marketplaces considered the proposed legislation to be a violation of the principle of national treatment under Article III of the World Trade Organisation’s General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade: “Under Article III, each country commits to not levy additional taxes on imported goods over comparable domestic goods. However, under the Bill, a merchant selling an imported product through an online marketplace must pay GST from the first dollar of sales to New Zealand, while a merchant selling a competing product in New Zealand receives a $60,000 exemption from GST.” (Alibaba and eBay) Comment Officials specifically consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in the development of the proposals and are comfortable that the proposals are not inconsistent with New Zealand’s international obligations, including in relation to free trade. In its final report on the inquiry into the similar offshore supplier registration system legislated in Australia, the Australian Productivity Commission (“the Commission”) considered the issue of whether Australia’s law could be a breach of international trade agreements. While the Commission noted that the different treatment of foreign and domestic goods sold through an electronic marketplace by a supplier below the A$75,000 registration threshold may pose some risks, the Commission considered there were good reasons to consider the model to be compliant with Australia’s international trade agreements. For instance, low-value goods will still cross the border without being stopped for revenue collection purposes, so there will not be added delays at the border. This is also true of New Zealand’s proposal. Officials further note that the European Union has committed to an offshore supplier registration system which includes similar rules for marketplaces. Recommendation That the submission and officials’ comments be noted. 8 Issue: Post-implementation review of the rules Submission (Alibaba and eBay) The submitters recommend establishing an Inland Revenue-led industry working group (including marketplaces, logistics providers, payments systems providers and retailers) to undertake a review of the regime’s practical implementation twelve months after any legislation is passed. Comment The Government will review the low-value goods threshold three years after the implementation of the rules. The Government has also directed officials from Inland Revenue, Customs and Treasury to continue to monitor the future viability of other collection models to see if the practical issues with these models can be overcome. Officials consider that it would be a bit premature to undertake a review of the implementation of the legislation twelve months after it was passed, as after a year of the law being enacted the rules would have only been in effect for a few months. Officials consider that undertaking any review three years after the rules’ implementation would be more informative, as by then there should be enough experience with the rules to identify any significant ongoing implementation issues. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 9 APPLICATION DATE AND TRANSITIONAL RULES Issue: Application date of the rules Clause 2(14) Submission (Accountants + Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Alibaba and eBay, Amazon, CAPEC New Zealand, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, PwC) Submitters have expressed concern about the proposed application date of 1 October 2019, noting that this leaves little time between the likely bill enactment date and the start of the new rules. Submitters consider that offshore suppliers cannot be expected to invest in making information technology systems changes until the law is enacted, as the proposed rules are not finalised and may yet be subject to change. They have noted that there may not be enough time after the rules are finalised for offshore suppliers to register for New Zealand GST and make the systems changes necessary to collect GST on low-value goods supplied to New Zealand consumers by 1 October 2019. A number of submitters have suggested 1 April 2020 as a more realistic application date. One submitter considered that the proposed legislation itself is complex, and there are numerous types of supply chain models. The submitter commented that offshore sellers would need to make significant systems and technology changes once they have digested how the rules will apply to them. (PwC) Submitters also verbally advised the Committee on 13 March 2019 that suppliers were being asked to make significant changes for e-commerce by a number of countries and “New Zealand is in the queue”. Some submissions noted the technical challenges for large electronic marketplaces that service a global customer base, which mean the required systems changes will need to be carefully planned and tested to ensure they do not create errors that interfere with other parts of their systems. (Alibaba and eBay, Amazon) One submission noted the risk that electronic marketplaces and suppliers (that do intend to comply with the proposed legislation) may be left with little choice other than to temporarily cease shipping goods to New Zealand from 1 October until the required systems changes are ready. (Alibaba and eBay) The submission also stated the systems changes that have been implemented to comply with Australia’s new legislation cannot be simply adapted for New Zealand, as “Australia’s GST system is different to New Zealand’s and therefore substantial additional investment will still be required to comply”. (Alibaba and eBay) Comment Officials have considered the arguments for and against delaying the application date. 10 Officials acknowledge submitters’ concerns that it may be difficult for some offshore suppliers to implement the necessary systems changes within the short time period between enactment (expected to be July 2019) and the proposed application date (1 October 2019). The proposed application date of 1 October 2019 was first announced when the discussion document was released in May 2018 and was confirmed when the Bill was introduced in December 2018. However, planning and testing is required to change systems and it is difficult to start developing the changes until the final requirements are certain. Officials are aware of the potential risks, particularly that some suppliers may temporarily block or suspend their sales to New Zealand consumers for several months until they are able to implement the necessary systems changes. On the other hand, delaying the application date by six or twelve months would delay the benefits of the proposal in terms of achieving fairness and a level playing field for New Zealand retailers. Delaying the application date would also have a large fiscal cost as between six to twelve months of additional GST revenue would no longer be collected in respect of the relevant low- value goods. Many of the affected suppliers already have experience in building similar systems for Australia, Switzerland and some US states. They should also have strong commercial incentives to implement the necessary systems ahead of the application date in order to avoid negative publicity and to maintain their market presence as otherwise consumers may seek out alternative providers. For these reasons, officials ultimately recommend retaining the 1 October 2019 application date. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Initial six-month taxable period Clause 18(2) Submission (Matter raised by officials) The Bill proposes that offshore suppliers of low-value imported goods would have quarterly taxable periods if their only supplies in New Zealand are of low-value imported goods and/or remote services – meaning that these offshore suppliers would be required to file GST returns quarterly. However, offshore suppliers that become liable to register from the start of the new rules because their only New Zealand supplies are low-value imported goods would have the option of having a six-month taxable period for the first six months. This means they would not be required to file their first GST return until 7 May 2020 (assuming a 1 October 2019 application date). 11 The current drafting of this rule does not technically apply to offshore suppliers that make supplies of both remote services and low-value imported goods who become liable to register for GST in New Zealand as a consequence of the low-value imported goods rules. Officials recommend that a change be made so that these suppliers would also have the option of having a six-month taxable period for the first six months of the rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Transitional rule for certain contracts entered into before application date No clause in Bill Submission (Matter raised by officials) Some imported goods may be successively supplied under a fixed term subscription that spans the proposed application date (one possible example is a magazine subscription). The Bill as introduced would require adjustments of the consideration for supplies of low-value imported goods made under such contracts (as payments made after the application date would be subject to GST). These adjustments may be administratively difficult for suppliers. To minimise compliance costs, officials consider it is appropriate to provide a transitional rule for fixed-term contracts entered into before the application date, similar to existing transitional provisions that were provided for the GST rate change in 2010 and for the introduction of GST on remote services in 2016. Such a rule would allow suppliers to treat periodic payments under the contract as not being successive supplies if the consideration for the supply is set or reviewed for periods of 396 days or less during the term of the agreement. This means that if the supplier elects that this transitional rule applies, payments made after the implementation date would not subject to GST for the term of the agreement or up to 396 days from the date the contract was entered into (whichever is earlier). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 12 ADMINISTERING THE RULES Issue: Compliance and enforcement Submission (Alibaba and eBay, PwC, Retail NZ, R Perry, Steve Cornwall, Trade Me) Submitters have expressed differing views on the likely level of compliance with the proposals and their enforceability: “... In our opinion, the current design will result in high rates of non-compliance.” (Alibaba and eBay) “Australia was in a similar position, but successfully introduced an offshore supplier registration system for GST last year... Before the implementation of offshore registration for services and intangibles there was also concern about uptake and non-compliance. That has also proved not to be a major issue and over 200 merchants have registered to date.” (Retail NZ) “It seems like the Government is relying on overseas suppliers to declare whether they supply more than $60k p.a. of goods into NZ so they need to register for GST... It is pretty straightforward for people to set up offshore accounts to pay for such goods or just use a confidential escrow service such as Paypal.” (R Perry) “... Low levels of compliance without an effective enforcement regime will not actually fix the distortion in practice, and will create a new competitive distortion (between marketplaces and suppliers that do comply with the GST regime, and those that don’t).” (Trade Me) Two submitters have suggested enforcement strategies to maximise compliance with the rules – one submitter stating that New Zealand must continue to strengthen its network of agreements with other jurisdictions on mutual co-operation, information exchange and assistance in tax matters (PwC). The other suggested enforcement strategy is addressed below as a separate issue. Comment Our tax system relies for the most part on voluntary compliance. Key to encouraging voluntary compliance is making the rules as simple as possible to comply with. Inland Revenue’s experience with similar rules applying to imported “remote” services suggests that making the rules easy to comply with leads to good compliance outcomes, although there will still be some non-compliance. Inland Revenue will monitor compliance and use a range of methods to detect non-compliance. New Zealand has agreements with other countries on mutual co-operation, information exchange and assistance in tax matters. These agreements cover an extensive network of jurisdictions, including our major trading partners. The agreements mean New Zealand can request that our treaty partners (that is, other foreign tax authorities) provide information about foreign taxpayers. In addition, Inland Revenue and Customs will share information and work together to help identify non-compliant suppliers. Inland Revenue will also work with the Australian Tax Office (“ATO”) which has successfully implemented similar GST rules for offshore suppliers selling low value goods into Australia. 13 When non-compliance is detected, Inland Revenue will register the supplier for GST and issue a default assessment of the GST liability. This debt would then be registered with the New Zealand courts. Using our international agreements, the debt would then be registered and pursued in the courts of the country that the supplier is based in. New Zealand also has agreements with some foreign tax authorities allowing them to collect unpaid GST on New Zealand’s behalf. Alternatively, Inland Revenue could order persons based in New Zealand that owe money to non-compliant offshore suppliers to instead pay those funds to Inland Revenue. Although in its early days, the Australian experience to date suggests that non-compliance may not be a significant problem in practice. The ATO has reported that it has had over 1,100 businesses register for GST under Australia’s new legislation and that the GST revenue raised from the measure for the first quarter of the law being in effect was $81 million – four times the $17.5 million per calendar quarter that was forecast in the Australian Budget. 1 This success is consistent with New Zealand’s experience with the rules applying GST to supplies of remote services, which has seen over 265 offshore businesses register to date and $131 million in GST revenue collected for the 2017–18 tax year. Recommendation That the submissions be noted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Border enforcement of GST collection by offshore suppliers Submission (Steve Cornwall) The submitter considers that Customs should instruct suppliers to place a bar code on parcels where they have collected GST on those items. All parcels that do not have a bar code should be held by Customs. Comment Officials do not consider the above suggestion to be a viable option. Collection at the border on low-value goods as a comprehensive back-stop to the proposed offshore supplier registration system would be costly to administer, with the collection costs likely to outweigh any extra GST revenue generated. The risk of double taxation in situations where the supplier had collected GST on a low-value item would also be significantly higher, particularly for postal items. Non-collection of GST on a low-value item by an offshore supplier would also not necessarily be an indicator of non-compliance. Under the proposals, there are two situations where an offshore supplier is not required to collect and return GST on a supply of low-value imported goods to a New Zealand customer: 1 https://www.afr.com/news/policy/tax/treasury-gets-amazon-bonus-on-unexpected-gst-on-overseas-products- 20190221-h1bj11 14 • Offshore suppliers would not be required to collect GST if they are below the $60,000 registration threshold. • Business-to-business supplies are excluded from the rules, meaning that offshore suppliers are not required to collect GST on supplies to GST-registered businesses. This is revenue neutral as the business purchaser would typically claim the full amount of GST back from Inland Revenue in its GST return. There would be costs in resources and delivery delays if Customs had to distinguish between goods from suppliers that had legitimately not collected GST and those from non-compliant suppliers. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Education and publicity campaign Submission (CAPEC New Zealand, Deloitte, PwC) Submitters encouraged Inland Revenue to undertake an education campaign about the proposed rules (from the time the law is passed) and to focus on ensuring that offshore suppliers have access to clear guidance to help them understand and comply with their new obligations. One submitter recommended adopting an awareness raising approach similar to Australia’s in communicating the proposed rules. The submitter specifically mentioned road shows in countries that are major exporters to Australia allowing suppliers to ask questions and obtain information about the changes and information sheets that the ATO produced. (CAPEC New Zealand) Another submitter further recommended that the enforcement of the new rules should initially have a large “education and encouragement” element, rather than a punishment approach. (Deloitte) Comment Officials agree that clear and effective communication of the proposed legislation will be essential to the successful implementation of the proposals. It is also recognised that the obligations imposed on offshore suppliers under these proposals may be unfamiliar to some suppliers and will require systems changes to be implemented, which may result in mistakes being made or registration being delayed. These situations will be considered on a case-by-case basis and penalties and interest may be remitted under the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s existing discretion (see sections 183A and 183D of the Tax Administration Act 1994) when it is appropriate. 15 The existing discretions can be exercised when the Commissioner is satisfied that the non- compliance has been caused by an event or circumstance that provides reasonable justification or excuse for the omission, or when the Commissioner is satisfied that the remission is consistent with the duty to collect, over time, the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law (for example, when there is a genuine oversight or a one-off error). Following enactment of the legislation, Inland Revenue will develop and provide tailored educational material that will be easily accessible to offshore suppliers. This should ensure the obligations imposed on offshore suppliers are clear, thus avoiding simple errors and misunderstandings. Inland Revenue will also engage directly with affected offshore suppliers, marketplaces and redeliverers to raise awareness of the rules and to notify businesses when the registration process is available. Recommendation That the submission be noted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Flexibility in the rules to reduce implementation costs for suppliers Submission (KPMG, Trade Me) Submitters have requested that the provisions in the Bill that apply GST to low-value imported goods allow for greater flexibility to enable affected businesses to comply with the new rules in the most cost-efficient manner. Comment Officials acknowledge the points raised by submitters about the need for flexibility in the rules. The businesses affected by these proposals have different business models and processes, and therefore will take different approaches to comply with the rules in the way that is most cost- efficient for them. Officials consider the desire for flexibility needs to be balanced against the policy aim of having clear and simple rules. There is a risk that too much flexibility and optionality may detract from the transparency and coherency of the rules and generate confusion and uncertainty. Officials are also mindful there is a risk with delegated powers that the discretion might not be applied consistently, which could result in unfair outcomes. This report therefore considers requests for greater discretion or flexibility on a case-by-case basis as part of the individual issues raised by submitters. Recommendation That the submission be noted, subject to officials’ comments. 16 Issue: Cooperation between Inland Revenue and Customs Submission (Deloitte) Inland Revenue and Customs need to prioritise co-ordinating their efforts to implement the proposed system, including working together to resolve any issues during and after implementation. Comment Inland Revenue and Customs have worked together in the development of the proposals and will continue to do so when the legislation is implemented. Recommendation That the submission be noted. The submission does not require any change to the Bill. 17 “DISTANTLY TAXABLE GOODS” AND THE $1,000 THRESHOLD Issue: Support for the proposed $1,000 threshold Clause 5(2) Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, PwC, Trade Me) Some submitters indicated that they support the proposed $1,000 threshold. One noted that, compared with the original proposal for a $400 threshold, the $1,000 threshold should minimise compliance costs for suppliers and deliver a better consumer experience. (PwC) Another submitter supported the removal of duties on consignments valued under $1,000. However, as this change will not be in the Bill itself, the submitter would like to see this change formally documented at the same time the Bill is passed. (Trade Me) Comment Officials welcome the support for the proposed $1,000 threshold. As one of the submitters has noted, the proposed change in the customs de minimis (being the threshold applied by Customs in determining whether it collects GST and other duties on imported goods at the border) to a $1,000 threshold is not included in the Bill. This change will be achieved through an amendment to regulation 70 of the Customs and Excise Regulations 1996. Customs expects to share an exposure draft of the amendment regulations with interested stakeholders in advance of the proposed changes coming into force on the same date as the amendments to the GST Act. Recommendation That the submission be noted. The submission does not require any amendment to the Bill. Issue: The term “distantly taxable goods” Clause 6 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The phrase “distantly taxable goods” is difficult to say and may be a difficult concept for consumers. The accessibility of the rules may be improved by using more user-friendly terminology. Government should consider whether there is a phrase that is more accessible and more memorable, such as “taxable overseas goods” (“TOGs”). 18 Comment Officials consider the term “distantly taxable goods” to be the most accurate way of describing the goods subject to the proposed rules, given the exceptions that may apply. For example, high-value goods will be subject to the rules if the supplier has elected under proposed section 10C to charge GST on its supplies of high-value goods, so “low-value goods” is not a sufficiently accurate term to use in the legislation to describe the types of goods subject to the proposals. Goods that are sourced from within New Zealand will be subject to the rules if they are supplied through an electronic marketplace by a non-resident underlying supplier, so “imported goods” or “overseas goods” would not be a strictly accurate description either. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Possible GST leakage on goods valued between $400 and $1,000 No clause in Bill Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, PwC) Two submitters have expressed concern that the proposed increase in the customs de minimis for collecting GST and other charges on imported goods at the border could create a significant hole in the rules in relation to goods valued between $400 and $1,000, where these goods are supplied by unregistered offshore suppliers (being suppliers that are not liable to register for GST under the rules or that will not register and comply with the rules). These submitters are concerned this may result in a change in supplier and consumer behaviour, suggesting that careful consideration should be given to this issue (PwC) and the behavioural response from consumers and suppliers should be monitored (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand). Comment As submitters have pointed out, an increase in the customs de minimis to $1,000 may incentivise consumers to purchase goods valued between $400 and $1,000 free of GST from offshore suppliers that would be below the registration threshold. However, it is unclear how significant an issue this might be in practice. For instance, it is not clear how many offshore suppliers that would be below the registration threshold would sell goods to New Zealand consumers through their own website or mail order (as opposed to selling goods on an electronic marketplace that would be liable to collect GST on offshore goods sold on its marketplace, including those sold by underlying suppliers below the $60,000 registration threshold). Officials have estimated that approximately $22 million in GST was collected on consignments valued between $400 and $1,000 that were imported by consumers in 2017–18. While a $1,000 threshold does potentially put this GST at risk, officials expect that most of this currently collected GST would continue to be collected under the proposed rules, largely owing to the inclusion of the proposed rules for electronic marketplaces and redeliverers. 19 A $1,000 threshold may even have some benefits for collecting GST on goods valued between $400 and $1,000, including: • increasing the number of suppliers with a liability to register by increasing offshore suppliers’ level of “supplies in New Zealand” (as supplies of goods valued between $400 and $1,000 would also be treated by the GST Act as supplies made in New Zealand); • reducing the risk of GST not being collected on goods between $400 and $1,000 owing to undervaluation (because, even if the supplier undervalued the goods for customs purposes, the marketplace operator will collect the correct amount of GST in the situation where the goods are supplied through a GST-registered electronic marketplace); and • reducing the reliance on visual checks of labels on parcels to identify when goods sent by international mail are above the de minimis. Officials note that the Government has committed to a post-implementation review of the level of the proposed $1,000 threshold, which is to take place three years after the implementation of the rules. Officials from Inland Revenue and Customs will also monitor any behavioural responses from offshore suppliers and consumers in the time between the initial implementation of the rules and the post-implementation review. Recommendation That the submission be noted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Collection of tariff duty No clause in Bill Submission (Retail NZ) The proposed legislation does not deal with current level playing field issues around tariff duty. Tariff duty is currently collected at the border on consignments valued at more than around $225, but the legislation increases that threshold to a flat $1,000. This exacerbates the issues relating to duty and New Zealand-domiciled businesses will continue to suffer a competitive disadvantage as a result. The practical constraints around collecting tariff duty on low-value goods are understood by the submitter, who supports their removal. However, until such time as tariffs are eliminated on a multilateral basis, the submitter recommends the Government continues to look at sensible ways of collecting tariffs on goods worth less than $1,000. In the event that current international trade disputes lead to an escalation of tariffs on inbound goods, the submitter considers the Government should prioritise solutions to this issue. 20 Comment Officials acknowledge the concern raised by the submitter. While the proposals will improve the playing field in relation to GST, they do not deal with (and in a small number of cases may negatively impact) the playing field issues in relation to tariff duty. 2 New Zealand has few remaining tariffs (the significant relevant tariffs for retailers are up to 10% on clothing and a 5% tariff on some fabrics) and our free trade agreements have already eliminated these tariffs for many countries (including China, Australia and – from 2020 – the 10 ASEAN countries, under the ASEAN Australia New Zealand free trade agreement). Consequently, over 90 percent of goods entering New Zealand are not charged a tariff. In 2017–18, $3.23 million was collected in tariff duty on consignments valued at or below $1,000, compared with approximately $5.2 million in the 2016 calendar year. The amount of revenue from tariff duty is expected to continue to reduce over time as a result of New Zealand’s implemented free trade agreements progressing toward agreed tariff eliminations. The revenues involved are therefore much less significant than the growing gap in GST collection on low- value imported goods, and the best way to level the playing field in relation to tariffs is to negotiate free trade agreements which eliminate these tariffs for all importers (retailers and consumers). Finally, in some cases, New Zealand businesses importing goods will also benefit from the proposed removal of tariffs on consignments valued at or below $1,000 as they would also no longer be required to pay any tariff duty on these consignments. Officials have referred the submission to the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, being the government agency responsible for tariff policy. Recommendation That the submission be noted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Legislative authority for the customs de minimis and clarification of the effect and intention of section 12(4)(c) No clause in Bill Submission (KPMG) The submitter is concerned that it is not clear from reading the Bill alone when GST will or will not be collected by Customs on low-value imported goods (as the proposed change in the customs de minimis to $1,000 based on the value of the consignment will have an impact, and this change is not included in the Bill). In particular, the submitter is concerned that it is not clear that GST will not be collected by Customs on low-value consignments imported by GST- registered businesses and has requested clarification of how the de minimis is applied by Customs to goods imported by GST-registered businesses. 2 As tariff duty will not be collected on imported consignments valued below $1,000, but will often be collected when retailers import items subject to tariffs as these businesses would typically import these items in a consignment valued above $1,000. 21 The submitter considers the effect of the low-value goods threshold should be clearly stated and the effect and intention of section 12(4)(c) reviewed. Comment Regulation 70 of the Customs and Excise Regulations 1996 provides the legislative authority for the de minimis applied by Customs for collecting duty (which is defined to include GST) on imported goods. The de minimis is currently set at $60 of duty. The effect of this is that GST is not collected at the border on most imported consignments valued below $400, including consignments imported by GST-registered businesses. There are few exceptions to the de minimis, the main ones being for alcohol and tobacco products. There is no exception to the de minimis for goods imported by GST-registered businesses specifically. As mentioned earlier, Customs expects to share an exposure draft of the amendment regulations to Regulation 70 with interested stakeholders at a later date. Officials consider it is appropriate that the de minimis is set in the Customs and Excise Regulations, as the de minimis also applies to other customs duties, not just GST. 3 From the start of the proposed new rules, Customs will collect GST on all consignments above the $1,000 threshold (including those imported by GST-registered businesses), except where notification is provided to Customs that GST was collected at the point of sale by the supplier. Notification of GST being collected at the point of sale should only be provided to Customs if the goods are covered by the offshore supplier registration system proposed in the Bill (meaning that offshore goods in an ordinary supply by a resident GST-registered business, for example, would still have GST collected at the border if the goods are imported into New Zealand and the value of the consignment is above $1,000). Section 12(4)(c) of the GST Act is unrelated to the de minimis. The intention of section 12(4)(c) is to prevent potential “double-dipping” where, in the absence of the rule, a GST-registered business that has paid GST on the importation of goods to Customs might obtain a drawback or refund of the GST from Customs, while at the same time being entitled to make an input tax deduction in its GST return for the import GST. The effect of section 12(4)(c) is that a GST- registered person is not entitled to a drawback or refund of GST from Customs if the registered person is entitled to claim an input tax deduction from Inland Revenue for the GST paid to Customs. Recommendation That the submission be noted. The submission is addressed in the above comment and the effect of the proposed change to the de minimis will be explained further in the guidance. 3 For example, the de minimis applies in respect of tariff duty, but does not apply to goods subject to excise taxes such as alcohol and tobacco. 22 Issue: Treatment of multiple item shipments Clause 6 Submission (PwC) Unlike the Australian rules, the proposals do not contain detailed rules for how sellers may treat multiple item shipments, where some goods may be above $1,000 and some below. That is, GST will only apply to the individual items of distantly taxable goods in a consignment that are $1,000 or less. In theory this simple approach has appeal but, at a practical level, it may create complexity as it requires sellers to apportion customer orders into items that attract GST and those that do not. Comment Clear and detailed guidance on what suppliers are required to do, including the GST treatment of shipping charges for mixed consignments, will be provided in an upcoming special report to be published on Inland Revenue’s Tax Policy website shortly after the legislation is enacted, and will also be included in the Tax Information Bulletin. Officials note that where suppliers choose to charge GST on their supplies of high-value goods, the treatment of multiple item shipments should generally be straightforward (as GST would generally apply to all the goods in the consignment, regardless of whether the individual items are above or below the $1,000 threshold). Recommendation That the submission be noted. The GST treatment of multiple item shipments will be explained in the guidance. 23 EXCEPTION TO BORDER COLLECTION TO PREVENT DOUBLE TAXATION Issue: Drafting of exception to border collection on low-value goods imported in consignments above $1,000 Clause 16 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, PwC, KPMG) Submitters have suggested that the proposed amendment to section 12(1) and proposed new section 12(1B) be redrafted to clarify the following: • That the proposed exception to the collection of GST by Customs on low-value imported goods that have already had GST collected by the supplier at the point of sale only applies to supplies within the scope of proposed section 8(3)(ab), rather than section 8 generally. An ordinary supply by a resident GST-registered person of goods yet to be imported should not be excluded from having GST collected at the border. (PwC) • The meaning of the phrase “tax accounted for by the registered person” (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG). Submitters have suggested that the words “accounting” and “accounted” in proposed sections 12(1B)(a) and (c) are replaced with the words “charging” and “charged” respectively. Comment Under the proposals, offshore suppliers would be required to collect GST on goods that are individually valued at $1,000 or less. Customs would collect GST on imported consignments valued above $1,000. An imported consignment with a value above $1,000 may include low-value imported goods that have had GST collected at the point of sale by the offshore supplier. Therefore, for the purpose of preventing double taxation, the proposed amendment to section 12(1) provides an exception to the collection of GST by Customs on low-value imported goods that have already had GST collected by the supplier. Officials agree that the scope of the proposed amendment to section 12(1) is broader than intended, as it applies to supplies of imported goods by New Zealand-resident businesses. The only supplies by residents that are intended to fall within the scope of the exception are supplies of imported goods that are actually made by a non-resident, but are treated for GST purposes as being made by a resident redeliverer or marketplace operator under the amendments in the Bill. Officials also agree that the use of the phrases “accounting for” and “accounted for” are inaccurate in the context of proposed section 12(1B), which sets out the information that the supplier is required to take reasonable steps to ensure is available to Customs for the proposed exception in section 12(1) to apply. As noted in two of the submissions, it is unlikely that at the time the goods are imported that the supplier will have “accounted for” the GST (that is, returned and paid the GST to Inland Revenue). 24 Officials will revise the drafting of the relevant provisions to address the points raised by submitters and will consult submitters on the revised drafting. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Exception to border collection on low-value goods is inconsistent with self- assessment Clause 16 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Proposed section 12(1B) is inconsistent with the principle of self-assessment. Comment As the submitter notes, self-assessment is a fundamental principle in tax administration. Proposed section 12(1B) could be said to be a departure from this principle. Under the proposed section, Customs will assess and collect GST on items imported in consignments over $1,000 unless it is provided with information in a specified form to show that GST was already collected at the point of sale by the supplier. The reason for the inclusion of the rule is to provide a workable basis for Customs to determine whether GST was already collected by the supplier at the point of sale. Without the proposed exception to collection by Customs in the situation where the information available to Customs indicates that GST was already collected by the supplier, the incidence of potential double taxation under the proposals would be higher. Recommendation That the submission be noted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Clarification of “an item of goods in a consignment” Clause 16(2) Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The proposed section refers to “an item of goods in a consignment”. The rule should also apply to any good imported individually and not as part of a consignment. The wording of the section should be clarified. 25 Comment Under the Customs and Excise legislation, a good imported individually is treated as a consignment in itself. Therefore, when goods are imported individually, the rules for preventing double taxation would still apply, meaning that GST should not be collected on the good by Customs if GST was already collected at the point of sale. Recommendation That the submission be noted. The submission is addressed in the above comment and will be further explained in the guidance materials. Issue: Collection of GST on tariff duty Clause 16(1) Submission (Matter raised by officials) GST is only one type of duty collected by Customs on imported goods. For instance, Customs also collects tariff duty, as well as GST on that tariff duty. The rationale for this is that, as a consumption tax, GST should apply to the full landed value of the goods, which includes applicable tariff duty. Under the proposed offshore supplier registration system, Customs will continue to collect tariff duty on consignments over $1,000, including on any low-value items in the consignment. For the purposes of preventing double taxation, a proposed amendment to section 12(1) switches off Customs’ ability to collect GST on imported goods if GST was collected on that good at the point of sale. However, this amendment as it is currently drafted would also switch off Customs’ ability to collect GST on tariff duty in certain situations, which is not intended. In the situation where an imported consignment containing low-value goods has a combined value over $1,000, Customs would collect cost recovery charges and tariff duty (if any) on the consignment, even if GST had been collected at the point of sale on some or all the goods in the consignment. However, if GST had been collected at the point of sale on an item in the consignment that is subject to tariff duty, the amendment as currently drafted would prevent Customs from being able to collect GST on that duty. Officials recommend the proposed exception in section 12(1) be amended, so that GST may still be collected on tariff duty in the situation described above. This would provide neutrality between the situation where Customs collects GST on a high-value item that is subject to tariff duty, and the situation where low-value goods that are subject to tariff duty are imported in a consignment with a combined value in excess of $1,000. Tariff duty (and GST on tariff duty) would not be collected on goods in consignments valued at or below $1,000. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 26 INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS FOR PREVENTING DOUBLE TAXATION Issue: Alternative information requirements for preventing double taxation Clauses 16(2) and 24 Submission (Alibaba and eBay, CAPEC New Zealand, KPMG) Proposed new section 12(1B) requires certain information to be provided to Customs to confirm that GST was already collected by the supplier at the point of sale and therefore will not be collected at the border. This information is the name of the registered person who is accounting for GST on the supply; the item; and the rate of tax accounted for by the registered person. The Bill does not contain any ability to agree alternatives to this prescribed form with Customs or Inland Revenue. Two submitters have suggested providing additional flexibility in the legislation to allow for alternative approaches on what information will be sufficient to satisfy Customs that GST was collected by the supplier at the point of sale, so that GST will not be charged again at the border (Alibaba and eBay, KPMG). Another submitter noted that many offshore suppliers shipping goods into New Zealand are also selling goods into Australia, and therefore are already required to register under Australia’s GST law for low-value imported goods (CAPEC New Zealand). The submitter has suggested that consideration be given to allowing dual use of Australian supplier registration numbers. Comment Officials consider it is appropriate to allow the Commissioner to agree with suppliers on alternative information requirements for preventing double taxation as submitters have suggested, provided that the Comptroller of Customs also agrees to the alternative information requirements. Officials further recommend the removal of the requirement to state the rate of tax charged on each item that has had tax charged at a rate of more than zero. Given that New Zealand currently has a single standard rate of GST (being 15%), this requirement is not necessary. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 27 Issue: Guidance on Customs’ procedures and how information for preventing double taxation is to be made available to Customs Clauses 16(2) and 24 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, Trade Me) Submitters are concerned that it is not clear how the information required to be made available to Customs for the purpose of preventing double taxation will be provided, and have suggested that better guidance is issued by Customs and Inland Revenue regarding the form in which the information will be received by Customs. Submitters have made the following suggestions: • Customs should be capable of accepting the required information in all the following forms: import entry, receipt inside the package with the goods, daily electronic transmittal of all transactions. Customs should put systems in place to process the information they will be receiving. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) • Government should consider including the information on how Customs will collect and process the information required on both the Customs and Inland Revenue websites. In addition, it would be useful to include this guidance on other government agencies’ websites, such as the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s website on doing business in New Zealand (business.govt.nz). (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) • Guidance on the administrative procedures to be followed by Customs in collecting the required information, including process flows and the role of customs agents would benefit stakeholders. (EY) Comment Customs’ existing documentation will be amended to include additional information and stakeholders will be consulted. Guidance materials will be issued by both Customs and Inland Revenue, and Customs will provide assistance to new stakeholders. The Conference of Asia Pacific Express Carriers (“CAPEC”) has also offered to work with suppliers to help them comply with information requirements. For non-mail items, the “reasonable steps” requirement would be met if: • the supplier (being the actual supplier of the goods, as well as the supplier for GST purposes) includes the relevant information contained on the receipt or tax invoice for the goods in the commercial documentation provided to the freight forwarder, carrier or customs broker, for use in completing the customs documents on behalf of the importer. The person responsible for completing the customs documentation would then include this information in the customs documentation; • an operator of an electronic marketplace (who is treated under the proposals as the supplier for GST purposes) includes GST information on commercial documentation which it requires the seller of the goods to pass through the logistics chain on its behalf. 28 In relation to mail items, the transmission of this information through the international postal network may not currently be accommodated under current systems. Therefore, for goods transported by post, providing a receipt (required to be issued under proposed section 24BAB) to the customer would currently be sufficient to meet the reasonable steps requirement. The customer would be able to provide the receipt to Customs to prevent Customs from collecting GST again on items that had GST collected by the supplier. Officials note that what will constitute reasonable steps in relation to mail items is expected to change in the future, owing to the increased availability of electronic advance data in the international postal network over the next few years. Recommendation That the submission be noted. The submission is addressed in the above comment and will be further explained in the guidance materials. Issue: Competitive neutrality between freight and post Clause 24 Submission (CAPEC New Zealand) The international postal network competes with members of the Conference of Asia-Pacific Express Carriers (“CAPEC”) in the parcel delivery industry. A large number of offshore suppliers ship goods through the postal pathway without any requirement to report information on these parcels through an electronic manifest or inward cargo report. The submitter is concerned this gives the postal pathway a direct advantage over other carriers, because Inland Revenue will not be able to capture supplier registration numbers relating to these shipments for monitoring and enforcement purposes. This will potentially see non- compliant offshore suppliers ship goods by international mail in order to avoid detection, thus advantaging the postal channel over the freight channel. The submitter considers that competitive neutrality between the postal and freight channels will only exist if the postal channel also provides supplier registration numbers. Comment For goods imported through the freight pathway, Customs currently collects information on consignments electronically from customs brokers, freight forwarders and carriers prior to the arrival and clearance of the goods. This information includes the value of the consignment, the country of origin, the consignor (usually the supplier of the goods) and the importer (usually the buyer). From 1 October 2019, supplier registration numbers and information indicating which goods in a consignment have had GST collected at the point of sale will also be provided electronically to Customs where this information is provided to the customs broker, freight forwarder or carrier by the supplier of the goods. Currently, electronic information on mail items is generally not available, although this is starting to change. Customs is working with New Zealand Post to obtain and use electronic advance data as soon as possible. 29 Customs and Inland Revenue are working together to see how best to share information to assist Inland Revenue to monitor compliance. In the interim period until electronic advance data becomes fully available in the international postal network, Customs will advise Inland Revenue where it sees any patterns that it considers will be of interest. Officials also note that under Inland Revenue’s existing information collection powers, Inland Revenue would be able to request other information (such as retail banking data) for monitoring and enforcement purposes. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Requirement for name of the registered person Clause 24 Submission (Matter raised by officials) In the situation where a supplier, redeliverer or marketplace operator has collected GST on the supply of low-value imported goods, proposed new section 12(1B) requires the information provided to Customs to sufficiently identify the registered person who has collected GST at the point of sale. Proposed new section 24BAC requires the registered person to take reasonable steps to ensure that its registration number is available to Customs at the time of importation, but not its name. In many cases, Customs would already receive information about the name of the person that is responsible for returning GST (Customs already collects information about the consignor, who would typically be the actual seller of the goods or, in the redeliverer case, this would be the redeliverer). However, Customs does not currently collect information about the identity of the marketplace operator in the situation where imported goods are supplied through an electronic marketplace. Officials recommend that in addition to providing its registration number, a registered person required to return GST on a supply of low-value imported goods would need to take reasonable steps to ensure that its name is available to Customs at the time of importation of the goods. This would provide two data points for identification and data matching purposes, so that Customs and Inland Revenue data may be more easily matched for monitoring and enforcement purposes. Officials note that the name of the registered person is already required to be included on the receipt required to be issued to the consumer for the purposes of double taxation. Therefore, officials do not consider that an additional requirement to take reasonable steps to ensure the name of the registered person is included in the customs documentation would be onerous. This is because this information would likely be included in the documentation that would be provided by the supplier to the transporter or customs broker in the absence of the suggested amendment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 30 Issue: Receipts for supplies of low-value imported goods Clause 24 Submission (KPMG) The new section 24BAB of the GST Act should include a provision allowing a supplier to agree with the Commissioner an alternative set of information to be included in a receipt for the supply of low-value imported goods. There may be other information that can be provided by the supplier apart from the information prescribed in section 24BAB, or other ways that a supplier can show that GST has been charged on the supply of the goods. Comment Proposed new section 24BAB provides that a registered person who makes a supply of low- value imported goods must provide a receipt to the recipient containing a number of particulars. The purpose of requiring the supplier to provide a receipt is to give the recipient a document evidencing that GST has been collected on the goods supplied to them. This can then be used to ensure the goods are not taxed again at the border when the goods are imported, thus serving as a back-stop mechanism to prevent double taxation in the situation where GST information has not been included in the customs documentation. Officials agree there may be other information that can be included in a receipt by the supplier apart from the information prescribed in section 24BAB. Officials consider that it would be sensible and pragmatic to allow the Commissioner to agree an alternative set of information to be included in a receipt as suggested by the submitter, subject to Customs’ agreement. As the submitter has noted, such a provision would be similar to the existing provision in the GST Act allowing the Commissioner to alter the requirements of a tax invoice where certain requirements are met. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 31 REFUNDS WHERE DOUBLE TAXATION HAS OCCURRED Issue: Customs or Inland Revenue should refund GST when double taxation occurs Clause 17 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australian and New Zealand, EY, KPMG, PwC, Trade Me) Several submitters disagreed with the proposed requirement for the supplier to provide a GST refund in the situation where double taxation occurs, stating that either Customs or Inland Revenue should be responsible for providing refunds instead of the supplier (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, Trade Me). While not expressing a firm preference either way, one submitter noted that requiring the supplier to reimburse consumers when double taxation occurs may be less popular with consumers than a simple standardised process through Customs. (PwC) A number of submitters also suggested that either Customs or Inland Revenue should provide the refund if the consumer is unsuccessful in obtaining a refund from the supplier (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY), or if the occurrence of double taxation is not the fault of the supplier (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand). Comment It is expected that double taxation would be a rare occurrence under the proposals. This is mainly because the vast majority of consumer imports are well below the current de minimis (under the proposals, Customs would only collect GST on imported consignments valued above $1,000). The Bill also proposes a tiered approach for preventing double taxation in the situation where goods are imported by consumers in consignments valued above $1,000: • The first safeguard is the requirement for the supplier to take reasonable steps to ensure that GST information is available to Customs at the time of importation. Since $1,000 is the threshold where a full import entry is required to be completed (and therefore a customs broker would likely be engaged to complete the import documentation), this requirement should be effective for preventing double taxation on goods imported through the freight pathway – provided that suppliers comply with this requirement by passing the relevant information through the logistics chain (as described in the officials’ comment under Issue: Guidance on Customs’ procedures and how information for preventing double taxation is to be made available to Customs). • The second safeguard is the requirement for the supplier to issue a receipt to the consumer showing relevant GST information, which the consumer can provide to Customs as evidence that GST was paid at the point of sale. 32 In the rare instances where double taxation does occur, officials consider that placing the responsibility for providing a refund on the supplier is the best of the available options, for the following reasons: • It would provide suppliers with more incentive to take reasonable steps to prevent double taxation. • Australia has the same requirement. It is desirable for the New Zealand system to closely match the equivalent Australian system to reduce the potential for confusion and errors by suppliers. In most instances, customs brokers should be able to avert double taxation and avoid the need for a refund as they will receive details about GST from the suppliers. • It would be administratively difficult for Customs to provide refunds. To provide a refund, Customs would need validation from two sets of documents confirming: – that the supplier had collected GST on the purchase; and – the value of the goods. • Relying solely on a supplier invoice provided by the consumer would more easily allow fraud to occur, as supplier invoices can be doctored. • Having Inland Revenue provide refunds to consumers might result in higher compliance costs, for two reasons: – It is not likely that consumers would find it intuitive to approach Inland Revenue for a GST refund (being a party that they had not otherwise had any interaction with in relation to the transaction). – If the obligation to provide a refund was instead placed on Customs or the supplier, the consumer would likely only need to provide one set of documentation evidencing that they had been double-taxed. If, on the other hand, Inland Revenue was responsible for providing refunds, two sets of documentation (one evidencing that GST had been paid to the supplier, and the other evidencing that GST had been paid to Customs) would be required (or, at a minimum, evidence that GST was paid to the supplier and a declaration from the consumer that GST was also paid to Customs on importation of the goods). Officials consider there would be disproportionate administration costs involved in verifying whether a supplier was at fault or whether the supplier had refused to issue a refund, if a government agency were to provide a refund in these cases. A supplier unwilling to provide a refund may also be unwilling to provide documentation showing that GST was charged, so it is unclear how helpful this option may be for consumers in practice. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 33 Issue: Customs should provide information to suppliers evidencing that GST was paid on importation Clauses 17 and 26(5) Submission (KPMG) If the submission that Customs or Inland Revenue should refund the GST is not accepted, Customs should be required to provide information to the supplier that GST has been collected on importation to confirm that the consumer did pay GST on importation. Comment Where Customs collects revenue, it provides a receipt to the customs broker or importer, which the consumer may use in seeking a refund from the supplier. It would not be cost-effective for Customs to deal with the supplier directly, and under the proposed offshore supplier registration system the relationships are between the supplier and the consumer and the supplier and Inland Revenue. Officials consider it is desirable for the New Zealand refund process to match the Australian one in order to reduce confusion for suppliers and to facilitate compliance. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: GST refund should be the amount paid to Customs Clauses 17 and 26(5) Submission (Trade Me) If the submission to require Customs to provide GST refunds where double taxation occurs is not accepted, the submitter suggests that the supplier should be able to claim an input tax deduction for the GST paid by the consumer to Customs. This would enable the supplier to refund the consumer for the total amount of GST that the consumer paid to Customs. Comment Officials consider that refunding consumers for the amount of GST paid to Customs (as opposed to the amount of GST the supplier collected at the point of sale) would be more onerous for suppliers. This is because the supplier would need to know precisely how much the consumer paid to Customs, meaning that it would need to obtain a receipt from the consumer showing the amount of GST paid to Customs. In cases of double taxation, the Bill as it is currently drafted only requires the consumer to provide a declaration to the supplier that GST was paid to Customs. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 34 MARKETPLACE RULES Issue: Support for marketplace rules Clauses 5(1), (3), (6), 35 and 36 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter has indicated its support of the amendments extending the rules for electronic marketplaces and approved marketplaces that are already in place under the remote services regime to the low-value imported goods context. Comment Officials welcome the support for the amendments. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Significance of the electronic marketplace provisions and compliance costs for marketplaces Clause 35 Submission (Alibaba and eBay, KPMG, PwC, Trade Me) Several submitters have commented on the significance of the proposed extension of the existing electronic marketplace rules to supplies of low-value imported goods and have especially noted the significant compliance costs that this will impose on electronic marketplaces for goods. Specific points that submitters have raised include the following: • The proposed “supplier model” imposes costs and obligations on parties who are not the supplier. (KPMG) • The marketplace provisions will be crucial in terms of the overall success of the rules. (PwC) • The successful implementation of GST on remote services does not demonstrate the simplicity of imposing a GST liability on electronic marketplaces for goods. In the vast majority of cases, the collection obligation for GST on remote services is imposed on businesses directly controlling both the supply and pricing of services and intangibles with relatively standardised pricing. Electronic marketplaces for goods, on the other hand, generally do not control the pricing or supply of goods sold by third parties. (Alibaba and eBay) • The development cost of adjusting electronic marketplaces that service a global market to meet local demands is significant. Suggestions that this is a simple or costless process for electronic marketplaces are simply incorrect. (Alibaba and eBay) 35 • It is unfair to shift expensive compliance costs onto electronic marketplaces, rather than taking steps to increase collection by working in collaboration with electronic marketplaces. (Alibaba and eBay) • It is disproportionately expensive for marketplaces that provide an online classified-style platform to build automated systems to comply with complicated GST collection obligations. (Trade Me) Comment Officials see the rules for electronic marketplaces as being key to the success of the proposals. It is expected that the inclusion of these rules would maximise compliance with an offshore supplier registration system by imposing the bulk of the compliance obligations on a relatively small number of relatively large businesses, who are estimated to account for a sizeable proportion of the goods being imported into New Zealand by consumers. Officials acknowledge that the proposed rules do impose potentially significant compliance costs on operators of electronic marketplaces. Officials also recognise that the way that electronic marketplaces for goods work is different to how electronic marketplaces for intangibles typically work, particularly in relation to the marketplace’s degree of involvement in or control over the delivery of the product itself. Having said this, officials consider that aggregate compliance and administration costs under the proposals would be significantly higher in the absence of the electronic marketplace rules, as many more entities would be required to register for and collect and return GST to Inland Revenue. Officials note that, aside from the administration and enforcement benefits, the main rationale behind the electronic marketplace rules is to minimise aggregate compliance costs across the entire system by minimising the number of entities that are required to register under the rules. Recommendation That the submissions be noted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: $60,000 threshold should be applied to sales by underlying suppliers Clause 35 Submission (Alibaba and eBay) The submitter considers the Bill should be amended so that operators of electronic marketplaces are not required to collect GST on supplies by merchants with sales to New Zealand consumers below $60,000. Comment Excluding sales by suppliers below the $60,000 registration threshold from the electronic marketplace rules would require marketplace operators to determine which of their suppliers make less than $60,000 of supplies to New Zealand annually and configure their systems to only collect GST on sales by suppliers that are clearly above the $60,000 registration threshold. This would increase complexity and compliance costs under the rules. 36 Further, while an electronic marketplace operator would be able to calculate the value of an individual supplier’s sales through its own marketplace, it would not know how much the supplier sold to New Zealand consumers outside of the marketplace (that is, through the supplier’s own website or mail order, or on other electronic marketplaces). Allowing electronic marketplaces to not charge GST where an underlying supplier’s annual sales through the marketplace are below $60,000 would in some cases mean that the underlying supplier would be required to register for GST (thus increasing aggregate compliance costs). If the marketplaces that the supplier uses to sell goods to New Zealand collected the GST instead, the supplier may not be required to register at all. Underlying suppliers on marketplaces may also be incentivised to continually create new identities whenever they get near the $60,000 registration threshold to avoid having GST collected on their sales. Officials note that a non-resident supplier that is below the $60,000 registration threshold may potentially be quite a large business, as only its supplies to consumers in New Zealand would count towards the registration threshold – whereas all supplies made by New Zealand-resident businesses (including supplies to non-residents and to GST-registered businesses) count towards the $60,000 registration threshold. Officials also note that GST would be paid on imported goods purchased from offshore suppliers below the $60,000 registration threshold under alternative collection models that are based on collection at the border by Customs or by transporters, or that are based on consumers paying GST to the government by way of an app or online portal after the goods have been delivered. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarification of when an electronic marketplace will be responsible for GST Clause 35(4) Submission (Trade Me) The submitter has expressed concern that there is uncertainty around the situations where an operator of an electronic marketplace would or would not be treated as the supplier of goods sold on its marketplace by a third-party seller. The submitter has raised the following specific questions: • Would a marketplace that authorises the charge for a supply merely on behalf of the seller (or as a processing agent for the seller) still be considered to authorise the charge for the supply, and therefore be liable for GST on the supply? 37 • Would a marketplace directly or indirectly set a term or condition under which the supply is made if the operator has a contract with the seller that requires the seller to comply with the marketplace’s listing policies, including a requirement that goods sold comply with New Zealand law, but leaves it to the seller to set all of the terms and conditions under which an individual supply is made? Comment Under the proposed amendments to section 60C of the GST Act, an operator of an electronic marketplace would be treated as the supplier of goods that are sold on its platform by a third party (the underlying supplier) unless all the following conditions are met: • The documentation provided to the recipient identifies the supply as made by the underlying supplier and not the marketplace. • The underlying supplier and the operator of the marketplace have agreed in a document signed by them that the underlying supplier is liable for the payment of tax. • The electronic marketplace does not: – authorise the charge to the recipient; – make or authorise the delivery to the recipient; or – directly or indirectly set a term or condition under which the supply is made. The meaning of “authorise the charge for the supply to the recipient” is intended to be broad and cover the situation where the marketplace authorises the charge on behalf of the supplier or as a processing agent for the supplier. An electronic marketplace would authorise the charge to the recipient if it communicates the liability to pay to the customer, or otherwise influences whether or at what time the customer pays for the supply. This may be done by initiating the process through which the recipient is charged, and includes situations where the marketplace connects the recipient to a third-party payment processor who receives the marketplace operator’s instruction. To authorise the charge, it is not necessary for the marketplace operator to collect or receive the payment, or that it is involved in each of the steps in the payment authorisation process. The meaning of “directly or indirectly set a term or condition under which the supply is made” is also very broad. This concept looks beyond the formal contractual relationship to the influence exercised by the marketplace operator. To be responsible for GST on supplies because of this requirement, it is not necessary that the marketplace operator has any direct involvement in determining the contractual arrangements between underlying suppliers and buyers using the marketplace. A requirement for underlying suppliers to comply with the marketplace’s listing policies would in many cases mean that the marketplace does (at least indirectly) set a term or condition under which the supply is made, meaning that the marketplace operator would be responsible for GST on the supply. However, this may not be true in all cases and would depend on what the marketplace’s specific listing policies are. Officials do not consider that a requirement in a contract between the marketplace operator and the underlying supplier that goods sold on the marketplace must comply with New Zealand laws and regulations would in itself mean that the marketplace “directly or indirectly sets a term or condition under which the supply is made”. However, there are other common marketplace listing policies that would meet this test. In practice this means there will be very limited 38 circumstances where an electronic marketplace operator will not be responsible for GST on sales made by a non-resident underlying supplier though its marketplace. Comprehensive guidance, including illustrative examples of situations where a marketplace operator would or would not be treated as the supplier of low-value imported goods for GST purposes, will be provided in an upcoming special report on the rules shortly after enactment of the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be noted. The submitter’s questions are addressed in the above comment and will be further explained in the guidance materials. Issue: Risk of electronic marketplaces structuring around the rules and potential impacts on consumer protections Clause 35(4) Submission (Trade Me) The submitter is concerned that electronic marketplaces who are only caught by the proposed rules because they set some of the terms and conditions under which offshore sellers make sales on their platforms would be able to structure their way out of being responsible for GST on third-party sales. The submitter considers that such marketplaces could do this very easily by simply ensuring they do not (directly or indirectly) set any of the terms and conditions under which sales on the marketplace are made, and considers there is a real risk this would reduce the level of protections provided by marketplaces to consumers using these websites. Specifically, the submitter has cited an ATO Law Companion Ruling which provides an example of a marketplace that indirectly sets terms under which a supply is made by requiring use of its grievance or dispute management procedure for sellers and buyers 4 , and has commented that: “We believe New Zealand consumers would be disadvantaged if classified marketplaces changed their business models to remove grievance and dispute management practices. We think this would be bad policy. New Zealand’s policy framework should encourage e- commerce sites to implement trust and safety processes, and ensure that goods sold comply with New Zealand laws and other consumer protection mechanisms, rather than discourage this.” To ensure that electronic marketplaces are not incentivised to reduce the level of protections they provide to consumers, the submitter considers that the coverage of the proposed marketplace rules should be broader so that the likes of online classified-style marketplaces that provide a messaging service between buyers and sellers and social media marketplaces are clearly captured. The submitter has further suggested that examples be included in the legislation to accompany the re-drafted provisions. 4 https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/document?DocID=COG/LCR20182/NAT/ATO/00001, see paragraph 89 on page 15. 39 Comment Given the breadth of common marketplace listing policies that the “directly or indirectly set a term or condition under which the supply is made” wording would cover, it is not clear that it would be simple for an established marketplace that already (at least indirectly) sets some terms and conditions for sales on its platform to change its business model to avoid the proposed rules. Further, it may be the case that there are counteracting reasons why it may not be commercially viable for such electronic marketplace operators to reduce their involvement in or exert less influence over transactions on their platforms such that they do not (even indirectly) “set a term or condition under which the supply is made”. For instance, in an online shopping environment – and possibly even more so in a cross-border online shopping context – consumers already have strong incentives to purchase from trusted websites that have consumer-friendly policies. It seems likely that marketplaces that set terms and conditions that provide greater protection to consumers using their websites would enjoy a competitive advantage because of this. Having said this, officials understand the submitter’s concern and acknowledge that this might be a potential risk. Inland Revenue officials will monitor whether marketplaces change their existing business structures in response to the rules to see if this risk transpires in practice. Officials do not consider the drafting changes suggested by the submitter are necessary as there is a very limited set of situations in practice where an electronic marketplace operator would not be responsible for GST on a supply of low-value imported goods made on its platform to a consumer in New Zealand. Officials consider that the amendments to section 60C in the Bill already achieve the policy intention of making the electronic marketplace rules as broad as possible within the constraint of ensuring the rules are workable. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but the specific concerns around the potential adverse impacts on consumer protections be noted. Issue: Goods in New Zealand sold over a marketplace Clause 6 Submission (Trade Me) The submitter has expressed concern that goods in New Zealand will be captured by the proposed rules when these goods are sold over a marketplace by a non-resident, and does not see any policy rationale for why the proposed rules have been drafted in this way. The submitter considers there are instances where this would be unfair to its sellers. The submitter recommends that the phrase “and the goods are outside New Zealand at the time of supply” be inserted at the end of proposed new section 4B(1)(c)(ii), with a requirement that marketplace operators can only treat goods as being inside New Zealand if they have information that supports this. 40 Comment There is a practical reason why the electronic marketplace rules are proposed to apply to supplies of goods by non-resident underlying suppliers without regard to where the goods are located at the time of supply. The rules proposed in the Bill would require operators of electronic marketplaces to determine the residency of their underlying suppliers; a further requirement that GST should not be charged if the marketplace operator has information that the goods are already situated in New Zealand may make the rules more complex for electronic marketplaces to apply in practice. Officials understand that one of the submitter’s main concerns is in relation to goods that are listed for sale on an electronic marketplace by a person that has moved from New Zealand to Australia, or moves relatively frequently between Australia and New Zealand. Examples of this that the submitter has raised relate to the situation where the goods are to be picked up by the buyer from a place in New Zealand. In the specific scenario where the goods are picked up by the buyer (rather than either the supplier or the marketplace operator arranging delivery of the goods to the buyer), the operator of the marketplace would not be required to collect GST on the sale. This is because the proposed rules hinge on the goods being delivered to a place in New Zealand, where the delivery is made, arranged or assisted by the supplier of the goods (or by the underlying supplier, if a marketplace operator is treated as the supplier for GST purposes). In other situations, where there may be some complexity involved in determining the residency of an underlying supplier and the marketplace operator has information that the goods are located in New Zealand, officials suggest that the ship-from location of the goods could be used as one of the two pieces of information required to support the conclusion that the underlying supplier is a New Zealand resident. Officials also note the proposed ability for the Commissioner to agree with marketplace operators on alternative methods for determining the residency of underlying suppliers in situations where the default methods are too difficult to apply in practice, or where there are good reasons why an alternative method might be more accurate. The submitter cited another example of non-resident suppliers importing goods into New Zealand before listing the goods for sale on an electronic marketplace. In this instance, the non- resident underlying supplier may be able to make use of the proposed amendment to the rule in section 60(1C) which treats a supply of goods to a consumer in New Zealand through an electronic marketplace as two separate supplies. This would allow the underlying supplier (if registered for GST in New Zealand) to make an input tax deduction for any New Zealand GST incurred in making the supply, including import GST paid to Customs. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 41 Issue: Discounts offered by marketplaces provision Clause 12(2) Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, KPMG) Submitters have commented that the drafting of the valuation provision that applies in the situation where an electronic marketplace offers a discount for goods sold on its platform by a third-party seller could be clearer. Submitters have suggested the following drafting changes: • That the language of the provision be simplified by deleting the phrase “if the amount of the reduction would otherwise form part of the consideration for the supply”. (EY) • The phrase “does not include the amount of a reduction” in section 10(7D) is ambiguous. The wording should be amended to make it clear that the consideration on which GST will be payable by the marketplace operator is the amount, net of any discount or reduction provided by the marketplace operator. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) • If the dependent clause is omitted, the relevant part of the provision reads “the consideration for the supply does not include the amount of a reduction... in the price of the supply for the recipient”. Supplies are made to recipients, rather than for recipients. If “for” is intended to refer to the price, rather than the supply, then the phrase “for the recipient” is not needed. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) One submitter has also commented that the example provided on page 50 of the Commentary to the Bill is unclear, and has requested that a clear example be included in the upcoming special report. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment Officials agree that the drafting of the provision could be clearer and will consult submitters on a revised draft of the provision to ensure that the points raised by submitters are addressed. Guidance on the rule, including a clear example of the calculation, will also be provided in the special report and in the Tax Information Bulletin following enactment of the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 42 SAFE HARBOUR RULES FOR ELECTRONIC MARKETPLACES AND REDELIVERERS Clause 37 Issue: General support for safe harbour rules Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, PwC) Submitters have expressed general support for the safe harbour rules in proposed new sections 60F and 60G, but have noted some concerns with specific aspects of the rules. These specific concerns, along with improvements suggested by submitters, are noted as a separate issue below. Comment Officials welcome the support for the safe harbour rules. The proposed safe harbour rules are intended to address the practical issue for electronic marketplaces and redeliverers where they may not have paid enough GST on a supply of goods that was actually made by a third party, as a result of: • having insufficient information to determine that the supply is of “distantly taxable” goods to a consumer in New Zealand; or • relying on inaccurate or misleading information provided by a third party (such as the actual seller of the goods). Recommendation That the submission be noted. The submission does not require any amendment to the Bill. Issue: Practical concerns with the safe harbour rules Submission (Alibaba and eBay, KPMG, PwC, Trade Me) Submitters have made a number of comments on the drafting of the proposed safe harbour rules: • The drafting of section 60G is difficult to understand and will not be simple to apply. An overall purpose provision should be included to aid interpretation, and careful consideration should be given to simplifying the detailed drafting style of this aspect of the rules. (PwC) 43 • Proposed section 60G(1) prescribes an exhaustive list of situations where a marketplace operator or a redeliverer will not be liable for GST on sales because it has relied on incorrect or misleading information provided by an underlying supplier or by a consumer. The section should not be an exhaustive list, but rather should be an inclusive list of situations where a marketplace operator or a redeliverer will not be liable for GST on supplies of low-value imported goods where it has relied on incorrect or misleading information provided by another party. (Alibaba and eBay, KPMG) • The requirement for a marketplace operator to obtain a declaration from the underlying supplier that they are resident in New Zealand under proposed section 60G(2)(a)(iii) should be removed. (KPMG) • Section 60G(5) should also include the location from where the goods are being shipped as one of the items of information that a marketplace operator can rely on in determining the residency of the underlying supplier. (KPMG) • In the situation where the marketplace operator does not know the address the goods are to be delivered to, the operator should be able to use items of information to determine the customer’s likely residency status at the time of the transaction (rather than the analysis hinging on where the person is “usually located”). For instance, it would be helpful if the ability to agree on an alternative method for determining the country or territory the goods are most likely to delivered to could be expanded to cover alternative information requirements for determining the residency of buyers that move between Australia and New Zealand frequently. (Trade Me) One submitter also noted that when the law is enacted, Inland Revenue will need to put in place an efficient process so that agreements between the Commissioner and marketplaces can be made in a timely manner before the proposals come into effect. (PwC) Comment Officials agree with the drafting points raised by submitters. Officials will consider ways to improve the clarity and breadth of section 60G, and have taken on board the specific suggestions of removing the requirement for electronic marketplace operators to obtain declarations from underlying suppliers and including the location from where the goods are shipped as one of the items of information that may be used to determine the underlying supplier’s residency status. Officials will consult with submitters on a revised draft of the provisions. Officials note the recommendation that Inland Revenue will need to prioritise putting in place an efficient process for agreeing alternative methods with electronic marketplaces and redeliverers once the law is enacted. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 44 VALUATION ISSUES Issue: Separate valuation methodologies for determining whether goods are low value goods and for calculating GST Clauses 12(2) and 13 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Trade Me) Under the proposed rules, a supplier must first determine whether goods are “low-value goods”. If the goods are low-value goods, the supplier must then charge GST based on the value of the supply. However, the valuation methods for determining whether goods are low-value goods and for calculating the amount of GST are different. One submitter has noted that it is important that offshore suppliers be made aware of the distinction, and has recommended that a clear explanation is included in the upcoming special report on the rules and in the information given to overseas businesses looking to register for GST. This information should include examples of the calculation under each valuation method. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Another submitter has noted that consumers benefit from the full price of goods (including freight) being clearly displayed at the time of purchase. The submitter considers it is inappropriate to reduce the value of the goods by the cost of transport, insurance charges and duties, which they state is inherently hard for online classified-style electronic marketplaces to calculate. The submitter recommends that marketplaces should be able to use the total purchase price when assessing GST liability. (Trade Me) Comment Officials acknowledge that having two different valuation methods for the purposes of determining whether goods are “low-value goods” and the amount of GST to be returned on a supply of low-value goods could be confusing. The upcoming special report on the rules (as well as other information provided to affected businesses) will contain a clear explanation of the two valuation methods, including examples of each calculation. At the time of the release of the discussion document, GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system, feedback was sought on whether requiring suppliers to use just one consistent valuation method for both purposes (being the total amount paid for the item including freight and associated insurance but excluding GST) might be a better approach. Most submitters on the discussion document who commented on this issue favoured taking the same approach as Australia, which is to require suppliers to use a reasonable estimate of the “customs value” of an item (referred to in the Bill as “entry value”) when determining whether goods are low-value goods. A reasonable estimate of the customs value would generally be the amount paid for the item (excluding GST) less any clearly separable charges paid by the customer for freight and insurance. Submitters cited the following reasons for this preference: 45 • Consistency with Australia’s similar new legislation would be more familiar for suppliers, electronic marketplaces and redeliverers that have registered under Australia’s new law, and therefore may be easier for these businesses to implement and generate less confusion than the alternative approach. • Using an approximation of the customs value may be easier for websites that enable consumers to purchase goods via an online checkout process. Because delivery charges are typically not known until the customer proceeds to the checkout, it may be easier to set up systems to add GST where the value of the good is $1,000 or less before the addition of insurance and freight charges. The collection of GST on the delivery charges can be accommodated by adding GST to the delivery charge at the end of the process. • If instead the overall transaction value (including freight and insurance) was the basis for determining if a good is above or below the threshold, whether GST applies would not be determined until the very end of the process. From a customer experience perspective it is preferable that the prices quoted by the supplier include all applicable taxes. • The inclusion of freight and insurance charges in the declared values on customs documents would be difficult for freight forwarders and customs brokers to ascertain on a consignment-by-consignment basis and may provide greater incentives for the declared freight values to be different to what was actually paid by the consumer. Further, because the $1,000 threshold would be applied by suppliers on an item-by-item basis in determining whether to charge GST, officials note that basing the low-value goods threshold on the total transaction value of an item (including freight and insurance) would require apportionment of delivery charges in instances where the customer pays a single delivery charge for multiple goods. This could potentially be complex, and therefore may increase compliance costs for suppliers. Officials do not see any reason why requiring suppliers and marketplaces to use an approximation of the customs value to determine whether GST is required to be collected on an item should prevent websites from displaying the full shipped price of goods to consumers where the amount of freight and insurance is known. Officials also note that the amount of GST would still be calculated on the overall transaction value (or full landed value) of the goods, including freight and insurance, which means that suppliers would not be able to substitute between the price of the goods and any explicit charges for freight and insurance to reduce the amount of GST payable. Recommendation That the submission that the overall transaction value be used for determining whether goods are low-value goods be declined, but the comments about the need for clear guidance on the two valuation methodologies be noted. The valuation methodologies will be explained in the guidance. 46 Issue: Valuation rule in section 10(7E) for calculating the amount of GST Clause 12(2) Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, David Johnston) One submitter has raised a number of technical issues with the rule in proposed section 10(7E), which is intended to ensure that GST is calculated on the full landed value of the goods, including any extra amounts charged by the supplier for delivery and associated insurance. • Proposed sections 10B(2)(a) and 10B(3) in the Bill allow a supplier to use “a reasonable estimate of the transport and insurance charges... when the item leaves the country”, although this approach does not appear to be reflected in proposed section 10(7E). • There appears to be a lack of clarity as to how the GST on freight and associated insurance costs should be calculated. • In addition, offshore suppliers will sometimes not know the cost of freight or insurance at the time of sale, and they will need to reimburse consumers for over charged freight or insurance costs. In these cases, the lack of clarity above means it is not clear whether the offshore supplier can use a “reasonable estimate” or whether subsequent adjustment to GST returns will be required. The submitter recommends that the proposed legislation be clarified, and that offshore suppliers be allowed to use a reasonable estimate of the transport and insurance charges at the time of sale when calculating GST. (David Johnston) Further, two submitters consider that section 10(7E) is unclear as to what types of services are intended to be covered by the provision, and have requested that: • The types of services covered by the rule are described in the upcoming special report (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand); • The proposed legislation is clarified, so it is clear in section 10(7E) that freight and associated insurance costs are included in the value of the goods for the purpose of calculating the amount of GST (David Johnston). Comment The intention behind proposed section 10(7E) is to ensure that GST generally applies to additional amounts paid by a consumer purchasing low-value imported goods for services that are closely related to the supply of the low-value imported goods, where these services are arranged or facilitated by the supplier of the goods. Such services include (but are not necessarily limited to) international freight and associated insurance. In the scenario described in one of the submissions, where the supplier does not know the total cost of freight and insurance and charges the consumer a fee based on an estimate of this cost, GST would apply at the time of supply to the full amount of the fee charged by the supplier. However, if the supplier subsequently refunds the consumer some amount of the fee because it had overestimated the freight and insurance cost, then technically an adjustment in the supplier’s GST return would be required under the credit note provisions in the GST Act. 47 Officials understand the submitter’s point is that some offshore suppliers and marketplaces may not want to incur the compliance cost of adjusting their GST returns in the situation where they reimburse consumers for overestimated freight and insurance costs, even though making such adjustments would reduce the amount of GST these businesses are required to pay to Inland Revenue. Officials consider that the practice described in the submission of reimbursing consumers for overestimated freight and insurance costs is likely unique to a relatively small number of offshore suppliers and marketplaces, and therefore may not warrant the inclusion of a specific exception to the requirement to make an adjustment. Further, it seems likely that it would only be in rare situations that the supplier would have filed its GST return before reimbursing the customer. For these reasons, officials consider that it would be rare for an adjustment to be required to a subsequent GST return as a result of reimbursing the customer for overestimated shipping costs, and therefore an exception from the requirement to make an adjustment is not necessary. While officials acknowledge that section 10(7E) could be more explicit that freight is intended to be covered by the provision, officials are hesitant to include an explicit reference to freight or transportation services. This is because the rule is intended to apply broadly to services that are provided directly in connection with the goods, and so an explicit reference to freight might narrow the scope of the rule (or be interpreted as narrowing the scope of the rule) to freight and associated insurance, or to services that are related or similar to freight. While an explicit reference to insurance has been included in the wording of the provision, this is because officials consider that insurance is unlikely to be covered by the “directly in connection” test – whereas freight would meet this test. While not incorporating the specific suggestions from submitters into the revised drafting of the provision, officials have made some changes to the drafting to improve the clarity of the provision. Guidance on the rule, including examples of the types of services that might be covered by the provision and how to calculate the amount of GST on freight and insurance charges, will also be provided in the upcoming special report and in the Tax Information Bulletin following enactment. Recommendation That the submissions requesting that section 10(7E) be amended to explicitly refer to freight and that adjustments not be required where freight charges are partially reimbursed be declined. Detailed guidance on the rule will be provided following enactment of the legislation. 48 Issue: Clarification of “entry value” where goods are already in New Zealand Clause 13 Submission (EY) To determine if an item is a low-value good, suppliers will be required to assess the item’s entry value in accordance with proposed section 10B. Reasonable estimates are permitted of certain transport and insurance charges and of tax and duty due. Section 10B should also clarify the manner of determining the entry values of goods already located in New Zealand (when supplied through a marketplace), as the Bill does not cover this situation. Comment Goods that are already located in New Zealand at the time of supply are included in the definition of “distantly taxable goods” in the limited situation where these goods are supplied by a non-resident underlying supplier through a marketplace. In practical terms, this means that operators of marketplaces would not distinguish between goods that are already in New Zealand at the time of supply (being the earlier of when an invoice is issued for the supply or a payment is received) and those that are not. In the situation where the goods are not actually shipped from an overseas jurisdiction but are instead sourced from a place in New Zealand, the intention is that a reasonable estimate of an item’s entry value would be the price paid by the customer for the item, exclusive of any explicit transport or insurance charges and any amounts included in the price for tax and duty. However, as the submitter has pointed out, the Bill does not provide for this outcome. Officials agree that the determination of the goods’ entry values in this situation should be clarified in the Bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarification of exchange rates No clause in Bill Submission (CAPEC New Zealand) The submitter is concerned that where the price of a good is expressed in a foreign currency, the supplier would be required to determine whether the goods are low-value goods using either a buy NZD rate or a midpoint rate (being an exchange rate that is between the sell NZD and buy NZD rate). Since New Zealand Customs currently uses a sell NZD rate (set on a fortnightly basis) to calculate whether goods are above the de minimis, the submitter is concerned there is an increased risk of double taxation if the supplier is required to use a buy NZD rate or a midpoint rate. 49 Comment Suppliers will be allowed to use sell NZD rates to determine whether goods are low-value goods (as well as for the purpose of determining how much GST is required to be returned in New Zealand dollars when filing their GST returns). The Bill imposes no restrictions on the specific type of exchange rate that suppliers may use, meaning that suppliers have a choice of using a sell NZD rate, midpoint rate or buy NZD rate. Clarification on this point will be provided in the upcoming special report and in the Tax Information Bulletin following enactment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. The submission is addressed in the above comment and will be further explained in the guidance materials. Issue: “Entry value” versus “customs value” Clause 5(2) Submission (Matter raised by officials) The proposals in the Bill apply GST to goods that individually have an “entry value” of $1,000 or less. The valuation methodology that “entry value” refers to is more commonly referred to as “customs value”, being the widely used terminology in the goods transportation and logistics industry. The Australian legislation applying GST to supplies of low-value goods imported into Australia also refers to “customs value”. Officials recommend that the references to “entry value” in the Bill be replaced with “customs value” to minimise potential confusion for suppliers, goods transporters and customs brokers. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 50 SUPPLIES TO NEW ZEALAND GST-REGISTERED BUSINESSES Issue: Support for the business-to-business exclusion Clause 9(6) Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, PwC) Two submitters indicated their support of the proposed exclusion of business-to-business supplies from the scope of the rules. One submitter commented that the decision to tax only supplies to private consumers (rather than all New Zealand residents, including GST-registered businesses) creates an additional compliance burden for suppliers. However, on balance, the submitter considered this to be justified given the risk to the tax base if suppliers were not compliant, but businesses could claim back GST on purchases. The submitter further noted the Australian law also only applies to supplies to private consumers, and therefore the main suppliers should already be accustomed to applying this rule for Australia. (PwC) Comment Officials welcome the support for the amendments. Recommendation That the submission be noted. The submission does not require any amendment to the Bill. Issue: Clarification that suppliers are able to issue a document that fulfils the requirements of a tax invoice and a GST receipt Clause 23(2) to (6) Submission (Deloitte) The submitter recommends that clear guidance is issued to confirm that suppliers are able to issue documents that qualify both as a tax invoice and as a GST receipt required to be issued to consumers for the purposes of preventing double taxation. Enabling overseas suppliers to issue a single document regardless of the business-to-consumer or business-to-business nature of the supply will streamline administration in many instances and could encourage higher levels of compliance. Comment The Bill proposes an amendment to extend an existing rule that allows a non-resident supplier of remote services that has incorrectly charged GST on a business-to-business supply to issue a tax invoice to the customer. Under the amendment, a non-resident supplier of low-value 51 imported goods would be able to issue a tax invoice for a business-to-business supply where GST had been incorrectly charged, provided that the value of the supply is $1,000 or less. The current drafting of the amendment does not clearly allow an offshore supplier to issue a tax invoice in the situation where the charging of GST on a business-to-business supply was deliberate. For instance, it is clear from the guidance materials issued on the rule from when it was first introduced that the ability to issue a tax invoice was only intended to apply in the situation where GST had been inadvertently charged on a business-to-business supply. Provided that the value of the supply is $1,000 or less, officials see little concern in allowing suppliers that principally make business-to-consumer supplies to simply charge GST on a business-to-business supply of low-value imported goods, as there is little risk of missing trader fraud associated with low-value supplies. Officials therefore recommend a further amendment to clarify that if the value of a supply of low-value imported goods is $1,000 or less, non-resident suppliers may simply charge GST without being required to determine whether the customer is a consumer or a GST-registered business. In this situation, there is no reason why an offshore supplier should not be able to issue a single document that fulfils the requirements of both a full tax invoice and a receipt required under proposed section 24BAB. Clear guidance confirming that offshore suppliers are able to do so will be provided following enactment of the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Deduction prohibition for GST-registered recipients of low-value imported goods Clause 19(8) Submission (Deloitte) An existing rule in section 20(4C) of the GST Act prohibits a New Zealand GST-registered business from claiming an input tax deduction for a supply of remote services that it has acquired from a non-resident supplier if the consideration for the supply exceeds $1,000. The submitter questions the need for the proposed extension of this rule to the situation where a GST-registered business purchases imported goods from a non-resident and the value of the supply is above $1,000. While the submitter understands this requirement is being inserted because of the risk of potential missing trader fraud and accepts that section 20(4C) is a valid requirement in respect of remote services, the submitter questions whether the risk of fraud is as high for goods. At a minimum, the submitter recommends the Commissioner should have discretion to allow a New Zealand GST-registered business to claim input tax deductions on high-value imported goods where the non-resident supplier has a good compliance history with Inland Revenue. Many overseas entities are likely to want to charge GST on all sales of goods into New Zealand for systems simplification reasons. In such an environment, compliance costs will be increased 52 if non-resident suppliers are required to make direct GST refunds if they have charged GST to New Zealand business customers who are not allowed to claim back GST in the usual way. Comment New Zealand and a number of overseas jurisdictions have had past experience with GST fraud on certain types of high-value business-to-business supplies, including even in a purely domestic (as opposed to cross-border) context. Officials are concerned that allowing non- residents to charge GST on high-value supplies of imported goods to GST-registered businesses may therefore create a real revenue risk from missing trader fraud (that is, where the supplier would not return the GST collected to Inland Revenue but the purchaser, which could be an associated entity, can still claim back GST on the purchase). Therefore, while officials are comfortable with allowing non-residents to charge GST on low- value business-to-business supplies, officials consider the proposed extension of the deduction prohibition rule in section 20(4C) is justified given the specific concern about high-value supplies. Officials recognise that the submitter’s suggestion of having a Commissioner discretion to allow some “trusted” non-resident suppliers to charge GST on high-value business-to-business supplies of imported goods may be one way to alleviate this concern. However, given the severity of the potential risk, officials consider that such a discretion would likely be exercised less often than the similar proposed discretion to allow suppliers to charge GST on supplies of high-value imported goods to New Zealand consumers. This could lead to perceptions of unfairness, as there is a chance that such a rule may end up being perceived as a concession for large, well-known offshore suppliers but not for smaller offshore suppliers that Inland Revenue knows little about and who may equally want to charge GST on high-value business-to-business supplies. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Missing cross-reference in provision validating supplier’s treatment of supply No clause in Bill Submission (Matter raised by officials) Existing section 24(5D) applies in the situation where GST is incorrectly charged at the rate of 15 percent on a business-to-business supply of remote services and the offshore supplier opts to provide the recipient with a tax invoice. The section re-characterises the supply as being subject to GST at the rate of 15%, validating the supplier’s treatment of the supply. To achieve this outcome, section 24(5D) refers to “circumstances where section 8(4D) was incorrectly applied to the treatment of the supply” (section 8(4D) being the provision that excludes business-to-business supplies of remote services from GST). 53 Since the business-to-business exclusion in section 8(4D) only applies to supplies of remote services (and not supplies of low-value imported goods), the addition of a cross-reference to section 8(4E), being the exclusion for business-to-business supplies of low-value imported goods, is necessary for the provision to work correctly in the low-value imported goods scenario. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Claiming New Zealand input tax Clause 14(1) Submission (Matter raised by officials) To allow offshore suppliers to claim input tax deductions for goods and services acquired for use in making supplies to GST-registered New Zealand businesses, the Bill proposes to allow these suppliers to zero-rate their supplies of low-value imported goods to New Zealand GST- registered businesses. However, the zero-rating approach currently proposed in the Bill may be unfamiliar and complex for offshore suppliers. It would also not address the issue of input tax recovery for offshore suppliers to the extent that the use of the relevant inputs is unrelated to making taxable supplies to New Zealand customers (for instance, the expenses relate to an offshore business activity of making supplies to other non-residents). Offshore suppliers of remote services and low-value imported goods should be entitled to claim their New Zealand expenses back, so that GST is neither a tax borne by businesses nor a tax on consumption occurring offshore. To ensure cross-border business-to-business neutrality, special rules applying to non-resident businesses that do not make any supplies in New Zealand were introduced in 2011 to allow these businesses to claim refunds of GST incurred on business expenses. For the purposes of claiming input tax, a deduction rule in section 20(3L) of the GST Act allows non-resident businesses registered under the special rules to claim back any input tax that relates to their worldwide taxable activity (for example, GST incurred in sending employees to a conference in New Zealand). However, offshore suppliers of remote services and low-value imported goods cannot take advantage of the special rules, as to qualify for these rules the non-resident business must not make any taxable supplies in New Zealand. For cross-border neutrality reasons and to simplify the rules for offshore suppliers, officials recommend that the zero-rating proposal currently in the Bill be removed in favour of extending the existing deduction rule in section 20(3L) to offshore suppliers of remote services and low- value imported goods. Officials have previously consulted with some stakeholders on the suggested approach and these stakeholders were supportive of this approach. Officials will also consult submitters on the drafting of the amendments. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 54 OPTION TO CHARGE GST ON SUPPLIES OF HIGH-VALUE GOODS Clause 13 Issue: Support for the rules allowing suppliers to charge GST on high-value goods Submission (Deloitte, Trade Me) Submitters have expressed support for the policy of allowing offshore suppliers, marketplaces and redeliverers to elect to collect GST on supplies of high-value goods (being goods that are individually valued above $1,000). Comment Officials welcome the support for the amendments. The rules in proposed new section 10C will allow suppliers who meet certain requirements to elect to collect and return GST on goods above $1,000 supplied to New Zealand customers. The rules consist of: • a self-assessed test, which suppliers may use to determine their eligibility to charge GST on their supplies of high-value goods (being goods valued above $1,000) to consumers in New Zealand; and • a Commissioner discretion to allow suppliers not meeting the self-assessment test to charge GST on supplies of high-value goods. The rules should eliminate compliance costs for suppliers in distinguishing between low and high-value goods, in the situation where these compliance costs are likely to be disproportionate to the potential revenue risk associated with replacing the collection of GST on the supplier’s high-value goods at the border with collection by the supplier at the point of sale. This would apply where the total value of high-value goods supplied to New Zealand consumers is relatively low, or where there is otherwise no good reason to consider that allowing the supplier to charge GST on high-value goods supplied to New Zealand consumers poses a significant revenue risk (for instance, because the supplier has a good tax compliance history). Recommendation That the submission be noted. The submission does not require any amendment to the Bill. Issue: 95 percent threshold in the self-assessed test Submission (EY) The submitter considers that the 95 percent threshold appears arbitrary, noting that general feedback it has received from stakeholders is that the threshold for the self-assessed test is too high. The submitter has suggested 75 percent as a threshold that would more effectively reduce compliance costs for suppliers. 55 Comment Under the self-assessed test as drafted in the Bill, suppliers would be entitled to elect to collect GST on supplies of high-value goods if 95 percent or less of the total value of goods sold to customers in New Zealand is of goods that are individually valued at or below $1,000. Officials agree that a 75 percent threshold would make the test easier for suppliers to apply and reduce compliance costs. New Zealand’s experience with the legislation applying GST to imported services and digital products (known as the remote services rules) has shown it is generally worth making the design of the rules as simple and easy as possible for offshore suppliers to comply with. Doing so tends to produce good compliance outcomes. Officials consider that the suggested 75 percent threshold strikes an appropriate balance between minimising compliance costs (being the main purpose of the test) and minimising potential risk to the Crown revenue. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Complexity of the self-assessed test Submission (PwC) The submitter considers that proposed section 10C (containing the rules allowing suppliers to charge GST on their supplies of high-value imported goods) is unnecessarily lengthy and complex. Given that its ultimate intention is to reduce compliance costs for suppliers, the submitter is concerned that the provision may not be used as it may be too difficult for suppliers to apply. The submitter has suggested that it be replaced with a very simple provision allowing the Commissioner to agree that a supplier may collect GST on all its supplies, taking into account various matters including the overall mix of low and high-value supplies and the supplier’s general history of tax compliance. Comment While the intention behind the self-assessed 95 percent test is relatively simple, officials acknowledge that the drafting of the provisions is complex. However, on the basis of other submissions received, it appears that some suppliers of low-value imported goods would find it useful to charge GST on their high-value goods using the rule, rather than being required in all cases to apply for approval to charge GST on high-value goods supplied to New Zealand consumers. Where suppliers are unsure that they meet the test, the option of applying to the Commissioner for an exercise of her discretion would still be available. For these reasons, officials recommend that the self-assessment test is not removed entirely, and instead improvements be made to make the test more user-friendly (such as decreasing the proposed threshold from 95 percent to 75 percent and making the test a one-off assessment by removing the requirement to check annually whether the test was met for the previous period). 56 Officials will consider what drafting simplifications can be made and will consult with interested submitters on any revised drafting of the provisions. Detailed guidance will also be provided in an upcoming special report on the rules following enactment of the legislation and in the Tax Information Bulletin. Officials will also focus on ensuring that material on the Inland Revenue website explaining the self-assessed test is clear and concise. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarification of how the election applies to goods already in New Zealand Submission (EY) The submitter has requested clarification of how the election to charge GST on supplies of high- value goods works for goods already situated in New Zealand (that is, in circumstances where the goods are supplied through a GST-registered electronic marketplace). Comment An operator of an electronic marketplace would be able to elect to charge GST on supplies of high-value goods if it reasonably believes that 95 percent or more of the total value of goods sold on its marketplace in the initial year of the election by non-residents to New Zealand consumers will be low-value goods. In assessing whether or not this test is met, the operator of the marketplace would include any goods supplied by a non-resident, regardless of where the goods are located at the time of supply. A marketplace operator that makes the election would be treated as the supplier of any high- value goods supplied to a New Zealand consumer by a non-resident underlying supplier – including any goods that are already in New Zealand at the time of supply. The upcoming special report will explain the rules. Recommendation That the submission be noted. The submission is addressed in the above comment and will be further explained in the guidance materials. 57 Issue: Compliance history of the taxpayer should be put into context Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) In considering whether a supplier that does not meet the self-assessment test may charge GST on its supplies of high-value goods, proposed section 10C(4)(a) requires the Commissioner to consider the compliance history of the registered person and any associated persons. The compliance history must be taken in context. Other countries may have different tax laws and different tax regimes. Moreover, it may be necessary to give compliance with some regimes more weight than others – for example, in some jurisdictions the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) rules have been enacted in response to particular concerns, so non-compliance may be as a result of the legislative framework at the time or commercial arrangements entered into prior to the law change. Comment Officials note the points raised by the submitter. In practice, the Commissioner will consider the supplier’s compliance history on a case-by-case basis in determining whether to grant her discretion to allow a supplier to charge GST on its supplies of high-value imported goods. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 58 OTHER ISSUES Issue: Clarification of application of the registration threshold No clause in Bill Submission (CAPEC New Zealand) The submitter has requested clarification of whether charges for shipping would be counted towards the $60,000 registration threshold when determining if an offshore supplier of low- value imported goods is required to register for GST. Comment The value of a supply of low-value imported goods would generally be inclusive of any explicit freight or insurance charges charged by the supplier to the New Zealand consumer. This would generally apply even in the situation where there is a separate zero-rated supply of international transportation, as a rule in proposed section 10(7E) requires amounts charged for shipping to be included in the valuation of the supply for the purposes of calculating the amount of GST to be returned. Therefore, in calculating the total value of their supplies of goods and services in New Zealand to determine whether they are above the $60,000 registration threshold, offshore suppliers are required to include amounts they have charged for shipping. Under section 51 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act), non-resident suppliers of low-value imported goods will be required to register for GST if the total value of their supplies of goods and services in New Zealand: • in the past 12 months exceeded NZ$60,000 (unless the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is satisfied that their supplies in the next 12 months will not exceed this threshold); or • in the next 12 months is expected to exceed NZ$60,000. Under the amendments proposed in the Bill, supplies by a non-resident of low-value imported goods will count towards the registration threshold where the supply is to a consumer. Recommendation That the submission be noted. The submission is addressed in the above comment and will be further explained in the guidance materials. 59 Issue: Clarification that the proposals do not apply to alcohol and tobacco Clauses 13, 35(4) and 36(4) Submission (Matter raised by officials) The proposed rules allowing suppliers to charge GST on their supplies of high-value imported goods apply too widely, as proposed section 10C(3) would arguably treat any supply of high- value goods as a supply of “distantly taxable goods” if the goods are delivered at a place in New Zealand. For example, the provision may be interpreted as potentially applying to supplies of alcohol and tobacco, even though alcoholic beverages and tobacco products do not meet the definition of “distantly taxable goods” in proposed new section 4B. Similarly, proposed sections 60C(2)(b)(iii) and 60D(2)(c)(iii) in the rules for electronic marketplaces and approved marketplaces also apply too widely. These provisions would arguably treat any supply of low-value goods made through a marketplace as a supply of distantly taxable goods by the marketplace operator, if the underlying supplier of the goods is a non-resident and the delivery of the goods at a place in New Zealand is made, arranged or assisted by either the marketplace operator or the underlying supplier. Similar to the issue with proposed section 10C(3), the marketplace provisions could be interpreted as extending to supplies of alcohol and tobacco. Officials recommend that the drafting of these provisions be clarified so that it is clear that supplies of alcohol and tobacco are not subject to the proposed rules in any way. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Misrepresentations by consumers to avoid GST on remote services Clauses 7(3) and 32(2) Submission (Matter raised by officials) Existing sections 5(27) and 51B(7) provide the Commissioner with discretion to require a person to register and pay GST that should have been charged on a supply of remote services, when: • the person has knowingly provided information that is altered, false or misleading, which leads to GST not being charged on the supply; and • the person has repeatedly and knowingly provided altered, false or misleading information, or the amount of GST that was not charged is substantial. 60 Section 5(27) as it is currently drafted only applies in the situation where a consumer misrepresents that they are a GST-registered business in order to avoid being charged GST. However, it is clear from the Commentary on the Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill that the policy intention was the provision should also apply in the situation where a New Zealand-resident consumer acquiring remote services from an offshore supplier deliberately provides false, altered or misleading information that leads the supplier to incorrectly conclude that the person is not resident in New Zealand. 5 Officials recommend that section 5(27) be amended so that it will also apply in the situation where a consumer deliberately provides false, altered or misleading information pertaining to his or her location or residency status for the purpose of avoiding paying GST. Given the ability for offshore suppliers to have New Zealand-resident agents and the proposed extension of the existing marketplace rules for remote services to marketplaces operated by New Zealand residents, the suggested amendment to section 5(27) should cover the situation where a consumer deliberately provides false, altered or misleading information to a resident agent or marketplace operator. An amendment to section 51B(7) should also cover this situation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 5 See the example on page 83 of the Commentary. 61 Ring-fencing residential property deductions 62 63 OVERVIEW The Bill proposes to ring-fence deductions in respect of residential rental properties to the extent the deductions exceed income from the properties. This means the excess deductions cannot be used to reduce tax on other income. The proposed rules would apply from the start of the 2019– 20 income year. Under current tax rules, rental property investors can deduct interest and other expenses (other than capital improvements) as these expenses relate to earning taxable rental income. In many cases these expenses exceed their rental income, which generates a tax loss even though the overall investment may still be profitable due to the capital gains that can be realised on the sale of the property. Most rental property investors hold their property on capital account and are not subject to tax on the capital gain on sale. Currently, investors can use losses from the rental properties to offset their income from other sources (such as salary and wages), thus reducing their income tax liability. Tax losses are common in the New Zealand rental market – 40 percent of taxpayers with residential investment property report rental losses, with the average loss per taxpayer being $7,235 a year. This may create an uneven playing field between property investors who are buying property in anticipation of capital gain, and owner-occupiers. Currently, investors can have part of the cost of servicing their mortgages subsidised by reduced tax on other income sources, helping them to outbid owner-occupiers. While rental housing is not formally tax-favoured, there is an argument that it may be under- taxed given that tax-free capital gains are often realised when rental properties are sold. The fact that rental property investments are often persistently loss-making indicates that expected capital gains are an important motivation for many investors purchasing rental property. Under the proposal, deductions for residential properties would be ring-fenced to the extent they exceed residential property income (including income on disposal). This effectively means that investors will no longer be able to offset residential property losses against their other income (for example, salary or wages, or business income), to reduce their tax liability. This proposal is aimed at making the tax system fairer, and improving housing affordability for owner-occupiers by levelling the playing field between investors and home buyers. Matters raised in submissions There were 283 submissions made on the rental ring-fencing proposal. Almost all submitters opposed the measure (268 of the 283 submitters). The main reasons given were that the proposal: • is based on an incorrect underlying rationale of there being unfairness in the system; • is at odds with New Zealand’s global approach to income and deductions; • would treat one class of investments differently to others; and • would have negative impacts, particularly on rents. 64 Many submitters also considered that the proposal should not proceed while the Government is considering the Tax Working Group’s recommendations, as the response to those recommendations may mean the measure could become obsolete within a short period of time. There was also opposition to the proposed application date of the start of the 2019–20 income year. Submitters did not consider that application date would give affected taxpayers sufficient time to understand the new requirements or have the opportunity to restructure their investments if appropriate. A number of submissions were received on the complexity of the drafting of these provisions in the Bill. It was strongly submitted that the provisions should be completely rewritten so they can be easily comprehended, particularly given the wide range of taxpayers who would be subject to the proposed rules and need to be able to understand them. It was submitted that as currently drafted the provisions are excessively complex, not fit for purpose, and are not consistent with the 1994 rewrite principles. A number of suggestions for improvement were made. A number of submissions were received on the technical detail of the proposed design of the ring-fencing rules. The main issues raised related to the land the rules should apply to, the use of ring-fenced deductions, and the interposed entity rules. Refer to Appendix I to view the list of individual submitters who raised particular issues. 65 SUPPORT FOR / OPPOSITION TO REFORM Clauses 49 and 65 Issue: Support for ring-fencing deductions for loss-making residential rental properties Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chris Perera, Frank McCulloch, Jeffrey Cate, Melanie Kilfoyle) The Corporate Taxpayers Group at a macro level, supports measures that address the perceived distortion in the residential property market. One individual submitter who supported the proposal considered that it was fair, but also noted that it will cause problems (such as rent increases). Another individual submitter considered ring-fencing losses to be a worthy proposal, which would enable more families to purchase their own homes. The submitter stated that in recent years, numbers of investment property portfolios have grown significantly due to the ease of using excessive financial leverage to obtain bank loans for purchase. The submitter noted that investors holding large numbers of properties were contributing to decreased home ownership. One submitter referred to the proposal as a progressive step. The submitter noted that ring- fencing of losses does not affect long-term property investors. However, in the submitter’s opinion, highly-geared speculative investors have damaged the way property investors are perceived. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Opposition to ring-fencing deductions for loss-making residential rental properties Submission (Akeda Trust, Auckland Property Investors Association Incorporated, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, Focus Holdings Ltd, For Tomorrow Ltd, Gabbie Limited, Generate Accounting Group Limited, Real Estate Institute of New Zealand, RKV Investments Ltd, Ghuznee Holdings Ltd, KPMG, New Zealand Property Investors Federation, PwC, Young Property Consultants Ltd, and 252 individual submitters – see the attached Appendix) There was strong opposition to the proposal, with 268 of the 283 submitters opposing the measure. The main reasons for this being that: • the Government is currently considering the Tax Working Group’s recommendations, which may mean the measure becomes obsolete within a short period of time; • the rationale for the measure is based on an incorrect underlying assumption that there is unfairness in the system and that owner-occupiers are disadvantaged compared to investors; 66 • the measure is at odds with New Zealand’s tax policy framework and non-schedular settings; • the measure would treat one class of assets differently to other investments; • there was concern that the measure will negatively impact on rents and the rental housing stock; and • the measure may not have the desired impact on affordability for owner-occupiers. Three individual submitters expressed no clear preference for or against the proposal. Comment These concerns are discussed in more detail below. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 67 OBJECTIONS TO THE PROPOSAL Clauses 49 and 65 Issue: Deferral until Tax Working Group recommendations considered Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, Generate Accounting Group Limited, KPMG, PwC) Submitters considered that the proposals should be deferred. This was on the basis that if the Government adopts the recommendations of the Tax Working Group in relation to taxation of capital gains from land, the ring-fencing rules would become obsolete, or at the very least the case for them would be weakened. Submitters appreciated that the Government has not yet responded in full to the Tax Working Group’s final report, and that there would be a time lag before any recommendations are implemented, but considered that proceeding with the proposal at this time would involve a significant amount of resources being spent on something that may just be repealed. One submitter commented that similar rules were introduced in Australia in the 1980s and were subsequently abandoned with the introduction of a capital gains tax. The submitter considered that to have a capital gains tax and ring-fencing would impact the supply of residential rental accommodation at a time when there is a recognised shortage. It was also submitted that this would have a fiscal impact for the Government. Comment The Government has announced that it will not be introducing a capital gains tax. That announcement supersedes this submission point. One of the primary rationales for the proposal is that landlords are currently able to fully utilise residential rental tax losses to reduce tax on their other income even though not all of the economic income from the rental property is taxed, as typically any gain on sale is untaxed. It is also noted that numerous countries tax capital gains but nonetheless restrict the use of rental losses or negative gearing. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 68 Issue: Incorrect underlying assumption that investors have an unfair advantage over home buyers Submission (Auckland Property Investors Association Incorporated, EY, New Zealand Property Investors Federation, and 15 individual submitters – see the attached Appendix) It was submitted that there is a fundamental error in the assumption that tax deductibility for rental property allows investors to outbid owner-occupiers. It was submitted that rental property is not tax advantaged, and that in fact homeowners actually have an advantage over investors as the imputed value of the accommodation they receive is not taxed. It was submitted that the proposal not be introduced as the playing field between investors and home buyers is not unequal. It was also submitted that the proposal may not have the effect of “levelling the playing field” between property speculators and investors and owner-occupiers – one of the stated objectives. It was considered that the proposal may instead simply result in a change of the composition of investors, with investors with more equity replacing low equity investors who are driven out of the market. One submitter noted that first home buyers are at an advantage compared to investors, because first home buyers have access to first home buyer grants and KiwiSaver funds. One submitter considered it is first home buyers, not investors, that are pushing up house prices. Comment Investment housing is currently taxed under the same rules that generally apply to other investments and is not formally tax favoured. The main tax preference for housing is for owner- occupied housing. This is because the benefits from owner-occupied housing are not taxed. If two people owned houses and rented these out to each other, each would be taxed on the rental income they receive. If instead they live in their own houses, no tax is levied on the implicit rental income they receive. This tends to bias housing choices in favour of owner-occupation for owner-occupiers with substantial equity. However, mortgage interest and other expenses are not deductible for owner-occupiers, and this will offset or more than offset this bias for owner-occupiers with lower amounts of equity. The proposed loss ring-fencing loss rules would reduce the bias in favour of rental housing for highly leveraged housing. It is possible that the proposal may result in a change of the composition of investors, with investors with more equity replacing lower equity investors. However, the proposal could also help improve home buyers’ ability to compete with investors. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 69 Issue: Contrary to New Zealand’s tax policy framework Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Ghuznee Holdings Ltd, PwC) Submitters commented that the proposal is contrary to New Zealand’s tax policy framework, and that concepts of gross income and global deductions are fundamental to the New Zealand tax system. It was submitted that this proposed “schedular” approach was unprincipled, and that alternatives which do not depart from the fundamental frameworks should be preferred. One submitter commented that, for example, the same objective could be achieved with a capital gains tax on the sale of land. Comment The proposed ring-fencing rules are an exception to the general approach in the Income Tax Act 2007, under which income and deductions are generally looked at on a global basis, with tax being payable in respect of a person’s net income from all sources. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Investment property treated differently to other assets Submission (Generate Accounting Group Limited, PwC, and 91 individual submitters – see the attached Appendix) It was submitted that the proposal is not good policy, as it means one sector of the economy or asset class is being treated differently from others. Submitters considered that this means the proposal in fact runs contrary to the stated goal of fairness. It was also submitted that the current tax rules do not result in a specific tax advantage only available to residential rental investment properties warranting specific rules to remove this perceived “tax advantage”. It was noted that currently negative gearing may also occur in other industries – for example, farms and businesses may also negative gear, making losses in the initial stages and using them to offset income generated by other means (including by commonly-owned companies). Individual submitters said that ring-fencing losses for rental properties is unfair, singles out one business, and discriminates against residential rental property investment compared to any other business or investment in New Zealand. If implemented, it would create an imbalance. It is a business that should be treated like any other. Expenses should be able to be deducted from gross income. Comment Investment housing is currently taxed under the same rules that generally apply to other investments and is not formally tax favoured. However, there is an argument that it may be under-taxed given that tax-free capital gains are often realised when rental properties are sold. There is an argument that to the extent deductible expenses in the long-term exceed income 70 from rents, those expenses in fact relate to the capital gain, so should not be deductible unless the capital gain is taxed. However, officials agree that this is not unique to investment housing or land. Other investments, especially if highly-geared, may produce losses which are able to be offset against other income, and untaxed capital gains. The loss ring-fencing proposal would, as submitters have commented, treat residential investment property differently to other investments. That said, there is an argument that there may be greater scope for under-taxation in respect of housing compared to other assets, as housing may potentially be more easily geared than other assets and there may be a higher expectation of capital gains. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Impact on rents and housing stock Submission (Auckland Property Investors Association Incorporated, Generate Accounting Group Limited, For Tomorrow Ltd, Gabbie Limited, New Zealand Property Investors Federation, Real Estate Institute of New Zealand, PwC, and 178 individual submitters – see the attached Appendix) Some submitters commented that it is unclear what impact the proposed rules would have on property speculation generally, property prices, or rent levels. Submitters stated that the proposal is poorly thought through, irresponsible, and politically motivated. They said that no proper analysis has been done to estimate impacts of the policy. Some also noted that there is a significant uncertainty as to the effects of the policy and that Inland Revenue itself is not sure of the impacts of the policy. Some believed that there was no consultation with the affected landlords. One submitter commented that they would like to see independent economic modelling undertaken to examine and calculate the likely effect ring-fencing will have on the rental market, and that before any decision on the proposal is made, the Government should produce an impact statement on the likely effects of ring-fencing on rental prices and the supply of rental accommodation. Other submitters felt strongly that the proposal would negatively impact the rental market. It was considered that this would occur for two reasons: • through investment property owners passing on the cost of the reduced benefit to renters through increased rents; and • by making rental ownership less appealing as an investment, leading to a reduction in rental properties and increased pressure on the rental market, which would in turn drive rents up. The majority of individual submitters believed that this measure will cause rents to increase. Many noted that such increases are inevitable as a result of the combined effect of this measure and additional pressure from the healthy homes standards. 71 Submitters considered that the fact residential rental property is likely to have losses shows that landlords are subsidising the living costs of their tenants. It was also noted that those making losses are likely to be landlords with recently purchased properties, but that eventually those properties would become profitable and investors would start to pay tax. It was also noted that rental property owners take on the risk of mortgage interest rates increasing. Submitters commented that it is already difficult enough to provide new rental property in New Zealand and would only become more so if the proposal goes ahead, as losses would not be available when cashflow is poor, which would make it much harder for many to buy a rental property. It was considered that the proposal puts the interests of first home buyers above renters, and that it would be an irresponsible measure to introduce at a time when New Zealand has a shortage of rental properties. Individual submitters noted that New Zealand already has a housing crisis, and that this policy would make the situation worse, including increasing homelessness. Many said that the proposal will result in a greater need for state houses. Some considered that the Government’s increased housing costs as a result of this proposal would be higher than if private landlords were not dis-incentivised to provide rental accommodation. Some did not believe that the Government alone is able to provide enough affordable homes for the housing market. Many believed that the housing and rental markets will suffer severe consequences, and some thought that these markets will collapse. Some noted that house prices went up not because of speculators but because of restrictive planning rules which reduce supply, and lack of industry capacity. Submitters considered that the proposal would have the greatest negative impact in low yielding areas, as it is most difficult to provide rental property in these areas. It was noted that Auckland has the lowest average rental yields in New Zealand, so would be the hardest hit area, but that it also has the fastest growing population in the country so the greatest requirement for more rental properties. Submitters commented that if the policy driver was to improve housing affordability or better access to housing, the proposed rules were a poorly targeted tool, as the risk that rents could increase would negatively impact on access to housing. Numerous submitters noted that either they or their clients were considering selling their rental properties in anticipation of the proposed changes. Comment Rental loss ring-fencing will reduce after-tax rental returns for some landlords. This could encourage the transfer of housing stock from investment housing (that is, rental housing) to owner-occupier housing, putting pressure on the remaining rental stock. On average, owner- occupied housing tends to have fewer people per house. This suggests that the transfer of housing stock from rental to owner-occupied may reduce the amount of housing available for each remaining renter unless there is an adequate flow of new housing onto the rental market. This may lead to increased rents. Landlords may also pass on their rental losses to tenants in the form of increased rents. There are other ways that this and other policies could impact the rental market. 72 Officials note there is significant uncertainty about the net impact of the policy on the housing market, especially on the rental market. Overseas experience underlines the uncertainty in the direction and magnitude of housing market impacts. For example, negative gearing was banned in Australia between 1985 and 1987, and while rents spiked in Sydney during this period, they were flat or falling across much of the rest of the country. The exact relationship between the tax changes and observed changes in rent is unclear. A Regulatory Impact Assessment was produced for this reform. In that and other advice officials have provided the Government, it was noted that rental loss ring-fencing could result in renters being adversely impacted through higher rental prices. This could in turn increase fiscal costs to the Government, most directly from higher income-related rent subsidy costs and accommodation supplement costs. While loss ring-fencing could lead to increased rents, on the other hand, it could improve housing affordability for home buyers. Officials have stressed that the net impact of these effects is uncertain. Officials note that Westpac’s 2018 report, Tax and house prices 6 , similarly did not quantify the likely impact of the loss ring-fencing proposal on rents, but noted that they would increase, while house prices would be expected to decrease by up to six percent, and home ownership rates would increase. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Other impacts on tenants Submission (74 individual submitters – see the attached Appendix) One submitter stated that “a move against a property investor is a move against a tenant”. Many submitters stated that in addition to having to increase rents (discussed above) they would also have to reduce maintenance on their rental properties, which would detrimentally affect the tenants. Some noted that tenants are going to be more negatively affected than property owners. Some submitters noted that not every tenant wants to buy their own home; this may simply be their choice. Additionally, many tenants would not have the required deposit to buy a property, and some may choose to have a different life style rather than saving for a deposit. One submitter noted the changes will result in rental properties being let only to “upper quartile” tenants, with the rest missing out. Three submitters noted that at risk and “marginalised” / the most needy (for example, mentally ill people) will not be able to get rental accommodation. One submitter noted that the changes are going to result in increased tension between tenants and landlords. 6 Westpac, Tax and house prices, 19 June 2018: https://www.westpac.co.nz/assets/Business/Economic- Updates/2018/Bulletins-2018/Tax-and-House-Prices-June-2018.pdf 73 Comment While the proposal could result in some deferral of repairs and maintenance compared to what may otherwise be the case, this may only be at the margin, as many submitters have commented that losses usually only arise in the early years of an investment property being held, and then become profitable. It is also noted that certain repairs and maintenance will not be able to be deferred, given the healthy homes standards regulated for under the Healthy Homes Guarantee Act 2017. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Impact on affordability for owner-occupiers Submission (Real Estate Institute of New Zealand, and 48 individual submitters – see the attached Appendix) It was submitted that removing the ability to offset losses against other income could skew investment decisions without improving affordability of owner-occupied housing. For example, investors may choose to increase their investment in owner-occupied housing rather than in rental properties, which could counter any potential impact on housing affordability, and has the potential to increase rent prices. Some submitters said that the consequences of the policy far outweigh any perceived benefits. Many believed that the policy will not achieve its stated outcomes, saying it will not level the playing field, will not assist but further disadvantage first home buyers (as increased rents would impede their ability to save for a deposit), and will decrease voluntary compliance. Some submitted that the current system is working fine as it is. Comment The advice Inland Revenue and the Treasury have provided the Government has been that loss ring-fencing could lead to increased rents, but on the other hand, it could improve housing affordability for home buyers. Officials have stressed that the net impact of the effects on the housing market is uncertain. Westpac’s 2018 report, Tax and house prices, noted that house prices would be expected to decrease by up to six percent, and home ownership rates would increase. On the other hand, it was also noted that rents would increase (though the extent to which this might be expected to be the case was not quantified). Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 74 Issue: Impact on investors (owners of residential rental properties) Submission (Focus Holdings Ltd, New Zealand Property Investors Federation, and 222 individual submitters – see the attached Appendix) The majority of submitters are owners of residential rental properties in New Zealand. Many such submitters noted that they own between one and four residential rental properties. The submitters noted that being a residential property owner is hard work (“sweat equity”), which is a result of sacrificing the owner’s lifestyle. Many owners already incur high compliance costs as a result of healthy homes regulations, necessary maintenance, council rates. It was also noted that investors can no longer claim depreciation on buildings. Submitters pointed out that residential property owners carry risks, and often top up rental shortfalls (when the rent received does not cover all of the expenses relating to the property). A number of submitters that are owners of residential rental properties noted that they strive to keep their rental properties in good order and already provide more than required by government standards for rental properties. This benefits their tenants. They pointed out that the benefit they provide to society, for example through subsidising their tenants’ living costs, accepting tenants with children and pets, and providing tenants with high quality accommodation. Some submitters said that their tenants have better quality homes than they do themselves. Submitters consider that existing (and particularly small) owners will be detrimentally affected because of the increased costs to run their rental properties. Costs will increase because of the inability to offset their losses against other income. Many noted that owners do not intend to make losses in perpetuity, and availability of deductions is not a reason to enter the residential rental property market. They explained that losses normally only occur in the first years of owning a residential rental property, after which the property will returns taxable profits. Sometimes, there may be a loss due to an unexpected large maintenance outlay (for example, due to damage to the property). One submitter noted that tenants do not look after rental properties. The ability to offset losses against other income is seen as essential to being able to continue provide rental housing. The submitters noted there would be different impacts on different categories of owners of residential rental properties: existing owners, potential owners (those considering purchasing a rental property), small owners (owning one to two rental properties), and large owners. Submitters commented that they may have to either sell their properties because of the changes, increase their rent, or reduce and defer maintenance on the rental properties. Some noted that the first port of call would be to reduce maintenance and to increase rents, but if it is insufficient, they will sell. Some noted that they will not develop their properties to make them able to house more tenants. Many believed that the owners of rental properties will be dis-incentivised. Only large or highly-leveraged investors will not be negatively affected. Many submitters (among them one investor with a large number of properties) said that larger investors will buy the properties of smaller investors forced to leave the residential rental market because they can no longer afford to remain there. 75 Many submitters considered that there is an unjustified prejudice against investors in rental properties, and that the effect of this proposal is penal. They submitted that their investments are being undermined. It was submitted that the proposal would seriously impact on and impair the ability for New Zealanders to save for their retirement. Submitters questioned why they are being penalised for taking initiative in relation to their financial futures and reducing their burden on the state in their retirement. Some noted that their investment in residential rental properties was to enable their children to purchase their first home. A number of investors believed that the Government alone cannot resolve New Zealand’s rental crisis, using the phrase “killing the goose which lays a golden egg”. Some noted that they invest in residential rental properties because of future capital gains and/or an ability to rely on a passive income stream. Some said that they expected that their gains will be modest. Many have pointed out to the differences between residential rental property investors and speculators. The investors are there long-term, whereas speculators intend to make a quick return. They pointed out that speculators are already taxed under the bright-line test. One submitter noted that the current law is too protective of tenants. One submitter noted that new rules will impact adversely on leasehold property owners. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 76 APPLICATION DATE AND PHASED INTRODUCTION Clauses 49 and 65 Issue: Retrospectivity, application date, and phased introduction Submission (Accountants + Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Andrew Clist, Baucher Consulting Limited, Bill Stark, Capital Accounting Associates Limited, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, David Rowell, Deidre Mellamphy, Generate Accounting Group Limited, Jacky Cheung, Justin Harness, KPMG, Matthew Dawe, Megan Graham, New Zealand Property Investors Federation, PwC, Real Estate Institute of New Zealand, Rob Rimmer, Sarah Wilson, Stephen Cruttwell, Steven Law) The application date generally It was submitted that the short timetable between the introduction of the Bill (5 December 2018) and the proposal that the ring-fencing rules take effect from 1 April 2019 was insufficient time to consider and submit on the proposed legislation for what is a substantial policy change. Some submitters suggested that if the rules are progressed, they should apply from 1 April 2021 at the earliest. It was considered that the proposed commencement date of 1 April 2019 does not give affected taxpayers sufficient time to comply with the new requirements or have the opportunity to restructure their investments if appropriate. Further, it was noted that the Government is considering extending the taxation of capital gains, in which case the rules may become obsolete. Submitters considered that it would be inefficient and result in undue compliance costs if taxpayers are required to comply with such complex rules for a potentially short time before they are repealed. Retrospectivity – particularly for early balance date taxpayers It was submitted that the regime should not have retrospective effect. It was noted that while the proposed rules will apply retrospectively for all taxpayers, this is particularly unfair for early balance date taxpayers, as their 2019–20 income year may have commenced prior to the Bill even being introduced. It was submitted that the proposed rules should instead apply from the start of the 2020–21 income year for early balance date taxpayers. Phased introduction Alternatively, it was submitted that given the complexities, the significant policy impact, and the proposed short timetable, the rules should be phased in. It was considered that phasing the rules in would allow investors sufficient time to modify or work out existing contractual arrangements, or to assess the impact of the changes on their circumstances and make adjustments if required. It was also noted that phasing the rules in may also mean rental prices could increase more gradually, which would be fairer to tenants. Some submitters considered that the rules should be phased in over a three-year period as they considered was suggested in Inland Revenue’s Issues Paper, or over five years as per the Labour Party 2017 election manifesto. 77 Others submitted that the Committee should seriously consider adopting the phased introduction suggestions made by the Treasury and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (“MBIE”), as outlined in the Regulatory Impact Assessments. One submitter considered that Inland Revenue’s concerns over precedent and complexity were over-stated. Grandparenting Other submitters proposed was that there should be grandparenting for existing investors as at either the time the Inland Revenue Issues Paper was released for consultation, or the date the Bill was introduced. Comment Application date and retrospectivity It is proposed that the rules will apply from the start of the 2019–20 income year. For taxpayers with a standard balance date, their 2019–20 income year began on 1 April 2019. For some taxpayers with earlier balance dates, their 2019–20 income year could have begun as early as 2 October 2018. These application dates would be before the Bill is expected to be enacted in mid-2019. The impact of this is mitigated somewhat by the Bill having been introduced before the start of the income year, for standard balance date taxpayers. This is not the case for some early balance date taxpayers, though it is noted that the proposed rules have been well signalled. The main features of the rules, and the proposal that the rules would apply from the start of the 2019–20 income year, were announced and consulted on in an Issues Paper that was released in March 2018. This was at least five months before the start of 2019–20 income year for those with early balance dates, and 12 months before the start of the income year for those with standard balance dates. Furthermore, because the proposals limit how deductions can be offset against income, taxpayers would not be required to take a tax position until the date that they file their income tax return for the 2019–20 income year. The deadlines for filing income tax returns for the 2019–20 income year will be well after the enactment date. Taxpayers with early or standard balance dates will have until 7 July 2020 to file their tax return for the 2019–20 income year. This is expected to be approximately 12 months after the Bill is enacted. Taxpayers are also able to apply to Inland Revenue for an extension of time to file their income tax return. The maximum period for an extension of time that can be granted is to 31 March 2021 for the 2019–20 income year, which would be approximately 20 months after the Bill is enacted. Finally, it is noted that the number of early balance date taxpayers who would be affected by the proposed rules is very small, with just 0.01 percent of the potentially affected taxpayers having early balance dates (99.4 percent have standard balance dates, 0.31 percent have late balance dates, and 0.3 percent are unknown). 78 Phased introduction The March 2018 issues paper sought submissions on whether the rules should be applied in full from 2019–20 (as per the current Bill) or phased in over three years. Phasing the rules in would allow affected existing investors more time to adjust to the new rules, or to rearrange their affairs before the rules apply in full. Inland Revenue officials consider that, on balance, there is a stronger argument to apply the rules in full from the outset for all properties. This is on the basis that it would create additional complexity, and that tax law changes are not typically phased in and such an approach could result in a precedent-setting risk. Grandparenting Grandparenting would exclude existing rental properties from the proposed loss ring-fencing rules. This would greatly limit the application of the policy and could be seen as unfairly disadvantaging new landlords that purchase rental properties after the start of the 2019–20 income year. It would encourage landlords to hold on to loss-making rental properties that they purchased prior to 2019–20 rather than invest in new properties (including new builds). Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 79 ALTERNATIVES TO THE PROPOSAL Clauses 49 and 65 Issue: A de minimis or cap on claiming rental losses, and exemptions Submission (Adrienne O’Sullivan, Andrea Thompson, Baucher Consulting Limited (oral submission), David Rowell, Grant Dickson, Jacky Cheung, Kathy Fray, Lesley Quirk, Megan Graham, Melanie Kilfoyle, New Zealand Property Investors Federation, nsaTax Ltd, PwC, Sally Rae, Stephen Cruttwell, Tania Tang, Teresa Elder, Virenda Gupta) It was suggested that an alternative, more targeted approach to the proposal, would be to have de minimis or cap on claiming rental losses. It was suggested this could be done by reintroducing specified activity loss rules for rental properties. These rules limited the losses for an income year for particular activities to the lesser of the income from that activity or $10,000. Submitters noted that the proposed rules are complex, confusing and onerous, and would impose significant compliance costs on many taxpayers who are substantially unaffected by the rules. It was felt that a de minimis or cap on claiming rental losses would reduce the obligation to comply with the rules. One submitter noted that its research showed that the average New Zealand property makes a loss of approximately $9,000 in the first year of ownership. It was suggested that if ring-fencing was applied to losses greater than approximately 20 percent above this level (say above $10,000), this would allow the average New Zealand property to continue being provided as a rental, which would reduce the impact on rental supply and rent prices. Another submitter suggested a de minimis or cap could be set at $5,000 (a maximum $1,650 tax benefit), and that this would remove a large portion of investors from having to comply with these rules. It was considered that the rules would be unlikely to achieve the policy objectives for taxpayers with such a low annual tax benefit. In particular, the submitter considered that the rules would not alter the behaviour of taxpayers getting such a low tax benefit, so would have no impact on the housing market, but would create additional significant compliance costs and result in significant non-compliance. It was considered that the rules should be targeted at those who highly gear their rental properties, creating significant tax losses in favour of tax-free capital gains. Some individual submitters asked for a de minimis cap of $5,000-$10,000, or for the rules to not apply for a certain number of properties per investor (for example, one or two). Some individual submitters asked for tiered allowance caps: for example, that an investor can claim 100 percent of the losses in the first year following the introduction of the rules (or the first year of ownership for new investments), with a 20 percent reduction in each subsequent year. Another submitter suggested a model when 90 percent of losses can be offset in the first year, with 10 percent being carried over to the next; in the second year the ratio of losses that can be utilised in that year to losses that have to be carried over is 75% / 25%; and then it is capped at 50% / 50%. The submitter noted that remaining credit should be refundable if the property is sold. 80 Some individual submitters suggested that the rules should not apply to: • one rental property; • one rental property for the first 5-10 years of ownership; • small landlords; • houses complying with government regulations; • certain expenses (for example, repairs and maintenance, bank interest); • existing rental properties (grandparenting these); or • investors’ next-of-kin, if investors have a proven track record of investing in residential property. Comment The rationale for the proposal, that there is unfairness in investors using rental losses to reduce their tax on other sources of income, exists irrespective of the level of losses a particular taxpayer makes. Many of the suggestions would make the rules substantially more complex. It is also noted that under the proposal excess deductions would not be lost, but carried forward and available for use in future income years when rental profits are being made. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: That the rules apply only to interest expenditure Submission (KPMG) It was suggested that an alternative approach would be for the rules to apply only to interest expenditure. This was considered a more targeted approach, if the concern is in relation to highly leveraged properties. Applying the rules to only interest expenditure would mean that other expenses could be deducted even if that resulted in a loss (for example, if there were significant repairs and maintenance in a particular year), and it would only be excess interest deductions that would be ring-fenced. Comment Interest will generally be the largest deductible expense, leading to rental properties being loss- making. Therefore, applying the rules only to interest would be an approach that would more specifically target highly leveraged properties. However, this would add some additional complexity to the rules, as opposed to the current proposal which just looks at whether the property is profitable or loss-making overall. Also, there may be an argument that excluding some expenditure from the rules (in particular, repairs and maintenance costs) could somewhat cut across one of the intended aims of the proposal. This is because repairs and maintenance to a property will feed into the ultimate potential capital gain, and it is the non-taxation of capital gains that is essentially the source of the under-taxation of investment housing, and the perceived unfairness in that regard. 81 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: A modified form of thin capitalisation rules Submission (Baucher Consulting Limited) It was suggested that an alternative would be a modified form of the thin capitalisation rules. This would mean that deductions could only be claimed for interest on debt up to a certain percentage of the value of the property. Comment It is considered that a modified form of thin capitalisation rules would be substantially more complex and more difficult for many investors to comply with. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Focus on supply-side measures Submission (Anne Tseng, Chris Perera, Di Yu, Gabbie Limited, Ilya Zharenikov, Kim Meichtry, Klodia Kamberi, Zikon Leung) It was submitted that instead of the proposed rules, the focus should be on reforming the Resource Management Act 1991, and opening up more land and speeding up development. The comment was made that the issue is one of supply, and we cannot solve it by taxing our way out. Submitters considered that instead of implementing the proposed rules, the Government should address the issue of housing supply by: • building more houses, releasing more land, addressing outdated local Government building regulations; • subsidising new apprenticeships in building and construction; • investing more in KiwiBuild; • building more state homes; and • providing rent-to-buy schemes and low interest government loans to lower income families. 82 Comment It is acknowledged that supply-side issues are a crucial part of the housing equation, and that demand-side measures such as this proposal can only go so far in attempting to address affordability and access to housing. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Other suggested alternatives Submission (Annelies Guyan, Barry Saxon, Beatrice Ezpeleta, Di Yu, Cliff Ah Kit, David and Vikki Bacon, Debbie Roberts, Dilipchandra Balachandran, Eduarda Abissamra, Frank Wang, Haraish Rajpal, Ian Muir, Ilya Zharenikov, Joshua Jones, Kevin Cox, Kim Meichtry, Michael Stubbs, Reece Chamberlain, Roger Matheson, Stephen Cruttwell, Tracey Swift, Vicki Haylock, Yvonne Grant-Martens) The submitters asked for the focus to be shifted from the ring-fencing rules to other measures, such as: • ensuring that rental homes are healthy to live in; • providing financial education; • providing incentives to investors; • incentivising investors to remedy properties suffering from delayed maintenance; • increasing focus on speculators (noting that they are different from investors), for example by increasing the bright-line to 7-10 years; • ensuring tax compliance of multi-nationals; • recovering existing taxes due; • allowing a tax credit for costs associated with compliance with local Government regulations; • requiring tenants to take greater responsibility for the care of their rental properties; • restoring depreciation on buildings (for example, at 4 percent per annum using the straight line method); • not taxing KiwiSaver savings at marginal rates; • taxing women less than men because women are paid less; • reducing taxes and living costs; • redirecting KiwiBuild funds to state housing; and • allowing income splitting for married couples not on benefit. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 83 COMPLEXITY OF LEGISLATION Clauses 49 and 65 Submission (Anthony Whitehouse, Baucher Consulting Limited, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Melanie Kilfoyle, New Zealand Law Society, nsaTax Ltd) A number of submitters strongly submitted that the provisions for this proposal in the Bill should be rewritten so they can be more easily comprehended. As currently drafted, it was considered that the provisions are excessively complex and are not consistent with the 1994 rewrite principles. Submitters made suggestions for improvement, including: moving the provisions to another subpart (either a new subpart, or within subpart E (timing)), organising the provisions better, and including interpretive aids such as a contents section, purpose provision, flowcharts, use of subheadings, and supporting examples. Some submitters suggested simplified drafting for numerous provisions, in particular to avoid repetitive terminology, and to remove new undefined terms and terms that may create confusion. Comment It is acknowledged that the drafting of the proposed rules in the Bill is complex. These provisions have been redrafted, taking on board the submissions. Officials consider the redrafted provisions to be substantially easier to read, with simpler language, more succinct phrasing, a more intuitive structure, and an overview of what is covered in the provisions at the outset. It is proposed that the redrafted provisions be inserted into subpart E (Timing). Officials have consulted on the revised drafting with a number of submitters and they consider it much clearer, easier to understand and significantly improved compared to the original drafting. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 84 PROPERTY THE RULES APPLY TO Clauses 49 and 65 Issue: Support for the rules not applying to mixed-use assets, farmland, or other business properties Submission (New Zealand Property Investors Federation) The submitter commented that notwithstanding their objection to the proposal, they agreed that the rules should not apply to other property-related industries (for example, baches that are sometimes rented out, farmland, or other business premises). Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Leased land Submission (nsaTax Ltd) It was submitted that the rules should apply to land either owned or leased by a taxpayer – they currently would only apply to land owned by a taxpayer. Comment The provisions would apply to land let by a taxpayer, not just to estates in fee simple. The definition of “land” in the Income Tax Act 2007 includes “any estate or interest in land”, which would include a leasehold estate, and the definition of “own” refers to having an estate or interest in land. If a taxpayer with leased land derived income from that land (for example, by sub-letting it), the rules would apply to potentially limit the deductions that may be allocated to the income year, just as they would to a taxpayer who derived income from land they owned in fee simple. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 85 Issue: Overseas land and foreign exchange losses Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, EY, KPMG) Submitters considered that the rules should not apply to overseas property, given the aim of the proposals is to level the playing field between property speculators and investors and home buyers in New Zealand. It was considered that there is no rationale for subjecting overseas land to these rules. In addition, it was considered inappropriate that a taxpayer could have income in a year from a foreign rental property, including foreign exchange gains on foreign debt, and then in a subsequent year have a foreign exchange loss resulting in losses that are ring-fenced. As an alternative to carving out overseas property, it was submitted that the rules should not apply to foreign exchange losses in relation to overseas land, and these should be able to be separated out and treated as deductible. It was noted that the rules applying to land outside of New Zealand would create high compliance costs for individuals temporarily relocating to New Zealand and renting out property owned in their home country, and that in these instances foreign exchange movements may be the cause of the losses. It was also submitted that if land outside New Zealand is not excluded, an exclusion should be available for an overseas residence of a “transitional resident”, if the property would or could be their main home if living overseas. It was considered that this would be in line with the policy rationale for the transitional residence rules, being to encourage non-residents to migrate to New Zealand. Comment Officials consider that it would be seen as unfair for deductions in relation to loss-making overseas investment properties to be able to be offset against New Zealand income where such deductions in relation to New Zealand investment properties are not. The rationale that the proposal would level the playing field between investors and home buyers is only one of the rationales for these rules. In addition, it is considered there is a perception that it is unfair for deductions in relation to loss-making properties to be able to be offset against income from other sources when the capital gains may not be taxed, or may be taxed at a lower rate. Overseas rental properties of New Zealand taxpayers are in our tax base, so it is sensible for all residential losses to be subject to the same rules. There is currently a project on the tax policy work programme looking at issues in respect of the financial arrangements rules and foreign mortgages. Officials consider that the issue in relation to foreign exchange losses that submitters have raised should be considered as part of that project. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 86 Issue: Mixed-use land Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, nsaTax Ltd) It was submitted that there should be clarification on when the rules would apply to mixed use land (for example, a two-storey building with a shop downstairs and a let apartment upstairs). One submitter commented that the proposed legislation does not deal with land that is used for both residential and commercial purposes, and suggested that a mechanism should be developed to specify how the two components should be measured. Comment The proposed rules would apply to “residential land” as currently defined in the Income Tax Act 2007, with some specific exclusions. The definition of “residential land” was introduced with the bright-line test, and excludes farmland and land “used predominantly as business premises”. Inland Revenue will be consulting soon on draft guidance as to what it means for land to have been used “predominantly” as business premises. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Revenue account land – the notification requirement should be removed Submission (nsaTax Ltd) It was submitted that the notification requirements in the provision carving out revenue account property from the scope of the rules should be removed for dealers, developers, builders and those acquiring land for the purpose or intention of disposal. It was considered nonsensical to provide a carve-out from the ring-fencing rules for these taxpayers yet impose onerous reporting requirements on them. It was noted that taxpayers with multiple development properties would not typically record holding costs separately for each property. It was also noted that these entities will already be identified to Inland Revenue as dealers, developers or builders by virtue of their industry activity, and will most likely be GST-registered in relation to the activity. It was considered that any further notification was unnecessary and would increase compliance costs considerably even though such land is outside the proposed rules. Comment It is noted that the proposed carve out for revenue account land would not require taxpayers with multiple development properties to record holding costs separately for each property. If all of the properties in a taxpayer’s portfolio were on revenue account the properties would be within the exclusion. 87 However, under the proposed rules, there are two notification requirements. The first proposed notification requirement The first notification requirement currently proposed is that taxpayers notify the Commissioner that the land will be taxed on sale. It is accepted that this is not necessary for properties that will be taxed on sale because they are held in a land-related business (for example, a dealing or development business). Officials therefore recommend that properties that will be taxed on sale under section CB 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 be excluded from the operation of the proposed rules, without there being any notification requirements. However, officials consider that this first notification requirement is appropriate for properties held on revenue account outside of those businesses (for example, a property that was acquired with the intention of disposal, where the taxpayer is not in the business of dealing in land). Most investors do not hold their properties on revenue account, but for those that do officials consider it appropriate that the exclusion for revenue account property only apply where it is known that the property will be taxed on sale and this is acknowledged by the taxpayer. The second proposed notification requirement The second notification requirement currently proposed is that: • the taxpayer notify the Commissioner of their income and deductions that relate to the particular property on revenue account (this could be done by submitting an IR3R (Rental income schedule for that property); or • if they do not that, all the properties they have are on revenue account and they have notified the Commissioner of that in relation to each property. As noted above, officials agree that there do not need to be any notification requirements for property that will be taxed on sale under section CB 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (for example, land held in dealing and development businesses). For other properties (for example, properties bought with the intention of disposal) officials consider that this second notification requirement could be amended. Officials think it would be sufficient if the taxpayer is able to separately identify the deductions that relate to the revenue account property, unless all of the properties they have are on revenue account, in which case this would not be necessary. While many taxpayers do notify the Commissioner of their income and deductions for each property they own, officials consider that this requirement could be removed. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 88 Issue: Revenue account land – compliance burden on taxpayers, and unfairness to some taxpayers Submission (Accountants + Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand) The submitter questioned the practicality of the provision carving out revenue account property from the scope of the rules (proposed section DB 18AF). It was considered that this provision would appear to require taxpayers to provide and retain substantial information relating to property which will be taxed, and that this would place a considerable compliance burden on such taxpayers. The submitter also considered that the provision would unfairly exclude taxpayers who dispose of property that is taxed under the bright-line (or another provision where taxation is contingent on conditions being met). The submitter’s view was that if disposals are taxed under the bright- line or other provision, there was no valid policy reason for preventing the offset of losses from the property against such income. Comment Officials do not consider that the proposed carve-out for revenue account property would require taxpayers to provide or retain substantial information. Most investors do not hold their rental properties on revenue account. But for those that do (for example, properties acquired with the intention of disposal), for the exclusion to apply the taxpayer would have to: • notify the Commissioner that the property will be taxed on sale; and • be able to identify the expenses that relate to that particular property, unless all of their properties are on revenue account. It is not considered that this is overly onerous, given that most investors hold their properties on capital account, and in light of the above recommendation that the notification requirement not apply to dealers, developers etc. It was also submitted that it would be unfair for the exclusion not to apply to property that may be taxed on sale (for example, under the bright-line, or under one of the other land sale provisions that may apply depending on events that transpire). It is noted that all residential land within the scope of the proposed ring-fencing rules falls into this category, as if sold within the bright-line period (either two or five years) it would be taxed on sale. If the rules did not apply to any residential land that may be taxed on sale, they would not apply to any land for the first two to five years of ownership. The carve out is intended to cover only land that it is known will be taxed on sale. This is because one of the rationales for the proposed rules is that not all of the economic income will be taxed, and that that rationale is not relevant in respect of properties that will be taxed on sale regardless of when that occurs. It is noted that if a property ends up being taxed on sale (for example, because it is sold within the bright-line period), any excess deductions, not absorbed by rental income and profit on the sale, can then be released (if the requirements for this are met). Recommendation That the submission be declined. 89 Issue: Revenue account land – requirements for exclusion unclear Submission (Deloitte) The submitted stated that they were unable to understand the requirements in paragraph (b)(ii) of this provision (proposed section DB 18AF). Comment Proposed section DB 18AF(b)(ii) in the Bill provides that the exclusion for revenue account property can apply if a taxpayer is applying the rules on a portfolio basis, provided that all of the properties in the portfolio are on revenue account. This has been clarified in the redrafted provisions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Main home exclusion – where mixed-use land Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) It was submitted that there should be clarification on when the “main home” exemption would apply to mixed use land. Comment The proposed main home exclusion is based on the existing main home exclusion from the bright-line test, under which residential land may be taxed if disposed of with either two or five years of being acquired (depending on when the land was acquired). Under the proposed exclusion, the land would need to have been used predominantly, for most of the income year, for a dwelling that was the taxpayer’s main home. There is some Inland Revenue guidance, in the context of the bright-line main home exclusion, on what it means for land to have been used predominantly for a main home. It is clear from the guidance that this test requires consideration of the proportion of the physical area of the land that is used for the dwelling, and it is noted that in this context “predominantly’ means more than 50 percent. As noted in the guidance, in situations where land is used for more than one purpose, a taxpayer would need to determine the area of land used for their private residential purposes and the area of land used for other purposes. The guidance Inland Revenue has provided in respect of the bright-line main home exclusion will be relevant in relation to the proposed main home exclusion from the ring-fencing rules, to the extent the exclusions are the same. The difference between the two is for the bright-line exclusion, the land has to have been used predominantly for the main home for most of the time it is owned, whereas in the context of the proposed ring-fencing rules the test is whether it has been predominantly used as the main home for most of the income year. The guidance around 90 what “predominantly” means, which is relevant to land used for more than one purpose, is equally relevant to the main home exclusion from the proposed ring-fencing rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Main home exclusion – trust property Submission (Baucher Consulting Limited, Deloitte) It was submitted that the main home exclusion in relation to property held in a trust is unnecessarily restrictive. In particular, it was considered that the requirement that a principal settlor of the trust does not have a main home, or if they do it is the property in question, should be removed. It was considered that this definition is unnecessarily restrictive and excludes several legitimate “main home” situations that use a trust structure. For example, it was noted that a settlor may establish several trusts for differing asset protection reasons, or a single trust may hold several properties occupied by beneficiaries. It was submitted that the test for the exemption should be that contained in section CB 16A(1)(b)(ii) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (the residential exclusion from many of the land sale rules), and that a remedial amendment should also be made to section CB 16A (the main home exclusion from the bright-line test) in this regard. It was also noted that the wording in paragraph (b)(ii) is confusing. Comment The proposed rules are intended to apply to any rental property, including where a beneficiary of a trust rents trust property. If a beneficiary lives in trust property rent-free, the property- related expenses would not be deductible to the trustees, so the proposed rules would not be relevant. In terms of the submission that the proposed exclusion should be the same as the bright-line main home exclusion in section CB 16A, it is noted that this is the case in terms of property held in trust. As noted above, the difference between the two exclusions is the period over which the use of the property is looked at (being the whole period of ownership for the purposes of the bright-line test, and the income year for the purposes of the proposed ring-fencing rules). Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 91 Issue: Main home exclusion – should extend to the home of a taxpayer who is temporarily overseas Submission (KPMG) It was submitted that the main home exclusion should extend to cover the home of a taxpayer who is temporarily overseas. In this situation, the home would be the taxpayer’s main home if they were living in New Zealand, and the home could still be considered their permanent place of abode for tax residence purposes. It was submitted that the main home exclusion should be available for a taxpayer’s New Zealand residential property that was, or could reasonably be, their main home, where the taxpayer continues to retain their New Zealand tax residence. Comment The proposed main home exclusion is intended to apply based on the home being used by the taxpayer as their main home, for most of the income year. Officials do not consider that the fact that a property was the person’s main home, or could be if they lived in New Zealand, would justify excess deductions being able to be used against other income, if the property is being used as a rental property for the time being. While the property may still be regarded as a permanent place of abode of the taxpayer’s for tax residence purposes, the permanent place of abode test expressly contemplates that a person may have more than one permanent place of abode, and is about the parameters within which a person should still be tax resident in New Zealand (though the allocation of taxing rights may be impacted by the application of tax treaties). The proposed ring-fencing rules are aimed at ensuring deductions in respect of loss-making properties cannot be used against income from other sources, with the capital gains not being taxed. This rationale is applicable to properties that are temporarily rented out just as it is to other rental properties. The proposed exclusion being limited to the one property that is actually used as the taxpayer’s “main home” is consistent with the bright-line main home exclusion, which allows a taxpayer to have only one main home at a time. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Main home exclusion – unclear why needed Submission (Deloitte) The submitter considered it to be unclear why the provision was needed given that there is no need to ring-fence any property used personally by the owners due to the “private limitation” denying the ability to claim deductions in the first instance. Comment A property that is a person’s main home may also be partly used for income earning purposes (for example, all or part of the property may sometimes be rented out). In this situation, expenses relating to the property would be partly deductible. While in many situations, the 92 apportionment of expenses between the private use and the income-earning use of the property would mean that the activity is not loss-making, this would not necessarily be the case. The proposed rules are aimed at loss-making investment properties, rather than any incidental income-earning use of a taxpayer’s main home. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Employee accommodation – support for exclusion Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte) The submitters supported the exclusion for employer-provided accommodation – it was considered sensible and logical. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Employee accommodation – the exclusion should apply to all employee accommodation Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Submitters felt that more consideration should be given to ensuring the rules do no unnecessarily impose compliance costs on businesses that hold residential property in their business, as there is not the same mischief present. In particular, it was submitted that the rules should not apply to any employee accommodation. Submitters thought it was unclear why the current limitations for employee accommodation being carved out were considered necessary. Comment It is accepted that is most situations where employee accommodation is provided, the mischief the proposed rules are aimed at is not present. It is also accepted that this may include situations outside the scope of the exclusion proposed in the Bill. Given that the mischief is really only likely to be present in situations where the employer and employee are associated, officials are recommending limiting the restrictions currently proposed for employee accommodation to situations involving employee accommodation provided to associated persons. Officials are recommending that other employee accommodation be excluded from the rules without those restrictions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 93 Issue: Employee accommodation – the exclusion should extend to accommodation owned by a related entity Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) It was submitted that the exclusion for employee accommodation should include accommodation owned by a related entity. Comment If the Committee agrees with the above recommendation that the restrictions currently proposed for employee accommodation only apply to situations involving employee accommodation provided to associated persons, officials do not consider that there is any need for expanding the exclusion to cover property owned by related entities. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Employee accommodation – IR guidance Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) It was submitted that Inland Revenue should provide guidance on the extent of the exclusion for employee accommodation. Comment If the Committee agrees with the above recommendation that the restrictions currently proposed for employee accommodation apply only to situations involving employee accommodation provided to associated persons, officials do not consider that it is necessary to provide detailed guidance on the scope of the restrictions. However, officials propose to include some brief comment on the restrictions for employee accommodation provided to associated persons in the Tax Information Bulletin item covering the proposed rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Widely-held companies – support for exclusion Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The submitters supported the exclusion of property owned by widely-held companies. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 94 Issue: Widely-held companies – the exclusion should extend to Government and Government owned enterprises Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) One submitter commented that a number of large businesses that do not meet the definition of “widely-held company” would still be caught by the rules. It was considered that more consideration should be given to ensuring the rules do no unnecessarily impose compliance costs on such businesses that hold residential property in their business, as there is not the same mischief present. In particular, it was considered that the rules should not apply to Government and Government owned enterprises. It was suggested that this could be done by excluding the entities listed in schedule 36 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Comment Officials agree that the mischief the proposed rules are aimed at is not present in respect of the Government enterprises listed in schedule 36 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (which, in particular, includes Housing New Zealand Corporation and Housing New Zealand Limited). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: All non-land-rich companies should be excluded Submission (Deloitte) The submitter considered that all non-land-rich companies should be excluded, as the widely- held company exclusion would not cover large family-owned businesses or other private non- land-rich businesses – putting these entities at a potential competitive disadvantage and subjecting them to higher compliance costs. Comment Officials agree that in terms of companies, the mischief the proposed rules are aimed at is really only present in respect of close companies (in general terms, companies with five or fewer natural persons whose total voting interests are more than 50 percent – with associated persons being treated as one person). As such, officials consider that it would be appropriate for the proposed rules to not apply to companies other than close companies. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 95 PORTFOLIO OR PROPERTY-BY-PROPERTY APPLICATION OF THE RULES Clauses 49 and 65 Issue: Support for default portfolio approach Submission (New Zealand Property Investors Federation, Real Estate Institute of New Zealand) The submitters supported the rules applying on a portfolio basis by default. This was considered very sensible, as it would go some way towards minimising the reduction in supply of rental property, and also because it would be highly complex for owners with multiple properties to report properties on an individual basis. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Support for ability to elect property-by-property approach Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Real Estate Institute of New Zealand) The submitters supported taxpayers having the ability to apply the rules on a property-by- property basis. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Property-by-property approach should be allowed on change of use Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) It was submitted that there should be the ability for taxpayers to apply the rules on a property- by-property basis on a change of use that brings the property into the scope of the rules (for example, if a property that that had been used as commercial property or a main home became a residential rental property). Comment Officials agree that this is appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 96 Issue: The election to take a property-by-property approach Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) It was submitted that the election to apply the rules on a property-by-property basis should be made by taking a position on that basis in the tax return. Comment Officials agree that this is appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Different approaches for different properties Submission (New Zealand Law Society) It was submitted that the proposed legislation was not clear whether different approaches (portfolio or property-by-property) could be taken for different properties. It was submitted that this should be allowed. In particular, it was noted that some provisions suggest that a taxpayer may take a portfolio approach to some properties and a property-by-property approach to other property owned at the same time (for example, the meaning of “residential rental property” for proposed section DB 18AC, which excludes properties the taxpayer has elected to take a property-by- property approach to). However, it was considered that proposed section DB 18AD(1) seems inconsistent with that notion, with its requirement that the person owns no land that was residential rental property in the divestment year. Comment It is intended that the rules allow taxpayers to take different approaches for different properties. This may have been unclear from proposed section DB 18AD(1) in the Bill, because of the definition of “residential rental property” for the purposes of that propose section being at the end of the provision. This has been clarified in the redrafted provisions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 97 Issue: Different approaches taken by look-through company shareholders or partners in a partnership Submission (nsaTax Ltd) The submitter commented that the legislation appears to allow shareholders in a look-through company, or partners in a partnership, to take different approach to applying the rules (that is, portfolio or property-by-property). It was unclear whether this is an intended outcome. Comment It is not intended that shareholders in look-through companies, or partners in partnerships, can take different approaches to applying the rules (that is, whether they apply the rules on a portfolio or property-by-property basis). Whatever approach the entity has taken flows through to the partners or shareholders in these transparent entities. Officials will clarify this in the Tax Information Bulletin item covering the proposed rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 98 USE OF RING-FENCED AMOUNTS Clauses 49 and 65 Issue: Use of deductions against income from residential land that is outside the scope of the rules Submission (nsaTax Ltd) The submitter commented that the draft legislation only allows ring-fenced deductions to be offset against residential property income, which does not include income from residential land excluded from the scope of the rules (for example, land acquired for the purpose or intention of disposal, or land in a land development business). This seems contrary to the clear policy intent. Comment Officials agree that it is appropriate for ring-fenced deductions to be able to be used against income from residential land that is outside the scope of the rules because it is on revenue account (the examples given above), as all of the economic income from such land will be taxed. However, officials do not consider that ring-fenced deductions should be able to be used against income from other residential land that is outside the scope of the rules but will not be taxed on sale – for example, a mixed-use asset or main home. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Carried forward deductions from other properties Submission (Deloitte) The submitter commented that the definition of “net disposal income” in proposed section DB 18AC(3)(b) was hard to understand. It seems to suggest that if a taxpayer has excess ring-fenced deductions that it carries forward from divested properties, those deductions will act prohibitively to stop taxpayers from deducting property related expenditures to cover net income from the divestment of properties in the current year. The submitter noted that they were unable to identify the underlying policy considerations that would justify this approach. Comment Excess deductions may effectively be “transferred” from a property that was not taxed on sale (or a portfolio that was not fully-taxed on sale) to another property or another portfolio in the future. It is intended that these transferred deductions be able to be used against rental income or land sale income from the property or portfolio, but for those transferred amounts not to be released if the property or portfolio they have been transferred to is fully-taxed on disposal. 99 The provisions in the Bill may not achieve what is intended in this regard, and this has been provided for in the redrafted provisions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Unfencing on divestment – rules unclear Submission (Deloitte, New Zealand Law Society) One submitter commented that the rules for the “unfencing” of losses in proposed section DB 18AC(5) to (7) were difficult to understand. In particular, it was noted that subsection (5)(c) uses very complex language, and that as a result, a simple interpretation might suggest that all ring-fenced deductions are released when a portfolio is totally divested and no notification is made to carry forward deductions. It was observed that this outcome is contrary to the Bill Commentary. Another submitter thought that proposed section DB 18AC(5)(d) contains a precondition for the release of ring-fenced deductions from a portfolio, being that the person has not treated any excess deductions as deductions that relate to residential rental property under proposed sections DB 18AD to DB 18AH. It was considered unclear how proposed sections DB 18AD or DB 18AH could apply, since proposed section DB 18AC(5) applies only to taxable disposals, whereas proposed sections DB 18AD and DB 18AH apply to excess deductions where there have been one or more non-taxable disposals of land in the portfolio. It was submitted that proposed section DB 18AC(5)(d) should be deleted, or, if there is a reason to retain it, it should be redrafted so that the purpose of the provision is clearer. Comment It is acknowledged that these provisions in the Bill may be difficult to understand. The intention of the provisions is that if an amount of excess deductions from another property that was not taxed on sale has been transferred to another property or portfolio, no excess deductions can be released after the taxable sale of that property or the taxable divestment of that portfolio. Essentially, this would mean that the excess deductions relating to a non-taxable property would “taint” the property or portfolio the deductions were transferred to. However, officials now recommend that rather than “taint” the property or portfolio to which the excess deductions are transferred, the amount otherwise available for release instead be reduced by the transferred amount. This is considered a more appropriate outcome. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 100 Issue: Release in year of taxable divestment Submission (New Zealand Law Society) It was noted that the intention is to remove the ring-fencing of deductions in respect of a portfolio if all the property has been disposed of and each disposal gave rise to income. However, it was submitted that proposed section DB 18AC(5)(c) is difficult to interpret and appears to require the last disposal to occur before the start of the year in which the deduction is released. It was submitted that if that is the intended meaning, the preferable approach would be for the deduction to be released in the income year of the final taxable disposal. Comment This is how the rules were intended to operate, and has been provided for in the redrafted provisions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Order in which different classes of losses to be used Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, nsaTax Ltd) It was submitted that the proposed legislation should specify the order in which ring-fenced deductions are utilised (for example, on a “first in, first out” basis). It was noted that the Bill implies a “first in, first out” basis for a wholly-owned group company, by virtue of the reference to continuity for companies and section IA 5 and IP 3 of the Act. However, there is no indication as to the order losses should be utilised for individuals, look-through companies, partnerships or trusts. It was submitted that the proposed legislation should clarify whether different classes of losses are to be used in a certain order. For example, a taxpayer may have an overall loss in the current year but have made a profit on the residential rental activity. Is the taxpayer able to utilise or re-characterise a portion of the quarantined brought forward losses against the residential rental profit? Comment If a taxpayer has made an overall loss in a particular income year but has made a profit on the residential rental activity, any ring-fenced residential property deductions they have from prior years would be able to be used against those profits, as they can be used against rental income, not overall net income. This will have the effect of decreasing the amount of the ring-fenced deductions. Officials will clarify this in the Tax Information Bulletin item covering the proposed rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 101 Issue: Support for release of ring-fenced deductions on taxable sale Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) It was submitted that the proposed rule to release ring-fenced losses in some circumstances is fair. Officials were thanked for responding to feedback. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Ring-fenced deductions should be released on sale, whether taxable or not Submission (New Zealand Property Investors Federation) Under the proposal, losses could only be offset against residential rental income from future years or taxable income on sale. As there is no capital gains tax in New Zealand, there is no tax payable when a rental property is sold. This means that losses could only be offset against rental income from future years. This introduces risk for rental property owners, as if they have to sell the property before it becomes income producing they completely lose the benefit of the losses. This is completely unfair given that the rule will not apply to other asset classes. This risk further reduces the incentive to buy and provide rental property. It was submitted that if the proposal is introduced, losses should be released if a property is sold, whether or not the sale is taxed. Comment One of the rationales for the proposed rules is that not all of the economic income from an investment property is taxed, so to the extent deductions exceed rental income in the long-term, they in substance relate to the untaxed capital gain and should not be allowed. If excess deductions were released on any sale, whether taxable or not, this would undermine one of the key rationales for the proposed rules. While there is no capital gains tax in New Zealand, there are some circumstances in which sales of residential land will be taxable (for example, under the bright-line test). If that is the case, ring-fenced deductions could be used against that (net) income. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 102 Issue: Transfer of ring-fenced amounts within a “group of companies” Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, nsaTax Ltd) It was submitted that the rules should allow ring-fenced deductions to be transferred within a “group of companies”, as other losses can be, not just within a wholly-owned group. It was considered that there is no mischief in allowing ring-fenced deductions to be transferred between ordinary group companies, so the 66 percent commonality requirement that applies for all other losses should be used here too. Comment Losses can be transferred under the loss grouping rules where the companies have at least 66 percent common ownership (in addition to other requirements being satisfied). Officials consider that ring-fenced losses should be able to be transferred between companies, but that this should be limited to companies in the same wholly-owned group, as the economic ownership is the same in that situation. This restriction to wholly-owned groups is consistent with the approach taken to the grouping of most other tax attributes, for example, the inter-corporate dividend exemption, intra-group transfers of trading stock, consolidated group rules, imputation group rules, use of attributed CFC net losses or FIF net losses by group companies, use of CFC foreign tax credits by group companies, and use of credits for supplementary dividends by group companies. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Ring-fenced amounts should not be subject to the shareholder continuity rules Submission (PwC, Real Estate Institute of New Zealand) It was submitted that there should be more flexibility for companies to carry forward unused losses. Companies are subject to the 49 percent shareholder continuity rules for carrying forward income tax losses. It was submitted that it would further significantly limit the ability for companies to use losses from residential investment properties if the ring-fenced losses are also subject to the shareholder continuity rules. Comment As noted above, officials are now recommending that the proposed rules not apply to companies other than close companies. Officials do not consider that there is any strong basis to not apply the general shareholder continuity rules in relation to excess deductions for the companies the rules will apply to. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 103 Issue: There should be a mechanism for subvention payments to be allowed Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, nsaTax Ltd) It was submitted that the rules should allow for companies to pay for losses transferred to them. The transfer or offset of ring-fenced deductions will create unimputed retained earnings for the recipient company, which in turn creates an uncrystallised tax liability on the ultimate distribution of retained earnings. To avoid this, subvention payments should be allowed for – this could be done by way of reference to the existing loss offset rules in subpart IC, which allow for the making of a subvention payment. Comment Officials are now recommending that the proposed rules not apply to companies other than close companies. If this recommendation is accepted, officials do not consider that it is necessary to provide for subvention payments in relation to excess deductions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Treatment of ring-fenced deductions for consolidated group companies and amalgamated companies Submission (nsaTax Ltd) There should be rules to deal with the treatment of ring-fenced deductions for consolidated group companies and amalgamated companies. The proposed rules do not deal with this, which is inconsistent with the rest of the Income Tax Act 2007. Comment As noted above, officials are now recommending that the proposed rules not apply to companies other than close companies. If this recommendation is accepted, officials do not consider it necessary to specifically provide for the treatment of ring-fenced deductions for consolidated groups or amalgamated companies. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 104 Issue: Treatment of ring-fenced deductions on change of use Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) It was submitted that the legislation should clarify the status of accumulated ring-fenced deductions when land has had a change of use, or partial change of use (for example, from residential rental to commercial rental or main home). Where a residential rental with ring- fenced excess deductions is converted to a commercial use, there appears to be no ability to offset any accumulated deductions against the future income from that property. It was submitted that these ring-fenced deductions should be available to be used against the property while it remains within the definition of residential property (that is, where it has been used as a residential rental for more than half the time). However, it was noted that this will cause complexity as the taxpayer is required to keep applying the test to determine the point at which it becomes predominantly commercial – as such it was suggested that the better answer may be to apply the test annually rather than over the life of the property. Comment Where there has been a change of use of residential land (for example from residential rental to commercial rental), ring-fenced deductions would be able to be used against income from the property while it remains within the definition of “residential rental property”. Officials consider that if a property has been “residential land” at any time in an income year it should “residential rental property” for that year. This would mean that in a change of use year, where the property has been a “residential rental property” in the year, any ring-fenced deductions in relation to the property could be used against any other income from the property (for example, commercial rent). It is noted that the definition of “residential rental property” excludes the main home. To be the “main home” the property has to have been used as the main home for most of the income year. Because of this, if the change of use has been from residential rental to the taxpayer’s “main home”, the ring-fencing rules would not apply in relation to the rental deductions for that year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Transferred excess deductions should not “taint” other deductions Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) It was submitted that excess deductions on sale should not “taint” deductions that relate to another property or portfolio. Only the excess that relates to the non-taxable property should remain ring-fenced – any excess deductions that relate to a property taxed on sale should be released. 105 Comment Officials now recommend that rather than “taint” the property or portfolio to which the excess deductions are transferred, the amount otherwise available for release instead be reduced by the transferred amount. This is considered a more appropriate outcome. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Use of ring-fenced deductions against depreciation recovery income Submission (Capital Accounting Associates Limited (oral submission), nsaTax Ltd) The proposed rules may result in a taxpayer being taxed on depreciation recovery income, despite the underlying depreciation deductions being denied. It is conceivable that depreciation recovery income will arise for residential rental property (for example, chattels, or historical depreciation on buildings). The legislation does not allow current year or carried forward ring- fenced deductions to be offset against depreciation recovery income – which arises from the disposal of chattels which are not residential rental income, and it arises under subpart EE not sections CC 1 to CC 2. It was submitted that ring-fenced deductions should be claimable against such depreciation recovery income. Comment Residential rental chattels are unlikely to be sold for above tax book value, giving rise to depreciation recovery income. However, some properties investors may have depreciation recovery income arising on the sale of their properties because of historic building depreciation claimed. Officials agree it is appropriate that any excess deductions be able to be offset against any depreciation recovery income. The redrafted Bill allows for this. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Use of ring-fenced deductions against financial arrangement income Submission (nsaTax Ltd) It was submitted that ring-fenced deductions should be claimable against financial arrangement income arising from debt related to the residential rental property. It was noted that it is likely that offshore residential rental property will be funded by foreign denominated currency, and movements in the exchange rate may give rise to gains under the financial arrangements rules. 106 Comment There is currently a project on the tax policy work programme looking at issues in respect of the financial arrangements rules and foreign mortgages. Officials consider that the issue in relation to foreign exchange losses that submitters have raised should be considered as part of that project, so there is a coherent and consistent approach. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Use of ring-fenced deductions arising from the interposed entity rules Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) It was submitted that the legislation should specify how ring-fenced deductions arising from the interposed entity rules can be used. In particular, the taxpayer may not receive “residential rental property income” (for example, from another property, held directly), but may receive dividends from the company. Otherwise, the only corresponding “income” will be a gain on sale of the shares in the company, which may be held on capital account. It was submitted that ring-fenced deductions should be able to be used against dividends from the residential land- rich company (or the portion that relates to residential rental property), or against distributions from a residential land-rich trust. It was also submitted that the interposed entity rules should be modified so that an interposed entity can offset ring-fenced losses if they derive income that is related to residential property income. The submitter commented that the interposed entity is unlikely to receive “residential rental property income” as that term is defined in the Bill. Comment Officials agree that ring-fenced deductions arising from the application of the interposed entity rules should be able to be used against distributions from the entity, to the extent those distributions relate to residential property income. This has been clarified in the redrafted provisions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 107 THE INTERPOSED ENTITY RULES Clauses 49 and 65 Issue: When “applied capital percentage” should be determined Submission (New Zealand Law Society, nsaTax Ltd) It was submitted that the interposed entity rules should specify the applicable point in time for determining the “applied capital percentage”. One submitter commented that presumably the intention is that this is determined at the end of each income year. Another submitter suggested that the rules should cater for changes in the applied capital percentage throughout the year. The example given was: • At the start of the income year, $600,000 was borrowed and used to subscribe for shares in the residential land-rich company, with the funds being used to buy a residential rental property. • On 31 March, $400,000 was borrowed and used to subscribe for further shares, with the funds being used to buy a share portfolio. It was noted that in this scenario, the “applied capital percentage” at the start of the year would be 100 percent. At the end of the income year it would be 60 percent. And the weighted average applied capital percentage calculated on a daily basis would be 99.9 percent. The legislation does not indicate when the applied capital percentage should be measured, so it could be any of these. This should be clarified. Comment The provisions as currently drafted do not clarify when the “applied capital percentage” is to be determined. For the sake of simplicity, officials recommend that this be as at the end of the income year. The redrafted provisions provide for this. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 108 Issue: The rules require tracing the use of funds Submission (nsaTax Ltd) The submitter noted that there are no interest allocation rules, because it was considered that these would introduce substantial complexity (as discussed in the Regulatory Impact Statement). However, it was submitted that the rules dealing with interest deductibility require tracing of the use of funds – for example, the definition of “applied capital percentage” in proposed section DB 18AJ(4). Comment Officials do not consider that the definition of “applied capital percentage” requires tracing of the use of funds. Rather, the definition simply requires identification of the percentage of the entity’s existing capital that represents the cost of any residential rental property the entity owns. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Absurd outcomes from “applied capital percentage” rule Submission (nsaTax Ltd) It was submitted that the “applied capital percentage” rule will result in absurd outcomes. The example given was: • A look-through company owns the shareholders’ private residence, the purchase price of which was funded through share capital funded from the shareholders’ cash. • The shareholders also borrowed to subscribe for further share capital, which is in turn used to acquire a residential rental property. It was submitted that in this scenario, only part of the interest deductions would be subject to ring-fencing, which is an absurd outcome as clearly the borrowed funds were used to acquire the residential rental property. Comment The “applied capital percentage”, for the purposes of the interposed entity rules, is the percentage of the entity’s capital that has been used to acquire residential rental property. The rule has the effect of essentially regarding all of the capital (both debt and equity) as split on a pro rata basis between the different investments the capital has funded. This is intended to be easier to apply than a rule requiring taxpayers to trace the use of specific funds. Officials consider this to be the most appropriate approach on the basis of its relative simplicity. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 109 Issue: Different classes of shares Submission (nsaTax Ltd) It was submitted that the interest limitation rules should provide for situations where there are different classes of shares. Otherwise, it was considered that there could be unfair results (for example, in a situation where some shares carry voting rights and other shares carry rights to participate in distributions). Comment One of the elements in the interposed entity “share of profits” formula is the person’s interest, which for a company is their voting interest in the company. The provision in the Income Tax Act 2007 that defines “voting interest” deals with situations where shareholder decision-making rights vary. Officials do not consider that there is any need to provide for the potential for different share classes with some shares carrying voting rights and others carrying rights to participate in distributions. The interposed entity rules are intended to prevent the ring-fencing rules being circumvented through a taxpayer borrowing to invest in an entity which invests in residential property. The proposed rules would limit the person’s interest deductions in this situation, based on the person’s interest in the entity (for companies) and the level of capital applied to acquiring residential property. If a person chooses to invest in residential property through an entity rather than directly, they could ensure they have voting interests so they could deduct some of their interest in the current year. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarification on trust rule Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, nsaTax Ltd) One submitter considered that the proposed interposed entity rule applicable to trusts was unworkable, as it is not possible to acquire an interest in a trust, so this is unworkable. Another submitter considered that the commentary should be expanded to clarify that the interposed entity rule for trusts is intended to apply to the beneficiary of a fixed trust that is not a unit trust, where the beneficiary borrows to acquire the interest in the trust. It was suggested that the commentary should also note that this situation is not likely to occur often. Comment As noted by one of the submitters, the interposed entity rule for trusts is intended to apply in relation to fixed trusts that are not unit trusts. While this may not arise often in practice, the interposed entity rules are aimed at preventing circumvention of the ring-fencing rules, so 110 officials consider that the legislation should cover this possibility. Officials will clarify this in the Tax Information Bulletin item covering the proposed rules. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Reference to trusts “with” property Submission (nsaTax Ltd) It was submitted that the definition of a “residential land-rich entity” is confusing in relation to trusts, as it refers to a trust “with” residential rental property. The submitters commented that it is unclear why the definition does not refer to the trustees “owning” the property. It was submitted that if it is intended to include a trust that has the use of a residential rental property that it does not own, this should be specified, and also presumably this would be the case for companies, partnerships and look-through companies too. Comment The definition of “residential land-rich entity” in the Bill, as it relates to trusts, refers to a trust “with residential rental property as trust property”. Officials consider this to be clear, as trust property is property owned by the trustees. The definition in the redrafted provisions differs slightly, and refers to “a trustee of a trust whose property includes residential rental property”. Officials think it is clear this refers to property owned by the trustee. Similarly, the definition in the redrafted provisions refers to a company, partnership, or look-through company if more than 50 percent of “its assets” are residential land. It is noted that the provisions cover leasehold estates not just estates in fee simple (see submission titled Issue: Leased land). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The interposed entity rule should not apply to look-through companies Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) It was submitted that the interposed entity rules should not apply to look through companies. As look-through companies are transparent, any excess deduction in a look-through company should belong to the shareholder and be available to put into a “portfolio” owned by the shareholder and used to offset any rental profits of the shareholder has. 111 The submitter noted that the extent to which a look-through company is transparent has been raised with the Committee and with officials, but that this issue has never been resolved. The submitter considered that the inclusion of look-through companies as interposed entities suggests that a look through company is not fully transparent. The submitter considered that clarity in this area is needed and should be a priority. Comment Any excess deduction a look-through company has would belong to the shareholder, and would be able to be used by the shareholder against income from other residential property the shareholder may own. This would make those properties a portfolio for the shareholder. However, if the interposed entity rules did not apply to look-through companies, the shareholder’s interest in respect of the borrowings used to invest in the entity would be fully deductible for the income year, even if the residential property was not profitable. The interposed entity rules are aimed at restricting the interest deduction that can be allocated to income year. These rules are necessary even for transparent entities because otherwise the ring- fencing rules would not apply to the shareholder’s (or partner’s, in the case of a partnership) interest deduction, as that expenditure would not be incurred in relation to the property, but in relation to the investment in the entity. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Absurd outcomes if residential rental property sold Submission (nsaTax Ltd) It was submitted that the land-rich entity rules could result in absurd outcomes if a residential rental property is subsequently sold by the entity, but the entity remains land-rich because the shareholders’ private residence is in the entity. The example given was: • A look-through company owns the shareholders’ main home, which cost $600,000 and was funded through share capital funded by the shareholders’ cash. • The shareholders borrow $400,000 which they use to subscribe for further share capital, which is used to acquire a residential rental property. • Subsequently, the look-through company sells the rental property for $400,000 and applies the sale proceeds to acquire a managed share portfolio. • The look-through company remains a land-rich entity, and the “applied capital percentage” remains at 40 percent (total share capital of $1m, with $400,000 applied to acquire the residential rental property). • Interest incurred by the shareholders will be ring-fenced to the extent of 40 percent, even though the look-through company no longer holds the rental property. • No deduction is claimable by the shareholders as they have no rental income attributed to them by the look-through company. 112 It was submitted that this is an absurd outcome. Comment If a residential land-rich entity sells property and residential land no longer makes up over 50 percent of its assets, the entity will no longer be a “residential land rich entity” as defined. The interest incurred by the shareholders from that time would not be ring-fenced. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Unlikely to be fully effective Submission (EY) The submitter agreed that a “land-rich entity” rule is required to give the rules any chance of success. However, they cautioned that the rule is unlikely to be fully effective. It was noted that well-funded investors may ensure their land-rich entity is not debt-funded, organising their finances to deduct debt elsewhere. Further, investors with residential property and other significant assets would be able to ensure the 50 percent threshold is not reached. Comment It is acknowledged that well-funded investors would be able to debt fund investments other than their residential properties. This is the case whether the investor holds their residential properties in an entity or directly; it is not an issue specific to the proposed land-rich entity rules, but the ring-fencing rules more generally. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 113 MISCELLANEOUS INTERPRETIVE ISSUES Clauses 49 and 65 Issue: “Unless the context otherwise requires” Submission (Deloitte) It was submitted that the phrase “unless the context requires otherwise” in proposed section DB 18AD(6) (which defines “residential rental property” for the purposes of that section) leaves the provision open to abstract interpretation. It is unclear what the “context” could be that could result in “residential rental property” for the purposes of that section being other than as defined in subsection (6). Comment Officials agree that this “unless the context otherwise requires” is unnecessary in this definition. The redrafted provisions are structured differently, and the issue does not arise in the redraft. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: “Pieces” of residential rental property Submission (Deloitte) It was submitted that the phrase “pieces of residential rental property” is odd, as it connotes a portion of a whole (for example, part of a property). Comment Officials agree that the phrase “pieces of residential rental property” is confusing. The redrafted provisions do not use this term when referring to property to which the rules are being applied on a property-by-property basis. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 114 Issue: Does the default portfolio approach apply to a single property? Submission (Deloitte) It was submitted that there should be clarification of the treatment of a taxpayer’s single rental property, as this cannot be a “portfolio” under the common meaning of that term, but the “piece of property” rules only apply by election. Comment It was intended that the default “portfolio” approach could be used for a single property, despite the common meaning of the term “portfolio”. However, as noted in relation to the submission titled Issue: The election to take a property-by- property approach, officials are recommending that the election to apply the rules on a property-by-property basis should be made by taking a position on that basis in the tax return. The effect of this would be that if a taxpayer has only one rental property, the rules would be applied on the property-by-property basis. If they subsequently acquire another property, they could apply the rules on the portfolio basis. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Land that was residential rental property “at some time” owned Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Proposed section DB 18AC(4) uses the phrase “at some time when they owned the land”. It was submitted that the natural meaning of the phrase is that the person no longer owns the land, however, subsection (4) is clearly intended to apply when the land is still owned, although it is no longer residential rental property. It was suggested that the subsection would be clearer if it was rephrased as: “the person owns residential rental property or land that was, in a previous income year, residential rental property of the person”. Comment This has been clarified in the redrafted provisions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 115 Issue: Lack of clarity about portfolio and property-by-property basis Submission (Anne Shotbolt, David Phipps, Kevin Cox, Leonie Jamieson) Two submitters stated that the rules should apply on a portfolio basis. One submitter asked not to remove the ability to offset losses within a portfolio. One submitter commented that applying the rules on a property-by-property basis is undesirable as losses should be transferrable between properties. Comment The proposed rules would apply on a portfolio basis by default, with taxpayers having the option to choose to apply them on a property-by-property basis for a particular property. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Allocating ring-fenced deductions to another property on non-taxable disposal or divestment Submission (Matter raised by officials) Ring-fenced deductions remaining on the sale of a property or the divestment of a portfolio can be treated as relating to another property. However, as currently drafted, these provisions limit the ability to do this to a later income year (proposed sections DB 18AD(1)(f) and DB 18AH(1)(d)). The ability to treat these excess deductions as relating to another property should be available for the income year in question (the sale or divestment year) or a later income year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 116 TRANSITIONAL AND OTHER ISSUES Clauses 49 and 65 Issue: Restructuring should not result in adverse tax consequences Submission (PwC, Real Estate Institute of New Zealand) It was submitted that there should be transitional rules to ensure there are no adverse tax consequences for taxpayers who wish to restructure their investments in light of the proposed rules. For example, it was noted that investors may want to split out their rental properties and hold them in a separate vehicle. It was submitted that if there is no change in the economic ownership, such transfers should not result in taxable income (for example, under the bright- line or other land sale rules). Comment Officials do not consider there to be a strong basis for transitional rules if taxpayers choose to restructure their investments, and consider that the general rules should apply. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Increased compliance costs and IR education programme Submission (Accountants + Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited, Generate Accounting Group Limited) It was submitted that the proposed rules will result in significant additional compliance costs for taxpayers and their advisors, and that these costs will be magnified by the hurried introduction of the rules. It was noted that many residential property investors hold only one or two properties and may not have easy access to the necessary level of advice required to comply. As such, it was recommended that Inland Revenue run an appropriate educational programme to ensure all residential property advisors are made aware of the changes and their potential impact. Comment Inland Revenue will produce guidance to assist taxpayers and advisors in complying with the rules. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 117 Care and management of tax system 118 119 OVERVIEW Seven submissions were made on the proposal to extend the Commissioner’s care and management role. Most submitters supported the proposal. Submissions focused largely on further technical refinements to the legislative drafting of the proposal. The Commissioner’s care and management role was considered as part of a wider review of the Tax Administration Act in the 2015 Government discussion document Towards a New Tax Administration Act. At the time, it was noted that a key aspect of the Commissioner’s care and management role is explaining the law to taxpayers. It was also noted that generally tax law could be interpreted consistently with the policy intent, but that in some circumstances the interpretation of the law when applying ordinary statutory interpretation principles may not accord with the policy intent. When this happens, it can tie the Commissioner’s and the taxpayer’s resources up in outcomes that are inconsistent with both parties’ practice and/or expectations. A proposal was developed to extend the Commissioner’s care and management role to provide her with more flexibility to address issues with tax law that produced outcomes that were inconsistent with policy intent. The proposal was originally included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill which was introduced to Parliament in June 2018. The proposal was removed from that Bill at the recommendation of the Finance and Expenditure Committee for further work to take place with the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee and affected parties. The revised proposal includes a regulation-making power and an administrative power of exemption. The regulation-making power permits the Governor General to make an Order in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue and this is referred to as a “modification”. The administrative power of exemption is for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and this is referred to as an “exemption”. Broadly, the powers can be used where there is an issue with tax legislation that produces an outcome that is inconsistent with intended policy outcomes (for example, there is a drafting error or inconsistency in the legislation). Modifications and exemptions are subject to several safeguards, including optional application for affected taxpayers, automatic expiration within three years, and a period of public consultation before a modification or exemption comes into force. The revised legislative drafting in the Supplementary Order Paper reflects work between Inland Revenue officials, the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee, and submitters. All references to legislation in this section are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the provisions proposed to be inserted to the Tax Administration Act 1994 as contained in the Supplementary Order Paper. 120 EXTENDING THE COMMISSIONER’S CARE AND MANAGEMENT ROLE Clause 67E Issue: Support for the proposal Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, New Zealand Law Society, New Zealand Super Fund, Russell McVeagh) Six submitters supported the proposal in the Supplementary Order Paper which provides alternative options to resolve issues with tax legislation that produce results which are inconsistent with the policy intent. The submitters agreed that the overall proposal would give more flexibility to tax administration. The redrafted power allows for modifications and exemptions from the Inland Revenue Acts in certain circumstances and for a limited time. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The proposed power will provide greater certainty to taxpayers seeking to apply tax legislation containing drafting errors, ambiguities and inconsistencies. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Super Fund) Given the challenges inherent in developing, administering and maintaining tax legislation during a time of major law and systems change, we accept there is a case for remedial powers. The way in which the remedial powers are delineated so that the Commissioner may grant an exemption from a provision of the Inland Revenue Acts, with modifications being reserved for the Governor General by way of Order in Council, is also reasonable. (EY) The Law Society submits that the redrafted provisions will achieve their intended purpose and have enough taxpayer protections to ameliorate many of the rule of law concerns previously raised in its submission on the proposal as drafted in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill. (New Zealand Law Society) A submitter supports the proposed powers to create modifications or exemptions to temporarily remedy or mitigate the effect of drafting errors and other anomalies in tax legislation. The proposed powers will provide a more principled, consistent and transparent framework for addressing drafting errors and other anomalies in tax legislation than is currently available. (Russell McVeagh) Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 121 Issue: Proposed safeguards are appropriate Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, New Zealand Law Society, New Zealand Super Fund) Although we have always supported the extension of the power, we believed it was important that appropriate safeguards were put in place. This proposed legislation includes several. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) It will be apparent that the limitations constrain the content of any modification or exemption (such that it must not be inconsistent with the intended purpose or object of the law enacted by Parliament) as well as requiring a high level of transparency and procedural scrutiny. The proposed adjustments would provide a consistent, principled and transparent framework for addressing drafting errors. The proposed power is to address drafting errors in the legislation itself rather than errors made by a taxpayer. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The safeguards for taxpayers included in the Supplementary Order Paper covering these concerns are generally well considered. All taxpayers should be entitled to depend on the law as it has been passed by Parliament where this is to their advantage. The ability for the taxpayer to opt-in (or opt-out as applicable) to the modification or exemption is the most crucial counterweight to the powers to override primary legislation. (EY) We consider the proposed powers are more principled and transparent than the status quo provided by Inland Revenue’s care and management power, which requires Inland Revenue to address legislative anomalies by declining to enforce the provisions that result in the anomaly; and for these reasons, strengthen the rule of law and are (given the various proposed safeguards the proposed powers incorporate) a pragmatic way of addressing anomalies given the limits on Parliament’s time, while respecting Parliament’s sovereignty to make laws. (Russell McVeagh) The redrafted provisions will achieve their intended purpose and have sufficient taxpayer protections to ameliorate many of the rule of law concerns previously raised. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment Officials worked with the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee to ensure that concerns with the rule of law were mitigated as best as possible. Officials note the proposal includes the following safeguards: • Optional application. Modifications and exemptions must always be optional for taxpayers to apply. If taxpayers choose not to apply the modification or the exemption, the law applies to the person as if the modification or exemption did not exist. • General application to a class of taxpayers. Modifications and exemptions will not be able to change the application of a tax law for a particular taxpayer, but will be limited to groups or classes or taxpayers (or circumstances) to ensure it is only used to remedy objectively determined issues with tax laws. • Changes must not be inconsistent with the intended policy. Modifications and exemptions must not be inconsistent with intended policy outcomes, and cannot be broader than is reasonably necessary to give effect to intended policy outcomes. 122 • Three-year time limit. Modifications and exemptions will expire within three years of coming into force. This should provide sufficient time for amendments to primary legislation to be considered. • Public consultation. Before a modification or exemption is made, there must generally be a period of six weeks for public consultation, unless a case of urgency exists. • Disallowable instruments. Modifications and exemptions are disallowable instruments. Both will be subject to review by the Regulations Review Committee and can be disallowed by the House of Representatives. In addition, modifications will be reviewed by Cabinet. As the proposed powers are significant officials acknowledge the need for appropriate safeguards to ensure the powers cannot be used to weaken the rule of law or disadvantage taxpayers. Officials consider the draft legislation in the Supplementary Order Paper achieves this. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Opposition to the proposal Submission (Alison Pavlovich) The submitter opposes the proposal because they consider it undermines the segregation of powers required for a stable and effective democracy. The submitter notes that the limitation on the power of the executive branch of government to administrative functions is vital to ensure the law is executed fairly across all taxpayers, as legislated by Parliament. This extension of power would allow the Commissioner (and others) to exempt some taxpayers from the law. The submitter considers the provision will benefit only those taxpayers who can afford representation to lobby the Commissioner to utilise the power, resulting in a power that cannot be enjoyed by the wider populous (and instead only those who can afford to pay for it) which has the effect of undermining of democracy. The submitter provides an example of how the power might operate, noting that under the proposal the Commissioner does not have to apply the law strictly due to the perceived unfairness of the outcome. The submitter notes the proposal will circumvent the process required for tax law change, including public consultation, scrutiny by the Finance and Expenditure Committee, independent advice and parliamentary scrutiny. In addition, the submitter considers that a power provided to an unelected member of the executive should not be legitimised. The submitter also notes that compliant taxpayers would be penalised if they pay tax according to the law when non-compliant taxpayers are excused under the proposed powers. The potential to treat some taxpayers differently to others undermines the voluntary compliance model as perceived unfairness and reduces a taxpayer’s willingness to comply. 123 The submitter also points out that this proposal has been introduced to the Bill by way of a Supplementary Order Paper, which manages to escape some of the scrutiny the Bill has already been under. Comment The proposal does provide the Commissioner with the ability to exempt taxpayers from the provisions within the Inland Revenue Acts in limited circumstances where the law cannot be interpreted in a manner consistent with its policy intent. It should be noted that the Commissioner’s power of exemption is intended to only be used for minor or administrative matters where there are no, or negligible fiscal implications. For other issues that are not better resolved through waiting for amendments to primary legislation, the modification by Order in Council would be used. Inland Revenue officials have worked closely with the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee to mitigate concerns with the rule of law. This is reflected in the numerous safeguards contained in the legislative drafting, as outlined in the response to the submission on the existence of appropriate safeguards above. Officials do not agree that the proposal will benefit only those taxpayers who can afford representation to lobby the Commissioner to utilise the power. This is because, in implementing the proposal, Inland Revenue will create a channel for taxpayers to raise issues that they believe should be considered in the context of these powers. Further, as modifications and exemptions have general application, they must be available for all taxpayers who are affected by the issue to apply. In addition, officials do not agree that the power could be used in the manner described in the submitter’s example. The proposed power cannot be used to address circumstances where a person makes a mistake in taking a tax position (such as the case in the submitter’s example) but is instead limited to situations where the legislation is inconsistent with (or cannot be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with) the clear and understood policy intent. Further, as noted, a modification or an exemption made under the proposed powers would have general application to taxpayers (or a class of persons or circumstances) so the chances of the power being used to the benefit of only one taxpayer would be very low. A key objective of the proposal is to provide a temporary “bridge” for taxpayers who, despite knowing what the intended outcomes are, are unable to achieve those outcomes based on the wording of the legislation. Officials agree that the best means of achieving this would be through amendments to primary legislation, but also note that this cannot always be achieved quickly. This prolongs uncertainty for taxpayers who may be required to provide Inland Revenue with numerous tax returns during the period new legislation is being contemplated and enacted. Without a temporary solution, taxpayers may be unsure about what tax positions to take in filing their returns. Officials also do not agree that taxpayers can be penalised under the proposal. This is because, as noted above, a modification or an exemption has general application to all taxpayers affected by the issue the modification or the exemption is seeking to resolve, and taxpayers can choose whether they apply a modification or an exemption to their circumstances. A person will always have the option to continue to apply the law as if the modification or the exemption did not exist, and the Commissioner must apply the law in relation to the person as if the modification or the exemption did not exist in these circumstances. In addition, in circumstances where a modification applies to earlier periods and taxpayers have already taken tax positions, taxpayers 124 will be able to ask the Commissioner to amend their returns to align the tax positions in those returns with the modification. As also noted, the proposal was originally included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill which was introduced to Parliament in June 2018. The proposal was removed pending further work between Inland Revenue officials and the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. The draft legislation in the Supplementary Order Paper reflects that work as well as input from private sector submitters. The truncated process was signalled in the officials’ report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on submissions to that bill. Officials also note that the proposal has been the subject of significant and ongoing consultation since its inclusion in the 2015 Government discussion document, Towards a New Tax Administration Act. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Operationalisation of the proposed powers Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The success of the new power will depend on how it is put into practice. We acknowledge that the proposed power is intended to be wider than the current power and to allow the Commissioner or the Minister to give primacy to the policy intent of the legislation. It will be important that the new power is used in a targeted way, in situations when it is needed and to the extent intended. Given the importance of the Government policy to the exercise of the power, it will be important the policy officials are involved in decisions on its exercise. If these things are not done, there is a risk that the power will not be effective. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment Inland Revenue is currently in the process of preparing interpretation guidelines for the proposed new provisions. These guidelines would be used by Inland Revenue in applying the proposed new provisions. This will ensure that any interpretative issues that arise during the implementation process will be subject to consultation and further discussion. It is expected that these guidelines will be subject to both internal and external consultation. In addition to the guidelines, clear processes are being developed, and will be made publicly available, to allow taxpayers to request the use of the power through Inland Revenue’s website. Further information will also be provided in the Tax Information Bulletin covering changes on the Bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 125 Issue: Clarification that costs of compliance can be considered Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Super Fund, Russell McVeagh) The submitters propose the powers should be able to be used in circumstances where it is reasonably necessary to provide an alternative means of complying with provisions that are difficult to comply with. In these circumstances, a modification or an exemption should be available to provide an alternative means of complying, provided the modification or exemption is consistent with the intent of the legislation to which the modification or exemption would apply. The other protections and limitations included in the proposed powers would also apply. It is also submitted that this could be achieved by amending proposed sections 6D(5)(a)(ii) and 6E(1)(c) by adding the underlined text: to give effect to the intended purpose or object of a provision of the Inland Revenue Acts, or to resolve ambiguity, including by providing an alternative means of complying with a provision of the Inland Revenue Acts: This clarification is appropriate because one of the circumstances in which legislative drafting results in difficulties for taxpayers and does not achieve the intended purpose or object of the legislation is where the drafting specifies a means of compliance that is not workable in practice. An example would be a rule requiring market value to be determined in a certain way (for example, by using a certain index or database) in circumstances where it is not practicable to use that method, and/or the method would not in fact result in a reasonable assessment of market value. This sort of drafting error may impose financial costs, as well as additional uncertainty and stress for taxpayers seeking to comply with their obligations. The exercise of the power to address such a situation would result in the law as drafted better reflecting Parliament’s intent, and would enhance the integrity of the tax system. Comment Officials consider the proposed wording of the draft legislation in the Supplementary Order Paper could cater for the circumstances described by the submitters. Proposed sections 6D(5) and 6E(2) outline the circumstances in which a modification or an exemption may be made. That is, where the Minister of Revenue or the Commissioner considers it is reasonably necessary to do one or more of the following: • to remedy or mitigate the effect of an “obvious error” (as defined in proposed section 6G) in a provision of the Inland Revenue Acts; • to give effect to the intended purpose or object of a provision of the Inland Revenue Acts, or to resolve ambiguity; • to reconcile an inconsistency between certain provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts, or between the relevant provision and an administrative practice of the Commissioner. 126 Officials consider that the wording that permits a modification or an exemption where it is reasonably necessary to “give effect to the intended purpose or object of a provision of the Inland Revenue Acts” would, when combined with the ability for a modification to state “an alternative means of complying with the provision” (as permitted by proposed section 6D(2)(d)(i)), be able to deal with the compliance cost matters raised by the submitters. An exemption could also provide an alternative means of complying through the use of terms and conditions, which are permitted under proposed section 6E(3)(c)(i). For example, an exemption could be conditional on taxpayers treating the provision subject to the exemption in another way. Officials will consider whether this result needs to be made more certain by adopting the amendment proposed by submitters for the revision-tracked version of the Bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Definition of “obvious error” Submission (Russell McVeagh) Proposed section 6G(c) should be omitted, as it is unnecessary in view of section 6G(a). If the intended purpose or object is clear (proposed section 6G(a)), and that intended purpose or object cannot be carried into effect (proposed section 6G(b)), then that in itself is evidence that there is an obvious error: the intended purpose or object is clear and yet cannot be given effect under the provisions in question. An Order in Council or exemption made under proposed section 6D or 6E must comply with the limitations and protections in those provisions, and will not necessarily involve second-guessing and seeking to replicate the form of the provision that Parliament would have made had the error been known to Parliament. Comment The definition of “obvious error” in proposed section 6G reflects the test used by the courts in Inco Europe Ltd v First Choice Distribution Ltd \[2000\] 2 All ER 109 (HL). The proposed powers provide the Minister of Revenue or the Commissioner with the ability to resolve an “obvious error” as defined in proposed section 6G. This requires the Minister of Revenue or the Commissioner to be satisfied that there is an error that arises only in the circumstances where: • the intended purpose or object of the relevant provision is clear (proposed paragraph (a)); • the intended purpose or object cannot be carried into effect by the relevant provision (proposed paragraph(b)); and • the substance of the provision that Parliament would have made, had the error become known, or had the circumstances been allowed for, is clear (proposed paragraph (c)). 127 As the proposal already allows the Governor General on the recommendation of the Minster of Revenue to make a modification or the Commissioner make an exemption to “give effect to the intended purpose or object of a provision” in situations where there is an obvious error, removing proposed paragraph (c) would remove the need for a separate definition of “obvious error”. Proposed paragraph (c) would allow for errors within the Inland Revenue Acts to be corrected by way of a modification or an exemption where it was clear that the law as drafted would have been different, had Parliament known of the circumstances in question and taken them into account when drafting the law. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Repetition in proposed section 6D(1) Submission (Russell McVeagh) Proposed section 6D(1) should be simplified. Proposed section 6D(1)(b) (“granting an exemption from a provision of the Inland Revenue Acts”) is unnecessary given proposed section 6D(1)(a) allows the exercise of the power “providing that a provision of the Inland Revenue Acts does not apply”. Accordingly, proposed section 6D(1)(b) should be removed. Comment Officials agree that “granting an exemption from a provision of the Inland Revenue Acts” and “providing that a provision of the Inland Revenue Acts does not apply” are doing the same thing. Proposed section 6D(1) should be amended to remove the unnecessary duplication. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Opt-in and opt-out process Submission (New Zealand Law Society) As modifications and exemptions can be opt-in or opt-out, it is not clear how taxpayers will be able to choose to apply a modification or an exemption in the circumstances. It would be onerous if taxpayers were required to write a separate letter at the time of filing their returns. This might impose the modification or exemption on the taxpayer. We presume a taxpayer could make this choice by filing their tax return taking a tax position incorporating or giving effect to that modification or exemption. 128 Comment Proposed sections 6D(4) for modifications and 6E(5) for exemptions provide that a modification or an exemption will either be opt-in or opt-out. The proposed legislation (in sections 6D(2)(b) and 6E(3)(b)) provides that the means for taxpayers to opt to apply (or opt not to apply) a modification or an exemption will be specified in the modification or the exemption itself. Where a modification or an exemption is opt-in, taxpayers will be required to do something in order to give effect to the modification or the exemption before it applies. Where a modification or an exemption is opt-out, taxpayers will be required to do something in order to not apply it. Further, in cases where the modification or exemption is opt-out, taxpayers must be provided with a reasonable opportunity to not apply the modification or exemption before it would take effect. Whether a modification or exemption will be opt-in or opt-out will depend on the circumstances. Officials expect that a modification or exemption would be opt-out in situations where a significant number of taxpayers are affected, and the modification or exemption provides taxpayers with a more workable outcome than the status quo. In other situations, it may be more appropriate for the modification or the exemption to be opt-in, such as where taxpayers could use a valuation option given by the Commissioner when filing their tax return and taking a tax position. The method for opting in and opting out, as well as whether a modification or an exemption applies on an opt-in or opt-out basis, would both be subject to public consultation. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Available period of retrospective application for exemptions Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter considers it important that modifications and exemptions can apply to years that are not subject to the time bar, otherwise taxpayers will face further uncertainty over whether prior years will be subject to a different tax treatment. The submitter notes it is not clear why a modification can have retrospective application of up to four years before it comes into force, but the extent of retrospective application for exemptions is limited to the beginning of the tax year in which the exemption is made. The submitter considers the extent of retrospective application should be four years for both modifications and exemptions. 129 Comment Under the proposed draft legislation, the provision that empowers the regulations by Order in Council will allow for retrospective application of up to four income years before the year in which the Order in Council comes into force. The extent of retrospective application available for exemptions made by the Commissioner is intended to be more limited, and is only available as far back as the beginning of the income year in which the exemption is made. Both modifications and exemptions would expire automatically at the end of the third income year corresponding to the tax year in which the modification or the exemption is made. The Commissioner’s exemption-making power is intended largely for administrative matters, where there are no, or negligible, fiscal implications. It is not clear what benefit retrospective application would have in these circumstances. In addition, officials note that if a greater degree of retrospective application is required, rather than resolve the issue using an exemption, a modification, which is intended to be used for issues that are more sensitive or that have fiscal implications, could be used (provided it is not more appropriate to wait for an amendment to primary legislation). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarifying the extent of retrospective application for modifications Submission (Matter raised by officials) Proposed section 6D(3)(b) provides that a modification can apply for up to four income years before the income year corresponding to the tax year in which the modification comes into force. A minor amendment is necessary to clarify that the period of retrospective application aligns with the time bar for amending assessments. Comment The time bar in section 108 prevents the Commissioner from increasing the amount of tax assessed (or decreasing the amount of a net loss) if more than four tax years have passed since the end of the tax year in which the taxpayer makes their assessment. The Commissioner is also unable to issue a refund in respect of an amended assessment unless the Commissioner receives notice or is satisfied that the person is entitled to the refund within the time bar period. The current proposed wording of section 6D(3)(b) which specifies the period of retrospective application available for a modification would not allow taxpayers to apply a modification in respect of all tax returns that are not subject to the time bar period. For example, if a modification was made during the 2021 tax year which applied to that year and four previous income years, taxpayers would be able to apply it to their income tax returns for the 2016–17 and later years. However, because the time bar applies four years after the end of the tax year in which the income tax return was filed, the time bar could apply to income tax returns filed for the 2015–16 income year. This is because income tax returns for the 2015–16 income year would generally be filed during the 2016–17 tax year. 130 The intent is that taxpayers be able to apply a modification to all tax returns that are not subject to the time bar. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Applying modifications to returns that have already been filed Submission (EY, New Zealand Law Society) Two submitters queried how taxpayers could apply modifications that had retrospective effect to tax returns that had already been filed. Both submitters noted that taxpayers would have to apply to the Commissioner for an amendment to their assessment under section 113. Submitters considered there should be a simple and straightforward method for taxpayers to use to apply modifications to previous tax returns. Both submitters also noted that the Commissioner’s power to amend assessments under section 113 is discretionary and submitted that the Commissioner should be required to amend an assessment in tax returns already filed to give effect to a modification. Comment Section 113 enables the Commissioner to amend an assessment to ensure its correctness. The Commissioner has published guidance on her approach to applications from taxpayers who request amendments to their assessments under section 113 in Standard Practice Statement 16/01 – Requests to amend assessments. The Commissioner’s practice, as outlined in the statement, is that she will use section 113 to amend an assessment to correct a tax position which is clearly incorrect. The criteria applied in determining whether to exercise section 113 are based on the existing care and management principles in sections 6 and 6A, which require the Commissioner to use her best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system, while acknowledging the Commissioner has limited resources and must be able to make resourcing decisions. Submitters suggested the Commissioner should be required to amend an assessment to give effect to a modification in situations where tax returns have already been filed. Officials consider that this approach could be inconsistent with the Commissioner’s care and management duty and therefore consider a better approach would be to outline how taxpayers can apply a modification to past assessments within the modification itself. This would ensure the issue was a matter for public consultation. The method for applying a modification to past returns would be part of the transitional matters relating to the modification which are permitted under proposed section 6D(2)(c)(iii) and section 6E(3)(iii). Recommendation That the submission be declined. 131 Issue: Effect of retrospective application on returns already filed Submission (Russell McVeagh) The submitter recommends an amendment be made to proposed sections 6D(4) and 6E(5) to make it clear that where a modification has retrospective application, and operates on an opt- out (instead of opt-in) basis that taxpayers should not need to do anything to preserve the tax position(s) taken in prior returns. In these circumstances taxpayers should be able to rely on the law without the effect of the modification. Comment Officials consider the submitter’s concerns can be addressed through the use of savings provisions, which modifications and exemptions can both provide under proposed sections 6D(2)(c)(iii) and 6E(3)(c)(iii) respectively. For example, if a modification came into force and had retrospective application covering a period where tax returns had already been filed, and the positions taken in those returns were correct under the law (without the effect of the modification), those positions could be preserved. Officials also note that in the case of an exemption, the extent of retrospective application is limited to the beginning of the income year that corresponds to the tax year in which it comes into force. This means that there will only be limited situations where exemption will affect an income tax return which has already been filed. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Ability to dispense with or shorten the period of public consultation in cases of urgency Submission (EY, New Zealand Law Society) We recognise that there may be unforeseen circumstances justifying urgency and accept that a case of urgency could exist in some exceptional circumstances. We consider that the meaning of a “case of urgency” is clarified, either through a statutory definition, published guidance from the Commissioner, or both. (EY) The consultation requirement is a crucial taxpayer protection that also reduces the rule of law concerns. Consultation should only be reduced or dispensed with in very narrow, prescribed situations, being “exceptional circumstances”. The “exceptional circumstances” test is applied elsewhere in the Act and has been interpreted by the courts, so will provide guidance to the Minister of Revenue and the Commissioner over when consultation is not required to take place. The submitter also considers that the urgency carve-out should apply to the Minister of Revenue only, and not the Commissioner, so that there will at least be internal consultation between the Minister of Revenue and the Commissioner for exemptions. In addition, if the consultation 132 period is shortened or dispensed with the reasons for this should be published. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment Proposed section 6F(3) allows the Minister of Revenue or the Commissioner to shorten, or dispense with, the period of public consultation required. Officials expect in most cases before a modification or an exemption is made it will be subject to a period of six weeks of public consultation. Further, proposed section 6F(1) requires that the Minister of Revenue or the Commissioner undertake a consultative process that includes providing the proposed modification or exemption (alongside an explanation of how the modification or exemption meets the relevant criteria) to persons and representatives that it is reasonable to consult with. This would include the likes of Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand and the New Zealand Law Society. Proposed section 6F(3) would only be used to shorten or reduce the period of public consultation where there were exceptional circumstances, such as a natural disaster or the issue having major systems implications in administering the tax system, and where the issue the modification or the exemption was seeking to resolve was clear and not contentious. Officials therefore agree that the period of public consultation should only be reduced or dispensed with in such “exceptional circumstances”, as this is consistent with the intended purpose of the provision. Officials note the definition of “exceptional circumstances” in the Tax Administration Act 1994 currently applies in the context of several provisions that relate to the formal disputes process. It applies when a taxpayer (or the Commissioner) is unable to meet statutory timeframes within the disputes process because of events or circumstances that are beyond their control. As noted above, officials consider the period of consultation would be expected to be shortened or dispensed with in limited situations such as a natural disaster or a major issue with an Inland Revenue computer system. As such, the current definition of “exceptional circumstances”, which generally considers a taxpayer’s particular circumstances, cannot easily be used as a reference point for proposed section 6F(3). Officials also do not agree that the ability to shorten or dispense with the consultation requirement should be limited to the Minister of Revenue in the case of modifications only as this could (in exceptional cases) remove the ability to pragmatically address administrative issues that could have major systems implications for Inland Revenue but very limited impact on taxpayers. Officials expect that if the period of public consultation is shortened or dispensed with the reasons would generally be publicised. Officials do not consider it necessary to amend the legislation to require this. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, in part, subject to officials’ comments. 133 Issue: Determining the “intended purpose or object of the provision” and establishing a remedial panel Submission (EY, New Zealand Law Society) Two submitters suggested the Minister of Revenue or the Commissioner may want to consider the establishment of a panel, similar to the Rewrite Advisory Panel which operated from 1995 to 2014, for the purposes of consultation before a modification or an exemption is made. The panel could both recommend a modification or exemption to the Minister of Revenue or the Commissioner and ensure that wider consultation occurred within the tax profession if necessary. It may be that a body of tax specialists would be better placed to provide advance comment as to whether the requirements listed in proposed sections 6D(5) and 6E(2) are met. The panel’s recommendations could be published alongside the Minister of Revenue or the Commissioner’s modification. (EY) The Law Society consider that because a modification or exemption is based on “the intended purpose or object of the provision”, the Minister of Revenue or the Commissioner should at least consult with an advisory committee or panel over what this means. This limited form of consultation should be mandatory when the normal consultation process is to be shortened or dispensed with. The Law Society sees an advisory committee or panel to be helpful to the Commissioner in terms of providing a measure of objectivity to the process, and in terms of taxpayer perceptions of the integrity of the tax system. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment Officials consider the consultation requirement in proposed section 6F will ensure there is opportunity for engagement between tax practitioners and Inland Revenue on proposed modifications and exemptions. Proposed section 6F requires the Minister or the Commissioner to undertake a consultative process “that includes the distribution, to persons or representatives or persons that it is considered reasonable to consult with” which would include Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand and the New Zealand Law Society. Officials also note that, if needed, a panel could be established without enabling legislation. However, officials consider the current consultation requirements to be sufficient for ensuring that it is only objectively determined issues with the Inland Revenue Acts that are the subject of a modification or an exemption. Establishing a panel and imposing requirements on the Minister of Revenue and the Commissioner to consult with that panel before a modification or an exemption is made will add an additional process and potentially prolong the period of uncertainty for taxpayers. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 134 Issue: Audits and disputes Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The submitter considers it would be inappropriate to continue to audit or dispute a matter that has been raised as an issue to be considered for a modification or an exemption until a decision has been made about whether a modification or exemption should apply to resolve the issue. The submitter also considers that if a modification or exemption is made, and it addresses an issue under dispute, taxpayers should be provided with additional time to make a choice whether to apply it. It is also submitted that any audit or dispute over an issue should only recommence once a modification or exemption becomes law, and that taxpayers who are part way through a dispute with Inland Revenue should be able to apply a modification or exemption if that resolves the issue at dispute and the Commissioner should be bound by the taxpayer’s decision. Comment Officials note that in respect of audits, the existing powers in sections 6 and 6A enable the Commissioner to make decisions not to allocate resources to areas (including the continuation of a dispute) where a modification or an exemption is being contemplated. Officials have considered whether it would be appropriate to introduce a “stop the clock” rule for the disputes process of Part 4A of the Tax Administration Act 1994, and do not recommend making changes to these rules as suggested by the submitter. If a “stop the clock” rule was introduced, it could encourage taxpayers to raise, as an issue to be considered for a modification or an exemption, a matter that is better resolved through the statutory disputes process. Officials note, in any case, that if a modification is made that has retrospective effect, taxpayers can ask the Commissioner to amend their assessment to give effect to the modification. Specifically, if a modification or an exemption is issued part-way through a dispute, if the taxpayer chooses to apply it, the Commissioner would in practice withdraw her proposed adjustments and apply the modification in relation to the taxpayer. The proposed legislation deals with this by allowing taxpayers to apply modifications and exemptions optionally. If taxpayers do not wish to apply a modification or exemption, in accordance with proposed section 6C(5), the law applies in relation to the person as if the modification or the exemption did not exist. The Commissioner would be required to apply the law with the effect of the modification or the exemption in relation to the taxpayer in these circumstances. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 135 Issue: Renewing of modifications and exemptions and requirement to review a modification or exemption during the period it is in force Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The submitter considers it should be clearer that the Commissioner is not able to reissue an exemption after it expires. The submitter notes that the issue could presumably be included within the tax policy work programme within the two-year period when it is in force. An extra subsection could be added to proposed section 6C, which outlines the purpose of the remedial powers, to state that the purpose is to provide relief pending legislative amendment. The proposed legislation does not stipulate that the Commissioner must attempt to address issues with tax legislation that are being resolved through a modification or an exemption in a tax amendment bill put before Parliament at any time during the period that the modification or exemption applies. The requirement that the Commissioner review the modification or exemption during the period it is in force (which was included in the draft legislation for this proposal in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill) should also be re-introduced. Comment The proposed legislation requires that a modification or an exemption cannot be in force for a prospective period longer than three complete income years – the income year corresponding to the tax year in which it comes into force and the next two income years. This is made clear by proposed sections 6D(3) and 6E(4). It is not intended to enable a modification or exemption to be reissued after it expires. For a modification or exemption to have ongoing effect after it has expired, an amendment must be made to primary legislation. Officials agree that it should be made explicit in the legislation that a modification or exemption cannot be reissued after it has expired. The draft legislation in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters Bill required the Commissioner to review a modification before the end of the three years during which it was in force to “determine if the modification should be included in an amendment to the relevant provisions”. This requirement is not replicated in the new draft legislation. As noted, for a modification or exemption to have ongoing effect after it has expired, an amendment must be made to primary legislation. Therefore, officials do not consider it necessary to include the same wording in the new draft legislation. Further, in some circumstances it may not be necessary to make amendments to primary legislation, such as where the legislation subject to the modification or exemption is only in place for a limited period of time. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 136 Issue: Sunset clause and requirement for review Submission (New Zealand Law Society – oral submission) The proposed powers should come with a sunset clause and/or subject to a review after five years. Comment A sunset clause would repeal the proposed powers after a defined period of time. For the powers to continue to be used, new legislation would need to be passed which either prevented the repeal of the powers, or reinstated them. Officials consider the built-in safeguards on the proposed powers, including the fact that modifications and exemptions will be reviewed by both the Regulations Review Committee, and Inland Revenue within three years (as would be required for circumstances where it was necessary for a modification or exemption to have ongoing effect) are sufficient protections against the power being used inappropriately. Officials also note that legislative changes are, as a matter of course, reviewed over time as part of the Generic Tax Policy Process and this will also be the case for this proposal if any significant issues arise. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 137 Other policy matters 138 139 ANNUAL RATES OF INCOME TAX Clause 3 Submission (Gina Gao, Kate Kate, Ray Craig, Wendy Feng, Zarir Chhor) The Government should commission a working group to see where Government savings can be made and then reduce corporate rates and personal thresholds and rates. (Kate Kate) No more tax. (Gina Gao) Do some real work to help the country and stop take from hard workers. (Wendy Feng) Flat tax of 25% on all incomes. (Zarir Chhor) The annual rates of income tax should not be rolled over without some adjustment. The first, say, $19,000 of income per annum per person should be untaxed and taxation rates for income over that amount should be readjusted to maintain total annual revenue currently received for income tax. (Ray Craig) Comment The Income Tax Act 2007 requires the rates of income tax to be set each tax year by an annual taxing Act. The Bill proposes to set the annual rates of income tax for the 2019–20 tax year at the same rates as the preceding year. Officials note that submitters have suggested lower tax rates, a flat tax or a tax-free threshold. Officials also note that the Tax Working Groups’ final report included some recommendations on personal income tax which the Government is currently considering. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 140 SOCIAL POLICY CHANGES Issue: Support to reinstate the tiebreaker provision Clauses 84 and 85 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter supports the proposal to reinstate the tiebreaker provision. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Day count test amended Clauses 84 and 85 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Clause 84 amends section 22 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. This section outlines the tests for a borrower becoming New Zealand-based, and thereby receiving an interest free loan and having income-based repayment obligations. Officials propose that section 22(1)(b) read “the borrower is treated as being physically in New Zealand for a period of 183 consecutive days because”. This would improve the clarity of the legislation by specifying that the test for becoming New Zealand-based under section 22(1)(b) is a 183-day test. Similarly, clause 85 amends section 23 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. This section includes tests for a borrower becoming overseas-based. Officials propose that section 23(1)(c) read “a New Zealand-based borrower who is treated as physically absent from New Zealand for a period of 184 consecutive days because”. This would also improve the clarity of the legislation by specifying that the test for becoming overseas- based is a 184-day test. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 141 Issue: Definition of income for student loans and Working for Families Clauses 57 and 93 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter supports the proposal to improve the alignment of the definitions of income for student loans and Working for Families purposes. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 142 SECURITISED PRE-1990 FOREST LAND EMISSION UNITS Clauses 44, 45, 47 48, 52 and 53 Issue: Support for the proposed amendments Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, CNI Iwi Land Management Ltd, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Matariki Forests) The submitters support the amendments changing the tax treatment of transactions involving the lease and buy-back of pre-1990 forest land emission units. Comment The Bill contains amendments to change the tax treatment of securitised transactions involving pre-1990 forest land emissions units. A securitisation transaction typically involves the sale and compulsory buy-back of pre-1990 forest land emission units. Under current tax law, securitisation transactions would be treated as a sale and purchase. The amendments in this Bill treat the transaction as a loan for income tax purposes and reflect the underlying economic reality of the transaction. A unique tax feature of pre-1990 forest land emission units is that a one-off tax-free status applies to transactions by the first (and only) owner of the unit. Subsequent transactions are taxable. The tax-free status exists as a transitional measure as part of the introduction of New Zealand’s emissions trading scheme. The amendment responds to concerns that the current tax law did not reflect the economic substance of the transaction and created an impediment for holders of pre-1990 forest land emission units that wanted to realise the value of those units but not lose the tax-free status of those units. The amendments therefore provide that the sale of the emissions units and the return of the equivalent units would be ignored for both parties. Instead, for tax purposes there would be a loan between the two parties. The interest flows earned/paid by both parties on the borrowed/lent funds would be taxable/deductible. If the acquirer of the units may wish to on-sell them, any gain or loss on selling the units to a third party would be taxable or deductible according to the ordinary rules that apply to the sales of forest land emissions units. Importantly, ignoring the sale transaction in this instance means that pre-1990 emissions units retain their one-off tax-free status if and when they are disposed of. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 143 Issue: Scope of the proposed amendments should be extended to include post- 1989 forest land emission units Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Matariki Forests) The submitters assert that the proposed amendments changing the tax treatment of transactions involving the lease and buy-back of pre-1990 forest land emission units should, on the ground of fairness, equally apply to post-1989 New Zealand emission units. Comment The proposed amendments are directed at the treatment of pre-1990 forest land emission units given their unique tax transitional treatment. Post-1989 New Zealand emission units are treated as revenue account property and transactions involving the sale and compulsory buy-back are taxable in the year of sale and deductible in the year of repurchase, as noted in Matariki Forests’ submission at 2.3. As such, the tax disincentives for these transactions is not as marked, unlike the loss of tax-free status for pre- 1990 forest land emission units under similar transactions. Officials agree that there is a technical fairness issue, as acknowledged in Inland Revenue’s impact statement at page 7. For post-1989 forest land emissions units, because the sale and repurchase legs of the transaction are recognised separately, the associated income and deduction can arise in different years, which may have some cashflow impact. This will not be an issue for a securitised transaction involving a pre-1990 forest land emissions unit because the proposed legislation focuses only on the net cash flows from the transaction. There is a case for consistent treatment of pre-1990 and post-1989 emission units. However, there are several factors against using this Bill to create this consistency: • The tax treatment of post-1989 emission units outlined in the submission from Matariki Forests is consistent with the tax treatment of revenue account property generally. This is not the case for pre-1990 forest emission units because of their unique tax treatment. • There is a need for fuller engagement with holders of post-1989 emission units to ensure no unintended consequences, including overall consistency with the objectives of the review of the emission trading scheme that is currently underway. • The issue that tax law should reflect the economic substance of sale and compulsory buy- back transactions is relevant for a wide range of assets and is better explored using the generic tax policy process, subject to resourcing and other commitments on the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 144 Issue: Drafting matters Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia New Zealand)) The submitter makes two editorial comments regarding the drafting of clauses 44 and 47. Comment Officials have reviewed the drafting of these clauses and confirm they accord with standard drafting convention and are correct. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 145 KEEPING TAX RECORDS IN TE REO MĀORI Clauses 38(1), (3) to (5) and 68 to 71 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter supports the change but cautions that non-te reo Māori speaking taxpayers could be disadvantaged or required to incur additional compliance costs if they receive a tax record in te reo Māori. Comment The proposed amendments allow taxpayers to hold tax records in te reo Māori as a matter of right, but subject to the requirement that documents to third-party taxpayers should be in English as required by the GST Act and Tax Administration Act. The proposed amendments recognise in the Inland Revenue Acts that te reo Māori is an official language of New Zealand and codifies Inland Revenue’s current operational practice, which has been in effect for over 20 years, to allow taxpayers to hold their tax records in te reo Māori. Inland Revenue is already resourced to work with tax records held in te reo Māori. In response to the concern raised by the submitter, officials note that clause 38(5) in the Bill requires taxpayers that are registered for GST to use the English phrases required by the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 – for example, “tax invoice”, “buyer created tax invoice – IRD approved”, “modified tax invoice – IRD approved”, “copy only”, and “debit/credit” note. Officials note that the current disclosure requirements in the Goods and Services Tax Act do not prevent additional information being provided on tax invoices that could be in another language, nor otherwise prohibit the use of bi-lingual documents. The Bill also does not change the current requirement in the Tax Administration Act 1994 (section 32) that donee organisations produce donation receipts in English (unless otherwise permitted to do so in another language). The reasons for retaining the English disclosure requirements in the Goods and Services Tax Act and the Tax Administration Act is that taxpayers rely on the documents required by those Acts to support tax positions, such as entitlements to GST input tax deductions and tax benefits for monetary gifts to donee organisations, such as charities. These documents need to be accessible and understood by a wide section of the community. Anecdotal comments received by officials from tax practitioners suggest that the majority of Māori sector clients (including taxpaying Māori authorities and tax-exempt registered charities) keep their records in English. Organisations that are most likely to keep their records in te reo Māori are te kohanga reo, marae, kura kaupapa, and Māori social-service groups. Records that are typically kept in te reo Māori by these organisations consist of constitutional documents, cash books, cheque books, wage books and records, minutes of meetings and receipt books. Financial statements and accounting records prepared for third-parties (such as invoices and receipts) are typically prepared in English. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 146 PAYE AND EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEMES Clause 61 Issue: General support Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, PwC) That the proposed amendment is supported as it overcomes accounting consequences and will help minimise compliance and administration costs. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) That the proposed amendment is supported as it gives employers the flexibility to address undesirable financial reporting consequences. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, PwC) Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Form of legislation Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, PwC) The form of the legislation be agreed with a professional accountancy body to ensure that the legislation is sufficient to provide the desired outcome. Comment Officials agree with the suggestion to obtain consensus with a professional accounting body on ensuring the wording meets the policy objective. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Ability for amendments to apply to current schemes Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Proposed section RD 7B does not seem to apply to benefits that have already been offered under existing employee share schemes (“ESS”), only to benefits offered or provided going forward. 147 The amendment states that an employer has irrevocably chosen to withhold and pay tax for a benefit for an employee if, at the time the benefit is offered or provided, it is a term of the offer of the benefit, or of the scheme under which the benefit is provided, the employer must withhold and pay tax under this section. Current schemes that have already offered benefits to their employees cannot fulfil this requirement, since they have already offered the benefit at some time in the past, and did not make the irrevocable election to withhold at that time. Therefore, they appear unable to get the benefit of this amendment. Corporate Taxpayers Group submits that the proposed amendment should be extended to cover benefits offered under existing ESS. Comment Officials agree that the proposed amendment should be extended to cover benefits that have already been offered under existing ESS, provided that making provision for this possibility does not prevent the proposed amendment from achieving the desired accounting outcome. Providing this additional flexibility will allow more employers to pay PAYE on behalf of employees, which was the policy intent of introducing the provision originally. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Use of term “benefit” Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The submitter queries whether the use of the term “benefit” in the proposed section RD 7B is appropriate, as the term is not defined and at the time of offer/grant, no actual “benefit” exists to an employee. Comment Officials acknowledge that no crystallised benefit exists to an employee at the time of the offer. However, officials do not consider it problematic that the word “benefit” refers to a contingent benefit, especially as the proposed provisions refer to the offer of a benefit, which inherently includes situations where the benefit has not yet crystallised and is still contingent. Accordingly, officials do not think it necessary to replace the widely-understood term “benefit” or further define it. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 148 Issue: Possibility for employers to cancel irrevocable election to withhold Submission (PwC) Under the currently proposed wording of amended section RD 7B, employers could still, after making an offer to employees which includes withholding as a term of the offer, simply cancel the offer and make a fresh offer which includes no such term. If this is the case, it could be argued that in substance, the employer still has “choice” in relation to its obligation to withhold. And if the employer has this choice, then any election to withhold is not truly irrevocable, and equity settled accounting treatment is therefore not available to the employer (for the tax/cash component of the benefit granted). The submitter suggests the following wording to resolve this issue: Irrevocable obligation (2) An employer who has made an irrevocable election described in subsections (1)(a) and (3) must comply with subsection (4)(a) to (c) for both the relevant benefit and employee under the scheme, and for any benefit offered or provided to that employee in replacement of the relevant benefit where such relevant benefit offered or provided to that employee has been withdrawn or otherwise varied with the purpose or effect of avoiding the operation of this section. Comment Officials can see the argument that if it is possible for an employer to cancel a scheme that has withholding as a term of the offer, and replace it with a scheme that has no such term, then indeed an irrevocable election to withhold is not truly irrevocable, and therefore equity settled accounting treatment will not be available. If this is the case, then there is a risk that the proposed amendment will not achieve the intended policy outcome. Officials agree that to prevent this, the irrevocable obligation to withhold should also apply to replacement schemes. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 149 BENEFICIARIES AS SETTLORS Clause 56 Issue: Support for the proposal Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter supports the proposal. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Importance of correctly identifying settlors Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The submitter stated that correctly identifying the settlors of a trust underpins a number of income tax and tax administration provisions, including: • determining whether the trustees are liable to New Zealand income tax on their worldwide income; • the income tax treatment of distributions made by the trustees; • who is liable to meet the trustees’ income tax liabilities; • whether the trustees are required to register the trust as a New Zealand foreign trust; • calculating “family scheme income” for the Working for Families entitlements; and • “adjusted net income” for student loan purposes. In some instances, correctly identifying the settlors of a trust in a particular income year is critical (for example, in calculating Working for Families entitlements), but in other instances it is critical to identify who have been the settlors of a trust since the trust was first settled (for example, in determining whether the trust is a foreign trust). For the above reasons, the submitter considers that it is essential that the definition of settlor is clear and unequivocal. Comment Officials agree with the submitter. Officials consider that the amendment results in a clear definition of “settlor”. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 150 Issue: Previous position of Inland Revenue Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The submitter said that in draft public ruling PUB0209\[a\], which was issued in December 2014, Inland Revenue concluded that a beneficiary of a trust would not be treated as a settlor of the trust just because they had a credit balance in their beneficiary current account and no interest was paid on that credit balance (or interest was paid at a rate less than the market rate). The commentary to the draft ruling includes comprehensive analysis that explains why a beneficiary would not be treated as a settlor in this situation. In essence, this is because the beneficiary does not cause a settlement to be made, as it is the trustee, not the beneficiary, who decides to make the distribution and whether the distribution is actually paid out or credited to account. Further, the beneficiary does not have legal ownership of the money, and so cannot provide money to the trust or provide financial assistance. PUB0209\[a\] was never finalised, but was widely recognised as reflecting Inland Revenue’s considered view on this issue. The submitter said that Commentary to the Bill on this issue states a view contrary to that expressed in PUB0209\[a\], and is also arguably contrary to the analysis set out in IS 18/01, Taxation of Trusts – Income Tax (28 June 2018). Comment As a draft, PUB0209\[a\] does not represent the Commissioner’s final view on the matter, and is therefore not binding on Inland Revenue. As a result of submissions received on the draft the Commissioner further considered the issue and came to a different conclusion, which has resulted, and is reflected, in the proposal. Officials disagree that the proposal is arguably contrary to the analysis set out in IS 18/01 – on the contrary, the analysis in IS 18/01 is consistent with the proposal. The analysis in IS 18/01 refers to the definition of “settlor” being purposefully wide, and discusses that those who transfer value to the trust are settlors. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Savings provision Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, New Zealand Law Society) One submitter suggested that the amendment should include a savings provision, so that taxpayers who have adopted a different tax position are protected. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) 151 The submitter noted that the amendment would not reflect the long-standing approach held by many practitioners. The submitter remarked that the policy intent is contrary to that approach. The submitter argued that this policy intent was not made clear when the trust rules were amended in the 1980s, and the accompanying comprehensive Tax Information Bulletin makes no mention of this. The submitter continued that such a clearly intended effect should have been identified. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Another submitter noted that because of the importance of correctly identifying the settlors of a trust, it is essential that any uncertainties or overreach in that definition are resolved with retrospective effect. (New Zealand Law Society) The submitter stated that it is clear who becomes a settlor following the amendment, but only from the date the Bill is enacted. The submitter said that it is still not clear whether a beneficiary with a credit current account balance would be treated as a settlor of the trust prior to the date of enactment. The submitter said that an alternative to making the proposed amendment retrospective is to allow a beneficiary to choose whether or not they are treated as a settlor of the trust where the trustee of the trust owes an amount to them before the date the Bill is enacted. However, taxpayers who have taken a tax position which turns on whether such a beneficiary is a settlor of the trust prior to the date the Bill is enacted are prevented from changing that tax position. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment Officials agree with the submissions and recommend changing the application date from the date of the enactment, as currently proposed, to 1 April 2020 to enable trustees of trusts with beneficiaries with current account credits to evaluate and address their position. The Commissioner will consider how to respond operationally in respect of tax positions taken for periods before 1 April 2020. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to the officials’ comment. Issue: Wrong result for foreign trusts Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The submitter stated that the uncertainty as to whether a beneficiary with a credit current account balance would be treated as a settlor of the trust prior to the date of enactment could lead to absurd and unintended results. For example, a beneficiary of a foreign trust who migrates to New Zealand and receives a small distribution from the trust which has been credited to their current account, will be treated as a settlor of the trust. This will cause the trust to cease being a foreign trust and make it liable for income tax on its worldwide income (for each income year that the beneficiary remains New Zealand tax resident). The beneficiary may be liable, as agent of the trustees, to meet the trustees’ New Zealand income tax liability. The submitter does not consider this to be an intended policy outcome. 152 Comment Officials consider that all beneficiaries with any current account balances retained with the trust are settlors where no market interest has been paid, because there is a transfer of value from the beneficiary to the trust. It is also consistent with the policy intent that beneficiaries with relatively modest current account balances are not treated as settlors. This equally applies to beneficiaries of foreign trusts. In the absence of the proposed amendment, all beneficiaries of foreign trusts who have migrated to New Zealand, with any amounts retained in their current accounts, would have caused the trust to lose its foreign trust status. The amendment however clarifies that beneficiaries with account balances under $25,000, or with balances over $25,000 in relation to which a current rate of interest has been paid to the beneficiaries, are not settlors. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: The $25,000 threshold is arbitrary Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The submitter stated that limiting the threshold change to beneficiaries who are owed no more than $25,000 at the end of the income year is arbitrary and could be ineffective. The trustees could manipulate beneficiary current account balances at the end of each income year to fall below the $25,000 threshold. The submitter noted that there is no clear rationale for why a beneficiary that is owed less than $25,000 at the end of an income year would not be treated as a settlor, whereas a beneficiary with $25,000 or more would be (unless the interest is charged on the balance at a rate not less than the prescribed rate of interest). The submitter noted that the analysis set out in PUB0209\[a\] applies irrespective of the beneficiary’s current account balance. The submitter recommended that the proposal is amended so that a beneficiary does not become a settlor of a trust solely because a trustee of the trust owes an amount to the beneficiary, irrespective of the amount. Comment Officials consider that beneficiaries transfer value to the trust by leaving any money in their current accounts with the trust, at no or below a market rate of interest. It is consistent with the policy intent that beneficiaries with relatively modest current account balances are not treated as settlors; the Bill sets a $25,000 threshold for this purpose. It is also consistent with the policy intent that those who leave significant amounts (above $25,000) in their current accounts with the trust at no or below market rate of interest should be settlors. 153 It is quite common in tax legislation to exclude a nominated amount from the application of a particular rule, for example, to ease compliance. Other examples in the Income Tax Act include section CQ 5(1)(d) (When FIF income arises, with a $50,000 cost de minimis), section HC 35 (Beneficiary income of minors, with a $1,000 de minimis), and section MB 13 (Family scheme income from other payments, with a $5,000 threshold). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The proposed amendment affects Working for Families entitlements Submission (McIntyre Dick) The submitter stated that the proposal dilutes the family scheme income of existing (formal) settlors, and increases family scheme income for beneficiaries that are also settlors. The latter are sometimes unaware of the distribution that makes them settlors, and may not report the additional income to Inland Revenue. The submitter has also stated that once a settlor has been deemed a settlor for tax purposes, they are always a settlor. The proposed amendment may cause beneficiaries who received an allocation of income in one year only, to be the settlor for the rest of the trust’s existence even though they may never receive income from the trust again. The submitter considered it to be an unfair overreach of the Working for Families rules. The submitter proposed to amend the drafting, by also excluding beneficiaries who are not trustees or persons with the power of appointment or removal of trustees, from the scope of the definition of “settlor”. Comment Officials consider that all beneficiaries with any current account balances retained with the trust are settlors where no market interest has been paid, because there is a transfer of value from the beneficiary to the trust. It is consistent with the policy intent that beneficiaries with relatively modest current account balances should be treated as settlors (whereas beneficiaries with significant balances should be treated as settlors). The proposal therefore introduces a “safe harbour” for beneficiaries with modest balances (below $25,000). In accordance with section MB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, beneficiary income received by the person is included in their family scheme income. From 2011, section MB 7 (Family scheme income of settlor of trust) of the Income Tax Act 2007 also included the net income of a trust (less beneficiary income) in a person’s family scheme income if they are a settlor of the trust. For this purpose, the trust’s income was equally divided by the number of settlors, to be then added for the purposes of each settlor’s Working for Families tax credits entitlements (if any). This was done so that the amount of undistributed trustee income is included in family scheme income because it is available to meet a family’s living expenses. The effect of the 2011 amendment to section MB 7 of the Income Tax Act was that the family would receive their correct Working for Families tax credits entitlement. 154 A beneficiary will not be a settlor, if the trustees distribute to the beneficiary any funds above $25,000 on which market rate of interest has not been paid before the end of the trust’s income year. Officials agree that once a settlor has been deemed a settlor for tax purposes, they always remain a settlor. This is an existing position however and is not affected by the proposal. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 155 CO-OPERATIVE COMPANIES: NON-DEDUCTIBLE CASH DISTRIBUTIONS Clauses 51 and 58 to 60 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte) Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand and Deloitte support the proposed amendment. Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand notes that the proposed amendment will have the intended effect if tax on pool profits is always borne by members of the pool. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 156 TAXATION OF LIFE INSURANCE: REMEDIAL CHANGES TO THE TAX TRANSITIONAL RULES Clause 54 Issue: Threshold should be increased from 3 percent to 5 percent Submission (Financial Services Council, Sovereign Assurance Company Ltd) The threshold in the proposed clause should replace the reference to 3 percent with 5 percent. (All) The proposed 3 percent threshold is not supported because it does not reflect CPI movements for relevant periods and does not reflect commercial reality. (Sovereign) Comment In 2010 the taxation rules for life insurance business were substantially reformed and included rules that provided transitional relief for life policies sold before the commencement of the reforms (1 July 2010). The previous tax rules for life insurance business were broken and did not correctly tax the profits life insurers earned from selling life-risk insurance policies. The transitional rules give life insurers a deduction (calculated by reference to the formula in section EY 30(7)) and have the effect of preserving the application of the previous tax rules to life insurance policies sold before 1 July 2010. The intent of the transitional rules was not, however, to provide comprehensive or full grandparenting for the entire lifetime of life insurance policies sold before the start of the reforms. The proposed amendment in the Bill responds to a request for legislative change from the Financial Services Council concerning the availability of transitional relief for life insurance policies that were sold as “level premium”, when those policies offered policyholders the option to increase the amount of life cover. Level premium life insurance policies are policies whose premiums do not change for the duration of the contractually agreed continuous period, that is, the period by which the premium would remain level. The rules for “level premium” provide life insurers with an extended period of transitional relief (more than 5 years which applied to rate for age – also known as annual renewable term – life policies) on the basis that the life insurer has sold a policy for a premium that does not change over the policy’s lifetime. The policies would have been priced using certain assumptions, including the tax rules at that time, and generally provided limited ability for the life insurer to adjust premiums even though the cost of insurance risk increases due to the increasing policyholder mortality risk. Level premium policies can be sold with an additional benefit that allows policyholders to annually increase the amount of life cover to keep pace with inflation, as measured by percentage movements in the consumer price index (“CPI”). In 2010 the tax transitional rules were modified so that such annual adjustments did not disqualify level premium policies from transitional relief on the condition that the increase in life cover was “directly linked” to percentage movements in CPI and that any increases were contractually provided for in the life policy before 1 July 2010. 157 The proposed amendment in this Bill responds to a practical problem arising from the low- inflation environment that has existed in New Zealand since 2010, apart from the calendar quarters affected by the increase in the rate of GST in 2010. Officials understand from consultation with the Financial Services Council that many of the increases in life cover under a level premium policy were subject to a minimum increase to ensure that the administration costs of providing an annual CPI benefit did not exceed the profit element priced into that benefit. For example, the administration costs of managing a 0.8% inflation increase in the sum assured would exceed the profit to the life insurer for providing that benefit. As noted in the submissions from AMP and Asteron a minimum increase of 3 percent was applied. Officials note that 3 percent aligns with the upper range of the Reserve Bank’s inflation target since the mid-1990s. From information provided to officials by the Financial Services Council, the proposed amendment’s 3 percent threshold would preserve life insurer transitional relief for 10,000 life insurance policies. These life insurance policies are expected to have a remaining life of 5 years. Sovereign argues that a 5 percent minimum cap should apply. Sovereign’s concern is that a 3 percent threshold puts at risk about 900 life policies it asserts should receive risk grandparenting relief. These 900 policies offered policyholders growth life cover benefits of above 3 percent. The matters raised by submissions go to the core objective of providing transitional relief. The transitional rules provided life insurers around 5 years of meaningful tax relief with the expectation that the relief would sharply decline in the 2016–17 income year to reflect transitional relief for life insurance policies sold as level premium or single premium. The rules have been successful in this outcome. The issue raised by submissions is to what extent on- going transitional relief should continue to be given to a small and declining segment of the life insurance market. Officials consider that offering annual increases in life cover of 5 percent (when movements in CPI have not been continuously at such levels since the early 1990s) is on the high side of inflation expectations. As such, the policy benefit arguably provides the policyholder with more than protecting the real value of the initial amount of life cover and is adjusting for changes in lifestyle and income (life events). The additional benefit also makes the level premium policy an effective substitute for rate for age policies, most of which generally received a maximum transitional period of 5 years. The solution sought by submitters is, in officials’ view, beyond the scope of the proposed amendment. It is a moot point whether the current law supports annual increases in life cover of 5 percent and officials are aware of at least one instance where Inland Revenue has disallowed transitional relief for such increases. Officials do not support the threshold in the proposed amendment being changed to 5 percent. There is a risk that such an increase could have unintended consequences, with an accompanying fiscal cost, and retrospectively alter existing life insurer tax positions and expectations. 158 Officials recognise, however, that the application date of the proposed amendment – income years that include 1 July 2010 and later – could affect tax positions taken by life insurers for earlier periods. The proposed amendment could be taken as retrospectively overriding tax positions where life insurers have claimed transitional relief for level premium policies that provide increases in life benefits of more than 3 percent. Taxpayers in this situation may choose to argue those tax positions under the current law. Officials recommend that the application date should be changed and provide a savings provision allowing taxpayers to take a tax position on the basis of the current law, provided that tax position is taken before the date of Royal assent. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to officials’ comment regarding the application date of the proposed amendment. Issue: Nexus with inflation Submission (Sovereign Assurance Company Ltd) The clause should amend section EY 30(5)(b) and remove the requirement that increases in premium be “directly linked” to the percentage change in CPI. Comment The current nexus test with percentage changes in CPI is intended to ensure that changes in the amount of life cover under the life policy have a connection with preserving the real value of the life cover and not permit increases that are intended to provide options to grow the life cover under the life policy. Officials consider the current test is appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Drafting matters Submission (AMP Financial Services, Asteron Life Limited, Chartered Accountants Australia New Zealand, Deloitte, Financial Services Council, Sovereign Assurance Company Ltd) The proposed amendment does not achieve the intended outcome. 159 Comment Submitters consider that the amendment does not achieve its intended outcome of providing transitional relief for level premium life policies that provide the option to annually increase the sum assured, capped by the greater of 3 percent or percentage changes in the CPI. Submitters make a range of suggestions, including substituting the term “continuous rate period” for “cover review period”. The concern is that the increase in the sum assured should be measured on an annual basis instead of over the entire term of the life insurance policy. Officials agree that the amendment does not achieve the intended outcome as the proposed clause does not directly refer to policy benefits that give the option for policyholders to annually increase the amount of life cover but disagree with submitters’ suggestions. Officials consider substituting the term “continuous rate period” for “cover review period” would be ineffective and propose an alternative change to ensure the amendment has its intended effect as set out in the recommendation. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Officials recommend that clause 54 be amended to provide that: • section EY 30(5)(b) applies to life insurance policies where the premium charged does not change during the continuous rate period, ignoring additions to the premium charged for annual increases in the sum assured under s EY 30(5BA); and • section EY 30(5BA)) has effect if an annual increase in the sum assured is caused by a policy benefit, that exists before 1 July 2010, that permits increases in the sum assured provided that increase does not exceed the greater of 3 percent and the percentage change in the CPI. 160 CAPITAL RAISING COSTS – REQUIREMENT FOR REGISTERED PERSON TO “PRINCIPALLY” MAKE TAXABLE SUPPLIES Clause 21(1) Issue: Support for the proposed amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter supports the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Test should be broadened Submission (KPMG) The rules allowing registered persons to make input tax deductions in respect of capital raising costs in section 20H of the GST Act require that the registered person principally makes taxable supplies. The drafting of the section should be changed so that in establishing whether the registered person is “principally” making taxable supplies, the exempt supplies arising from the capital raising itself are excluded. The test should also be broadened to include registered persons who intend to principally make taxable supplies. Comment As the submitter has identified, the requirement for the registered person to principally make taxable supplies would mean that GST-registered businesses would not be entitled to make input tax deductions for capital raising costs in the following situations: • The business intends to make taxable supplies but is not currently making any taxable supplies. This could include start-ups that raise capital in advance of making any taxable supplies. • An established business makes taxable supplies but raises capital in excess of the value of those taxable supplies (meaning that it would not meet the “principally” test). Officials agree that these outcomes are contrary to the policy intention behind the GST rules allowing deductions for capital raising costs and that the drafting of section 20H(1) should be revised further to rectify these unintended outcomes. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 161 CLARIFICATION OF THE APPLICATION OF THE COMMON REPORTING STANDARD Clauses 73 and 74 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter supports the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 162 LOSS OF EARNINGS INSURANCE Clause 42 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter supports the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 163 New matters raised at Select Committee 164 165 MATTERS RAISED BY SUBMITTERS Issue: General opposition to the Bill Submission (Amanda Bonham, David Hammond, Dipak Patel, Edwin Khoo, Florence Lim, Gloria Guo, Jack Bao, Jun Yan, Kening Zhou, Keyul Sharma, Lidia Real, Limin Li, Matthew Bonham, Naiyuan Sang, Nicky Rhodes, Pavel Brukvin, Wendy Feng) Seventeen submitters expressed general opposition to the Bill (without identifying any particular measures) or suggested that the Bill should not proceed. Comment It is important to maintain the tax system and ensure that it continues to be fit for purpose. Changes in the economic environment, business practice, or interpretation of the law can mean that the tax system becomes unfair, inefficient, complex, or uncertain. The amendments in this Bill aim to address these concerns and improve current tax settings. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”) Submission (Garret Huelson) The submission raises a general tax issue unrelated to any specific bill proposal. It pertains to the current requirement for information on the activities and financial holdings of “Kiwi- Americans” to be reported to the United States (“US”) Internal Revenue Service, under that country’s Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCAC) legislation. The submission recommends that additional wording be introduced into this taxation Bill and that the “tax treaty” be amended to prevent such reporting. The submission notes that there are thousands of “US persons” currently residing as citizens of New Zealand that are adversely affected by this law. It allows the United States to enforce double taxation and its own reporting codes on residents and citizens of New Zealand. It can jeopardise the ability of Kiwi-Americans to open accounts with New Zealand financial institutions and imposes tax reporting costs and other impediments on small businesses operating in New Zealand. More generally, FATCA “siphons profits generated in NZ to fill government coffers in the USA”, and “impedes on NZ’s sovereign nation status by letting the US politicians regulate NZ financial institutions”. The submission states that it is imperative that New Zealand takes steps to protect profits earned in New Zealand and adopts a territorial-based taxation approach. 166 Comment The US FATCA legislation applies directly to all financial institutions worldwide. Penalties apply for non-compliance, including a US 30% withholding tax on US sourced payments. It would not be practical for New Zealand to pass legislation blocking FATCA reporting as such action would merely trigger the imposition of US penalties. The FATCA reporting regime is also very similar to the global reporting of financial account information that has since been established under the G20/OECD Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information for Tax Purposes (“AEOI”) initiative. The US did not join the AEOI initiative as it already has FATCA and FATCA is specifically tailored for the US tax system which operates on a different basis than most other countries. The “tax treaty” referred to in the submission is likely the FATCA intergovernmental agreement (“IGA”) that New Zealand concluded with the US. This requires reporting to go through the local tax authority rather than direct to the US, thereby removing privacy concerns and other legal obstacles that would have arisen for financial institutions from direct reporting. It also establishes reciprocity, so that the US must also provide information to New Zealand on financial accounts held in the US by New Zealand residents. This should provide New Zealand with the same result as it would have if the US had implemented AEOI. These benefits would be lost if New Zealand terminated the IGA. The recommendation in the submission for New Zealand to adopt a territorial based taxation approach would be a fundamental change that cannot be considered in the context of a submission on a bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Tax on charities Submission (Zarir Chhor) There should be no special tax treatment for charities. Comment Policy changes to the tax treatment of charities would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Officials note that the Tax Working Group’s final report included recommendations relating to the tax treatment of charities and that the Government is currently consulting on a review of the Charities Act 2005. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 167 Issue: Capital gains tax Submission (Bruce Wallis, CK Yan, Hongtao Du, Justin Rose, Phil Penney, Tania Tang) Six submitters opposed a capital gains tax. A capital gains tax will increase costs on landlords and reduce the incentives to work hard to earn wealth. (CK Yan) Implementing a CGT would increase rents and reduce rental supply. (Justin Rose, Phil Penney) I’ve paid for new carpet and vinyl for a rental property out of my salary income which has already been taxed. These costs can’t be deducted against rental income. I would be taxed again under a capital gains tax. (Tania Tang) A capital gains tax should apply progressively: exempt owner occupied and first rental property, apply loss ring-fencing and tax a second rental property; ring-fence and a higher tax on third rental properties and so on. (Tania Tang) Comment The Bill does not include a capital gains tax. Furthermore, the Government has announced it will not be introducing a capital gains tax. Officials note that the existing tax rules allow the cost of new chattels such as carpet to be depreciated over several tax years. For details see the Inland Revenue publication, General Depreciation Determination DEP 80: Residential Rental Property Chattels. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Tax debt write-offs and refunds Submission (Gary Wills) All monies owed by individuals, businesses, trusts or by Inland Revenue should be paid, regardless of how much is outstanding. Comment Inland Revenue actively seeks to collect debts that it is owed but there are some situations where debts cannot be collected. The tax laws include rules allowing for the write off of some debts in cases of hardship or where it would be uneconomical to collect a debt. 168 The individuals’ income tax year end processes enacted in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 will help Inland Revenue to pay out refunds of tax by enabling the auto-calculation of approximately 2.5 million taxpayers’ tax positions and the payment of refunds without the need for the taxpayer to interact with Inland Revenue where they have only earnt wages and salary and investment income. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Certain income limits should increase with an increased minimum wage Submission (Connie Winslow) The income limits for secondary tax and the community services card need lifting due to minimum wage increases. Superannuation recipients who continue to work part time may lose their eligibility for a community services card because of the higher minimum wage, unless they reduce their hours of work. Comment Secondary tax codes help ensure that taxpayers with a second job have the correct amount of tax deducted from their pay cheques. This reduces the need to make adjustments (additional tax or refunds) at the end of the tax year. As there is no income threshold for using a secondary tax code, there is no need to adjust a threshold in response to a higher minimum wage. The income thresholds for eligibility for a community services card are administered by the Ministry of Health and are outside the scope of a taxation bill. The community services card income thresholds are periodically reviewed and adjusted upwards. The latest increases apply from 1 April 2019 – see Health Entitlement Cards Amendment Regulations 2019. Officials have referred this submission to the Ministry of Health to consider when they next review those thresholds. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 169 Issue: Secondary tax codes Submission (Gary Wills) Secondary tax should be abolished and that all income should be taxed at the main rate. Comment New Zealand has a progressive tax system and secondary tax codes are necessary to help ensure that taxpayers with a second job have enough tax deducted from their pay cheques. This reduces the need to make adjustments (additional tax or refunds) at the end of the tax year. In some circumstances secondary tax can result in taxpayers paying too much tax and the Government has passed measures to deal with this problem in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: GST Act rewrite Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The proposed GST on low-value imported goods legislation has been drafted to fit into the existing structure of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act). The GST Act is nearly 35 years old. There have been many changes in GST during those years and this is now evident when reading and interpreting GST legislation. The section structure has become more uneven as different regimes have been incorporated into the Act. The Government should consider a rewrite of the Act. Comment A rewrite of the GST Act would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. In particular, it would require a significant commitment of drafting resource and input from stakeholders such as tax practitioners. Officials note that the tax policy work programme is full and consider that a rewrite of the GST Act would, at this time, be a lower priority than other uses of these resources such as policy items and remedial amendments. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 170 Issue: Associated persons definition – interaction of tripartite test with partnership and associate of partner test Submission (Polson Higgs) The submitter has identified an unintended consequence of the tripartite test of association in section 2A(1)(i) of the GST Act 1985 – in particular its interaction with the partnership and associate of partner test in section 2A(1)(e). To address this issue, the submitter has suggested that the limitation to the tripartite test in section 2A(8) be amended to read: “Subsection (1)(i) does not apply if two persons (persons A and B) are both associated with a third person (person C) under subsection (1)(c) either directly or indirectly through the application of subsection (1)(c) in any paragraph of subsection (1).” Comment The limitation to the universal tripartite test in section 2A(8) was inserted to prevent the tripartite test unintentionally increasing association for GST purposes past two degrees of blood relationship by chaining together associated relatives. For example, in the absence of the limitation in section 2A(8), an uncle and a nephew would be associated for GST purposes through their common association to the brother/father. The limitation prevents the uncle and nephew from being associated under the tripartite test only as a result of their blood relationship with the brother/father. However, it is possible that such distant blood relations can be associated through the universal tripartite test indirectly as a consequence of the various aggregation rules for specific entity types. The submitter has provided a specific example of where the interaction of the partnership and associate of a partner test with the universal tripartite test produces an outcome that constitutes an overreach. Given the existence of the universal tripartite test, the partnership and associate of partner test is not necessary. The specific example raised by the submitter can therefore be remedied by repealing the partnership and associate of partner test. Officials consider this amendment is preferable to the amendment suggested by the submitter as it is more certain. It would also be consistent with the associated persons definition in the Income Tax Act 2007. Officials acknowledge there may be other examples of potential overreach under the tripartite test. This broader issue would however require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 171 Issue: Extension to non-resident oil rig exemption Submission (Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of New Zealand) It is submitted that section CW 57 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which will otherwise expire on 31 December 2019, be renewed. Section CW 57 provides an exemption for income derived by a non-resident company from exploration and development activities in an offshore permit area. Prior to section CW 57 being enacted some 15 years ago, drilling and seismic ships were in some cases incentivised to inefficiently leave New Zealand (with a new rig being mobilized to complete the exploration programme) before triggering a day count threshold in New Zealand's double tax agreements. The day count threshold (presence in New Zealand for 183 days, or sometimes a shorter period, in a 12-month period) is relevant to whether the owner would be subject to New Zealand tax and so can create an artificial incentive for swapping out one ship/rig before the period has elapsed for another. The submitter considers section CW 57 to be important for the following reasons: • It removes the incentive for the inefficient “rig churn” described above and thereby minimises unnecessary costs. • It supports the delivery of current work programmes for petroleum exploration permits. All exploration permits in New Zealand have “drill-or-drop” commitments in the coming months and several years, which means that regulatory settings (including section CW 57) within this time must be certain and conducive to drilling taking place. • It is critical to maintaining investor confidence in New Zealand. This is especially important in the current context of significant sovereign risk and policy uncertainty facing the petroleum sector in New Zealand following the unexpected ban on new petroleum exploration permits outside of onshore Taranaki. • The Government has previously stated that it will honour existing permit holders’ rights and we consider that maintaining long-standing exploration rules (including section CW 57) is an important part of that. Section CW 57 has been in place for almost 15 years and although it has a sunset period it has been renewed by successive Labour-led and National-led Governments. Businesses have inferred from this support that the exemption was a relatively stable aspect of New Zealand's tax policy settings. The submitter understands that this Bill is likely to be the last tax bill to be enacted this year. Given that the exemption expires on 31 December 2019 it is critical that Parliament uses this Bill to amend section CW 57 accordingly. Comment This provision was originally introduced in 2004 for a five-year period ending on 31 December 2009. It has subsequently been extended twice more with expiry dates of 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2019 respectively. However, the current policy position, which is reflected in the Income Tax Act, is that it will expire on 31 December 2019. Extending the provision beyond this date would be a policy change which requires a decision by Cabinet which has not been made. 172 Officials note a decision on section CW 57 is independent of the Government’s decision not to grant new offshore petroleum exploration permits as the rigs and seismic vessels covered by this exemption will be used within existing permit areas. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 173 MATTERS RAISED BY OFFICIALS Issue: Tax treatment of transitional support payments made under the Oranga Tamariki Act 1989 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 386AAG and section 386B of the Oranga Tamariki Act 1989 come into force from 1 July 2019 and will enable two new payments to be made by the Chief Executive of Oranga Tamariki to young people or their caregivers. These payments extend support for young people leaving care by allowing them to: • remain with or return to a caregiver until the age of 21 (section 386AAG); and • receive financial assistance until the age of 25 (section 386B). These payments are equivalent to other forms of financial assistance that are exempt from income tax, such as Foster Care Allowance payments made under section 363 of the Oranga Tamariki Act. Changes have already been progressed to exempt these payments from being considered income under the Social Security Act 2018. These payments are not intended to take on the nature of income or effect entitlements for various social policies. Legal advice has indicated that these payments may be taxable under the Income Tax Act 2007 and may be considered income for Working for Families, student loan repayments and child support purposes. Comment Officials recommend that amendments be made to sections CW33 and MB13 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to exempt payments made under sections 386AAG and 386B of the Oranga Tamariki Act 1989. The application date should be 1 July 2019. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Binding rulings on the test of principal purpose of making taxable supplies Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials recommend an amendment to section 91CB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to remove the reference to the test of principal purpose of making taxable supplies in respect of matters that the Commissioner can issue binding rulings on. This is because the test no longer exists. 174 Comment Changes made under the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 (the amendment Act) enable the Commissioner to issue binding rulings in relation to a person’s purpose under certain provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. This included the ability for the Commissioner to issue binding rulings on the test of principal purpose of making taxable supplies under certain provisions of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. This test was removed from the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 by the amendment Act. Section 91CB(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to remove paragraph (c) with effect from 18 March 2019 (the date the amendment Act received the Royal assent) to ensure there is no confusion. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Removal of requirement for an “arrangement” in binding ruling Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 91EB(2)(a), which provides that a ruling does not apply in certain circumstances, is limited to where an “arrangement” is materially different from that ruled on. However, the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 has expanded the scope of matters that can be ruled on without the need for an “arrangement”. This includes new section 91CB which allows rulings to be made on matters such as a person’s status, whether an item is “trading stock” or “revenue account property” as defined under the Income Tax Act 2007, and the application of the intention tests in relation to the disposal of personal property and under certain land sales provisions. It is submitted that section 91EB(2) be extended to also include a person’s circumstances being materially different from the circumstances in relation to which a ruling is made under section 91CB. Comment The purpose of section 91EB(2) is to protect the revenue base from binding rulings given when there has been a material omission or representation in the application for the ruling or when the ruling could be applied in circumstances that are materially different from those outlined in the application. Paragraph (a) deals with the second situation but is limited to an arrangement that is materially different to that in the ruling. Officials recommend that section 91EB(2) be amended as submitted to extend to when a person’s circumstances are materially different to the circumstances in relation to which a ruling is made under section 91CB. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 175 Issue: GST exemption for residential property that is sold after being sub-let for five or more years Submission (Matter raised by officials) Most sales of residential land are not subject to GST as they are either not sold by GST- registered persons, or are not part of the GST-registered person’s taxable activity. However, if a GST-registered person is regularly selling residential land, then they may have a taxable activity of selling property and so they may have to apply GST when they sell residential land. An exception to this is when the land has been exclusively used for residential accommodation for at least the last five years, the sale of the land will be exempt from GST under section 14(1)(d) of the GST Act. However, the current exemption requires the land-owner to have rented the dwelling to the ultimate tenant. It does not apply to sub-letting arrangements where a GST-registered land- owner has let the property to a housing provider who has sub-let it to tenants for five or more years. This means that such sub-letting arrangements can be disadvantaged relative to similar arrangements where the property owner had let the property directly to the tenant. These type of sub-letting arrangements are becoming increasingly common, particularly for social housing providers. Section 14(1)(d) of the GST Act should be amended so it also exempts the sale of the residential property where the property has been sub-let to tenants for five or more years. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: ACC attendant care payments Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment has been made to the Income Tax Act 2007 to exempt backdated ACC payments that reimburse ACC beneficiaries for care they have paid for. An unintended consequence of this amendment is that the tax credit for the tax withheld by ACC is passed through to the carer where it should be assigned to the claimant. The Income Tax Act 2007 requires further amendment to rectify this issue. Comment ACC make payments to a number of ACC claimants who do not have full capacity and are unable to look after themselves (“ACC attendant care payments”). Attendant care payments are treated as schedular payments and ACC withhold tax at a rate of 10.5%. The ACC claimants who receive these payments can then on-pay this income to carers who provide services to the ACC claimants. These payments are exempt income to a claimant if they are on-paid to a carer, and the carer receives a tax credit for the amount withheld by ACC. Where the claimant passes on part of the payment to the carer, the claimant can claim a deduction for the amount passed on and the tax credit will be shared pro-rata between the claimant and carer. 176 Example: Current year entitlement passed on fully by the claimant to the carer. Adam is a quadriplegic and Ben is his carer. ACC have assessed Adam’s entitlement to care at $10,000 per year\*. ACC pays Adam $10,000 less the tax withheld ($1,050). Adam passes on the full amount to Ben. Adam is assessed on the gross amount of $10,000 but this income is exempt to Adam. Ben is taxable on this income of $10,000. Ben claims a credit of $1,050 for the tax already paid by ACC. Example: Current year entitlement passed on partially by the claimant to the carer. ACC pays Adam $10,000 less the tax withheld ($1,050). Adam pays Ben $5,000 gross to care for him. Adam receives a deduction for this amount. Ben is taxable on the amount paid to him. The tax credit of $1,050 is split equally between Adam and Ben. \* Note that entitlements are often paid on a weekly basis but a yearly payment has been chosen for the sake of simplicity. Amendments made in ARMTARM Although this scheme of levying withholding tax on ACC attendant care payments and not taxing the claimant on payments on-paid to the carer achieves its intended outcome where ACC provides the payments in the same year as the care is provided, it failed to do so in respect of back year payments. Where an ACC claimant was paid a back-year attendant care payment (“reimbursement payment”), the payment was effectively double taxed (taxed in both the hands of the claimant when received from ACC, and in the hands of the carer who paid tax on that income when the income was earned by the carer). This is because the law did not allow a reimbursement payment to be treated as exempt income or allow a deduction. An amendment has been made in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 (“ARMTARM”) to rectify this double taxation. Issue requiring further amendment The amendment in ARMTARM eliminated the double taxation by applying the relevant provisions to reimbursement payments. However, because the ARMTARM amendments followed the payment structure that applied to ACC attendant care payments that were made in the current year for the purposes of determining the allocation of tax withheld by ACC, it failed to take into account that where a reimbursement payment is made the claimant has previously paid the carer a “gross” amount and the carer would have paid tax on this amount. As applied, the amendments would deny the claimant a tax credit, and would allow the carer to claim a tax credit to which they were not entitled. 177 Example: Lumpsum backyear entitlement that reimburses the claimant for payments made to the carer Adam receives a reimbursement payment from ACC of $40,000 which covers attendant care payments he has made to Ben over the past four years ($10,000 per year) out of his own pocket. ACC withholds tax on the $40,000 payment in the year it is paid ($4,200). Ben has paid tax on the attendant care payments received over the last four years. To ensure that Adam is reimbursed for the $40,000 he has paid, the tax credit should be attributed to Adam. Tax treatment Cash flow Gross income $40,000 ACC payment $35,800 Exempt income ($40,000) Tax refund $4,200 Taxable income Nil $40,000 Tax credit $4,200 Payments to Ben ($40,000) (Refund) \_\_\_\_\_\_ Officials agree that the relevant provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 should be further amended to ensure that where a reimbursement payment is made, the tax credit for the tax withheld by ACC is attributed to the claimant. Officials also consider that the proposed amendment should apply from the 2018–19 year to coincide with the application date of the amendments in the ARMTARM Act. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Time barred refunds in respect of ACC reimbursement payments Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment has been made in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act (“ARMTARM”) to the ACC attendant care payment rules to eliminate the double taxation that occurs when a reimbursement payment is paid to a claimant. The amendment achieves this outcome by legislating that, where certain requirements are met, the reimbursement payment is exempt to the claimant. Where an ACC claimant has returned that income in a prior year, they must request that the Commissioner amends their assessment under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This will allow them to treat the payment as exempt income and therefore claim a tax refund. The issue that arises under current law is that section RM 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 acts as an impediment to the issuance of the refund due to the application of the timebar to amended assessments. 178 Example Mary was involved in a car accident in 2006 which reduces her ability to care for herself. Mary pays Mandy $10,000 pa to care for her out of her own pocket. 2006–07 tax year: Mary pays Mandy $10,000. Mandy pays tax on this at her marginal rate. 2007–08 tax year: Same as above. 2008–09 tax year: Same as above. 2009–10 tax year: Same as above. For the 2010–11 tax year, ACC accept that Mary is entitled to ongoing care. Along with paying Mary an entitlement for the 2010–11 tax year, ACC also pay Mary a lumpsum of $40,000 (less $4,200 withholding tax) as compensation for the previous 4 tax years. Mary files a tax return and also pays additional tax on this amount at her marginal tax rate. Treatment of the $40,000 reimbursement payment (post ARMTARM amendments) Under section CZ 35 of the Income Tax Act 2007, the lumpsum reimbursement payment that Mary received during the 2010–11 tax year will be treated as tax exempt income to Mary in the year in which it was received where the Commissioner is satisfied that the tax obligations relating to the payment have been met. Assuming that the Commissioner was satisfied that the tax obligations in relation to the payment had been met by the carer, this means that Mary could, under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, request that the Commissioner amend her assessment. The Commissioner would accept this request which would result in Mary being owed a substantial tax refund, as she has paid tax on income that is now determined to be exempt. The way that section RM 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 applies is to limit a taxpayer’s ability to claim a refund from an amended assessment to the timebar period, being four years from the end of the tax year in which the taxpayer provides the return. This achieves the desired policy intent in most instances, but means that, in Mary’s situation, she would be timebarred from claiming a refund. This is because more than four years have passed from the end of the tax year (2010–11) in which Mary provided the return. Comment Officials propose that an amendment is made to the refund provisions to include an exception that allows a taxpayer to claim a refund from an amended assessment outside the timebar period where the refund arises due to a reimbursement ACC attendant care payment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Breach of confidentiality Clause 72B Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials recommend a minor amendment to clarify what is covered by the offence for revenue officers who breach confidentiality. 179 Comment The Taxation (Annual Rates, Modernising Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 contained provisions that modernise Inland Revenue’s confidentiality rules. This included narrowing the coverage of the rule to focus specifically on information about taxpayers, rather than “all matters” relating to the Inland Revenue Acts as under the previous law. The new rules also contain a protection for information that, while not about taxpayers, is also highly sensitive as it could either prejudice the maintenance of the law or the integrity of the tax system. Examples of such information might include investigative techniques, audit strategies and so on. The Tax Administration Act 1994 contains offences and penalties for those who breach the confidentiality rules. These provisions have been amended to take account of the new confidentiality rules. However, in the case of the provision that relates to Inland Revenue staff (“revenue officers”) it is considered that a further minor amendment is required to clarify that it remains an offence to knowingly disclose information that would prejudice the maintenance of the law or the integrity of the tax system. The offence provision currently contains a cross- reference to section 18(3), the substantive provision that protects such information from disclosure. However, a more explicit reference to the type of disclosure this covers would improve the clarity of the offence provision. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Pre-consolidation imputation credits – correction of legislative error Submission (Matter raised by officials) Incorrect date references in section 186(4) of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters Act 2019 (the “ARMTARM Act”) (the transitional provision) should be corrected to ensure the provision works as intended for tax positions taken by a consolidated imputation group for the transfer of pre-consolidation imputation credits to the group’s imputation credit account (“ICA”) for periods beginning before 1 April 2021. Comment A consolidated imputation group may transfer a pre-consolidation imputation credit (section OP 22 refers) from a member company’s ICA to the group ICA if: • at any time, a debit entry is made to the group ICA (for example, by attaching imputation credits to a dividend); • the debit entry results in a debit balance in the group ICA; • at the time of the debit balance, a member company of the group has a pre-consolidation credit balance in its ICA; 180 • the amount transferred from the member company’s ICA to the group ICA does not exceed the debit balance in the group ICA; and • shareholder continuity requirements are met. Submissions have been made requesting a review of the policy for section OP 22. Section 186(3) of the ARMTARM Act provided a savings provision to allow the Government time to consider the relative priority of this review in terms of the tax policy work programme. The savings provision protects a tax position taken for a period beginning on or after 1 April 2008 and before 1 April 2021 if the amount of a pre-consolidation credit transferred to the group ICA: • exceeds the amount allowed to be transferred under section OP 22; and • does not exceed the debit balance that has arisen in the ICA of the consolidated imputation group. Officials are aware that some consolidated groups have taken tax positions that transfer pre- consolidation credits in excess of the amount allowed under the savings provision. These excess amounts have resulted in over-distributions of imputation credits, and therefore a liability for further income tax arises (which, when paid, is treated as tax paid by the consolidated imputation group). As these excess distributions would have resulted in past years’ ICA returns being required to be refiled, a transitional provision was also enacted in section 186(4) of the ARMTARM Act to minimise compliance and administration obligations for these returns. The transitional provision removes the need to refile past year ICA returns and is intended to require the payment of further imputation tax and the adjustments to the ICA for the overdistributions of imputation credits to be made in the same tax year. However, this provision contains incorrect date references, which mean that there would be a timing misalignment between the adjustments to the ICA for overdistributions of imputation credits (which would be taken into account in ICA for the tax year ending 31 March 2021), and the due date for payment being in the tax year ending 31 March 2020. In addition, the transitional provision is not clear that, for the 2019–20 and later tax years, it is no longer possible to have adopt a tax position to transfer an amount of pre-consolidation imputation credit that is more than the amount allowed under the savings provision. As this Bill will not be enacted until the latter part of 2019, officials recommend that: • the transitional provision in section 186(4) of the ARMTARM Act be amended to ensure that it works as intended; and • the due date for payment of further income tax be extended to fall after the enactment date of this Bill. The following example illustrates how the transitional provision should apply when a consolidated imputation group has transferred pre-consolidation imputation credits in any period beginning on or after 1 April 2008 and before 1 April 2019. 181 Example: Adjustment for transfer of excess pre-consolidation imputation credit This example is based on the following assumed facts: • Company A in a consolidated group pays a dividend on 30 September 2016 with $60,000 imputation credits attached. • Prior to paying the dividend, the consolidated group’s ICA credit balance was $1,000. • Company B, another company in the consolidated group, has a pre-consolidation ICA credit balance of $100,000. • No other transactions occur in the group ICA during the year to 31 March 2017. • The group transfers the entire amount of the pre-consolidation credit to the Group ICA on the payment of the dividend. Assume the group also pays: • $50,000 of income tax in April 2017; • a dividend with $90,000 imputation credits attached in September 2017; • $60,000 of income tax in April 2018; • a dividend with $75,000 imputation credits attached in September 2018; • $60,000 of income tax in April 2018; and • a dividend with $58,000 imputation credits attached in September 2018. This example illustrates that the consolidated group has overdistributed $79,000 of imputation credits during the two years to 31 March 2018. Shareholders will have received credit for this over-distributed amount in aggregate over the same years. Therefore, the consolidated group is required to include the aggregate adjustments in its ICA return for the 2019– 20 tax year and to pay further income tax of $79,000 by the due date during the 2019–20 tax year. As section 186(4) contains an incorrect reference to the 2020–21 tax year, a clarifying amendment will be made at the earliest opportunity. No imputation penalty tax or imputation additional tax is payable on this aggregate amount of further income tax. The pre-consolidation credits can be used in future periods provided the transfer is consistent with section OP 22, or until the 2020–21 tax year consistent with section 186(3) of the ARMTARM Act. Date Group ICA As returned Group ICA adjusted Company B ICA As returned Company B ICA adjusted 1 April 2016 1,000 1,000 100,000 100,000 30 September 2016 (dividend paid by Coy A) (60,000) (60,000) 30 September 2016 (transfer from Coy B) 100,000 100,000 (100,000) 30 September 2016 retrospective adjustment (40,000) 40,000 31 March 2017 /1 April 2017 (balance) 41,000 (39,000) 0 40,000 Further income tax liability 39,000 7 April 2017 tax paid 50,000 50,000 30 September 2017 dividend paid by group company (90,000) (90,000) 31 March 2018/1 April 2018 1,000 (79,000) 40,000 Further income tax liability 40,000 7 April 2018 tax paid 60,000 60,000 30 September 2018 dividend paid by group company (58,000) (58,000) 31 March 2019 / 1 April 3019 (3,000) (37,000) 40,000 Further income tax liability 0 Aggregate further income tax liability 79,000 182 Recommendation That the submission be accepted and the incorrect date references in the savings provision be corrected. Issue: Tax Administration Act remedial Submission (Matter raised by officials) The drafting of section 17(1CB) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 erroneously includes a reference to “sections 143 and 143A” which refers to some provisions involving criminal penalties. These references to criminal penalties should be removed. The policy intent was that criminal penalties would not apply when the Commissioner was using the new information power for large multinational groups under section 17(1CB). Instead, the Commissioner would apply the new civil penalty in section 139AB that applies to large multinational groups that fail to provide the information. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Associated persons definition – omitted cross-reference in tripartite test Submission (Matter raised by officials) The universal tripartite test in section 2A(1)(i) of the GST Act 1985 generally associates two persons, A and B, if person A is associated with a third person (person C) under any one of paragraphs (a) to (h), and person B is also associated with person C under any one of paragraphs (a) to (h). A remedial amendment in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018 inserted new paragraph (hb) to associate a trustee of a trust with a person who has a power of appointment or removal of the trustee. As a result of a legislative oversight, the tripartite test was not updated to include a cross-reference to new paragraph (hb). Consistent with the policy intention, officials recommend that a cross-reference to paragraph (hb) be inserted into the tripartite test, with application from the date of enactment of the Bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 183 Issue: Clarifying the periods in sections 23C(4) and 23F(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Submission (Matter raised by officials) New employment income reporting rules came into force on 1 April 2019. Section 23C(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 defines twice monthly reporting and section 23F(3) provides the option of twice monthly reporting for employers who file on paper. It is not clear when certain periods start and end, due to the way they are described in these provisions. Sections 23C(4) and 23F(3) should be amended to clarify when the periods referred to in these sections start and end. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Correcting outdated reference in section 48B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 48B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires a retirement scheme contributor or a retirement savings scheme to provide the Commissioner with a reconciliation statement containing certain information. The information requirement in section 48B(2)(m) to provide a person’s tax file number refers to the default retirement scheme prescribed rate. However, this reference was not updated when the prescribed rates changed. Section 48B(2)(m) should be updated to refer to the current default prescribed rate of 33%. The amendment should apply retrospectively from 1 October 2010, which is the date the current prescribed rates applied from. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Definition of hire purchase agreement Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of “hire purchase agreement” in section YA1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 contains an exclusion for agreements under which property in the goods passes absolutely. However, a drafting error means that these agreements are not excluded if they meet the general criteria under the definition. It is therefore submitted that paragraph (d) of the definition be amended to remove the error. 184 Comment The definition of “hire purchase agreement” is used both in the income tax and GST legislation with timing implications that differ from other financial instruments. It is recommended that paragraph (d) of the definition of “hire purchase agreement” in section YA1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 be amended by removing the conditional wording in the provision “unless the agreement is of a kind described \[in the general criteria\]” and instead ensuring that the provision is an exclusion to the general criteria. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 185 Appendices 186 187 APPENDIX I: RING-FENCING – INDIVIDUAL SUBMITTERS’ NAMES Issue Number of submitters Names of submitters All individual submitters

simplifying and modernising tax administration. The provisions in this Bill are improvements aimed especially at KiwiSaver and Student Loans, whose administration is due to transition to Inland Revenue’s new technology platform in April 2020. The third main feature of the Bill is aimed at extending the refundability of research and development tax credits. There were 13 submissions which were generally supportive of the KiwiSaver proposals. Some were concerned at potential compliance costs borne by employers with regard to the proposal to allow a person to change their KiwiSaver contribution rate through their employer or provider or Inland Revenue. The Bill allows the Commissioner in all cases to notify a portfolio investment entity (such as a KiwiSaver scheme) if their customer was discovered to be on an incorrect prescribed investor rate. While largely supportive of the proposal, submitters discussed a range of concerns. These are addressed in this report. In relation to this matter, officials have suggested a further measure for inclusion in the Bill, which would allow Inland Revenue to refund overpaid portfolio investment entity (PIE) tax. The measure included in the Bill will correct the rate, but current legislation does not allow Inland Revenue to refund overpaid PIE tax. Officials therefore recommend an amendment to allow an end of year square-up to allow a refund to be paid. A further matter was introduced to this Bill by Supplementary Order Paper. The measure aims to allow a KiwiSaver member to be able to withdraw funds in the case of a life-shortening congenital disease. Submitters offered a range of adjustments to improve the proposal. There were five submissions on the student loans proposals. Submitters were largely positive of the proposal to alert an employer when an employee paying off a student loan is close to eliminating their debt. This would allow the employer to ensure that no over-deduction would occur. One submitter felt that the proposal would impose undue compliance costs on employers. The Bill contains a proposal to reduce the number of cases that Inland Revenue will go back and reassess a borrower’s loan balance prior to 1 April 2013. This was not supported by a submitter who felt that it rewarded non-compliant borrowers. Ten submissions were received on the R&D proposals in the Bill. Nearly all submitters supported broader refundability and the proposed remedials. Five submitters submitted that the exempt entity exclusion goes too far and would exclude businesses who only receive small amounts of exempt income from claiming the R&D tax credit. A number of submissions were also received on the wider R&D funding landscape or commented on matters outside the scope of R&D provisions in the Bill. Officials have suggested a range of further matters and these are discussed in this report. Some of these relate to Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme and aim to ensure that service provision is not adversely affected by the transition to the new technology. All matters suggested by officials aim to ensure that the legislation is consistent with the policy intent. 12 13 KiwiSaver 15 GENERAL SUBMISSIONS Issue: Support for the proposed amendments to KiwiSaver Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Financial Services Council, PwC) Three submitters were supportive of the proposed amendments. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Financial Services Council) Two submitters supported the proposal to allow Inland Revenue to on-pay employer contributions to KiwiSaver scheme providers based on employment income information. (PwC, KPMG) One of the above submitters noted how the proposal operates in practice will be key. (KPMG) Recommendation That the support be noted. Issue: Greater consultation expected Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The submitter felt there had been insufficient industry consultation. Comment The proposed changes are part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme which will see the various tax types and functions administered through the tax system transferred to the department’s new technology platform. KiwiSaver will transition in April 2020 and this has meant that time available for consultation was constrained. It is desirable to implement legislative amendments aiming to enhance the central of administration of KiwiSaver at the same time. Officials also note there is on-going engagement with KiwiSaver scheme providers about the changes (the main industry affected), including during the policy development phase. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 16 Issue: Recovering unpaid employer contributions from scheme providers (Clause 21) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Financial Services Council) The submitters queried who would be liable if the employer did not subsequently pay the employer contribution amount to Inland Revenue and if there needed to be a mechanism in place for Inland Revenue to recover unpaid contributions from a KiwiSaver scheme provider. Comment Officials consider that such a mechanism is unnecessary. Where an employer has not paid an employer contribution amount by its due date, proposed amendments to section 78 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 specify that the unpaid contribution would be paid from a Crown Bank Account (effectively creating a debt from the employer to Inland Revenue). Therefore, the employer contribution amount would not need to be recovered from the KiwiSaver scheme provider. This approach ensures employees are not disadvantaged by their employer’s non- payment and is consistent with the approach Inland Revenue currently adopts in relation to KiwiSaver employee contributions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Aligning the provisional and holding periods with the opt-out period (Clauses 6, 7, 8, 9) Submission (Financial Services Council) The submitter supports the proposal to reduce the KiwiSaver provisional period and holding period from three months to two months. However, the submitter sought clarification as to whether the intent is also to change the KiwiSaver opt-out period, noting it would be good to synchronise the provisional period with the opt-out period. Comment Officials intent is not to align the provisional period and holding period with the KiwiSaver opt- out period. The proposal in the Bill would reduce the holding period from 92 days to 62 days, while the opt-out period would remain from day 13 until the end of day 55 after a person has been automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver. Maintaining a holding period that is slightly longer than the opt-out period reduces the risk of contributions being transferred to KiwiSaver scheme providers, ahead of an opt-out request being processed. This should prevent an increase in contributions that need to be recovered by Inland Revenue from scheme providers because of opt-outs. 17 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: More education about KiwiSaver residence requirements (Clauses 10, 11, 12) Submission (Financial Services Council) The submitter supported removing the three-month grace period for people who were invalidly enrolled in KiwiSaver to meet the KiwiSaver residence requirement. However, to reduce the number of people invalidly enrolled, the submitter recommends Inland Revenue consider providing more education about the KiwiSaver residence requirements. Comment Removing the three-month residence grace period, would mean Inland Revenue would be able to contact an employer who has invalidly enrolled a person as soon as the invalid enrolment has been identified (to let them know that the KiwiSaver account has been closed). This would mean Inland Revenue would be able to help these employers understand the KiwiSaver residence requirements sooner, therefore, potentially preventing subsequent invalid enrolments. Officials also note that Inland Revenue already has information on its KiwiSaver website and in its KiwiSaver guide for employers, explaining the KiwiSaver residence requirements. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Calculating interest on contributions not received (Clause 23) Submission (Financial Services Council) The Bill proposes that interest paid on contributions while they are held by Inland Revenue would start accruing from the date of the member’s payday. The submitter sought clarification about how interest would be calculated and paid on contributions Inland Revenue had not yet received. Comment For the purpose of calculating interest payments, KiwiSaver contributions would be treated as received by Inland Revenue on the date of the member’s payday, as reported by the employer. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 18 CHANGING CONTRIBUTION RATES THROUGH A SCHEME PROVIDER OR INLAND REVENUE (Clause 14) Issue: Support for the proposal Submission (ANZ, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Financial Services Council, PwC) Submitters supported the proposal that would allow KiwiSaver members to change their contribution rate by giving notice to their scheme provider or Inland Revenue. One submitter noted the change would positively impact s retirement outcomes and ensure KiwiSaver scheme providers have the ability to effectively engage with their members on this matter. (Financial Services Council) Another submitter supported the proposal on the basis it would improve the member experience by making it easier for members to review and change their contribution rate. Consequently, this submitter strongly opposed the possibility of the proposal being removed from the Bill. (ANZ) Recommendation That the support be noted. Issue: Proposal creates compliance costs Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY, Martin Etherington) The change will increase compliance costs for employers. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY) One of these submitters also noted that the proposed notification process (where an employer actions a contribution rate change request once notified by the employer) would likely not be as efficient as a contribution rate change request made directly to an employer. However, this submitter felt it was desirable to have flexibility in the legislation and overall viewed the amendment as favourable, to the extent there was evidence indicating it was something employees would find useful. (EY) One submitter was of the view the proposal should be removed from the Bill on the basis it would add complexity to the KiwiSaver scheme rules and introduce additional administrative costs for KiwiSaver scheme providers and Inland Revenue. (Martin Etherington) Comment Officials recommend that the application date for this proposal should be deferred until 1 April 2022 or an earlier date set by Order in Council. 19 The proposed change has received public support and would be worth implementing. However, deferring the application date would enable officials to undertake further consultation with stakeholders to explore the root of concerns raised in more detail and to investigate an operational approach that would minimise the compliance cost of this change for employers. Allowing for the new application date for this proposal to be set by Order in Council at a date earlier than 1 April 2022 would mean there could be flexibility around when the proposal was introduced, to ensure the change could be implemented at a time that was workable for affected parties. Recommendation That, subject to officials’ comments, the submission be accepted. Issue: Proposal should not be deferred Submission (ANZ, Financial Services Council) The submitters were of the view it would not be cost effective to defer the change past its current application date of 1 April 2020 (as this would require employers and payroll providers to make further KiwiSaver compliance changes at a later stage). Comment Based on concerns outlined above by other submitters, officials are recommending that the application date of the proposal be deferred until 1 April 2022 or an earlier date to be set by Order in Council. As employers and payroll providers update payroll specifications each tax year, making the change for a post 1 April 2020 tax year is unlikely to increase the implementation cost for employers and payroll providers. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The first pay period that the contribution rate change applies to Submission (Deloitte, EY) Where a KiwiSaver member changes their contribution rate through their KiwiSaver scheme provider or Inland Revenue, the member’s employer would be required to apply the new contribution rate to the next “payment of salary or wages that is calculated” after being notified by Inland Revenue about the contribution rate change. Submitters raise concerns that it may not always be workable for an employer to comply with this requirement (for example, if a 20 notification is received by an employer after details for their next pay run have already been finalised). Employers should instead be required to respond to the rate change request as soon as practicable after receiving the notification from Inland Revenue, or the legislation should prescribe that if a rate change request is received within three working days of a pay run it does not need to be applied until the following pay run. Comment Under the existing legislation employers must already apply a new contribution rate to the next payment of salary or wages that is calculated after receiving notice from their employee of this request. This same timeframe applies for stopping KiwiSaver deductions where an employer receives notice from Inland Revenue that one of their employees has opted to go on a savings suspension. These rules have been in place since KiwiSaver was introduced in 2007 and officials are not aware of employers having difficulty complying with them in the past. Moreover, once pay run details are finalised, an employer would have already calculated a payment of salary or wages. Therefore, in the situation the submitter has concerns about, the existing wording of the amendment would already allow employers to first apply the new contribution rate to the subsequent pay run. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Contribution rate information should be sent to scheme provider Submission (ANZ, EY) Members’ contribution rates should be reported to KiwiSaver scheme providers. (ANZ) Where a contribution rate change application is made to Inland Revenue under proposed new section 64(2D) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006, Inland Revenue should be required to notify the member’s scheme provider of the contribution rate. (EY) Comment Officials note that currently employers are not required to report information to Inland Revenue about the KiwiSaver contribution rates selected by their employees. As Inland Revenue does not hold this information, it is not possible for Inland Revenue to pass this information on to KiwiSaver scheme providers. Requiring employers to report their employees’ contribution rates to Inland Revenue would have compliance costs for employers and consultation would need to be undertaken to ascertain the scale of these compliance costs. Officials also consider that if facilities were introduced to report contribution rates to Inland Revenue it would be more helpful if scheme providers received this information about all their members, not just members who had made a contribution rate request through a scheme provider. 21 With officials recommending deferring members being able to change their contribution rate through a scheme provider or Inland Revenue, this would allow time for further consideration to be given to sharing contribution rate information with KiwiSaver scheme providers, ahead of this proposal being introduced. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Certainty about when contribution rate change processed Submission (Financial Services Council) The legislation should either specify a timeframe within which Inland Revenue must give notice to the employer of the employee’s request to change contribution rates or Inland Revenue should be required to confirm to the member and the member’s scheme provider, it has given notice to the member’s employer of the contribution rate change. Comment Inland Revenue would provide notice to an employer of a contribution rate change as soon as possible after receiving the contribution rate change request from a KiwiSaver scheme provider or member. Officials are recommending that the application date for this proposal be deferred to give further consideration to the operational design of the proposal. As operational design considerations could have implications for the delivery of information to Inland Revenue, officials are of the view a timeframe for providing notice to an employer should not be set. Officials consider there to be limited benefit in advising a scheme provider when notice has been provided to an employer of a contribution rate change in isolation. Rather, as noted in relation to the above submission, information about all members’ contribution rates is likely to be more useful to scheme providers. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Timeliness of providing information to employers Submission (PwC) It would be important to ensure information was provided to employers in a timely manner to ensure the preferred employee contributions are being deducted from an employee’s salary or wages at their preferred rate. 22 Comment As noted, it is intended that Inland Revenue provide notice to an employer of a contribution rate change as soon as practicable after receiving the contribution rate change request from a KiwiSaver scheme provider or member. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Scheme providers should share contribution rate information with employers Submission (EY) The submitter recommended that proposed new section 64(2C) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 be amended so that KiwiSaver scheme providers would be required to notify a member’s employer (in addition to notifying Inland Revenue) where the member has made a contribution rate change request to their scheme provider. Comment The existing proposal would only require KiwiSaver scheme providers and employers to communicate with one other party (that is, Inland Revenue). Therefore, this submission would add significant complexity to the proposal, as KiwiSaver scheme providers would be required to communicate with all the employers of members who requested a contribution rate change. Moreover, as there are no existing channels for KiwiSaver scheme providers and employers to communicate, officials consider this recommendation would introduce additional administrative costs for both KiwiSaver scheme providers and employers. The recommendation could also create issues where a member has not provided accurate employer details to their scheme provider when requesting a contribution rate change. This could result in KiwiSaver scheme providers being unable to satisfy their obligation to notify an employer of the contribution rate change. In contrast, Inland Revenue is better placed to determine whether a member’s employer details are accurate, as these details can be verified against information Inland Revenue already holds. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 23 Issue: Guidance about implementing the proposal Submission (ANZ) The submitter sought further guidance about how the proposal would work in practice. In particular, how contribution rate changes would be communicated between KiwiSaver scheme providers, Inland Revenue, and employers. Comment Inland Revenue officials will continue to work with stakeholders to establish a more detailed operational process for this change. Deferring the application date would provide further time to work through the operational details with stakeholders before the change must be implemented. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 24 COLLECTING KIWISAVER INCOME AND ESCT RATE INFORMATION (Clauses 13, 25, 132) Issue: Support for the proposal Submission (PwC, Financial Services Council) Submitters supported employers being required to provide KiwiSaver income and employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) rate information to Inland Revenue. Recommendation That the support be noted. Issue: Compliance costs on employers Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Martin Etherington) One submitter raised concerns about the compliance costs for employers associated with the proposal. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Collecting ESCT rate information will impose unnecessary compliance costs on employers, as Inland Revenue should already be able to calculate an employee’s ESCT rate based on employment income information already collected from employers. (Deloitte, Martin Etherington) Comments ESCT rate information While collecting ESCT rates would make it easier for Inland Revenue to detect potential miscalculations of ESCT deductions by employers (for example, where an employer has selected the correct ESCT rate but miscalculated the deduction); officials agree that the compliance costs on employers of this change would outweigh these benefits. Therefore, officials recommend that the requirement for employers to report ESCT rate information to Inland Revenue for new employees and existing employees where the information has changed, should be removed from the Bill. KiwiSaver income information The Bill currently proposes that employers be required to provide information to Inland Revenue about the income an employee’s KiwiSaver contributions are calculated from (as there are some amounts treated as income for PAYE that are excluded from the KiwiSaver definition of “salary and wages” for new employees and existing employees where this information has changes since it was last reported). To address concerns raised about compliance costs on employers, officials 25 recommend changing the proposal so that employers would only be required to report this information to Inland Revenue about new employees. As a result, reporting this information could be incorporated into new employee on-boarding reporting processes. As any differences between income for PAYE purposes and for KiwiSaver purposes generally does not change during the course of an employment relationship, collecting this information in relation to new employees only is likely to be sufficient for Inland Revenue to more effectively detect miscalculations of KiwiSaver contributions. Recommendation That, subject to officials’ comments, the submission be accepted. Issue: Reporting ESCT rate information on a payday basis Submission (EY) Employers should be given the option of reporting ESCT rate information to Inland Revenue every payday, rather than only for new employees and also when this information has changed since it was last reported as proposed in the Bill. This would make it easier for the change to be programmed into automated PAYE information reporting systems. Comment This is no longer a consideration as officials are recommending that the proposal to require employers to report ESCT rate information to Inland Revenue be removed from the Bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Include the value of accommodation with the definition of “salary and wages” for KiwiSaver Submission (Martin Etherington) The objective of Inland Revenue being able to identify earnings an employee is receiving that are not subject to the KiwiSaver definition of salary and wages is supported. However, this could be achieved by aligning the definition of “salary and wages” in the KiwiSaver Act 2006, with the definition of income used in the Accident Compensation Act 2001 for the ACC earners’ levy. This alignment could be achieved by including the value of accommodation within the definition of “salary and wages” in the KiwiSaver Act 2006. 26 Comment Officials note that the definition of salary and wages used in the KiwiSaver Act 2006 is based on the definition of salary and wages used in the Income Tax Act 2007. However, there are some differences in recognition of the fact that including certain payments may impact the affordability of KiwiSaver. The value of accommodation was not included in the definition of salary and wages in the KiwiSaver Act 2006 as doing so could have a significant impact on the affordability of KiwiSaver for both employees and employers. Generally, if an employee is required to have contributions deducted from a payment, an employer will also be required to take this payment into account when calculating compulsory employer contributions. Officials also note that including the value of accommodation within the definition of “salary and wages” in the KiwiSaver Act 2006, would not align it with the definition of income used for the ACC earners’ levy. For example, weekly paid parental leave payments are included within the definition of “salary and wages” for the purpose of KiwiSaver employee contributions but are not included within the definition of income for the purposes of the ACC earners’ levy. Therefore, further alignment of these definitions could have adverse impacts on KiwiSaver members’ retirement savings. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: General comments on greater information gathering capabilities Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) If Inland Revenue were to obtain greater quantities of information as a result of proposed amendments to the KiwiSaver Act 2006, it needs to ensure that there is a good reason to do so and that the information was being used for a particular purpose. Comment As outlined above officials are recommending revisions to the KiwiSaver information collecting amendments included in the Bill, so that information will only be collected when there is a clear reason to do so. Information would only be collected where it is necessary for Inland Revenue to be able to ensure that KiwiSaver members are receiving their correct contribution entitlements. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 27 REDUCING THE KIWISAVER TRANSFER PERIOD (Clauses 8 and 9) Issue: Support for the proposal Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Financial Services Council) One submitter supported aligning the transfer times for default and non-default KiwiSaver scheme providers, noting that such transfers usually happen quickly. (Financial Services Council) Recommendation That the submitters’ support be noted. Issue: Exception to 10-day transfer rule sought Submission (Kensington Swan) The submitter sought the introduction of an exception to the proposed 10 working days transfer rule, so that members were able to contract out of this transfer period if they wish to. The rationale for this was that it may be difficult for KiwiSaver providers offering “self-select” schemes (which enable investors to design their own KiwiSaver investment portfolio) or schemes investing in alternative asset classes (such as venture capital or private equity) to realise alternative assets for fair value or have access to sufficient liquid investments within the 10 day timeframe. Comment Officials consider that overall the risk described by the submitter is minimal. It is noted that as per their instruments of appointment, default KiwiSaver scheme providers already transfer default members within 10 days without issue. Many of these providers are already applying a 10 day transfer time to the transfer of all funds. In addition, the legislation would also permit schemes to exceed the 10 working day transfer rule, so long as it was agreed to between the old and new KiwiSaver schemes. Officials consider that this provision provides sufficient protection for scheme providers. Recommendation That that submission be declined. 28 OTHER KIWISAVER MATTERS Issue: Insufficient information provided to employers around KiwiSaver opt-outs Submission (PwC) When employees opt-out of KiwiSaver, employers are given insufficient information from Inland Revenue about amounts refunded. In the future Inland Revenue should provide clarity to an employer as soon as refunded amounts are processed. Currently Inland Revenue may refund contributions to the employer for members who have opted- out of KiwiSaver, without including details of which employees the refunded amount relates to. This can cause issues for the employer when the refunded amounts formed part of a total renumeration package and therefore need to be returned to the employee. Comments The KiwiSaver Act 2006 does not prescribe what form information to employers about refunded contributions must take, therefore, a legislative remedy is not required. Inland Revenue is looking at ways to enhance the central administration of KiwiSaver. This includes ways to more effectively communicate with employers in relation to KiwiSaver refunds. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Entitlement to Government contribution ceasing at 65 Submission (Neville Wynn) Over 65 year olds should continue to be entitled to the annual KiwiSaver government contribution. Comments The upper age limit for compulsory employer contributions is linked with the age a KiwiSaver member qualifies for New Zealand superannuation, as well as the age they are able to withdraw their savings (that is, 65 years old). Unlike other KiwiSaver members, over 65 year olds are able to withdraw their funds. Officials therefore note that extending entitlement to the annual government contribution to over 65 year olds, would create a risk of over 65 year olds inappropriately circulating money in and out of their KiwiSaver account to receive the government contribution (that is, immediately withdrawing the annual government contribution and then re-investing this same amount with their KiwiSaver scheme provider, so that it would count towards their entitlement to their next government contribution). This outcome would not be consistent with the purpose of this incentive, which is to encourage long-term retirement savings. 29 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Entitlement to compulsory employer contributions for under 18 year olds Submission (Ayush Vyas) Under 18 year olds should be entitled to compulsory employer contributions. Comments Setting a minimum age of entitlement to compulsory employer contributions at 18 years old avoids an incentive being created for those aged 16 or 17 to leave educational training and enter the workforce in order to obtain the benefit of compulsory employer contributions. By encouraging young people to stay in educational facilities for longer, the current setting helps to ensure the greater earning power of those young people (through higher education) and hence improve their ability to save in the future. Setting the minimum age of entitlement to compulsory employer contributions and the annual government contribution at 18 is also consistent with the KiwiSaver automatic enrolment rules. Aligning these rules helps to ensure the scheme remains simple for employers to administer. Any changes to this setting would raise issues that would require resourcing and prioritising as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Flexibility of employee contribution rates Submission (Martin Etherington) Employees should be able to have KiwiSaver contributions deducted from their salary or wages at any rate up to a maximum of 10% (this would include rates that are not whole numbers). This would allow voluntary contributions (which are currently paid directly to scheme providers) to be reported and paid in the same manner as other KiwiSaver contributions deducted (that is, through Inland Revenue). Comments There is a trade-off between providing flexibility for members and ensuring KiwiSaver remains simple, with low administrative and compliance costs for employers. Allowing members to 30 contribute at any rate above 3% would increase compliance costs for employers (especially for smaller employers not using payroll software). Officials also note that voluntary contributions are often in the form of one-off lump sum payments. As they are not necessarily regular payments nor will they always be made out of an employee’s salary or wages, it would be undesirable to require that these contributions are subject to the same reporting and payment process as the percentage based contributions deducted from members’ salary or wages. Officials believe the additional 6% and 10% rates introduced in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 adds sufficient flexibility for members, without over complicating the KiwiSaver employee contribution rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: “Lock-in” of QROPS funds in KiwiSaver schemes Submission (PwC) An amendment should be made to the KiwiSaver Act 2006 to introduce a new permitted withdrawal ground that allows UK retirement savings currently held in a KiwiSaver scheme to be transferred to a qualifying recognised overseas pension scheme (QROPS). This would address the issue of UK migrants who transferred their retirement savings to a KiwiSaver scheme before it lost its QROPS status effectively being “locked-in” to their current KiwiSaver scheme provider. Background Under UK law, migrants can transfer their UK retirement savings out of the UK to a QROPS. If these UK retirement savings are not transferred to a QROPS (or are withdrawn) then a migrant can be subject to a UK pension tax of 55% of the total savings transferred. Previously, KiwiSaver schemes were QROPS. However, the QROPS criteria were tightened in April 2015 to ensure savings could not be withdrawn until retirement age. Because of the KiwiSaver first home withdrawal facility, this led to KiwiSaver schemes no longer qualifying as QROPS. This has resulted in UK migrants who transferred their retirement savings to a KiwiSaver scheme before it lost its QROPS status effectively being “locked-in” to their current KiwiSaver scheme provider. This is because: • another KiwiSaver scheme will not accept an inward transfer of a KiwiSaver account that includes UK retirement savings; and/or • transferring to another KiwiSaver scheme would trigger the 55% UK tax liability. As the KiwiSaver Act 2006 only allows for KiwiSaver accounts to be transferred to other KiwiSaver scheme providers, it is currently not possible for an affected member to transfer their UK retirement savings to a non-KiwiSaver New Zealand QROPS. 31 Comments Officials are aware of the matter raised in this submission, however, note that it requires prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: ESCT rate for employee with secondary tax code should be the same as base tax rate Submission (Martin Etherington) An employer determines the ESCT rate for an employee based on the employee’s earnings from that employer only, without regard to earnings the employee may have elsewhere or the tax code the employee has declared. The submitter proposes the ESCT rate for employees using a secondary (or other fixed rate) tax code should be the same as the base tax rate for that tax code. Comments Using a secondary tax code can result in some individuals overpaying tax during the year. As the employee’s secondary income will be subject to a flat rate of tax at their marginal tax rate, tax is overpaid when this secondary income takes a person’s total income over a tax threshold. In this situation the individual will be entitled to a refund of the overpaid tax at the end of the tax year. In contrast, ESCT is treated as a final tax, which means overpaid ESCT cannot be refunded. Therefore, if the same rate of tax was applied to employer superannuation contributions paid by a second employer as was applied to other earning received from that employer, this would create situations where tax would be overpaid without an entitlement to a refund. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Reporting employer’s name and address to Inland Revenue Submission (Matter raised by officials) Under proposed new section 64(2C) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 when giving notice to Inland Revenue that a member has made a contribution rate change request, a KiwiSaver scheme provider is required to provide Inland Revenue with the name and address of the employers the member wants the new contribution rate to be applied by. Similarly, under proposed new section 64(2B), a member requesting a contribution rate change through Inland Revenue is required to 32 provide Inland Revenue with the names and addresses of the employers they want the new contribution rate to apply to. Similar requirements to provide employer name and address details to Inland Revenue also exist in section 38(2) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 (a KiwiSaver scheme provider is required to report these details to Inland Revenue where a person has enrolled directly with a scheme provider) and section 103 (a member is required to report these details to Inland Revenue when applying to go on a savings suspension). Issues arise where employer name and address details reported by a scheme provider or member are not accurate. This can occur when a member’s place of work has a different name to the entity they are employed by. For example, a member works at Local Corner Store but are legally employed and paid by Food Conglomerate Limited. As Food Conglomerate Limited will need to administer any changes to the employee’s contribution rate or a savings suspension request, it should be their details that are reported to Inland Revenue. However, often the member will provide Local Corner Store’s details. This can delay the member’s request being actioned. Comment Officials recommend that the requirement in proposed new sections 64(2B) and 64(2C), and existing section 38(2) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006, for KiwiSaver scheme providers and members to report an employer’s name and address to Inland Revenue be removed. Instead, Inland Revenue would notify each active employer it has on record for the employee where one of the employees has enrolled in KiwiSaver or of an employee’s new contribution rate if they have requested a contribution rate change through their scheme provider or Inland Revenue. Officials recommend the requirement in section 103(2)(b) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 for members to provide employer name and address details should be on an “as required” basis only (that is, when the information has been requested by Inland Revenue). Members who are applying for a savings suspension via their myIR account would indicate which employers they wish the savings suspension to apply to. Inland Revenue would then notify these employers that a savings suspension had been granted and as per existing practice Inland Revenue would also send notice of the savings suspension to the member, which they could show to subsequent employers of their choice. For a member applying for a savings suspension via other channels, to avoid the issue of employer details being misreported, no employer details would be requested. Instead, Inland Revenue would send the member a letter advising that a savings suspension had been granted, which the member could show to employers of their choice. This would ensure the employee could action the savings suspension with relevant employers as soon as possible. The amendments related to the employer information reporting requirements for KiwiSaver provider opt-ins and savings suspensions are required before Inland Revenue transfers the administration of KiwiSaver into its new IT system from 1 April 2020. The removal of the employer name and address reporting requirements for contribution rate changes would apply from 1 April 2022 or an earlier date set by Order in Council (this being the date that officials are recommending in this report that members be able to change their contribution rate through their KiwiSaver scheme provider or Inland Revenue). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 33 Issue: Aligning employee address requirements in the KiwiSaver Act 2006 with the Tax Administration Act 1994 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Table 2 of schedule 4 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, inserted by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018, intends to bring together the requirements from the IR330 (Tax code declaration) and KS2 (KiwiSaver deduction form) in a way which supports consolidated “fully electronic onboarding” of new employees (although, paper forms for these requirements will continue to exist). As there is currently significant overlap between these reporting requirements, consolidation would mean employers would no longer be required to provide Inland Revenue with the same information about a new employee twice. Under Schedule 4 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, an employer must provide a new employee’s contact address to Inland Revenue “as required” (that is, when this information has been requested by Inland Revenue). However, under the KiwiSaver 2006 an employer will always be required to provide an employee’s contact address to Inland Revenue for KiwiSaver new enrolments. This would mean in situations where Inland Revenue did not require a new employee’s contact address under the Tax Administration Act 1994, the employer would still be required to provide this information if the relevant employee had also been enrolled in KiwiSaver. Such an outcome would be inconsistent with the intent to consolidate new employee reporting requirements. Comment To align with the language in the Tax Administration Act 1994, officials recommend that the KiwiSaver Act 2006 be amended to clarify that an employer is only required to provide the contact address of an employee who has been enrolled in KiwiSaver as required. As new employee reporting requirements are expected to be consolidated by April 2020 (that is, when the administration of KiwiSaver is transferred to Inland Revenue’s new IT system), it is desirable to address this discrepancy now. Therefore, it is recommended amendments apply from 1 April 2020. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 34 NEW EARLY KIWISAVER WITHDRAWAL CATEGORY FOR PEOPLE WITH LIFE-SHORTENING CONGENITAL CONDITIONS Issue: Support for the proposals Submission (ANZ, BNZ, Financial Services Council of New Zealand, KPMG, Sarah Peters) Submitters support the proposals that people with a life-shortening congenital condition should be able to access their KiwiSaver funds early. One submitter supported early withdrawal of KiwiSaver funds for people whose lives are shortened for any reason. (Sarah Peters) Comment Officials welcome the support expressed by submitters for the proposals. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Definition of life-shortening congenital condition taken to be a life expectancy below the New Zealand superannuation qualification age (Clauses 38(2) of Supplementary Order Paper 293) Submission (Financial Services Council) The submitter states that the definition of life-shortening as being below the New Zealand qualification age is narrower than their understanding of the original policy intention. Comment Officials consider that defining a life-shortening congenital condition as one that shortens a person’s life below the New Zealand qualification age is appropriate. Once a person reaches the age of 65 their KiwiSaver account is unlocked and they are able to access their retirement savings. To take the definition of life-shortening congenital condition beyond the age of 65 starts to advance the definition into age ranges and timeframes that a person with a normal life-expectancy could reasonably expect to reach in retirement. This withdrawal category has been specifically designed for people who will not reach the age at which their KiwiSaver account would be “unlocked” under existing KiwiSaver settings (65 years old). Recommendation That the submission be noted. 35 Issue: KiwiSaver providers may have a grace period for updating disclosure information (Clause 37C of Supplementary Order Paper 293) Submission (Financial Services Council, BNZ) The submitters support the proposal that KiwiSaver providers will have additional time to update the disclosure documentation they are required by law to provide to their KiwiSaver members about the new withdrawal category. One has asked whether the additional time period to update information could also extend to information that they are not legally required to provide but is used to inform investors of the rules relating to their KiwiSaver scheme, for example, material on their website and customer brochures. (BNZ) Comment Officials welcome the support but consider that the additional time allowed to update disclosure documentation does not need to be extended to information that is not legally required to be provided. Recommendation That the submission about extending the grace period to information that is not legally required be declined. Issue: Application process (Clauses 38(2) and (3) of Supplementary Order Paper 293) Submission (Financial Services Council, ANZ) The submitters support the final decision for a member’s withdrawal under the new clause to sit with the supervisor of the KiwiSaver scheme. One submitter suggests that it may be helpful from a process point of view if a registered medical practitioner were required to provide a statement as part of the standard process for applications for withdrawal in order to ensure consistency across providers. The submitter also expressed their support for the proposal that those relying on the new withdrawal category should be able to select the age at which they retire. However, both the Financial Services Council and ANZ noted that allowing a member to choose the date at which 36 they retire (as distinct from the date at which the application for withdrawal is made) could be confusing and difficult to operationalise. (Financial Services Council) Comment Officials consider it would be appropriate for supervisors and managers of KiwiSaver schemes to be able to rely on the judgment of medical professionals in order to determine whether a person meets the requirements for withdrawal under the new category. It would be appropriate for a statement from a registered medical practitioner to be part of the standard process for application as this would allow the supervisor or manager to easily assess whether the person meets the criteria for withdrawal. Officials agree that the potential separation between application for withdrawal and the date the withdrawal takes place could create some operational challenges. Recommendations That the submission be accepted, and amendments made to the information requirements for the application to include a certificate from a registered medical practitioner. That the submission about the application process triggering the withdrawal of KiwiSaver funds be accepted. Issue: Operational matters requiring clarification (Clause 38(2 of Supplementary Order Paper 293)) Submission (Financial Services Council, ANZ) The interaction between the new withdrawal category and the existing five year lock-in period would prevent those people subject to the five year lock-in from withdrawing their KiwiSaver funds even if they qualify for a withdrawal under the new category. Both submitters have suggested amendments to ensure withdrawal can take place even for those who are subject to the five year lock-in period. One submitter asked whether a person can reactivate their KiwiSaver account at a later date if they have made a withdrawal under the new category. The “reactivation” would give the person the ability to return to a “locked-in” status and again become eligible for compulsory employer and government contributions (for example if their health improves). (Financial Services Council) Comment A five year lock in period applies to KiwiSaver contributions for people who joined before 1 July 2019. A person that joins before this date is a grandparented member and can withdraw their savings on the later date of New Zealand Superannuation qualification age or the five year grandparenting period. This lock-in period impacts people that joined not long before they turn 65. 37 In regard to whether a person can “reactivate” their account following a withdrawal under the new category, the purpose of the withdrawal category is to facilitate an early retirement period. Allowing a person the ability to reactivate and “lock-in” their contributions again would be counter to the purpose of facilitating an early retirement by making KiwiSaver funds available. Recommendations That the submission about the five year lock-in period be accepted, and amendments made to ensure that a person subject to a five year lock-in period can still withdraw under the new early withdrawal category. That the submission about whether a person can reactivate their account be noted. Issue: Clarification of ability to work following withdrawal under the new category (Clauses 38(2) and (3) of Supplementary Order Paper 293) Submission (Financial Services Council, ANZ) The combination of the clauses relating to a member’s ability to continue in paid employment despite making a withdrawal is inconsistent, with 12B(5) stating a withdrawal does not prevent a person from continuing in paid employment and 13(1C)(a) requiring a statutory declaration stating that the person does not intend to continue in full-time paid employment, or to accept it in the future. No statutory declaration should be required so that the withdrawal is aligned with a withdrawal that is made at age 65. Comment The statutory declaration referred to in clause 13(1C)(a) sets out that the person seeking a congenital condition withdrawal needs to declare that that is the purpose of the withdrawal. Notwithstanding the requirement in clause 13(1C)(a), if a person chooses to continue in some form of paid employment, clause 12B(5) makes it clear that any contributions made after a congenital condition withdrawal has been made will not receive Crown or compulsory employer contributions for any future contributions to their KiwiSaver account. Officials consider that the statutory declaration is still required in order to make it clear that the purpose of the withdrawal is for retirement from full-time paid employment. It is also reasonable that a person may want to continue in some form of paid employment as this is consistent with a positive retirement. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 38 Issue: Drafting matters Definitions of life-shortening congenital condition (Clause 38(2) of Supplementary Order Paper 293) Submission (Financial Services Council, ANZ) There are some inconsistencies with the drafting of the definitions of life-shortening congenital condition. Comment Officials agree that the definition of life-shortening congenital condition should be clarified in the drafting to remove inconsistencies. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and the drafting revised. Issue: Impact of withdrawal on social assistance payments Submission (Financial Services Council) Clarify how a withdrawal under the new category would affect a person’s entitlement to social assistance. Comment Under current settings, KiwiSaver funds are no longer locked-in and able to be withdrawn are treated as an available asset for the purpose of social assistance and income earned from that asset is treated as income. This means that unlocking a person’s KiwiSaver account under the proposed early withdrawal category will most likely reduce or stop a person’s social assistance payments. Work is underway to examine the interaction between early withdrawal of KiwiSaver and entitlement to social assistance and recommendations. Amendments would need to be made to the Social Security Regulation 2018 to change the impact that a withdrawal under the proposed new category would have on a person’s entitlement to social assistance. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 39 Student loans 41 MATTERS RAISED BY SUBMITTERS Issue: Limiting the ability to reopen repayment obligations prior to 1 April 2013 (Clause 57) Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter does not support the proposed changes and considers that despite the complexity introduced by significant numbers of changes since 1992, there is no principled reason to enact this change. Comment In general, officials note that by the time the changes take effect, 1 April 2013 will be seven years in the past. This is more than the median repayment time for New Zealand-based borrowers. Given this, there are unlikely to be many borrowers affected by this change. If a borrower is adversely affected by this change, the proposed legislation enables the Commissioner to reinstate the borrower back to the position they would have been in prior to this change. Retaining the rules going back to 1992 imposes compliance costs for borrowers who have their repayment obligations changed before 2013, as the majority of the changes to rules prior to 2013 do not feature in the current scheme. The low likely impact on borrowers significantly outweighs the cost imposed by building and testing systems to manage the old and complex rules that are unlikely to affect many borrowers. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Allowing Inland Revenue to notify employers when an employee’s loan balance is close to zero (Clause 45) Submission (Martin Etherington, Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY) Two submitters expressed support for the proposal to allow Inland Revenue to notify employers of a borrower’s remaining loan balance. Both also noted that it would be important that when Inland Revenue notifies an employer, that this is done allowing enough time for the employer to make the necessary adjustments. (Martin Etherington, Corporate Taxpayers Group) Implementing the change within payroll software should not be difficult. “Close” could be defined as where the loan is likely to be paid off within the next month. (Martin Etherington) 42 The proposal would impose significant compliance costs on employers for little benefit. The proposal should be made optional for employers. Alternatively, Inland Revenue could provide a faster refund process for overpaid loan deductions in the interim period between annual returns. (EY) Comment Officials welcome the support for the proposal and agree that providing sufficient notice to employers is important. Officials would prefer that the timeframe is not defined in legislation to allow greater flexibility to cater for different borrower situations. Generally, Inland Revenue is looking to issue letters to employers and borrowers when the borrower’s loan is expected to be repaid in the next three months. Officials consider that the compliance costs imposed by this change should not be significant, and that as a result, this change is appropriate. Qualitative research undertaken by Inland Revenue with groups of employers concluded that employers supported the proposal. Officials consider that making compliance with these requirements voluntary is not appropriate. Inland Revenue agrees that the refund process should be as efficient as possible and is making significant efficiency changes as part of its transformation process. It still considers that it is preferable for no over deductions to occur for student loan borrowers. Independent testing on Inland Revenue’s behalf has shown a positive response from employers and customers to this change. Recommendation That the submission to make the proposal optional for employers be declined and the other submissions be noted. Issue: Loan put on hold for those with life-shortening congenital conditions (Clause 42) Submission (Sarah Peters) That those with life-shortening congenital conditions should have their loan put on hold to prevent further debt. Comment Officials consider that the current loan scheme strikes the correct balance between providing relief to those with life-shortening congenital conditions and ensuring equity among borrowers. Where the borrower is based in New Zealand, loan repayments are income contingent with repayments only required where the borrower’s income is above the repayment threshold of $19,760 and no loan interest is imposed. If the borrower’s income is above the repayment threshold and loan repayments are required, the borrower may be able to qualify for hardship relief if the repayments are causing difficulties for the borrower. The Bill would extend this treatment to overseas-based borrowers with serious illnesses or disabilities. 43 Officials therefore recommend that the submission be declined. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 44 MATTERS RAISED BY OFFICIALS Issue: Repeal the requirement for loan repayments to be deducted from schedular, election-day, and casual agricultural income Submission (Matter raised by officials) The changes requiring student loan repayments be deducted from schedular, election-day, and casual agricultural income should be repealed. This is because consultation with employers has identified significant compliance costs for them to implement the changes. Comment From 1 April 2020, changes included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 require student loan repayments to be deducted from schedular, election-day, and casual agricultural income each payday. These changes apply from 1 April 2020. These changes would be beneficial to borrowers in reducing the compliance costs of making loan repayments during the year. However, consultation undertaken by Inland Revenue with employers has identified significant costs for implementing these proposals. Therefore, officials recommend that this legislative requirement be repealed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Underestimation penalty Submission (Matter raised by officials) That the student loan underestimation penalty be replaced with a shortfall penalty to align it with the penalty imposed for underestimation of provisional tax for tax purposes. Comment Borrowers who earn income other than salary and wages and whose end-of-year repayment obligation on this income is more than $1,000, are required to make interim repayments in the following year. A borrower can base these interim repayments on either the previous year’s assessed amount plus an uplift percentage or an estimate of the expected end-of-year repayment obligation. To ensure borrowers who choose the estimate option make an accurate estimate of their interim repayment obligations, a penalty is imposed on those who significantly underestimate their interim repayments. 45 To provide consistency of penalties between underestimations of loan repayments and the underestimations of provisional tax, it is proposed that the current underestimation penalty be replaced with a tax shortfall penalty. The Government tried to make this legislative change in 2011, but it had to be reversed because of Inland Revenue’s system limitations at the time. With Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation changes, this system limitation has been removed. This change is required before Inland Revenue moves administration of student loans repayment rules to its new computer system from 1 April 2020. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Repayment obligations limited to loan balance Submission (Matter raised by officials) Remove the requirement for pay-period repayment obligations to be limited to the loan balance. Instead, enable repayment obligations to continue until the consolidated loan balance (including unpaid amounts and interest) is repaid. Comment The Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 limits a borrower’s repayment obligation to their loan balance, rather than their consolidated loan balance. The consolidated loan balance includes amounts in default, whereas the loan balance excludes these amounts. These terms are defined in the Act. Occasionally, borrowers working in New Zealand may have no remaining loan balance, but because of amounts being in default, may have a consolidated loan balance remaining. In these cases, the current provisions prevent salary and wage deductions from being made to repay these outstanding amounts. Officials recommend an amendment to allow salary and wage deductions to continue until the consolidated loan balance is fully repaid. This change is required before Inland Revenue moves administration of student loans repayment rules to its new computer system from 1 April 2020. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 46 Issue: Lowering the adjusted net income threshold from $1,500 to $500 Submission (Matter raised by officials) That the $1,500 adjusted net income threshold, below which a borrower is not required to make repayments on their adjusted net income, be reduced to $500. Comment The Act contains a concessionary $1,500 threshold. If a borrower has less than $1,500 of non- salary and wage income, they are not required to make any student loan repayments on this income. This threshold reflects the compliance costs associated with the requirements to file a return and/or notify Inland Revenue of any adjustments to income for student loan purposes. From the 2018−19 tax year, most salary and wage earners will have their tax automatically assessed. Therefore, as the compliance costs associated with complying with the filing requirements have been reduced, officials recommend lowering the threshold to $500 of income, which would require $60 of repayments. This is very close to the $50 threshold for income tax owed from an automated assessment, where amounts owed of less than $50 are written off. This would mean that a larger number of borrowers would be required to make repayments and if payments are made, would reduce the term of the loan. Where the borrower does not pay, provisions in the student loan scheme currently allow unpaid amounts of less than $334 to be capitalised back onto the loan balance. No borrowers will be subject to penalties as a result of this change if they do not make repayments when required to do so. This change is required before Inland Revenue moves administration of student loans repayment rules to its new computer system from 1 April 2020. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Date repayment deductions are deemed to be made Submission (Matter raised by officials) The date that student loan repayment deductions are deemed to be made should be changed from the 15th of the month to the employee’s payday. Comment Currently deductions are deemed to be made on one fixed date, the 15th of the month. This is because until 1 April 2019 Inland Revenue did not receive pay day information for all employees, and determining employees’ pay days would impose compliance costs on employers. The introduction of payday filing now enables Inland Revenue to deem deductions to be made on the employee’s payday. This should not have adverse implications for borrowers. 47 Officials recommend that an amendment be made to deem student loan repayment deductions be made on the employee’s payday. This change is required before Inland Revenue moves administration of student loans repayment rules to its new computer system from 1 April 2020. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Aligning the write-off rules Submission (Matter raised by officials) Amend the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 to enable the Commissioner to write off amounts of $20 or less. Comment Currently, the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows the Commissioner to refrain from collecting tax of amounts not more than $20. In the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 the Commissioner may write off amounts less than $20. Officials recommend aligning these by changing the wording in the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 to align with the Tax Administration Act 1994. This would provide consistency of treatment between small amounts of income tax and student loan obligation. This should not have a significant impact as it will adjust the threshold for a small balance write-off by one cent. This change is required before Inland Revenue moves administration of student loans repayment rules to its new computer system from 1 April 2020. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Interest for New Zealand-based borrowers Submission (Matter raised by officials) Remove the requirement to impose interest and then write it off for New Zealand-based borrowers, for reassessments prior to 1 April 2020. Comment Systems limitations have meant that New Zealand-based borrowers had interest applied to their loans and the interest was immediately written off. This has caused confusion and concern. Inland 48 Revenue’s business transformation programme means that those systems limitations no longer exist. However, when changes are made to borrower’s loan balance after 1 April 2020 that apply to periods before 1 April 2020, the legislation technically requires interest to be imposed and written off for New Zealand-based borrowers. From a systems perspective and to improve clarity for borrowers, it is simpler to confirm that this treatment should also apply to any recalculations or reassessments on a New Zealand-based borrower’s loan before 1 April 2020. Officials propose including a savings provision to confirm this treatment. No borrower’s repayment obligations will be affected by this change. This change is required before Inland Revenue moves administration of student loans repayment rules to its new computer system from 1 April 2020. Recommendation That the recommendation be accepted. Issue: Payment ordering rules Submission (Matter raised by officials) Payments should be generally allocated against the oldest unpaid period, and within each period against interest first, then the principal. Comment Currently, the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 requires that payments be offset first against interest on the loan, then against the principal. Inland Revenue’s new system has been configured so that payments are generally allocated against the oldest unpaid assessment, and then against interest before principal within each period. This treatment is generally advantageous to borrowers as it will minimise any interest they are charged. Officials recommend that the legislation be amended to reflect the period-based allocation of payments within the new system. This change is required before Inland Revenue moves administration of student loans repayment rules to its new computer system from 1 April 2020. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 49 Issue: Early assessment of student loan adjusted net income Submission (Matter raised by officials) Where a borrower files a valid return before the end of the tax year, a borrower’s end of year repayment obligation should be finalised before the end of the tax year. Comment Currently, the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 requires that a borrower’s end-of-year repayment obligation on their adjusted net income cannot exceed their loan balance on the last day of the tax year. In some cases, a borrower may file a return before the end of the tax year (for example, if they go overseas) and this requirement would delay Inland Revenue being able to complete this assessment. Where a return is filed earlier than the last day of the tax year, officials propose that the assessment could be completed, and the borrower’s repayment obligation should not exceed their loan balance on that day. This change is required to enable Inland Revenue to configure the student loan rules in its new computer systems and processes which apply from 1 April 2020. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Notification of income by overseas-based borrowers applying to be treated as New Zealand-based Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment is required to clarify that borrowers are able to notify the Commissioner of their adjusted net income at the time they apply for treatment as being physically in New Zealand or a later date. Comment Borrowers can apply to be treated as being physically in New Zealand if the principal reason for not being in New Zealand is included within a list of categories in the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011, for example, as part of their New Zealand employment the borrower is posted overseas. If granted, borrowers’ repayment obligations are income contingent and the loan is interest free for the relevant period. Borrowers can apply for this treatment before, during or after being absent from New Zealand. As a condition of some of the listed reasons, borrowers must notify the Commissioner of their adjusted net income. However currently, it is unclear whether those borrowers who apply for this treatment after their absence must make a separate extension of time application, or whether they may notify the Commissioner of their income information at the time of application. 50 Officials recommend that the Act be amended to make it clear that a borrower can notify the Commissioner of their adjusted net income at the time they apply or at a later date if the Commissioner agrees. This change would apply from 1 April 2020. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 51 Research and development 53 GENERAL SUPPORT Issue: Support for the R&D tax credit regime Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Pharmaceutical Solutions, 1 EY, New Zealand Technology Industry Association) Submitters support the R&D tax credit regime. Comment Officials welcome the support. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Effect on innovation and investment Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY, New Zealand Technology Industry Association) The R&D tax credit will lead to more investment in the New Zealand technology sector and aligns New Zealand with other leading technology nations. (New Zealand Technology Industry Association) A well designed and administered R&D tax credit regime, in combination with other measures, has the potential to achieve the Government’s goal of incentivizing R&D in New Zealand to drive innovation, productivity, and economic growth. (EY) A successful R&D tax credit regime will benefit all New Zealanders, by helping to increase productivity, enhance skills and knowledge, and potentially attract new activity to New Zealand. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Comment Officials welcome the support. 1 Pharmaceutical Solutions’ submission is supported by Julie Jones (President of the New Zealand Association of Clinical Research), Brandon Capital and the Medical Research Commercialisation Fund (MRCF), Edward Watson (CEO of Middlemore Clinical Trials), Barney Montgomery (CEO of Optimal Clinical Trials), Richard Stubbs (CEO of P3 Research), and Mike Williams and Simon Carson (CEOs of Pacific Clinical Research Network). 54 Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Long-term sustainability is important Submission (EY) The R&D tax credit regime needs to be sustainable from a fiscal and cost management perspective, which includes compliance costs on claimants and administrative costs for Government. The submitter supports measures that aim to maintain the regime’s sustainability over time. We support the broad direction of the tax reforms in the Bill because simplifications in administration are positive for the tax system as a whole. Comment Officials welcome the support and agree that sustainability is important. The R&D tax credit rules already contain a number of integrity measures. The proposed refundability cap is also aimed at ensuring the sustainability of the regime. The systems and processes for claiming the credit have been designed so that wherever possible compliance and administrative costs are minimized while still ensuring the continued integrity and sustainability of the regime. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Support for stakeholder engagement on proposals before Bill introduced Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Submitters appreciated the consultation undertaken prior to the introduction of the Bill, as it means that we have already had the chance to provide feedback on the R&D proposals in the Bill. It has been a constructive process and we have found it particularly useful to understand officials’ specific concerns behind the proposals. This understanding has helped us address these concerns directly and to work with officials to find solutions. Comment Officials welcome the support. 55 Recommendation That the submission be noted. 56 REFUNDABILITY (Clause 101 (proposed new sections LA 5(4B), (5B) and (5C))) Issue: Support for broader refundability Submission (EY, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, NZRise, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, New Zealand Technology Industry Association, PwC, KPMG, Pharmaceutical Solutions) Support broader refundability because it is a necessary incentive for firms in loss, or with insufficient tax to pay, to participate in the regime and increase their R&D activity. It will also help the Government reach its goal of increasing New Zealand R&D expenditure to two percent of GDP over the next ten years. Comment Officials welcome the support. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Support for refundability cap Submission (EY, KPMG) Support having the cap. (EY, KPMG) While some businesses may not be able to receive refunds of all their R&D tax credits because of the cap, the cap is nevertheless a reasonable approach to ensure the integrity of the regime is maintained. (EY) Comment Officials welcome the support. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 57 Issue: Changing the name of the cap Submission (Matter raised by officials) The name of the cap should change from “payroll-tax based cap” to “refundability cap”. The references to “payroll” in the components of the formula for the cap should, where appropriate, just refer to “tax” (and not refer to payroll). Comment Officials recommend the name of the cap be changed from “payroll-tax based cap” to “refundability cap” because the current name may cause confusion. Changing the name to “refundability cap” better reflects that the cap applies to R&D tax credit refunds and is made up of the total PAYE, ESCT and FBT paid by a claimant 2 in a given income year. The same changes should be made to the components of the formula, so that instead of referring to “payroll” they just refer to “tax”. That is, the relevant components of the formula should be “own tax”, “other wholly-owned tax”, and “other controller tax”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Contractors and sweat equity Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, PwC) A payroll tax-based cap is not appropriate, because start-up businesses often use sweat equity or contractors (and do not opt into voluntary withholding) instead of hiring employees. These businesses may not pay payroll taxes. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, PwC) A cap is unnecessary because: • the credit is largely only available for work performed in New Zealand. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) • there are sufficient integrity measures in place to prevent fraud, such as in-year approval. (PwC) 2 Grouping rules may also apply to allow a claimant to include amounts of tax paid by a member(s) of their wholly-owned corporate group, and/or an entity that controls the claimant, in certain circumstances. 58 If the Government is not willing to remove the cap, then a solution would be to extend it to include the tax effect of contractor payments not already subject to schedular tax. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment The Bill seeks to broaden access to refundable research and development (R&D) tax credits so that more businesses with insufficient tax liability are able to access support for their R&D expenditure sooner. Without refundable R&D tax credits, firms in a tax loss position or with insufficient income tax liability would be unable to benefit from R&D tax credits for some time, which would reduce the incentive for these firms to perform additional R&D. The provisions introduced by the Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Act 2019 earlier this year currently allow some businesses to have their R&D tax credits refunded. The rules that currently apply to refundable tax credits, including the corporate eligibility and wage intensity tests, significantly constrain the number of firms that can access this part of the scheme. The value of the tax credits that can be refunded is also capped at $255,000, although any unused credits can be carried forward. The objective of the R&D tax credit is to support as much genuine R&D as possible while maintaining the integrity of the tax system. This objective has informed the design of the broader refundability rules proposed in the Bill. The Bill proposes to replace the current refundability rules with a single measure which would cap the maximum amount of R&D tax credits paid out to the total amount of PAYE, fringe benefit tax (FBT), and employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) paid in the same income year by the claimant business. PAYE includes schedular payments deducted from contractors’ pay. The cap would apply at the group level. That is, the cap can include amounts of PAYE, FBT, and ESCT paid by firms the claimant is controlled by, and firms in the same wholly-owned corporate group as the claimant (subject to a double dipping rule, which prevents the same amount of tax counting towards more than one claimant’s cap). The cap would not apply to credits claimed by levy bodies, or that relate to eligible R&D expenditure on approved research providers. The proposal would take effect for the R&D tax credit regime from the 2020−21 income year (“year 2”). Officials consider a refundability cap necessary to ensure the continued integrity and sustainability of the R&D tax credit regime. It is widely recognised that paying refunds through the tax system increases the risks of fraud. This has been the experience of overseas jurisdictions that offer refundable tax credits, as well as other parts of the New Zealand tax system (such as GST refunds). To counter this risk, all countries that offer refundable tax credits have put in place additional integrity measures. It is common to limit the amount of refund with reference to tax paid by a claimant business. For example, the UK initially had a payroll-type cap on refundability but removed it. After this they experienced large amounts of R&D tax credit fraud. The UK is now looking to reinstate their cap − earlier this year HM Treasury and HM Revenue & Customs released a consultation document Preventing abuse of the R&D tax relief for SMEs. 3 3 Available at https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/preventing-abuse-of-the-rd-tax-relief-for-smes 59 New Zealand officials discussed our proposal to broaden refundability from year two of the regime with UK officials. UK officials recommended that we introduce the proposed style of refundability cap because it is an effective and efficient deterrent of fraud, and because it is more difficult to introduce a cap once a regime has had uncapped refundability. Officials considered and discarded other options to manage the increased risks of fraud associated with refundable tax credits including: • allowing chartered accountants or lawyers to certify that a claimant has a tangible economic presence in New Zealand instead of imposing a refundability cap; and • a minimum threshold below which claims would be automatically approved. It was considered that these options could increase complexity and compliance costs as well as administrative costs. In addition, they did not fully address risks associated with refundability. The proposal to limit refunds by the amount of labour-related taxes paid by a business provides a measure of tangible economic presence. This ensures that refunds are only paid to businesses undertaking genuine R&D in New Zealand. The proposed cap is easy for businesses to calculate, thereby providing them with certainty about their claim. It is also simple for Inland Revenue to administer, thereby reducing administrative costs so that effort can be focussed on assessing claims. Officials acknowledge the cap may mean some R&D performers do not fully benefit from the tax credit. Modelling of the potential impact among current Callaghan Innovation Project Grant recipients indicates the number of affected firms will be small. Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand has suggested the cap include the tax effect of contractor payments. This would impose an additional administrative and compliance burden for both Inland Revenue and businesses. The burden associated with calculating the tax effect of payments to potentially multiple contractors per claim, and cross-checking this against the amount claimed by each business, is significantly greater than that imposed by the cap as currently proposed. With respect to the point about sweat equity, officials note that this is not eligible for the R&D tax credit because the credit is based on actual expenditure incurred. For the same reason, that it would be difficult to verify, officials do not support its inclusion in the cap. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to include it in the calculation. The R&D tax credit will provide substantial support for businesses’ R&D, but it is not the only measure available to support businesses to increase their investment in R&D. Businesses that may not be eligible for the credit because they spend less than $50,000 a year on R&D (so do not satisfy the minimum threshold), or who are in a tax loss position but have no employees (and therefore cannot access refundable tax credits) may be eligible for R&D grants provided by Callaghan Innovation. This includes the following grants: • Getting Started Grant: provides a grant for forty percent of eligible expenditure up to $5,000. • Project Grant: provides a grant for forty percent of eligible expenditure up to $800,000, and then twenty percent after that. The Callaghan Innovation grants not only offer higher rates of co-funding than the tax credit, but also provide businesses with wrap around support. This includes access to advisory services and Callaghan Innovation’s research and technical experts. MBIE has commenced 60 a review of the wider funding landscape to ensure that these other forms of support complement the R&D tax credit. Officials will also ensure the refundability cap is reviewed as part of the five-yearly evaluation of the R&D tax credit regime. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Cashing out non-refundable year one credits in year two Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The refundability of non-refundable credits carried forward from year one of the regime to year two needs to be clarified. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) If the proposed new refundability cap (based on payroll taxes) applies to credits carried forward from year one to year two, then year one payroll taxes should be included when calculating the cap on refunding credits carried forward from year one. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Comment If a claimant in loss (or with insufficient income tax payable to use up its R&D tax credits) cannot refund all of its R&D tax credits in year one, then the claimant can carry forward its non-refundable credits to year two of the R&D tax credit regime. The policy intent is for these year one credits to then be refundable in year two, provided the total number of credits in year two (including any year two credits) does not exceed the total PAYE, ESCT and FBT paid for year two. Officials agree, however, that allowing PAYE, ESCT, and FBT paid in year one 4 to be taken into account in year two when determining the refundability of year one credits brought forward to year two is sensible. Allowing year one taxes paid to be taken into account in year two would allow claimants to benefit from the scheme more in the first two years of the regime. It is in line with the regime’s goal of incentivizing R&D activity. Officials recommend that this rule apply for year two only. That is, in year three, only year three PAYE, ESCT, and FBT paid will be included in the year three refundability cap, even if non-refundable credits are brought forward from prior years. Officials recommend that guidance is published on how the proposed new rules would apply to credits brought forward from year one. 4 Also taking into account any taxes paid that qualify through the proposed new refundability grouping rules. These allow PAYE, ESCT, and FBT paid by members of a claimant’s wholly-owned corporate group, or by entities that control the claimant, to be included in the cap in some circumstances. 61 Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 62 WIDER R&D SUPPORT MECHANISMS Issue: Wider R&D funding landscape Submission (EY, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, NZRise, Pharmaceutical Solutions, New Zealand Technology Industry Association, PwC) The R&D Tax Incentive must be considered in combination with a wider package of initiatives to drive innovation in New Zealand. Together, these measures have the potential to help drive innovation, productivity, and economic growth. (EY, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The definition of R&D in the R&D tax credit rules excludes virtually all commercial software development. Growth Grants are ceasing soon, so will no longer be available to support software R&D. (NZRise, New Zealand Technology Industry Association) Other initiatives in the package could better target areas of the economy that do not necessarily fit easily into the R&D tax credit regime, including: • Software development. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, New Zealand Technology Industry Association) • The digital economy. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) • Start-ups and small-medium sized businesses. (New Zealand Technology Industry Association) • Charities. (PwC) • Clinical trials undertaken by global businesses in New Zealand. (Pharmaceutical Solutions) The Government should continue to engage with the industry and undertake a broad education campaign to ensure businesses are aware of the range of options available beyond tax credits. The Bill presents the Government with an opportunity to: • make it easier to identify the various grants and other support mechanisms (like the tax credit) that are available to encourage and support firms making investments in R&D; • grow innovative new businesses; and • clearly demonstrate to innovative firms how each piece of Government support for R&D is interlinked (in a manner similar to Hong Kong). (New Zealand Technology Industry Association) Comment MBIE has commenced a review of the wider funding landscape, to ensure that other forms of support such as Callaghan Innovation grants complement the R&D Tax Incentive. 5 5 For more information on Callaghan Innovation grants, refer to the section of this report on contractors and sweat equity. 63 Officials recognise that education is critical to increasing business awareness, especially amongst small-medium sized enterprises. Callaghan Innovation has received additional funding to deliver an education and engagement programme to raise awareness of the tax credit and support high quality applications. Callaghan Innovation is New Zealand’s innovation agency, and one of its core functions is to educate businesses about the benefits that R&D creates for businesses. Callaghan Innovation also supports businesses who wish to increase their investment in R&D. Officials note that online guidance is available, which addresses the eligibility of software development. The guidance provides examples of software development expenditure that may be eligible for the credit. 6 Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Tax barriers to innovative activity Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) There are existing barriers to innovation in the tax system. These issues include the deductibility of feasibility and black hole expenditure, and the tax loss carry-forward rules. Addressing these issues would help encourage innovative activity in New Zealand. Comment Officials recognise that these issues may present barriers to innovative activity, and that addressing them would help encourage innovative activity in New Zealand. These issues are on the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 6 Note that there is also a specific section of this report regarding submissions on the eligibility of software for the R&D tax credit. 64 TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY EXCLUSION (Clauses 106 and 107 (proposed new sections LY 3(2)(f) and LY 8(2B)) Issue: Entities that derive small amounts of exempt income should be eligible Submission (EY, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) The proposed exclusion may apply more broadly than intended because it extends to all entities that receive any exempt income (other than from dividends). As currently drafted, the exclusion prevents some businesses from claiming the credit, even though they only receive small amounts of exempt income and otherwise sit within the tax system. This is inconsistent with the policy intent. (EY, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) There are various provisions under which otherwise taxpaying entities or individuals may receive exempt income. Receiving income that is exempt under such provisions should not make a potential claimant ineligible. These sections include: • CW 1: Forestry companies established by the Crown, Māori owners, and holding companies acquiring land with standing timber from founders. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) • CW 1B: Treaty of Waitangi claim settlements – rights to take timber. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) • CW 2: Forestry encouragement agreements. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) • CW 3: Forestry companies and Māori investment companies. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) • CW 26: Jurors’ and witnesses’ fees. (KPMG) • CW 27: Certain income derived by transitional residents. (KPMG) • CW 28: Pensions. (KPMG) • CW 34: Compensation payments. (KPMG) • CW 53: Distributions from complying trusts. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG) • CW 55: Māori authority distributions. (KPMG) • CW 55BAB: Rebates of fees paid by FIFs. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) • CW 55B: Amounts of exempt income from partners. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG) • CW 58: Disposal of companies’ own shares. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG) • CW 59C: Life reinsurance outside New Zealand. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) 65 There needs to be flexibility for the Commissioner to disregard the tax-exempt entity exclusion where the exclusion would prevent businesses that are not the target of this reform from claiming the credit. (EY) A more targeted approach should be taken to appropriately exclude specific entities. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG) Prefer a more targeted approach to excluding exempt income entities. An alternative rule is excluding “a person whose main source of income is exempt income”. (KPMG) Comment Officials agree that the legislation as currently drafted has some overreach, so does not satisfy the policy intent. The policy intent is for businesses that receive exempt income (such as lines company dividends) but otherwise pay tax to be eligible for the credit. Officials recommend the legislation is amended so that the exempt entity exclusion is more targeted, rather than being a blanket exclusion that prevents any recipients of exempt income from receiving the credit. Officials prefer this targeted approach which provides more certainty to business and reduces both compliance and administrative costs. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Rationale for tax-exempt entity exclusion acknowledged Submission (EY) The submitter acknowledges the rationale for making tax -xempt entities (such as charities) ineligible for refundability and from the R&D tax credit as a whole. Comment Officials welcome the support. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Eligibility of charities Submission (Deloitte, KPMG) 66 Some organisations, such as social enterprises, have eligible R&D activities but are tax exempt. It would be useful to review the tax exempt exclusion to ensure these organisations are not disadvantaged from participating in R&D. (Deloitte) Charities should be eligible for the R&D tax credit and refundability. The fact that they are not “income” taxpayers does not alter the logic for their entitlement to the credit. The R&D tax credit is delivered through the tax system because it is agnostic to activities and businesses. Any changes to the eligibility of charities should be subject to the full Generic Tax Policy Process and public consultation, with changes applicable only from the 2021−22 income year onwards. Bypassing this wider consultation raises serious questions about the process followed for such a fundamental change to the scope of the R&D tax credit regime. (KPMG) Comment Throughout the policy development process of the R&D tax credit officials have signalled that it was uncertain whether charities and other social enterprises would be eligible for the R&D tax credit. The Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Act 2019 introduced provisions that allow charities to claim the R&D tax credit in year one of the regime, but does not provide charities with any way to cash-out their credits. This makes the credits effectively unusable for charities because they do not pay income tax (and non-refundable credits can only be used to offset a claimant’s income tax payable, with any remaining credits able to be carried forward to the next income year only if shareholder continuity requirements are satisfied). This means that while charities can claim the credit in year one, they cannot benefit from the credit unless changes are made to the refundability rules for charities. Officials engaged with charities and other tax-exempt entities at various workshops early this year, where the current eligibility of these entities for the credit was expressly discussed. Officials made it clear to participants that the eligibility of charities for the credit from year two of the regime was under consideration, and that it was possible they would not continue to be eligible for the regime (and that they may never be able to cash out any credits claimed in year one). Charities do not pay income tax and receive additional Governmental support in the form of GST concessions, an exemption from FBT, and the donor tax credit regime. Tax-exempt entities such as charities sit outside the tax system, so it is not appropriate for them to also benefit from incentives provided from within the tax system. This approach was reflected in the initial uncertainty of charities’ eligibility, which has been communicated by officials to tax-exempt entities. The proposed new tax-exempt entity exclusion does not extend to associates or entities controlled by a tax-exempt entity. This means that from year two of the regime, tax exempt enterprises will be able to continue accessing the credit through their wholly or partially- owned subsidiaries, provided they do not register these subsidiaries as charities. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 67 Issue: Credits carried forward by excluded entities and definition of levy body researcher Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Support the amendment to section LY 8, which ensures that tax-exempt entities ineligible from year two will not be able to carry forward their year one R&D tax credits. Also support the proposed definition of levy body researcher in section YA 1. Comment Officials welcome the support. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Eligibility of Māori enterprises Submission (Deloitte) The tax-exempt entity exclusion highlights the challenges faced by some Māori enterprises that may have eligible R&D activities but be tax exempt. It would be useful to review the credit to ensure Māori enterprises are not disadvantaged from participating in R&D because of a lack of legal recognition of organisations using business models to address social and environmental issues. Comment Officials understand that there is some concern that Māori enterprises may be ineligible for the credit because they are charitable or may have charitable entities within their group structure. Officials have already reviewed the proposed tax-exempt entity exclusion to ensure it does not prevent Māori enterprises from accessing the credit. This review included discussions regarding the proposed exclusion with both internal and external experts on Māori enterprises, charities, and subpart CW of the Income Tax Act 2007. Under section CW 42 of the Income Tax Act 2007, income derived by a tax charity is tax exempt. “Tax charity” is defined to include registered charities and unregistered charities that carry on business for (or for the benefit of) a registered charity. From 1 April 2020, a new tax provision is coming into force which means an entity will only be able to use the section CW 42 tax exemption if the entity is a registered charity. This is the case even where the entity is wholly owned by a registered charity. This means that entities owned by charitable, tax-exempt Māori enterprises will soon have the flexibility to choose whether the CW 42 tax exemption will apply to them. 68 The proposed new tax-exempt entity exclusion does not extend to associates or entities controlled by a tax-exempt entity. This means that from year two of the regime, tax exempt enterprises will be able to continue accessing the credit through their wholly- or partially- owned subsidiaries, provided they do not register these subsidiaries as charities. 7 Recommendation That the submission be noted. 7 Although note that similar to other potential claimants of the credit, Māori enterprises would still need to ensure that they or their subsidiaries seeking to claim the credit do not receive tax-exempt income under any of the other provisions in subpart CW of the Income Tax Act 2007 that come within the proposed new tax exempt entity exclusion. 69 ADMINISTRATION Clauses 105, 122, 123, 128, 145 (sections LY 1, 46, 108, 113E, and 138E) Issue: Timeframe for completing disputes process Submission (EY, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Support the amendment about the timeframe for completing the disputes process. Comment The proposed amendments to sections 108(1E) and 113E of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will allow the Commissioner to adjust a person’s R&D tax credit claim upwards if the person has initiated the disputes process through issuing a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) before the earlier of: • four months of filing their income tax return; or • a year after their income tax return due date. The legislation currently requires a person to complete the disputes process within a year of their income tax return due date. The policy intent is for the person to initiate the process within the earlier of their income tax return due date or four months of filing the return, but not for the person to have to complete the disputes process within this timeframe. Therefore, the proposed amendments would ensure the legislation satisfies the policy intent. Officials welcome the support. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Challenging the Commissioner’s decisions Submission (EY, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Support the amendment about challenging the Commissioner’s decisions. (EY, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) There should be transparency as to why an application might be declined in respect of applications to exceed the $120 million cap. Officials should work closely with an organisation to determine whether the Commissioner might apply her discretion. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) 70 Comment The Bill proposes an amendment to prevent a person from challenging the Commissioner’s decisions regarding the pilot approval scheme and exceeding the $120 million eligible expenditure cap. The amendment brings these parts of the R&D tax credit regime into line with other Commissioner decisions regarding R&D, such as whether an entity can be an approved research provider, the in-year approval of activities that will apply from year two, and whether an entity can be an R&D certifier. This amendment does not prevent a person from applying for judicial review of the Commissioner’s decision. Officials welcome the support for this amendment and agree that there should be transparency regarding why an application to exceed the $120 million cap might be declined. Officials recommend that guidance be published on the process involved in applying the exceed the $120 million cap, so that potential applicants understand what is required and can prepare their applications accordingly. As with other parts of the R&D tax credit regime that involve the Commissioner exercising discretion, officials will contact each applicant before their application is declined. They will also provide applicants with the opportunity to supply additional information in support of their applications, before they are declined, if appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Allocating credits to joint venture members Submission (EY, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, We support the amendment regarding allocating credits to joint venture members. (EY, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The amendment ensures the rules are in line with how joint ventures operate in practice. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Comment The Bill proposes an amendment to correct the allocation of R&D tax credits claimed for R&D activities performed by joint ventures, so that these credits are allocated in accordance with members’ interests in the joint venture (rather than members’ interests in the income of the joint venture, which is impractical for joint ventures that do not derive income). Officials welcome the support. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 71 Issue: Cost of claiming credits Submission (New Zealand Technology Association, Red Crater Software) Concerned that the R&D tax credit claims process may have excessive compliance costs for businesses. (New Zealand Technology Association, Red Crater Software) The administrative and compliance costs of the R&D tax credit currently outweigh its value. Instead of the current R&D tax credit claims process, it would be faster and easier if a representative worked through only the most necessary information required one-on-one with us, either in person or on the phone. (Red Crater Software) Since in-year payments are not available under the R&D tax credit but are available under the existing Callaghan Innovation grants regimes, businesses are more likely to perceive that the credit has high compliance costs. (New Zealand Technology Association) Comment Officials recognise that there will be compliance costs associated with claiming the R&D tax credit, but compliance costs need to be balanced against the need for integrity and sustainability. The credit has been designed with various integrity measures to help ensure the credit’s sustainability. Some of these measures mean claimants will be required to provide the Government with information as part of the claims process. The intent is that claimants should only be required to provide information they would generate as part of their usual business processes wherever possible. This may involve claimants assembling the information required to make an R&D tax credit claim but should not require the creation of new information just to satisfy the requirements of the R&D tax credit regime. Recommendation That the submission be noted, subject to officials’ comments. 72 ENTITY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA (Clause 106 (section LY 3)) Issue: Tertiary education organisation exclusion Submission (Matter raised by officials) The legislation should be amended so that it is clear that foreign tertiary education organisations are ineligible for the credit, regardless of whether they are registered in New Zealand. Comment The legislation as currently enacted should exclude foreign tertiary education organisations but officials agree that it should be amended so that it is clear they are ineligible. This exclusion should include the organisations themselves, entities they are directly or indirectly controlled by, and entities they are associated with. This amendment would apply from year one of the regime (so from the 2019−20 income year), so that it can be incorporated into the processing and administration of year one claims. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Fixed establishment and in-business requirement Submission (Pharmaceutical Solutions) The general entity eligibility criteria for the credit are too narrow, so make it harder to qualify for the credit when compared with the Australian R&D tax credit regime. The Australian regime only requires foreign claimants to have at least one resident director and allows a business to be eligible even if it only has a virtual presence. This is an easy requirement to meet. On the other hand, the New Zealand regime requires foreign claimants to have a fixed establishment and operate a substantial business in New Zealand. This currently does not occur with clinical trials, which means that many foreign companies that run clinical trials in New Zealand will not be able to access the credit. The credit should be available to foreign businesses with no fixed establishment or substantial business in New Zealand, because the R&D these businesses do in New Zealand through clinical trials provides the same benefits and spill-over effects to New Zealand. Clinical trials are considered the backbone of R&D in the life sciences industry. 73 Comment Officials have met with and discussed New Zealand’s R&D tax credit regime with officials from other jurisdictions as part of the policy development process. The New Zealand regime has been designed with integrity and sustainability in mind, taking into account issues that have arisen in other jurisdictions. Officials consider the fixed establishment and in-business requirements necessary to help ensure the continued integrity and sustainability of the regime. Removing these requirements would potentially enable claimants with little presence in, or connection with, New Zealand to claim the credit. Claimants with no fixed establishment in New Zealand are unlikely to pay income tax in New Zealand, so would need to receive refundable credits to derive any benefit from the R&D tax credit regime. Refunding credits to such claimants is particularly risky because the claimants’ lack of New Zealand presence would make it difficult to ensure any overpaid refundable credits are paid back to the Commissioner (for example, if a fraudulent or excessive claim is made that is later reassessed downwards). Officials note that there are benefits to clinical trials being undertaken in New Zealand but consider that support might be better targeted through other mechanisms such as grants. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Excluding Growth Grant recipients Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The inclusion of an association test means that shareholders in a company that receives a Growth Grant are ineligible for the R&D tax credit regime for the remaining duration of the Growth Grant scheme. There are enough measures within the R&D tax credit rules already to prevent double dipping – this additional exclusion is unnecessary. The exclusion creates a significant area of ineligibility that was not previously included when the Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Act 2019 was first introduced, nor was it submitted on or covered in the officials’ report on that legislation. We prefer removing the association rule to a grandfathering approach (which officials have previously indicated to the Corporate Taxpayers Group is their preference, should a change be made), because a grandfathering rule would be unnecessarily complex. It does not make sense for eligible R&D undertaken by an entity to become ineligible when it later makes a separate investment into an entity which receives a Growth Grant. This change prevents access to capital needed by innovative firms, because it discourages recipients of R&D tax credits from investing in Growth Grant recipients as doing so means 74 they can no longer access R&D tax credits. This may limit the extent to which companies are prepared to invest in Growth Grant recipients and the growth of Growth Grant recipients. An announcement or other action should be taken to provide comfort to affected taxpayers that this rule will be amended, before the Select Committee reports back on the Bill. This will enable affected businesses to know whether they will be eligible for the regime, and if so, whether they should be keeping records of their R&D to meet the requirements. It is not practical for these businesses to have to wait until Select Committee reports back to find out whether they will be eligible because: • the regime already applies for affected businesses in the Corporate Taxpayers Group; • a significant amount of work is required to bring businesses up to speed with the R&D tax credit rules; and • the credit has contemporaneous documentation requirements. Comment A person cannot currently claim the credit if they: (i) receive a Callaghan Innovation Growth Grant; (ii) are directly or indirectly controlled by a Growth Grant recipient; or (iii) are associated with a Growth Grant recipient. The Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Bill as introduced only contained the rule in (i) above, with rules (ii) and (ii) introduced at Select Committee. These two additional limbs were introduced to prevent Growth Grant recipients from artificially structuring so that they could claim both the credit and the Growth Grant at the same time. The policy intent is that a person can only claim either the credit or the Growth Grant, because the credit is intended to replace the Growth Grant regime. Officials acknowledge that adding limbs (ii) and (iii) to the Growth Grants exclusion at the Select Committee stage may have had effects beyond what was intended by the Government. Some businesses may have entered into arrangements in reliance on the Growth Grants exclusion in the Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Bill as introduced, prior to the Select Committee report back on 3 April 2019. While officials recognise that a grandfathering approach involves more complexity than removing the association rule altogether, officials consider the association rule necessary to prevent businesses deliberately structuring themselves so that they can claim both the credit and the Growth Grant. Therefore, officials recommend: • that the rule in the Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Bill as introduced (just limb (i) above) apply before the date the Select Committee reported back, so that businesses who entered into arrangements in reliance on the rule in the Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Bill as introduced can still access the credit; and • that the rule that is currently in place (which includes all three limbs above) apply from the date Select Committee reported back, to ensure businesses cannot structure 75 themselves to get around the Growth Grant exclusion (and claim both the credit and the Growth Grant). Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Callaghan Innovation ineligible for the R&D tax credit Submission (Matter raised by officials) Callaghan Innovation should not be eligible for the R&D tax credit. Nor should entities directly or indirectly controlled by Callaghan Innovation, or associated with Callaghan Innovation be eligible. Comment Callaghan Innovation is a Government agency and is helping Inland Revenue administer the R&D tax credit regime. For the avoidance of doubt, officials recommend a new provision that ensures Callaghan Innovation, entities it controls, and any of its associates cannot claim the R&D tax credit. This amendment would apply from year one of the R&D tax credit regime (the 2019−20 income year), so that it can be incorporated into the processing and administration of year one claims. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 76 IN-YEAR APPROVAL (Clause 127 (schedule 21, sections 68CB, 68CC, and 124ZI)) Issue: R&D certifier approvals and applications Submission (EY, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, PwC) Support the amendments about R&D certifier approvals and applications. (EY, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, PwC) There should be a clear process or framework for those businesses potentially affected by the revocation of their R&D certifier, noting that those businesses would have been responsible and compliant. Therefore, they should not be adversely impacted. (PwC) Comment Officials welcome the support. Officials agree that there should be a clear process or framework for businesses potentially affected by an R&D certifier’s status being revoked. Officials recommend that guidance be published on this issue. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: General approval binds the Commissioner Submission (Matter raised by officials) General approval should be binding on the Commissioner. Comment Binding approval will provide businesses with the certainty that their activities are eligible earlier in the claims process. However, general approval is not currently legally binding on the Commissioner. Therefore, it is possible for the Commissioner to change her view as to whether an activity is a core or supporting activity, even if it has been approved as part of the general approval process. This is contrary to the policy intent, which is for general approval to be binding on the Commissioner. Officials recommend the legislation be amended so that general approval is binding on the Commissioner. This amendment would apply from year one of the R&D tax credit regime (the 2019−20 income year) for the general approval pilot, and from year two of the R&D tax credit regime for general approval once it is rolled out for all customers (from the 2020−21 77 income year), so that it can be incorporated into the processing of relevant year one claims and the administration of the tax credit from year two. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarifying the scope of general approval in relation to supporting activities Submission (Matter raised by officials) Schedule 21, part B does not currently specify that supporting activities are ineligible if they have not been approved. It should be amended to clarify this. Comment Various amendments were made to the Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Bill in response to submissions made to the Select Committee earlier this year. This included an amendment to the scope of general approval. In the Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Bill as introduced, general approval only applied to core activities. At the Select Committee stage, the proposed legislation was amended following submissions requesting general approval be extended to cover supporting activities as well. This was to provide businesses with added certainty that their R&D would be eligible for the credit. A clause equivalent to schedule 21, part A, clause 24 should have been added into schedule 21, part B at the time these other changes were made. Officials recommend that a clause be added into schedule 21, part B to clarify that supporting activities are ineligible if they have not been approved. This amendment would apply from year two of the R&D tax credit regime (the 2020−21 income year), so that it can be incorporated into the administration of the tax credit once in-year approval is rolled out in year two. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 78 Issue: Criteria and methodologies approval mandatory for significant performers Submission (Matter raised by officials) Criteria and methodologies approval (CAM) should be mandatory for businesses that choose to opt out of the general approval regime. Comment From year two of the R&D tax credit regime, all businesses will be required to obtain general approval or, if they qualify, opt into the significant performer regime. A business can be eligible for the significant performer regime if it reasonably expects to have more than $2 million of eligible R&D expenditure for the relevant income year. The significant performer regime is intended to provide large R&D performers with an alternative to the general approval regime, because the compliance and administrative costs associated with obtaining general approval for large amounts of R&D activities may outweigh the benefit of the R&D tax credit for these businesses. It is recognized, however, that businesses who spend significant amounts on R&D will still want certainty regarding their R&D tax credit claims. This led to the creation of the CAM regime, which is optional for businesses in the significant performer regime. Businesses in the significant performer regime can apply for CAM if they want to obtain approval from Inland Revenue that their R&D systems and processes are appropriate for determining the eligibility of R&D activities and expenditure. Without general approval or CAM, businesses in the significant performer regime have no way of knowing for certain whether their activities or expenditure are eligible until they file their income tax and R&D supplementary returns. At recent meetings with the Research and Development Advisory Group (RDAG) 8 and other key external stakeholders, officials were advised that CAM should be mandatory for significant performers. This was for these reasons: • Businesses who opt out of general approval (which is mandatory for businesses that are not in the significant performer regime) but do not have CAM will have no certainty that their R&D will be eligible for the incentive. 9 This is because they will not have general approval and will not have CAM. It is expected that most businesses in the significant performer regime who are legitimately performing R&D will want CAM because of this. • Some stakeholders had always thought CAM would be mandatory and were surprised to discover it was optional. 8 RDAG is made up of representatives from PwC, Deloitte, KPMG, EY, BDO, Fisher and Paykel Healthcare, and Barkers of Geraldine. Officials discussed this issue with RDAG in late August and with other stakeholders in early September. 9 Although note that significant performers do have the option of obtaining general approval for some of their activities, even if they have opted into the significant performer regime. 79 • Businesses in the significant performer regime are required to obtain R&D certificates from R&D certifiers that they have complied with the R&D tax credit rules. Providing an R&D certificate to a business with no CAM involves significantly more work for a certifier, because the certifier would have to: (i) Identify the systems and processes the business has in place; (ii) determine whether these systems and processes would enable compliance with the R&D tax credit rules; and (iii) test samples of the business’s claim to determine whether they satisfy the R&D tax credit rules. On the other hand, if a business has CAM, (i) and (ii) above will have been completed by the R&D core team working with the business as part of the CAM process. Only (iii) would need to be completed by a certifier, who would also be tasked with checking whether the business has complied with their CAM. 10 Therefore, the cost obtaining an R&D certificate is expected to be comparatively greater for non-CAM significant performers. • R&D advisors have indicated that they are comfortable certifying whether businesses have complied with the requirements of their CAM, but that they may not be willing to certify much beyond this because of the risk associated with erroneously providing an R&D certificate to a business who has not complied with the rules. 11 This means it may be difficult to find certifiers willing to provide R&D certificates to non-CAM businesses in the significant performer regime. • Businesses in the significant performer regime who do not have CAM will not have early engagement with officials, which means that more scrutiny will have to be applied later in the claims process. This is not ideal for businesses, because if they have reduced their provisional tax payments expecting to receive a certain amount of R&D tax credits for a given year, the reassessment of their R&D tax credit claim could lead to the imposition of penalties and interest. Officials agree with the points raised by stakeholders. Officials recommend that CAM is amended so that it is mandatory for businesses that opt into the significant performer regime. Officials also recommend that additional guidance is published on CAM and the R&D certifier process. This amendment would apply from year two of the R&D tax credit regime 10 The exact requirements of the CAM process and what will be required of R&D certifiers is still being developed. It is expected that part of checking compliance with CAM will involve looking at samples of activities and expenditure, but that this process would be lighter and significantly more straightforward for businesses with CAM (compared with businesses that do not have CAM). Officials will continue to develop the CAM process to ensure it provides certainty to businesses while still reducing the administrative and compliance costs that would otherwise be associated with these businesses obtaining general approval. 11 An R&D certifier can have its certifier status revoked in a number of different circumstances, including when the certifier provides a certificate to a business who is later found to have committed tax evasion in relation to R&D tax credits. After having certifier status revoked, a firm cannot reapply for R&D certifier status for two years. The Bill contains proposals to extend the circumstances in which the Commissioner can revoke certifier status, so that certifier status can be revoked where a certificate has been provided to a business who has entered into a tax avoidance arrangement for R&D tax credits, or where allowing the certifier to retain their certifier status would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. 80 (the 2020−21 income year), so that it can be incorporated into the administration of the tax credit once in-year approval is rolled out in year two of the regime. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 81 OTHER R&D SUBMISSIONS (Clause 113(5) (schedule 21B, sections LY 2, YA 1 and 124ZH)) Issue: Eligibility of software Submission (NZRise, New Zealand Technology Industry Association) The definition of R&D may exclude a lot of software R&D. It does not incorporate a novelty or innovation test, which currently enables some software R&D to be eligible for the Callaghan Innovation Growth Grant. (NZRise, New Zealand Technology Industry Association) Further consideration should be given to the definition of eligible R&D for software R&D. As it stands, Australia may offer a more favourable environment for software R&D, so this creates the risk of exporting companies shifting their R&D from New Zealand to Australia. (NZRise) New Zealand’s definition expressly excludes elements of the Frascati definition, such as experimental development and activities. Most other jurisdictions use the Frascati definition of R&D. (New Zealand Technology Industry Association) Comment In developing the tax credit and associated policies, such as the transitional arrangements for Callaghan Innovation Growth Grant recipients, the Government has wanted to minimise any disruption to R&D performers. In switching from one scheme to another, however, it is not possible to guarantee that all firms will get the same support as they did with the Growth Grant. There are inherent differences between a tax credit and a grant. Some firms may be entitled to less money under the R&D tax credit, while other firms may be entitled to more than they would have received under the Growth Grant. Overall, the Government considers that the settings within the tax credit will mean that a greater amount of support to a larger number of R&D performers will be provided. Officials consider that the current definition adequately incentivises software development. Widening the definition, such as by introducing a novelty test, would create an easier test and may let in activities of the kind that the Government does not wish to incentivise. Officials have already made changes to the definition from what was originally proposed in the discussion document by dropping the requirement that the R&D is conducted using a scientific method, in order to better accommodate software development. By introducing a novelty test, a claimant could qualify where they have created something “new”, without it necessarily incorporating the degree of difficulty and risk required by the uncertainty concept (that is, being “hard”). New Zealand’s R&D activity definition is based on the Frascati definition of R&D. The Frascati manual provides that for an activity to be an R&D activity, it has to be novel, creative, uncertain, systematic, and transferrable/reproducible. All five of these criteria have 82 to be satisfied. 12 Similar to Frascati, New Zealand’s core activity definition requires the use of a systematic approach, an intention to create new knowledge or things, and the resolution of uncertainty. The New Zealand definition is comparable with definitions used by other jurisdictions including Australia and Canada. Other jurisdictions with a similar R&D activity definition to the one proposed in New Zealand support a considerable amount of software related R&D. Officials expect this outcome in New Zealand, but the credit will not support all software development activities. 13 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Approved research providers Submission (Matter raised by officials) To be eligible to become an approved research provider, an entity must be capable of performing core R&D activities. Comment Under the legislation as currently enacted, an entity can technically apply to become an approved research provider for the R&D tax credit regime if it performs core or supporting activities in New Zealand. Officials are concerned that this is too easy a threshold to meet, as a supporting activity just has to be inextricably linked to a core activity without necessarily involving any scientific or technological uncertainty in its own right. There are benefits associated with being an approved research provider. There is a special rule for expenditure on approved research providers in relation to the proposed new refundability cap. Businesses can also claim expenditure on an approved research provider despite being under the $50,000 minimum threshold. These benefits may make the approved research provider regime an attractive way of getting around the cap or the minimum threshold. Officials therefore recommend that to be eligible to become an approved research provider an entity must at a minimum be able to perform core activities on behalf of R&D tax credit claimants. This amendment would apply from year one of the R&D tax credit regime (the 2019−20 income year), so that it can incorporated into the processing and administration of year one claims. 12 Frascati Manual 2015: Guidelines for collecting and reporting data on research and development, OECD, page 45. 13 Officials note that online guidance is available which addresses the eligibility of software development. The guidance provides examples of software development expenditure that may be eligible for the credit. 83 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Internal software development expenditure Submission (EY, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte) Support the amendment to the definition of internal software development. (EY, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) It would be useful to update the R&D tax credit guidance to include some examples of affected expenditure for clarity. (Deloitte) Comment The Bill proposes an amendment to clarify the definition of internal software development expenditure, to make it clear what expenditure is subject to the $25 million internal software development expenditure cap. Officials welcome the support for this amendment. Officials also recommend updating the guidance to include examples of affected expenditure for clarity. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Eligibility of expenditure on creating depreciable tangible property Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) R&D expenditure that contributes towards the cost of depreciable tangible property should be eligible for the R&D tax credit because it is true R&D expenditure. The R&D regime is intended to incentivise R&D expenditure in New Zealand, but many organisations are finding this exclusion a significant barrier to their entry into the regime. We want to continue working with officials to develop an appropriate rule. Comment R&D expenditure that contributes towards the cost of creating depreciable tangible property is currently ineligible for the R&D tax credit. The rationale for this exclusion is the fiscal risk associated with R&D claimed in relation to creating large assets such as bridges and dams. Despite the exclusion, the cost of creating prototypes can be eligible, as can the depreciation associated with using an asset in subsequent eligible R&D. 84 Officials look forward to continuing to work with the Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte and other stakeholders on this issue. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 85 Other policy and remedial changes 87 REFUNDING OVERPAID PIE TAX (Clause 99) Issue: No symmetry between overpayment and underpayment of PIE tax Submission (David McLay) The proposed changes enhance the over taxation of investors in PIEs by not proposing symmetrical tax treatment for overpayments and underpayments that arise from the use of an incorrect prescribed investor rate (PIR). Current law enables Inland Revenue to impose additional tax on investors who specify a rate that is too low, but do not allow for any refund for investors who provide a PIR that is too high. The submitter proposes a mechanism should be introduced to provide a form of refund for an over-taxed PIE investor and suggests a refundable tax credit for the individual investor to achieve this. Comment The PIE income attributed to an investor in a multi-rate PIE is generally excluded income to the investor. This means that the PIE income is not taken into account when calculating the investor’s income tax liability. Overpaid PIE tax cannot be refunded. However, where tax on PIE income has been underpaid because the investor has notified a rate that is lower than their actual PIR, the PIE income ceases to be excluded income. It is required to be included in the investor’s assessable income and taxed at the investor’s marginal tax rate. A tax credit is given for the PIE tax that has already been paid. Officials agree that a mechanism to provide a form of refund for an over-taxed PIE investor and create symmetry between over and underpayment of tax on PIE income is desirable. However, officials recommend a different mechanism to achieve this than the one suggested by the submitter. This is because mirroring the current legislative treatment of underpayment would in some cases result in inequitable outcomes for the taxpayer. To achieve refundability of overpaid tax on PIE income and symmetry between over and underpayments, officials recommend that a year-end square-up process for all individual investors in multi-rate PIEs is introduced, regardless of whether tax on PIE income has been correctly, over- or under-withheld during the tax year. This square-up would apply the correct PIR to the PIE income to determine the PIE tax payable. The PIE tax that had been deducted during the tax year would be a tax credit against the PIE tax payable. Any refund due or tax payable would be added to the person’s end of year tax position and would either be refunded, payable or reduce the person’s tax payable. This would address any over- or underpayment of PIE tax during the tax year. This recommended square up would mean a change compared to the current treatment for investors who have notified a PIR that is too low. Their PIE income would no longer be subject to their marginal tax rates, but instead to their correct PIR. 88 It is recommended that this change apply from the 2020−21 tax year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 89 WIDENING THE COMMISSIONER’S POWER TO PUT PEOPLE ON THE CORRECT PRESCRIBED INVESTOR RATE (Clause 99) Issue: Support for the proposal Submission (AMP Capital, ANZ, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, Financial Services Council) The submitters supported Inland Revenue being able to correct an investor’s prescribed investor rate (PIR), by advising the investor’s portfolio investor entity (PIE) of the correct rate to apply. A number of submitters caveated their support with specific concerns, which are set out below. Comment Officials welcome the support. The report notes the specific concerns raised by submitters as separate issues. Recommendation That the submitters’ support be noted. Issue: Further widening the Commissioner’s powers to put people on correct prescribed investor rate Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials recommend further widening Inland Revenue’s ability under section HM 60 of the Income Tax Act 2007 so that it can proactively provide PIEs with their investors’ PIRs when Inland Revenue holds sufficient information. Comment Under section HM 60 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Inland Revenue can provide the PIR it considers appropriate for an investor directly to a PIE if Inland Revenue thinks the rate the investor has notified is incorrect. The Bill as introduced widens this ability to include situations when a PIE investor has not notified a rate and has defaulted onto the top PIR of 28%. However, under the new section HM 60 for new members of PIEs, there would have to be at least one incidence of using a wrong PIR for the new investor, before Inland Revenue could determine that the rate used is incorrect and can notify the PIE of the correct PIR. 90 Officials therefore recommend further widening Inland Revenue’s ability to provide PIEs with their investors’ correct PIRs. This would enable Inland Revenue to pro-actively provide PIRs for all investors to the PIE providers where Inland Revenue holds sufficient information to determine the PIR applicable for the tax year. Officials recommend that this change apply from 1 April 2020. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: 1 April 2020 application date should be deferred Submission (AMP Capital, Corporate Taxpayers Group) Submitters sought a deferral of the 1 April 2020 application date of the change, noting that sufficient lead-in time is required for PIE providers to analyse Inland Revenue’s build specification, make IT and system changes and to educate frontline staff. Submitters also noted that PIEs are busy with PIE end-of-year assessments during April of each year and therefore changing investors’ PIE tax rates at this time is not optimal. Comment Officials note that under section HM 60 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Inland Revenue has had the ability to advise PIEs where certain investors appear to be on an incorrect PIR, since the introduction of the PIE regime in 2007. Therefore, the proposed amendments would simply be widening the situations when Inland Revenue was permitted to communicate an investor’s PIR to a PIE. However, officials do recognise that the pre-existing power in section HM 60 of the Income Tax Act 2007 had not been widely used and, as a result, the amendment will require PIEs to make changes to their systems. Inland Revenue is currently engaging with PIE providers about the design of these changes. There are currently a large number of PIE investors who are being taxed at an incorrect PIR. The proposed change would help to address this issue and therefore, benefit a significant number of PIE investors (including KiwiSaver members). Delaying this change would prolong the issue of investors being taxed at an incorrect PIR. Therefore, the earliest reasonably possible implementation date is needed. Officials also note that although the change will apply from 1 April 2020, in practical terms, Inland Revenue is not likely to have sufficient information to determine correct PIRs for the tax year until at least June 2020. Advising PIEs of their investors’ correct PIRs will be actioned after that. Recommendation That the submission be declined 91 Issue: Clarification about liability for under and over paid tax for investors on Commissioner advised rate Submission (AMP Capital, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Financial Services Council, EY) Submitters sought clarity about who would be liable for under or over deducted PIE tax, where the Commissioner had inadvertently advised the PIE to apply an incorrect tax rate. Two submitters noted a PIE investor’s experience is likely to be adversely impacted if the investor were to end up having income tax filing obligations, as a result of an incorrect rate advised by Inland Revenue. (AMP Capital, Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment The proposed change to refund overpaid PIE tax, in this report would mean that all PIE income is subject to an end of year square-up. Where an investor’s PIE income was taxed at an incorrect rate based on information provided by the Commissioner, the over or under paid PIE tax would be squared up at the end of the tax year. If adopted, this proposal would address the concerns raised by submitters. For most investors the square-up would happen automatically and they would not be required to do anything. For investors who are required to file an income tax return for their other income, the PIE income information Inland Revenue holds would be pre-populated into their income tax profile to be available when they file their income tax return. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Increased engagement about operationalisation of proposal Submission (ANZ, Financial Services Council) Noting that the change would have impacts for PIEs’ IT systems and collateral, submitters sought increased engagement from Inland Revenue around the design and operational process for sharing PIR information with PIEs. Comment Inland Revenue is currently engaging with PIE providers on the changes proposed. This engagement will continue with an increased focus on the operational design of the proposal and the practical application of the change. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 92 Issue: Notifying an investor of a change to the PIR Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia New Zealand, Financial Services Council) Inland Revenue should notify a PIE investor where they are being placed on a different PIE tax rate. (Chartered Accountants Australia New Zealand) Another submitter sought clarity about who would be responsible for notifying members that their PIE tax rate had been updated. (Financial Services Council) Comment During the current tax year Inland Revenue has been notifying investors directly where, based on information Inland Revenue holds, it appears they are being taxed at an incorrect PIR. When Inland Revenue begins notifying the PIE directly to change the investors’ PIR, Inland Revenue would also advise the investors that it has instructed their PIE to change their PIR. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Ultimate responsibility for determining the PIR Submission (ANZ, Financial Services Council) Where Inland Revenue had advised a PIE of a tax rate to apply, the investor would still be able to subsequently advise the PIE to apply a different tax rate to the one supplied by Inland Revenue. The submitters recommended that instead Inland Revenue should be responsible for mandating an investor’s PIE tax rate (that is, an investor should not have the ability to advise their PIE to disregard a tax rate supplied by Inland Revenue). Comment Although officials are proposing that Inland Revenue would provide investors’ PIRs to PIEs, the ultimate responsibility for determining whether their PIE income is being taxed at the correct rate should remain with the investor. There will also be some instances where an investor has information relevant to determining their correct PIR that has not yet been made available to Inland Revenue. Therefore, an investor should have the ability to update their PIR in accordance with this additional information. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 93 Issue: Process required where Inland Revenue recommends the wrong rate Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia New Zealand, EY) Inland Revenue should implement a process to allow an investor to notify Inland Revenue where the rate Inland Revenue advised the PIE to apply is incorrect, to avoid the same change being made each year. (Chartered Accountants Australia New Zealand) Another submitter recommended that the PIE should be required to notify Inland Revenue if an investor had subsequently changed their PIR after a rate had been advised by the Inland Revenue. (EY) Comment Under current information provision requirements, the situation envisioned by the submitters is unlikely to arise. PIEs are already required to annually report notified investor rate information to Inland Revenue. Officials consider that this information is likely to be sufficient for Inland Revenue to identify where an investor has subsequently changed their PIE tax rate after Inland Revenue has advised the PIE of a rate to apply. An investor in a PIE has one correct PIR for a tax year. This PIR is determined by the investor’s taxable income and their PIE income for the last two income years before the tax year in which the PIR is to be applied. The PIR can change from year to year, if the investor’s relevant income passes a threshold. If Inland Revenue has the investor’s relevant income information, it will be able to determine the applicable PIR for the investor for the tax year. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Require PIEs to report PIR information to Inland Revenue on a semi- regular basis Submission (EY) PIEs (in particular KiwiSaver PIEs) should be required to report PIRs used by their members to Inland Revenue on a semi-regular basis (monthly or quarterly), to assist Inland Revenue in the earlier identification of incorrect PIR usage. Comment PIEs are currently required to report notified investor rates to Inland Revenue annually. As an investor’s PIR is set with reference to their two prior years’ income, this annual reporting requirement is likely to be sufficient for most existing PIE investors. Therefore, officials consider that the additional reporting burden this recommendation would create for PIEs would likely outweigh its benefits. 94 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Technical drafting issues Submission (EY, Financial Services Council) Submitters raised the following technical drafting issues: (a) The reference to “investor does not have a notified rate” should be replaced with the “investor does not advise a multi-rate PIE of their notified investor rate”, on the basis the current drafting implies the investor has no notified investor rate, when rather they have failed to provide their rate to the PIE. (EY) (b) Rather than referring to a notified investor rate being “inconsistent” with an investor’s PIR, the legislation should refer to the rate as being incorrect. (EY) (c) The current drafting provides that the “Commissioner may notify a multi-rate PIE to apply a rate”. The submitter is of the view the revised drafting makes it less clear that the PIE is required to disregard any earlier rate advised by the investor and must apply the rate advised by the Commissioner. (EY) (d) That the existing drafting only enables the Commissioner to correct a rate notified by the investor, it does not make it clear the Commissioner is able to correct a previous Commissioner-notified rate. (EY, Financial Services Council) Comment “Notified investor rate” is defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to mean a rate notified under section HM 60 or HM 58. Therefore, officials are of the view where an investor has not notified a rate to their PIE then they do not have a notified investor rate, meaning issue (a) does not need to be addressed. In relation to issue (b), by virtue of its definition, it is not possible for a “notified investor rate” to be incorrect even if the rate is different from the investors PIR. Therefore, the current language of “inconsistent” is more appropriate than “incorrect”. Officials agree with the submitters on issue (c). On issue (d), the current drafting allows the Commissioner to correct any incorrect notified investor rate, which includes one that has been notified by the Commissioner. However, officials acknowledge that the use of “notified investor rate” as a nonce term in section HM 60(1) for rates notified by investors could cause confusion, and consider that the clarity of the legislation could be improved. Recommendation That the submissions covering issues (a) and (b) be declined. That submissions (c) and (d) be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 95 Issue: Process for investor being listed in part A of schedule 29 Submission (AMP Capital, Russell McVeagh) To qualify as a PIE an entity must meet the eligibility criteria listed in section HM 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 – this criterion includes requirements as to the minimum number of investors per investor class (section HM 14) and the maximum interest that can be held by a single investor (section HM 15). However, there is an exception to the criteria in sections HM 14 and 15, for investors listed in part A of schedule 29 of the Income Tax Act 2007. For example, as PIEs themselves are listed in schedule 29, this means where a PIE invests in another PIE the above requirements do not need to be met. Currently, an Act of Parliament is required to update schedule 29. The submitter proposes that investors should be able to be added to part A of schedule 29 by way of an Inland Revenue determination or an Order in Council. Comment Although officials note there are some examples where the Income Tax Act 2007 can be amended by Order in Council, to ensure maximum transparency in setting tax laws it is generally desirable for amendments to be made via primary legislation. Therefore, changing the method for updating schedule 29 would raise issues that would require prioritising and resourcing as part the Government’s tax policy work programme. Moreover, as entities are generally included in Part A of schedule 29 by type (for example, the list currently includes all PIEs and life insurers) rather than by organisation, there is unlikely to be a need for the schedule to be frequently updated. Therefore, as omnibus tax bills are regularly progressed through Parliament, officials consider the current setting should not act as a significant impediment to part A of schedule 29 being updated in a timely manner. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Extension of new PIE transitional period Submission (AMP Capital, Russell McVeagh) Generally, where a PIE fails to satisfy certain investment and investor requirements on the last day of a quarter and does not remedy the issue by the last day of the next quarter, it will lose its PIE status. However, section HM 25(3)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that 96 a newly established PIE has six months before failure to meet these requirements will result in the entity losing its PIE status. This is to recognise when a new PIE is established, the investor base may be more concentrated than it typically would be. The submitter seeks for this six month transitional period to be extended to a year, on the basis the length of the transitional period does not reflect the practicalities of establishing a new PIE (with institutional investors typically only meeting quarterly or semi-annually). Comment This submission raises issues that would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Engagement with the managed fund industry about new PIE investment practices would be required to determine whether there is an issue with the current six month transitional period. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 97 TAXATION OF TRUSTS Issue: Remedial amendments to trust rules supported (Clauses 59, 89, 92(1) – (7), 93, 95, 97, 113(16) – (20)) Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The proposed amendments to clauses 59, 89, 92(1) – (7), 93, 95, 97, and 113(16) – (20) are supported. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Residence of co-trustees as a single notional person (Clause 87) Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) The proposed amendment should be included in subpart YD of the Income Tax Act 2007. The proposed amendment is a departure from the common law position and should be consulted on. (Chartered Accountants Australian and New Zealand) The relevant provision should be: • reconsidered for whether it applies the correct test of residence; • included in Subpart YD rather than in Subpart HC of the Income Tax Act 2007; • the commencement date should be deferred; and • the consequential impacts should be further considered. (KPMG) Comment Residence of the trustee We agree with submitters that the trustee is not necessarily the only determining factor for taxation of trustee income of a trust. However, residence is an important factor for the taxation of New Zealand-sourced income as well for compliance with assessment obligations because: 98 • the trustee of the trust is the person responsible for calculating and satisfying the income tax liability; • residence of the trustee is relevant for the determining if certain tax credits can be used in satisfying the income tax liability of the trustee; and • payers of passive income need to know the residence status of an investor to determine the correct tax rate (for example, is the passive income subject to resident withholding tax or non-resident withholding tax). It is necessary for a trustee to determine their tax residence because, under the global/gross framework for calculating taxable income, New Zealand-sourced income is subject to New Zealand tax and a New Zealand resident is taxed on their world-wide income. The only exception in the trust rules for the global/gross framework is foreign-sourced income derived for an income year by a trustee of a trust that does not have a settlor resident in New Zealand at any time in that year. Residence is also relevant to determining the withholding tax payable on passive income and for the PIE rules. The proposals for residence clarify the law to ensure it is consistent with how the Commissioner applies the current law. Adopting a common law principle instead would put New Zealand out of step with most other jurisdictions including Australia. Officials consider it would also result in more uncertainty. If a trust has a sole trustee, the residence of the trustee is based on the rules in subpart YD. If a trust has co-trustees, we consider it is appropriate to apply the residence rules on the basis that the trustees are a single notional person. We note that co-trustees have always been treated as if they were an individual deriving the trustee income. We agree with submitters that the Commissioner applies the residence test for co-trustees in the same manner proposed in the amendment. The Commissioner has published her view in IS 16/03 and reaffirmed that administrative approach in IS 18/01. We also note that an election can be made to pay New Zealand tax on world-wide trustee income, irrespective of the residence of the settlor or the trustee or any beneficiary of the trust. Officials consider the comments made by the submitters in referring to the FATCA rules and common reporting standards are cross-border matters relating to those specific measures and do not affect how New Zealand approaches the taxation of trustee income generally. Effect on withholding taxes The proposed amendments clarify how trustees are to apply the withholding tax rules. The clarification is consistent with the conclusions drawn by the Rewrite Advisory Panel, which concluded that, a trust cannot meet the requirements to be a complying trust of trustee income derived by co-trustees is apportioned to give different (withholding) tax effects based on the personal residence of the co-trustees. Location of the residence rule Officials consider this submission has some merit. However, there are many examples in the Income Tax Act 2007 of definitions that are index entries in Part Y, and which point to the 99 substantive definition within a complex set of rules (for example, many of the definitions within the depreciation rules). Officials recommend that drafters consider either relocating the substantive definition or making an appropriate index entry in Part Y that refers to the substantive definition. Deferral of effective date To clarify, officials wish to point out that the proposed amendment does not apply from the date of enactment. Instead, clause 87 states that this proposed amendment applies to income years beginning after the date of enactment. Our view is that this should result in the proposed amendment applying, in most cases, from the beginning of the 2020−21 income year. Officials consider this is enough time for trustees to advise payers of interest and dividends of the correct withholding tax rate or tax rate (for PIE investments). Consequential impacts The proposed amendments do not deem a trust to be a resident or a non-resident. They apply only to the trustee. It is the trustee (including co-trustees treated as a notional single person) who is responsible for compliance with income tax obligations for trustee income. Officials consider the proposed amendments: • improve the clarity of how the tax residence rules apply to co-trustees of a trust; • are consistent with how the Commissioner has applied the residence rules to trustees since 2016; and • do not affect the taxation of distributions from a trust. Taxation of distributions from a trust remain unchanged as the proposals do not impinge on the factors that determine the nature of a distribution. The four main factors that determine the nature of a distribution are: • the classification of the trust as either a complying trust, a foreign trust or a non- complying trust in relation to the amount being distributed; • the tax residence of the beneficiary; • the source of the distribution from the trust fund; and • the ordering rules which stipulate the order in which distributions from either a foreign trust or a non-complying trust are to be made. Recommendations That the submission that requests a reconsideration of the policy for tax residence of co- trustees be declined. That the submissions that the tax residence rule be included in Part Y be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. That the submissions on the proposed amendments affecting the tax residence of the trust be declined. 100 That the submissions on the effect on withholding taxes be declined. That the submissions on the deferral of the effective date (application date) be declined. That the submissions on consequential impacts be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Corpus (Clause 88) Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, New Zealand Law Society, nsaTax) The proposed amendment should consider the situation of debt forgiveness. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The definition of corpus be reconsidered. (KPMG) The wording of the proposed amendment to section HC 4(1) may create uncertainty as to whether certain amounts are included in the corpus of the trust. Confirmation should be given that debt forgiveness would give rise to corpus under the proposed amendment to section HC 4(1). (New Zealand Law Society) The proposed amendment should include, within the definition of property, money that is loaned to the trustee where the loan is subsequently forgiven by the lender. (nsaTax) Comment Corpus is an amount that is analogous to the capital of the trust and so is intended to consist of property settled on the trust. That capital is applied by the trustee as required in the trust deed to generate income and gains for the purposes of the trust. Under the trust rules, corpus may be distributed tax free. The proposed amendment that an amount included in corpus should be capable of distribution is consistent with the Commissioner’s application of the law. KPMG suggests the proposed amendment is unnecessary. We have consulted with submitters on this point and we now consider that under the general law, an amount can only be distributed if it is capable of being distributed. Therefore, we agree that it is unnecessary for the definition of corpus to state that the amount must be capable of being distributed. In our consideration of the submissions, we noted that a forgiveness of a loan owed by a trustee of a trust is within the technical meaning of “disposition of property”, a defined term for the purpose of the trust rules. As both a settlement and a distribution are defined by reference to the concept of a transfer of value in the Income Tax Act 2007, we reviewed the technical components of the definitions of “settlor” and “distribution” in Income Tax Act 2004. The components of these definitions in the Income Tax Act 2004 were rationalised into a single concept of “transfer of value” in the Income Tax Act 2007 during the rewrite of the trust rules. 101 In the Income Tax Act 2004, a settlement and a distribution include a forgiveness of a loan, because they are included in the definition of “disposition of property” in the Income Tax Act 2004. The rationalisation of these various rules during the rewrite may have obscured this policy. Therefore, we agree that the legislation should be clarified to ensure that a forgiveness of a loan is treated as a disposition of property for both a settlement on a trust and a distribution from the trust. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Drafting relating to trustee income (Clause 89) Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The drafting of clause 89 could be improved by reflecting the exclusion of beneficiary income from trustee income. Comment The proposed amendment is a response to a submission made during the administrative review of trust taxation. The submission identified that certain settlements on a trust would be taxed to the trustee as trustee income, and could not be taxed to the beneficiary, even if the amount of that settlement had been on-distributed to a beneficiary. We consider the proposed amendment is clear that such an on-distribution would not be taxed to the trustee as trustee income. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Source of capital gain (Clause 91) Submission (KPMG, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The efficacy of the rule should be confirmed, and consideration given to whether an equivalent rule is required for capital losses. (KPMG) 102 That the rule should specify how section YD 4 should apply to capital losses. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment Officials consider it is appropriate for the source rules applying for income to be also used to determine the source of a capital gain. A distribution of a capital gain from a trust may be untaxed (distribution from either a complying trust and foreign trust) or taxed (distribution from a non-complying trust). The submissions are primarily concerned with a capital gain included in a taxable distribution made from a non-complying trust to a non-resident beneficiary. This is because if such a taxable distribution is made to a non-resident beneficiary, the beneficiary is taxed only to the extent that distribution is sourced from New Zealand. As the ordering rules require capital losses to be netted off from capital gains, we agree with the submitter that the source of a capital loss should also be determined on a similar basis as proposed for capital gains. We consider that the proposed amendment should be adjusted to reflect this effect. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Taxable distribution not subject to the ordering rule (Clause 91(2)) Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Further consideration should be given to the current interpretation and the scope and application of subpart FC of the Income Tax Act and the wider ramifications of the interpretation underlying the proposed amendment to clause 91(2) of the application of other aspects of the trust rules. Comment The submitter raises two issues: • valuing a distribution at market may result in circularity because there is not a transfer of value from the trustee to the beneficiary (a bitcoin example is used to illustrate the submitter’s point); and • gifted property to a trust would not be a transfer of value to the trust. We agree with the submitter that the purpose of subpart FC of the Income Tax Act 2007 is to tax holding gains on revenue account property when certain transactions occur (for example a distribution of property from a trust, or the making of a gift). 103 In relation to the issue raised about distribution of property, officials note that a recent amendment in section FC 2(4) of the 2007 Act ensures that the valuation of a distribution of property is only for the purpose of determining: • whether the trustee is liable for tax on any holding gains or depreciation recovery on revenue account property being distributed; and • the cost base of the distributed property for the beneficiary (if that property is revenue account property). Under that amendment, the value of distributed property under subpart FC is not considered in determining whether a transfer of value has occurred from the trustee to the beneficiary. We agree this rule should be expanded to ensure that the valuation rules in subpart FC should not apply in determining whether a gift is a settlement on a trust. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Foreign-sourced income of a resident trustee − distributions (Clause 93(1)) Submission (KPMG) The treatment of a distribution of beneficiary income should be confirmed in a Tax Information Bulletin item. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Foreign-sourced income of a resident trustee (Clause 93(1)) Submission (New Zealand Law Society) That the term “trustee income” should be used instead of references to income as for example in section HC 26(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007. 104 Comment In section HC 26 of the Income Tax Act 2007, the term trustee income could be misinterpreted as the provision is about defining when an amount of foreign-sourced income is treated as exempt income for the purpose of calculating taxable income of a trustee. The rule is not about trustee income but about a subset of trustee income. The purpose of section HC 26 is to override the general rule that taxes the world-wide trustee income of a resident trustee. This rule is concerned with: • a subset of trustee income (foreign-sourced income derived by a trustee); • defining the circumstances when that foreign-sourced income is not included in the calculation of the trustee’s taxable income. Although the foreign-sourced income referred to is also included in trustee income, the concept of trustee income is more relevant for the application of the ordering rules, the nature of a distribution, and for the election to pay tax on world-wide trustee income. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Foreign-sourced income of resident trustees – a trust that has no settlor (Clause 93(2)) Submission (New Zealand Law Society) That the relevant issue is whether any settlor of the trust died or ceased to exist when it was a New Zealand resident, and this can be addressed by amending section HC 25(2)(c). That section HC 25(2)(c) be reviewed in light of the amendment proposed by clause 87 of the Bill (which clarifies the tax residence of co-trustees treated as a notional single person). Comment (Clause 93(2)) A submission received during the administrative review of the taxation of the trust rules noted that the current wording of section HC 26 implies it will apply only in situations where a trust has a settlor. The proposed amendment addresses this submission. The proposed amendment seeks to clarify that the exemption for foreign-sourced income under section HC 26(1) can apply when the trust has no settlor provided that the last remaining settlor of the trust was a non-resident at the time of death or the time it ceased to exist. We consider the proposed wording achieves this objective. 105 Suggested review of section HC 25(2) The general rules for taxing income result in a New Zealand resident being taxed on their world-wide income unless a specific exemption applies. The proposals in clause 87 result in co-trustees being treated as a New Zealand resident (as a notional single person) for the purpose of calculating the income tax liability on trustee income as follows: • if the settlor of a trust is resident in New Zealand, the trustee of that trust will be taxed on their world-wide trustee income for an income year; and • if the settlor of a trust is non-resident, foreign-sourced income derived by the trustee of that trust may be exempted under section HC 26. If the proposals in clause 87 result in co-trustees being treated as a non-resident (as a notional single person), section HC 25 will apply to those trustees only if the trust has a resident settlor. Officials consider these effects are consistent with the application of the law set out in IS 18/01. We note that the New Zealand Law Society also suggests section HC 25(2)(c) should be modified to apply to corporate trustee that has ceased to exist. We agree with this submission. Recommendation That the submission relating to a trust that has no settlor be declined. That the submission to include a reference to non-natural person trustees in section HC 25(2)(c) be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Foreign-sourced minor beneficiary income drafting (Clause 93(4)) Submission (New Zealand Law Society) That the proposed amendment in clause 93(4) is unnecessary. Comment The proposed amendment addresses a matter raised in submissions received during the administrative review of the taxation of trusts. The proposed amendment clarifies that minor beneficiary income that is foreign-sourced does not enjoy the benefit of the exemption for foreign-sourced income derived by a trustee of a trust having only a non-resident settlor. That exemption is intended to apply only to income retained by the trustee (that is, it does not apply to a distribution that is beneficiary income). 106 As a base protection measure, minor beneficiary income is intended to be attributed to the trustee and taxed at the trustee rate. This attribution of minor beneficiary income: • is only for the purpose of ensuring New Zealand tax is paid on that income at the trustee rate; and • ensures that minor beneficiary income is not taxed to the beneficiary. The submitter’s concern likely relates to foreign-sourced income derived and retained by the trustee which is exempt income of the trustee under this rule. We agree with the submitter that a subsequent distribution of that income is likely to be a taxable distribution and would be taxed to the minor beneficiary under the normal source and residence principles. However, for the reasons stated above, we feel that the amendment is necessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Settlement by acts of associates (Clause 94) Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, New Zealand Law Society, nsaTax, Russell McVeagh) The proposed rule should apply only where the person has influence or control over the actions of an associate. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The proposal does not clearly meet the objective and it may expand the definition of settlor significantly and inappropriately. (KPMG) • Clause 94 should be amended so that the proposed amendment specifies which persons must be associated. • Clause 94 should clearly set out which subsection of section HC 27 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is being referred to in the reference to “paragraphs (a) or (b)”. (New Zealand Law Society) The interaction between the proposed amendment for section HC 27(4) and existing section HC 27(6) be clarified by making section HC 27(6) subject to section HC 27(4). (nsaTax) Clause 94 should not proceed as the proposed replacement of section HC 27(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007 would result in a significantly broader definition of “settlor” for income tax purposes. (Russell McVeagh) Comment The Commissioner considers the current provision concerning the treatment of indirect settlements is very broad and overreaches. The objective for the proposed amendment is to 107 limit when a person is treated as a settlor because they have a connection with an indirect transaction that results in a transfer of value to a trust. The purpose of the proposed amendment (as introduced) was to restrict the current rule to transactions where: • a person (person A) controls or influences the actions of another person (person B) for that transaction; and • a result of that transaction is that a transfer of value is indirectly made to a trust. An example of a transaction that is intended to be within the scope of the proposed amendment would be where Person A influences person B to make a gift of property to a company, which is owned 100% by a trust of which person A is a trustee and a beneficiary. The interpretation statement (IS 18/01) notes that the control or influence effect of such a transaction is more likely to occur if the two persons are associated with each other. Officials agree that the wording of the proposed amendment should more clearly reflect the intent of the provision. We have also consulted on this issue with submitters and we agree the proposed amendment is not intended to apply to advice (which could be considered to be influence), for example professional or family advice offered on the establishment of a trust. The reference to paragraphs (a) or (b) grammatically can only be the paragraphs listed in the proposed amendment. However, we note that the submission is likely suggesting that the issue relates more to the reference in the proposed amendment to subsection (2) of section HC 27. Changes made to the proposal relating to control or influence, will render references to paragraphs (a) or (b) unnecessary. We agree that the relationship between subsection HC 27(6) and proposed subsection HC 27(4) be clarified. Recommendations That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Value of deferral and non-exercise (Clause 96) Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, New Zealand Law Society) The rule should apply only where the interest rate is less than market. The relevant rate should be reconsidered. (KPMG) Further work is required to ensure the formula works in a guarantee situation and that officials provide detailed examples to illustrate the application of this provision where financial assistance is provided in the form of a guarantee. (New Zealand Law Society) 108 Comment Officials agree that the prescribed rate of interest at present can be substantially in excess of market rates in some sectors or markets. We consider that the relevant rate should be, as submitted, the lower of the market rate (but cannot be less than zero) or the prescribed rate. Officials consider that the proposed amendment should state that for a guarantee, the guarantee fee should be the basis for determining the amount that is calculated as the transfer of value for a guarantee. An example will be provided in the Tax Information Bulletin on the enactment. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Election to pay New Zealand tax on world-wide trustee income (Clauses 90 and 97) Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, New Zealand Law Society) That a retrospective election should be allowed. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) That an annual notification obligation on non-active trusts is unnecessary and imposes a compliance burden which diminishes the advantage that non-active trust status affords such trusts (clause 97(2)). (New Zealand Law Society) Comment The purposes of the election rule and taxable distribution rules are to encourage people to elect into the complying trust regime at an early stage rather than when a problem or adverse effect arises. We agree with the submission that the tax status of a trust may be fluid. We also note that the ability to elect into the complying trust regime was enacted before the current penalties and interest regimes came into force. We considered the submissions of Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand about: • the interest and penalties regime; and • the fluid nature of family trusts. We discussed this issue with the advisor to the Committee and consider that it would be appropriate to provide the ability to make a retrospective election subject to the following requirements: • the trustee has always been compliant with their New Zealand income tax obligations on New Zealand sourced income; 109 • use-of-money interest is applied on any trustee income derived in prior years not previously taxed in New Zealand; • the date of a change in status of the trust can be identified; • the date from which the election applies must not include any period that is subject to the time bar for amending assessments; • the election changes the status of the trust for future distributions from income derived after the effective date of the election; and • tax payable on distributions made before the date the Commissioner is notified of the election is not affected. Non-active trust The submission is concerned with the situation of a non-active trust, which is a complying trust that derives no income. We agree with the submitter that it is unnecessary for the trustee of a non-active trust to give an annual notice of an election for the trust be a complying trust unless the trust begins to derive income. We consider that the proposed amendment for section HC 33(1B)(c)(i) should not apply to a non-active trust. The proposed amendment applies to trustee of a complying trust if certain technical requirements relating to income derived by the trustee. The amendment is intended to apply to: • a trustee of a trust when a settlor of the trust migrates from New Zealand, which may result in a change to the way in which income of the trust may be taxed or exempted; or • a foreign registered charitable trust. If the trustee of such a trust wishes to have complying trust status, the proposed amendment requires the complying trust status to be notified when the trustee files its annual foreign trust disclosure form. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Taxation of distributions from a trust that has elected to become a complying trust (Clause 97(8)) Submission (New Zealand Law Society) That careful consideration should be given to whether it is appropriate that the ordering rules are applied in the way (provided in the proposed amendment) and whether doing so gives rise to the appropriate outcome in all circumstances. 110 That a detailed analysis of the fact scenarios should be carried out to ensure that the proposed amendments result in an appropriate outcome for a trust which “flips” in and out of being a complying trust under the proposed amendment and for a trust which has suffered losses in some periods over its lifetime. Comment The New Zealand Law Society’s submission on the application of the ordering rules is to the effect that the status of the trust at the date of the distribution should determine the taxation of the distribution because the trust fund is a single fund. We agree this is the policy for a trust that does not change its status during its lifetime. However, this is not the policy for a distribution from a trust that has changed its status, as for example, if a settlor of that trust has migrated to New Zealand and has become a tax resident of New Zealand. The proposed amendment is based on the approach taken under current law for distributions from a trust that was a foreign trust and a settlor of that trust has migrated to New Zealand which taxes distributions based on when the income was derived by the trustee and not just by the date of the distribution. For such a trust, an election may be made within one year of the time the settlor becomes a New Zealand tax resident for all purposes. If the election is made, the trust is treated as a complying trust from the date of the election (settlor migration rule), provided the trustee satisfies their income tax obligations for world-wide trustee income on an ongoing basis. However, under the settlor migration rule, a distribution from the trust after the election is treated as follows: • a distribution of an amount derived by the trustee before the date of the election is treated as a distribution from a foreign trust; and • a distribution of an amount derived by the trustee after the date of the election is treated as a distribution from a complying trust. If the election to be a complying trust is not made that one year period, a distribution from the trust after the election is treated as follows: • a distribution of an amount derived by the trustee before the date of the election is treated as a distribution from a foreign trust; and • distribution of an amount derived by the trustee after the date of the election is treated as a distribution from a non-complying trust; and • in both cases there are may be some technical adjustments to the amount of the distribution to take account of New Zealand tax payable on income derived before the election date. Officials consider that the proposed amendment for the taxation of distributions is consistent with the policy that already applies for a foreign trust that changes its status by electing into the complying trust rules. We also consider that it is appropriate for the ordering rules to be applied for all trusts to determine the timing of when the amount being distributed was derived by the trustee. 111 Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 112 MĀORI AUTHORITY TAX CREDITS (Clauses 104 and 108) Issue: Correction of unintended legislative change in the rewrite of the provision into the Income Tax Act 2007 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) That the proposed amendment is supported. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 113 REMOVAL OF THE REQUIREMENT TO ESTIMATE AT FINAL PROVISIONAL TAX INSTALMENT DATE (Clause 110 and 125) Issue: General support for the measure Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Tax Management New Zealand Limited, EY, KPMG, Deloitte) General support for the removal of the requirement to estimate a taxpayer’s final instalment of provisional tax where they believe their residual income tax will be less than the final instalment amount. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Relationship between sections RC 7 and proposed sections RC 10(5) and (6) should be clarified to avoid the confusion of terms Submission (EY) The drafting as currently worded could pose potential confusion when taxpayers look to apply this section because of the use of terms such as “RIT estimate” with reference to the standard uplift method which could be confused with the estimation method in section RC 7. We recommend that the relationship be clarified. Comment Officials considered that using the term “RIT estimate” was sufficiently different from the use of the term “estimate” in section RC 7, however, on reflection we can see how that wording could create some confusion so drafting will be amended to “expected RIT”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 114 Issue: A subsequent change is required to account for early balance date taxpayers Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) While the removal of the requirement to estimate at the final instalment makes sense there would need to be a subsequent change to sections RC 5(2) and RC 5(3) to account for early balance dates as these sections do not allow taxpayers to use 110% for the final instalment. Comment Officials agree that sections RC 5(2) and RC 5(3) as currently written do not work well for early balance date taxpayers who are unable to use a standard uplift based on 110% of the year preceding the prior year at the final instalment date but yet, because of an extension of time to file their prior year tax return they are unable to use an uplift of 105%. This issue has existed for some time. However, taxpayers who have early balance dates have a significant amount of time to file their tax returns (up to 18 months following their balance date) and, in addition, most taxpayers will generally prefer to base their final instalment under the standard method on their approximation of their RIT for the year as it is from this date that use of money interest will apply to any shortfall which is five weeks after their balance date. To provide more certainty to taxpayers they can make use of other tools to minimise their exposure to use of money interest from this date including using a tax pooling intermediary. Officials consider that to make a special rule around early balance date taxpayers would add significant complexity to the rules and raise integrity concerns. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The practical implications of the change to eliminate estimating the final instalment should be fully considered Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Potentially there may be some practical issues around debt demands issued automatically by START if a taxpayer pays less than the amount calculated under the standard method. We understand no formal estimate will be required so it is not clear how START will know that a payment has been made under section RC 10(4) as opposed to a taxpayer short paying their provisional tax. We recommend the practical implications be fully canvased and the necessary changes (if any) are made to START to prevent any unnecessary angst for taxpayers. 115 Comment Officials have been actively engaged with our technical experts in designing this change. A taxpayer who does pay less than the instalment required under the standard uplift because they believe their residual income tax will be less than what they have already paid will not be able to be identified within START, however, the correct calculation of penalties and interest will occur when that taxpayer files their returns. It may be that notices outlining that a payment has been short-paid may be issued to taxpayers who make a short payment and do not inform us that this has been done under proposed section RC 10(4), however, there is no practical way to identify those payments without increasing compliance costs. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 116 CLARIFYING THE “LESSER OF” CALCULATION FOR STANDARD UPLIFT TAXPAYERS (Clause 109) Issue: General support for the amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, KPMG, Tax Management New Zealand Limited, Corporate Taxpayers Group) Support for the amendment to clarify the “lesser of” calculation for standard uplift taxpayers. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: The proposed amendment should be located in the Tax Administration Act 1994 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The inclusion of the provision clarifying the application of the use-of-money interest (UOMI) rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 is contrary to the principles of the rewrite of the Act and this amendment should be included in the Tax Administration Act 1994. Comment Officials agree that this provision is better placed in the Tax Administration Act 1994 and recommend moving that section to section 120KBB of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 117 REMOVING THE ABILITY FOR PROVISIONAL TAXPAYERS TO ALLOCATE PAYMENTS TO PARTICULAR INSTALMENTS (Clause 126) Issue: Disagree with the proposed amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, Tax Management New Zealand Limited) Removing the ability for taxpayers to choose the provisional tax instalment to which a particular payment is applied is unacceptable and unprincipled. This amendment may unfairly penalise taxpayers by exposing them to additional late payment penalties even though payment has been made on time. Comment In practical terms the ability for taxpayers to allocate provisional tax payments to particular provisional tax instalments has never been available to taxpayers. Neither the heritage FIRST system nor the configuration of the new START platform have had the facility to apply payments to an instalment other than the oldest. However, it is noted that prior to the removal of incremental penalties on income tax it was always more beneficial to allocate payments to the oldest debt to stop incremental penalties being charged. Once those penalties were removed it now gives non-compliant taxpayers the ability to reduce the impact of penalties by applying payments to later instalments. Officials agree that this will be an adverse outcome to those taxpayers who do not pay their provisional tax instalments. Submitters made the point that this would be particularly harsh on taxpayers who inadvertently missed an instalment. However, with the ability to purchase funds from tax pooling intermediaries we consider that taxpayers in the situation where they have inadvertently missed a payment have the ability to correct that issue. To allow those taxpayers who are non-compliant to reduce their exposure to late payment penalties by allocating payments to later instalments is not equitable to those taxpayers who make their payments on time. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 118 Issue: The Government should add a review of the coherence of the interest and penalty rules Submission (EY) While the example given as the justification for the amendment is one of deliberate non- compliance, and we agree in those circumstances that taxpayers should not be able to game the system for advantage in relation to late payment penalties, we are also concerned that the amendment will also apply to taxpayers who under pay because of oversight. We recommend that the Government undertake a review of the coherence of the use of money interest and penalty regime as part of future business tax reforms in that context to ensure that taxpayers who inadvertently under pay, or late pay, provisional tax are not disproportionally penalised because of the way in which Inland Revenue’s systems allocate the payments. Comment For those taxpayers who inadvertently fail to pay instalments there are other options available to them to ensure that no penalties are incurred. The coherence of the use of money interest and penalties regime is always considered when changes are made to the legislation. The practical impact of this change is insignificant as no one has ever allocated payments in such as manner as the legislation allows. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 119 CLARIFYING THE WAY IN WHICH PROVISIONAL TAX INSTALMENTS ARE TRUNCATED TO WHOLE DOLLARS (Clause 110(1)) Issue: General support for the amendment Submission (Tax Management New Zealand Limited, EY, Corporate Taxpayers Group) Support for the amendment to clarify the way in which provisional tax is truncated to whole dollars. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Legislation should be altered to deal with taxpayers who have short paid their instalments by small amounts Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, Deloitte ) The legislation should be altered to deal with taxpayers who have short-paid their instalments by less than $1 to ensure they can still use safe harbour concessions. Comment Officials have recommended that a tolerance be added to the legislation and system to ensure that taxpayers who do underpay their instalments by $20 or less will be deemed to have paid the instalment for the purposes of assessing concessionary rules such as the safe harbour. This is included in the new matters raised at Select Committee section of this report. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Example in the commentary Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The example in the commentary about truncation is incorrect. 120 Comment The example in the commentary is correct according to the calculation in the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Inland Revenue should provide further guidance Submission (EY) Inland Revenue should provide further guidance as to what is required at each instalment to provide greater certainty. Comment Inland Revenue’s technology platform provides taxpayers with clear direction on the amounts that are payable for provisional tax purposes at particular dates. This is via both notices and via taxpayers’ myIR accounts. Taxpayers should be aware from those sources how much they need to pay, by when, and if they have overdue amounts. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: The proposed amendment is in the wrong section Submission (EY) Support the codification of the current practice of truncation within the legislation. However, considers this amendment should be made to section RC 9(2) rather than section RC 10(7). Section RC 10 details the method of calculation for instalments under standard and estimation methods whereas section RC 9(2) clarifies a general principle for the way in which payments are to be divided into instalments. Comment Truncation is important for assessing whether a taxpayer has made the correct payments to make use of concessions within the Tax Administration Act 1994 including the safe harbour rules in section 120KE and the interest concession rules in section 120KBB. 121 Section RC 10 of the Income Tax Act 2007 calculates the amount of each instalment required at each payment date and this is where truncation will apply. We consider that RC 10 is the preferred place to have a rule that applies to the calculation of the instalments. However, after reviewing the way it is proposed that numbers will be truncated officials do recommend some adjustments to the wording in the legislation to reflect this and this is raised below. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The amendment should apply retrospectively to the 2017−18 income year Submission (Tax Management New Zealand Limited) Support the codification of the current practice of truncation within the legislation but believe it should apply retrospectively to the 2017−18 income year, as this is when the safe harbour concession was changed. Comment The submitter is correct that the safe harbour concession was changed to require taxpayers to make their instalments from the 2017−18 income year, however, this rule was not applied in the heritage FIRST system for that year and therefore no one was impacted by this issue for that year. We do, however, agree that for completeness the application date should be made retrospective although note that practically this will not change the outcome for any taxpayers. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 122 Issue: Additional truncation Submission (Matter raised by officials) Truncation takes place at two points when determining the amount of provisional tax instalments. There is a truncation when the uplift is undertaken and also when the uplift amount is divided into thirds. The truncation points are illustrated in figure 1. Figure 1: Provisional tax truncation points Residual Income Tax (dollars and cents) Uplift (5% or 10%) Truncate to whole dollars Calculate instalment Truncate to whole dollars Instalment (whole dollars) Estimate provided by customer Comment The proposed truncation amendment in clause 110(1) should be applied to sections RC 5(2) and RC 5(3) and RC 20 of the Income Tax Act 2007 in addition to RC 10. In the truncation rule in clause 110(1) replace the word “amounts” with “instalments” – this is to ensure that there is no argument that residual income tax should be truncated. All the above have application from the 2017−18 and later income years. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 123 CLARIFYING THE APPLICATION OF LATE PAYMENT PENALTIES APPLICABLE FROM THE FINAL PROVISIONAL TAX INSTALMENT DATE (Clause 130) Issue: Concerned about unintended consequences for a taxpayer who has residual income tax of less than the amount due to settle the liability Submission (Tax Management New Zealand Limited) The submitter had concerns as to how the rule will apply in practice and whether any late payment penalty will take into account any over payments on previous instalments. They consider the wording should be supported by examples. Comment Officials agree that these types of changes are best illustrated with examples and these will be provided with the accompanying Tax Information Bulletin that will be published once the Bill is enacted. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 124 NON-STANDARD PROVISIONAL TAX INSTALMENTS (Clause 129) Issue: Support for the amendment Submission (Tax Management New Zealand Limited) General support for the amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Application date of this clause should be amended Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The application date should be amended to apply to the 2017–18 and later income years. Comment This issue has not arisen in practice as the Inland Revenue computer systems have been applying the rule as if the definition is correct. However, we agree the change should apply retrospectively to the 2017–18 income year, when section 120KBB applied from. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 125 THE EFFECT OF REGULAR AMENDMENTS TO PROVISIONAL TAX Issue: Constant changes provide a negative impact to the provisional tax rules Submission (EY) Broadly support the amendments to clarify the provisional tax rules, but believe the Select Committee should be mindful of the wider impact that regular changes to this regime has and ensure that only those amendments that are sustainable and clearly needed are progressed. Comment We note the submitter’s concerns. However, the majority of the proposed amendments ensure that the legislation matches the administrative practice to provide certainty to taxpayers and these amendments have been necessitated where there are gaps in the legislation. We agree that regular amendments do impact on taxpayer certainty and ensure that only those amendments that are clearly needed to improve certainty should be made. However, in the majority of cases the legislation is catching up to the administrative practice and should have no practical effect on taxpayers. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 126 TAX ADMINISTRATION MATTERS (Clause 134) Issue: Support for permitted disclosure relating to representatives Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Institute of Certified NZ Bookkeepers) The submitters support the proposal to extend the ambit of an existing rule that allows Inland Revenue to disclose information to associations or groups that represent tax agents to also allow Inland Revenue to disclose information to associations or groups that represent “representatives” (including bookkeepers) in the same circumstances. Recommendation That the submission be noted. (Clauses 2(19) and 119 – 121) Issue: Support for remedial amendments relating to the binding rulings regime Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter supports the proposals to: • enable the Commissioner to withdraw short-process binding rulings; and • specify the period that a person can continue to rely on a withdrawn private, short- process, or product ruling in relation to a matter that does not involve an arrangement. Comment The proposed amendments were identified following the enactment of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019, which extended the scope of matters for which the Commissioner could issue binding rulings and introduced a new type of binding ruling – short-process rulings. The proposed amendment includes new section 91ESB of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which would enable the Commissioner to withdraw short-process rulings. This corrects an oversight following the drafting of the short-process rulings provisions, and mirrors existing provisions which allow the Commissioner to withdraw other binding rulings. Binding rulings are generally only withdrawn where there has been a change in the interpretation of the relevant taxation law, or where the ruling needs to be withdrawn and reissued with a variation. 127 The other proposed amendments (to sections 91EI and 91FJ of the Tax Administration Act 1994) provide that where a private, short-process, or product ruling has been withdrawn in relation to a matter that does not involve an “arrangement”, the person to whom the ruling applies can continue to rely on it for the period specified in the ruling. This is consistent with the rules that apply for private, short-process, and product rulings on matters involving arrangements where these rulings still have effect for the applicant (despite being withdrawn) where the applicant has already entered into the arrangement described in the ruling before it is withdrawn. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Clarifications to the legislative drafting for removing tax agents, representatives, and nominated persons Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials recommend remedial amendments to section 124G of the Tax Administration Act 1994 which contains the discretion for the Commissioner to remove a person from the list of tax agents, disallow a person’s status as a representative, and disallow a person as a nominated person. The proposed amendments would ensure the rules operate as intended. Specifically, the amendments would ensure that there is no ambiguity about the effective date a person is removed from the list of tax agents or disallowed as a representative or nominated person. It is intended that before a person is removed as a tax agent (or disallowed as a representative or a nominated person) the Commissioner will be required to consider arguments against the proposed removal (or disallowance) unless the Commissioner considers it necessary in the circumstances to remove the person immediately to protect the integrity of the tax system. For example, this could be the case where the Commissioner becomes aware of a person acting fraudulently and it is necessary to revoke their access from Inland Revenue’s computer systems. In such circumstances it would be inappropriate for the Commissioner to continue to allow the person to act on behalf of others. Officials also recommend a proposed amendment to section 124G(6)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to make it clear that the Commissioner is not required to divulge information that could, for example, be withheld under section 6 of the Official Information Act 1982. The proposed amendment is consistent with the same rules requirements on the Commissioner when she refuses to list a person as a tax agent (see section 124G(5)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994). Officials recommend the proposed amendments apply from the date of enactment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 128 Issue: Clarification to the rules that allow for the self-correction of certain errors in subsequent returns Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials have identified several refinements which can be made to ensure that the rules that enable taxpayers to self-correct certain errors in returns for income tax, fringe benefit tax (FBT) and goods and services tax (GST) operate as intended. The refinements are to address interpretative and practical issues that have been raised with officials since the changes were made to the rules as part of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 earlier this year. The refinements aim to: • Confirm that the $10,000 limit in the materiality threshold test refers to the tax discrepancy caused by the error(s) and not the amount of the error(s). • Ensure that there is no confusion between the application of the thresholds in section 113A (either a tax discrepancy of $1,000, or a tax discrepancy that does not exceed the greater of $10,000 and two percent of the taxpayer’s annual gross income or GST payable for the relevant period) and the self-correction rules for PAYE, RWT and NRWT which have their own rules. • Clarify that multiple errors that do not exceed the new materiality threshold can be corrected, provided the total discrepancy caused by the errors do not exceed the relevant thresholds. Officials recommend the proposed amendments apply from the date of enactment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Self-correction of certain errors in subsequent returns – guidance and changes to the test for GST errors Submission (Deloitte) The meaning of “total discrepancy in the assessment” should be clarified. The correct interpretation of section 113A(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is that the two percent threshold is two percent of the output tax for the return period in which the error occurred, not the annual output tax. 129 To resolve the fact that exporters have a limited ability to use these rules in relation to their GST returns (because export sales do not generate output tax), measuring materiality for GST errors should involve a test that looks at a person’s “taxable supplies” instead. Comment The phrase “total discrepancy in the assessment” is intended to refer to the total amount of the tax discrepancy caused by the error, or errors, that were included in the original return. For example, if a return contained an error that resulted in an omission of output tax of $800 (a debit), and an error that resulted in an omission of input tax of $400 (a credit), the total discrepancy in the assessment caused by those errors is $400 (that is, $800 minus $400). Officials intend to include further examples in the Tax Information Bulletin that covers the changes made by the Bill. Officials also agree that the two percent test in section 113A(4) for GST errors is intended to be two percent of “output tax” for the relevant return period, and not two percent of a taxpayer’s “annual output tax”. The expression “annual gross income” is defined for the purposes of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in section BC 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The use of the word “annual” in section 113A(4) is intended only to refer to “annual gross income” as in the defined term, and it is not intended to extend to “annual output tax”, which is not a concept that is used in either the Tax Administration Act 1994 or the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Officials can see merit in changing the test from “2 percent of output tax” to “2 percent of taxable supplies” (or another alternative) for the purposes of GST to address the issue raised by the submitter. However, officials consider that before an amendment be made to change the test, further consultation should be undertaken on whether “2 percent of taxable supplies” is the most appropriate solution. Officials recommend that this consultation occur as part of a future taxation bill. Recommendations That the submissions about “total discrepancy in the assessment” and the correct interpretation of the two percent materiality test for GST be noted. That the submission to change the materiality test for GST to address a possible issue for exporters be declined. 130 CONSIDERATION FOR GRANT OF AN EASEMENT (Clauses 61 and 62) Issue: Transitional rule Submission (EY) A transitional rule should be introduced for taxpayers who have previously treated a one-off payment for a permanent easement as taxable, because of the uncertainty of treatment in the period between the release of the Vector decision and this amendment coming into force. These taxpayers should be able to claim refunds in respect of these amounts; it does not appear fair to penalise taxpayers who may have conservatively paid tax on such receipts in the interim period. Comment Taxpayers who have conservatively paid tax on one-off payments for the grant of a permanent easement after the Vector decision and before this amendment comes into force may be able to claim refunds in respect of these amounts. However, officials do not consider that a transitional rule is necessary to achieve this. Taxpayers can already apply to the Commissioner to have an assessment amended under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. It is also unlikely there are any taxpayers in this position, as section CC 1(2C) has always had the clear intent of excepting these payments from tax. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Payments for the grant of a land right Submission (Matter raised by officials) An existing remedial amendment in the Bill moves section CC 1(2C) – a provision that excepts one-off payments for the grant of a permanent easement from income tax – from section CC 1 to section CC 1B of the Income Tax Act 2007. Doubts have arisen as to whether section CC 1B taxes consideration for the grant of an easement (or other land right). A clarifying amendment should therefore be made to ensure that, consistent with the policy intent, such payments are taxable. Comment It is intended that payments for the grant of an easement or other land right are taxable. 131 Originally, it was thought that payments for the grant of a land right were taxable under section CC 1. However, the Court of Appeal in CIR v Vector Limited \[2016\] NZCA 396 found that the words “other revenues” in section CC 1 do not capture traditionally capital amounts such as one-off payments for the grant of an easement, and none of the other “amounts” listed in section CC 1(2) captures such payments. This meant that the exception for permanent easements in section CC 1(2C) is redundant. It was noted by the Court that section CC 1B – introduced with effect from 1 April 2013 – would have captured the amount for the grant of the easements in Vector had it existed at the time of the transaction. Officials were similarly of the view that section CC 1B captured payments for the grant of a land right. However, doubts have arisen as to whether this is the case. Section CC 1B should be amended to ensure that payments for the grant of a land right (such as a licence or a limited term easement) are taxable, because economically, such payments can be substituted for a taxable rental stream. This amendment is also necessary to ensure that relocated section CC 1(2C) (proposed section CC 1B(6)) has its intended effect of carving out a one-off payment for the grant of a permanent easement from tax in a legislative scheme that would otherwise tax such a payment. The proposed amendment should apply retrospectively from 1 April 2013, the date that section CC 1B became effective. However, a savings provision should be included so that taxpayers who have already filed a tax return, or been given a binding ruling, on the basis that section CC 1B does not tax these payments, are not affected by the amendment. The savings provision should only apply to positions taken before the date of announcement of the proposed amendment by the Minister of Revenue, which was 23 August 2019. Officials consider this proposed amendment should be included in the current Bill rather than the next bill that is introduced to preclude what could otherwise be a significant fiscal risk. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 132 EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEMES (Clauses 69 − 71) Issue: General support Submitters generally support the proposed amendments to the employee share scheme (ESS) rules. However, they also recommend some further changes to improve the workability of the rules. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 133 EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEMES – DEFINITION OF MARKET VALUE (Clauses 69 and 71) Issue: Refreshed valuation statement should be released Submission (PwC) In conjunction with the introduction of the new definition of “market value”, the Commissioner should release a refreshed valuation statement (replacing CS 17/01) that sets out a volume weighted average price (VWAP) equivalent and other valuation methods accepted by the Commissioner. Also, prior to releasing this refreshed valuation statement, the Commissioner should consult with taxpayers to ensure that the approaches included in it are practical and workable. Comment Officials understand that the valuation methods approved in the existing valuation statement reduce compliance costs, and in most cases will be practical and workable for companies that choose to use them. However, officials can see value in reviewing the content of the statement and consulting further with taxpayers to ensure that the list of available methods is as practical as it can be. A refreshed list of methods could potentially be published as a Tax Information Bulletin item, or as a new valuation statement, as the submitter suggests. Officials will consult further to determine the best approach. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Section CE 2(4) should be amended Submission (Russell McVeagh) Section CE 2(4) should be amended so that where an employee disposes of shares under an employee share scheme (or exempt ESS) immediately upon acquisition (often to fund the payment of PAYE), the employee is not treated as having a further gain or loss for tax purposes (as a result of the way the shares are valued) where the shares are on revenue account. Currently, the cost base for shares is determined with reference to their “market value”, but this market value – however it is determined – is unlikely to match the actual proceeds derived by the employee on sale. The most administratively simple solution would be to deem the value of the shares to be equal to the sale proceeds for cost base purposes but continue to use “market value” for PAYE purposes. 134 Comment Officials acknowledge the concerns raised by the submitter, but do not consider that the problem is significant enough to warrant specific legislative change. Officials consider that in the vast majority of cases, shares acquired by an employee under an ESS will be on capital account, as an employee normally holds these shares because their employer has chosen to remunerate them that way, rather than because the employee has a particular intention of resale. Any further gain or loss made on the sale of the shares will therefore not be taxable. In the uncommon case that the employee holds the shares on revenue account and sells them immediately, a further gain or loss on the sale of the shares represents a real positive or negative difference in the economic benefit to the employee against the market value. While compliance costs would be reduced by not taxing this additional amount, taxing it is technically correct and officials do not think that position should be departed from. Officials note that in the current Commissioner’s statement on the valuation of ESS shares (CS 17/01), one of the options for valuing listed shares is to use the sale proceeds (for both cost base and PAYE purposes), if the employee disposes of the shares on a recognised exchange on the date of acquisition. This option may be expanded as part of a refresh of the statement. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 135 EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEMES – FLEXIBILITY TO ALLOW EMPLOYEES TO KEEP SHARES IF THEY LEAVE EMPLOYMENT (Clause 70) Issue: Use of the word “purchase” does not allow for nil consideration Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The proposed amendment to section CW 26C(8) provides for arrangements in which, if an employee who is not currently employed breaches the restricted period for an exempt employee share scheme, the employee’s shares must be “purchased” back by the employer for the lesser of the cost of the shares to the employee or the market value of the shares on the date the period of restriction ends. The use of the word “purchase” in this context is problematic if an employee was granted shares for nil consideration, as the employer must “purchase” the shares back for that nil consideration, but definitionally, a “purchase” requires a contract and consideration. As a workaround, employers can grant shares for a nominal amount such as $1, and subsequently “purchase” the shares back for that amount. But this fix creates onerous compliance costs and is often questioned by Boards. To correct this issue, references to “purchased” or “bought” should be replaced with either “acquired” or “transferred”. Comment Officials agree that the use of the word “purchased” in the legislation may be problematic where shares are granted for nil consideration. The exempt employee share scheme rules were not intended to preclude such arrangements, and officials agree that using the word “acquired” or “transferred” instead would resolve the issue. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Proposed section CW 26C(8) is unclear Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Proposed section CW 26C(8) is unclear and should be rewritten. The new drafting could be: When the period of restriction ends, the arrangement must provide: if the employee is currently employed that the shares are transferred to the employee, or if the employee chooses, that the shares are purchased for the lesser of • the cost of the shares to the employee; 136 • the market value of the shares on the date the period of restriction ends; or: • if the employee is not currently employed and the employee chooses, that the shares are transferred to the employee or purchased for the lesser of: − the cost of the shares to the employee; or − the market value of the shares on the date the period of restriction ends. Comment Proposed section CW 26C(8) is complex, as it has to provide for two possible arrangements from which the employer can choose (in relation to an early termination of the “restricted period”). One of these options distinguishes between an employee who is currently employed and an employee who is not currently employed. The other does not. This is because the policy intent of the proposed amendment is to allow companies to choose whether a particular subset of employees – those who are not currently employed – (a) have a choice between keeping their shares or having the company buy them back, or (b) are required to have them bought back. While complex, officials consider that the current drafting covers all of the permutations that are intended to be allowed under the amendment. Officials do not consider that the submitter’s suggested drafting covers all of the possibilities. However, we will investigate whether there is a simpler way to draft the provision, while still ensuring that it covers all of the arrangements intended to be permitted. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Potential unintended change in the 2004−2008 rewrite Submission (Deloitte) In section CW 26C, there is no requirement for dividends paid during the restricted period to flow to employees. In the prior version of the section – section DC 12(5) of the Income Tax Act 2004 – this requirement was included as part of the requirement to have a trustee to hold the shares during the restrictive period. The requirement to have a trust was (sensibly) deleted when the rules relating to tax-exempt ESS were amended, as a trustee should not be required for a scheme to qualify. However, with it, it appears that the dividend requirement was also removed. This deletion does not seem likely to have been a policy intention during the rewrite. Section CW 26C should be revised to clarify and confirm the original policy intention. 137 Comment Officials agree that removing the requirement for dividends to flow to employees was unlikely to have been a policy intention. Section CW 26(C) should be revised to clarify the original policy intent that dividends must flow to the employees holding the shares. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 138 OVERSEAS DONEE STATUS – SCHEDULE 32 (Clause 114) Issue: Updates to the list Submission (Matter raised by officials) Two changes are required to the existing list of organisations named on schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007: 1. Remove “Onesight New Zealand” with effect from 30 May 2019. This trust was wound up on that date. 2. Remove “Orphans Refugees and Aid of New Zealand Charitable Trust” and replace the reference with “Hope Street Charitable Trust” with effect 15 June 2019, the date the charity was rebranded. Comment The proposed changes are recommended by officials ensure the statutory list remains current. The proposed changes are not new additions to the list of donee organisations and update existing references to reflect changes in the named charities’ circumstances. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 139 TAXATION OF LIFE INSURANCE BUSINESS – TRANSITIONAL RELIEF Issue: Implementation concerns Submission (AIA New Zealand Ltd, Cigna Life Insurance New Zealand Ltd, Financial Services Council) Submissions raise three matters with the implementation of an amendment made by the Taxation (Annual Rates 2019−20, GST Offshore Registration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 at it applies to transitional relief for level premium life insurance policies sold before 1 July 2010. The issues are: 1. The current description for CPI movements in section EY 30(5BA) of the Income Tax Act 2007 do not reflect life insurer practices. (AIA New Zealand Ltd, Financial Services Council) 2. The savings provision that accompanied the legislative change made by the Taxation (Annual Rates 2019−20, GST Offshore Registration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 is too limiting for some life insurers to take advantage of the amendment to section E 30. (Financial Services Council) 3. Transitional relief should be available for life insurance policies that were sold as “level premium” and provided life cover indexing benefits of more than three percent. (AIA New Zealand Ltd, Financial Services Council, Cigna Life Insurance New Zealand Ltd) Comment In 2010 the taxation of life insurance business was substantially reformed. Accompanying the reform was transitional relief for life insurance policies sold before the start of the new rules (1 July 2010). The transitional relief provides life insurers with a tax deduction to reflect the tax that would otherwise be paid before the 2010 tax reforms. One form of term life insurance policy offers premiums that remain at a set level over the term of the cover. Section EY 30(5)(b) allows life insurers tax transitional relief for these “level premium” policies sold on or before 30 June 2010. Section EY 30(5)(b) allows for increases in the base premium for such policies if the increase is a result of increasing the amount of life cover for movements in the consumer price index (CPI). The base premium is the premium agreed at the time the life insurance policy is sold. Such increases are annually activated by the life insurer unless the policyholder expressly cancels it. The rule did not adequately respond to situations when, because of a low-inflation environment, increases in the sum assured under the formula were higher than percentage changes in CPI. Most level premium policies allow for an incremental increase in premiums over its contractual duration by a formula to reflect percentage changes in the CPI to maintain the real value of life insurance cover. These increases are typically framed by an increase of 3 percent or movement in the CPI index − whichever was the higher. 140 The amendments made by the Taxation (Annual Rates 2019−20, GST Offshore Registration, and Remedial Matters) Act preserved transitional relief for life insurance policies that provided benefits giving an increase in the amount of life cover where that increase does not exceed three percent or the percentage increase in the CPI (whichever percentage is the higher). Officials have had ongoing discussions with life insurers regarding the implementation of the amendments made by the Taxation (Annual Rates 2019−20, GST Offshore Registration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 and agree that improvements can be made to the wording of the legislation in respect of the first two submission points to ensure the amendments made by that Act operate correctly. Officials recommend two remedial changes be included in the Bill to: • Replace the current description of the CPI period being, “consisting of the last 4 quarters preceding the year”, with a reference to the CPI percentage change movement to the annual rate specified in the formula in the life policy. • Revise the application section (section 65(4) of Taxation (Annual Rates 2019−20, GST Offshore Registration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019) to ensure that life insurers wanting to use the amendment can do so. Regarding the third matter raised by submitters, officials’ discussions with affected life insurers and the Financial Services Council on the implementation of the amendment to section EY 30 has revealed a moderately complex background. An array of understandings and expectations exist about the outcomes of the 2010 reforms to the taxation of life insurers, including the extent to which transitional relief is available for level premium life insurance policies sold and in existence immediately before the reforms took effect. To further complicate matters, life insurers have taken different approaches in terms of their compliance systems and the matters on which Inland Revenue’s view has been sought. An illustration of this point can be found in the different recommendations put forward by AIA and Cigna. Officials consider the solution sought by submitters for the third matter goes beyond the scope of a remedial matter that can be included in this Bill and warrants deeper consideration. Officials recommend, subject to current priorities on the Government’s tax policy work programme, that submitter concerns regarding transitional relief for level premium life insurance policies be considered for a later bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part, subject to officials’ comments. 141 BRIGHT-LINE MAIN HOME EXCLUSION (Clause 60) Issue: Support for the proposal Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter supports the proposal to amend the main home exclusion for the bright-line test to align the period considered for the exclusion with the period in the bright-line test itself. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Suggestion for different period Submission (KPMG) The submitter agrees that the applicable period for the main home exclusion for the bright- line test should be aligned with the date the five-year period for the bright-line test begins but suggests the period should extend to the date of settlement of any sale. The submitter agrees that the period from which a mere equitable interest in the property is acquired to when settlement on purchase occurs should be excluded from consideration for the main home exclusion. This is because the owner does not have occupancy rights during that period. However, the submitter suggests that the period considered for the bright-line test artificially curtails the period of use because it ends when an agreement for sale and purchase is entered into. The submitter suggests that where a bright-line property is subject to an extended settlement period on sale and the owners continue to reside in the property it would be inappropriate to exclude this period from consideration for the main home exclusion. Comment The main home exclusion for the bright-line test in section CB 16A applies where land has been used predominantly, for most of the time, for a dwelling that was the main home for the person. Therefore, the time period that the property is used as a main home is important in determining whether the main home exclusion will apply. Officials consider it is important that this time period is consistent with the period that the bright-line test applies to. This is to ensure that a person cannot manipulate the application of the main home exclusion by occupying the property after the period considered for the bright-line test has ended. 142 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Settlements of relationship property Submission (Matter raised by officials) Clause 60 of the Bill contains an amendment to the main home exclusion for the bright-line test to align the period considered for the exclusion with the period in the bright-line test itself. A further amendment is needed to clarify when this period starts when land is transferred on a settlement of relationship property as defined in section FB 1B. Comment Section FB 3A applies where residential land that may be subject to the bright-line test is transferred on a settlement of relationship property. It clarifies that the transfer will be treated as occurring for an amount equal to the cost of the land to the transferor, and at the date the transferor acquired the land. Section FB 3A currently applies for the purposes of section CB 6A (the bright-line test). Section FB 3A should be amended to clarify that it also applies for the purpose of section CB 16A (the main home exclusion for the bright-line test). The proposed amendment would apply from the date of enactment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 143 INTEREST LIMITATION Issue: Restricted transfer pricing – optional credit rating method Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Russell McVeagh) Section GC 16(11) of the Income Tax Act was amended by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018−19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 to extend the optional credit rating method to long-term senior debt that is “secured”. However, section GC 16(5) still makes specific mention of the requirement for the long-term senior debt to be “unsecured”, with the unintended consequence that taxpayers with only secured debt are excluded from using the optional credit rating method on the basis that they do not meet the strict requirements of section GC 16(5). Section GC 16(5) should also have the word “unsecured” removed so that taxpayers with secured debt are then able to use the optional credit rating method in section GC 16(11). Comment As noted by the submitters, amendments to section GC 16(11) in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018−19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 were intended to allow taxpayers to apply the optional credit rating method based on long-term senior debt whether it was secured or unsecured. As a taxpayer can only calculate their interest rate under the optional credit rating method in section GC 16(11) if they satisfy the criteria in section GC 16(5) the word “unsecured” should have been removed from both sections. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Non-debt liabilities – shareholder loans Submission (Deloitte) The wording “a shareholder that is a member of the group” in section FE 16B(1)(b) should read “a shareholder”. This wording is likely to be an unintentional drafting error. This is because the wording will, essentially make the provision redundant as, if the shareholder was a member of the New Zealand group, the debt would be consolidated away. Comment Section FE 16B(1)(b) excludes from non-debt liabilities, in the thin capitalisation rules, financial arrangements providing funding that are pro rata with shareholding or by a substantial shareholder. 144 As thin capitalisation is calculated on a group basis, a financial arrangement between a company and a shareholder where both were members of the group would not increase the debt of the group as the arrangement would disappear upon consolidation. Therefore, the submitter is correct that the current wording would apply only to arrangements that would not affect the group’s debt levels. Also, officials have been made aware of situations where two members of a wholly-owned group exist where the first member is a shareholder of a New Zealand group member and the second member provides either an interest free loan or redeemable preference shares in proportion with the first members shareholding. By removing the wording discussed in the paragraph above this situation will be covered by the associated person reference in section FE 16B(1)(b)(ii) and (c)(ii) but there is no equivalent for proportional shareholdings where the total shareholding in the New Zealand group member is less than ten percent. Officials recommend changes to section FE 16B(1)(b)(i) and (c)(i) to ensure this situation is also excluded from being a non-debt liability. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. (Clause 83) Issue: Dividend paid out of previously attributed income Submission (Matter raised by officials) That the proposed amendment in clause 83 does not achieve the policy intent. Comment A submitter on the Bill has queried whether the proposed amendment in clause 83, relating to the income attribution rules, achieves its policy intent. As set out in the commentary on the Bill, the policy intent for this proposed amendment is to ensure that a dividend paid by a company (“associated entity”) that has previously attributed income to a shareholder (“working person”) is exempt income of the recipient if it is paid out of the previously attributed income, and the company’s records demonstrate this. Officials agree that the wording proposed does not clearly identify that the dividend is exempt only if it represents a distribution from income attributed to and taxed to a working person in an earlier income year. We recommend that the drafting be updated to clarify this intent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 145 New matters raised at Select Committee 147 RING-FENCING RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY DEDUCTIONS Issue: Residential income that deductions can be used against Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of “residential income” should be amended to ensure that residential property deductions can be used against net land sale income from residential property that is outside the ring-fencing rules because it is held on revenue account. Comment There is a cross-referencing error in the definition of “residential land” in section EL 3. As the definition is currently worded, deductions for residential property in the ring-fencing rules can be used against income from the property (or portfolio) and against net rental income and net depreciation recovery income from residential property that is outside the rules because it is held on revenue account. Deductions should also be able to be used against net sale income from such revenue account property. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarifying that amounts of residential income can only be counted once Submission (Matter raised by officials) It should be clarified that amounts of residential income from residential property outside the ring-fencing rules can only be counted once for the deduction allocation rules. Comment The definition of “residential income” in section EL 3 includes four components. These are: (a) rental income from the portfolio (or individual property); (b) depreciation recovery income from the portfolio (or individual property); (c) net land sale income from the portfolio (or individual property); and (d) net rental income and depreciation recovery income from residential property that is outside the ring-fencing rules because it is held on revenue account. As noted in Issue: Residential income that deductions can be used against, item (d) should also include net land sale income from residential property that is outside the ring-fencing rules because it is held on revenue account. 148 There is a clarification required, to ensure taxpayers can only count amounts of “residential income” once. This is because a taxpayer may apply the ring-fencing rules on a portfolio basis for some properties and on a property-by-property basis for another property, or they may have two or more properties on a property-by-property basis. In these situations, the deduction allocation rule is applied to each property (or a property and the portfolio) separately. Items (a) to (c) of “residential income” are amounts from the particular property or portfolio, so cannot be counted when looking at another property or portfolio. However, item (d) includes amounts of income from property outside the rules. On the face of it, there is nothing to preclude a taxpayer counting such amounts more than once – for example, once in ascertaining their “residential income” for their portfolio, and once in ascertaining their “residential income” for a property-by-property basis property. It should be clarified that if an amount of residential income has been counted, it cannot be counted again for allocating deductions for another property. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Unused excess deductions not released on taxable sale of portfolio or property Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment should be made to ensure the carry forward of unused deductions that are not released on a taxable sale of a residential property or portfolio. Comment If a property-by-property basis residential property is taxed on sale, or if all of the properties are sold and all sales were taxed, any excess deductions remaining (after use against the rental income and net land sale income) are released from the ring-fencing rules. This means those amounts can be used against income from other sources, such as salary and wages. However, if there has been an unused excess transferred to the property or portfolio from another property or portfolio that was not taxed (or not fully-taxed) on sale, the amount transferred is not released. Currently, there is no mechanism for any unfenced amount remaining after a taxable sale to be treated as relating to (and transferred to) another property. There should be such a mechanism, as there is for excess amounts remaining after non-taxed disposals. If this amendment is made, the opportunity could be taken to incorporate what is now section EL 8 (which deals with the treatment of previously transferred amounts on a fully-taxed disposal) into sections EL 5 and EL 7, which deal with sales of portfolios and property-by- property basis residential properties, respectively. There is also a cross-referencing error in section EL 7(2), which should be amended. 149 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Operation of the interposed entity rules Submission (Matter raised by officials) Some amendments are required to the interposed entity rules to ensure they operate as intended. Comment Section EL 16(2) suspends excess interest deductions related to investing in a land-rich entity. These are deductions that exceed the person’s share of the entity’s residential income, taking into account the level of capital used to acquire the residential property. Currently the suspended deductions are carried forward to a later income year in which the person derives residential income or a distribution from the entity (to the extent such distribution relates to residential land). But the excess deductions are then not used against either of those types of income, but rather added to the person’s interest expenditure and used against the person’s share (effectively) of the “entity’s net residential income”. Section EL 16(2)(b)(i) and (ii) therefore do not bear any relation to the income the excess deductions can be used against. What section EL 16(2)(b) should instead do is carry the excess deduction forward to a later income year in which the entity derives residential income. Subparagraphs (b)(i) and (ii) do not serve any purpose and should be removed. There is a related issue in respect of section EL 18(a). In that provision (which modifies the interposed entity rules for transparent entities), the person’s residential income for the year is treated as their share of “net residential income”. That is fine when the only residential property the person has is held in the entity. But the person may also hold other residential property directly. If they do, they should not be able to use excess interest deductions related to the investment in the entity against that other residential income. Section EL 18(a) should instead provide that the person’s residential income for the income year from the property held in the entity is what is treated as their share of net residential income. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 150 TAXATION OF TRUSTS Issue: Generic tax policy process not followed Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) That the proposed amendments should be deferred for full consultation under the generic tax policy process. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Only matters which are properly clarification should proceed. Other proposals should be deferred for proper consideration through the generic tax policy process. Alignment of the legislation with IS 18/01 Taxation of trusts – income tax (a Commissioner’s interpretation statement) should not be accepted as justification for any proposed amendment. (KPMG) Comment All of the proposed amendments are of a remedial nature and are consistent with the policy intent. The proposed trust remedial measures arise from a detailed administrative review of the Commissioner’s application of the existing law and do not represent a proposal to change the policy intent for the taxation of trusts. In general, the trust rules have always modified the common law approach relating to the treatment of income and capital to align the taxation of trusts with the general tax rules for the taxation of income (as defined in the Income Tax Act 2007). Stakeholders have been extensively consulted with through the process of the administrative review and some have made further submissions on the remedial measures proposed in the Bill that reflect the outcome of that review. In developing the Commissioner’s interpretation statement (IS 18/01 Taxation of trusts – income tax), stakeholders were consulted on the application of the current law, and their views considered in developing the Commissioner’s administrative practice for the taxation of trusts. The Commissioner applied normal interpretive principles in arriving at her application of the law for the taxation of trusts. This review culminated with the release of an interpretation statement, IS 18/01 Taxation of trusts – income tax earlier in 2018 which identified a small number of changes in the way the Commissioner applies the existing law, within the scope of the current policy framework for the taxation of trusts. Officials also note that the generic tax policy process contemplates that provisions in Taxation Acts need to be maintained or updated in response to changing business practices, jurisprudence or other factors (http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/work-programme#remedials). Clear, unambiguous legislation that keeps up to date with changing business and administrative practices reduces both administrative and compliance cost as it reduces 151 uncertainty and reduces the risk of litigation being undertaken to clarify the meaning of the current law as it is applied by the Commissioner. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Definition of trust and trustee Submission (KPMG) The amendment to the definitions of trust and trustee made by the Trusts Act 2019 should be considered for whether amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 are required. Comment Officials have followed the progress of the Trusts Bill through the legislative process and are currently reviewing the effect for taxation purposes, if any, of the changes to the definitions of trust and trustee in the Trusts Act 2019. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Trusts taxed twice on New Zealand sourced income. Submission (nsaTax) Section HC 15(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be amended to exclude distributions of tax-paid New Zealand sourced income from the definition of “taxable distribution”. Comment The policy for the taxation of taxable distributions does not provide a tax credit for New Zealand tax previously paid on trustee income. This double taxation effect (tax on trustee income and tax on the beneficiary on distribution) is an intended effect. This effect is part of the policy design of the trust rules to encourage a trustee of a foreign trust or a non-complying trust to elect to pay New Zealand tax on the world-wide trustee income (for example, to become a complying trust). This is because distributions from a complying trust are taxed only once – either as tax on trustee income or as tax on beneficiary income. All other distributions from a complying trust are not taxed to the beneficiary. 152 The objective of this policy in relation to New Zealand sourced income is to mitigate against the accumulation of that income offshore in a way that benefits a New Zealand resident beneficiary because the New Zealand tax on that income is limited to non-resident withholding tax rates. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: A person treated as a settlor under section HC 27(6) of the Income Tax Act 2007 Submission (nsaTax) Section HC 27(6) should be amended to clarify that the interest paid should be within 12 months after the end of the income year. Section YB 10 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (when a person is associated with another person) should be amended to exclude persons that are settlors by virtue of section HC 27(6) of the land provisions. Comment Officials agree that the wording of section HC 27(6) of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be clarified to better reflect the timing issues. Officials consider that a person who is treated as a settlor of a trust is intended to be included in the associated persons rules for the purpose of the land sales rules. Recommendations That the submission about the temporal element be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. That the submission about the associated persons rules be declined. 153 GST ON LOW-VALUE IMPORTED GOODS Issue: Reverse charge – GST-registered recipient returns the GST Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment should be made so that the reverse charge in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act) only applies to a supply of goods when: • the goods are imported by the recipient of the supply in a consignment with a total value of $1,000 or less; and • the recipient does not pay GST to Customs, nor to the supplier of the goods. Comment The new GST rules applying to supplies of low-value imported goods by offshore suppliers contain an exclusion for supplies to New Zealand GST-registered businesses. The rationale for this is that the application of GST to business-to-business supplies is broadly revenue neutral, as GST-registered businesses purchasing goods and services will generally claim back any GST charged by the supplier as a credit in their GST returns. However, in some cases, a GST-registered person may purchase goods from an offshore supplier for non-taxable use (for example, private use). Amendments were made to ensure that, in the situation where a GST-registered person purchases low-value imported goods from an offshore supplier for partial private use, the GST-registered New Zealand business is required to return GST under the reverse charge. However, the scope of the amendments to the reverse charge are wider than what was intended, meaning that there is potential for double taxation to occur in some instances. To rectify this, officials recommend that the proposed amendment should apply from 1 December 2019 (the date the GST on low-value imported goods rules came into force) with an optional savings provision to ensure that taxpayers are not disadvantaged. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Interaction of marketplace rules with existing agency rules Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials recommend an amendment to provide an exclusion from the marketplace rules in the GST Act for supplies of remote services made by New Zealand-resident underlying suppliers through marketplaces operated by New Zealand residents. 154 Comment The electronic marketplace rules in the GST Act currently only apply to electronic marketplaces for remotely-supplied services and digital products (remote services) operated by non-residents. A recent amendment will extend the marketplace rules to electronic marketplaces operated by New Zealand residents, so that as of 1 December 2019 New Zealand-resident marketplace operators will be liable to return GST on supplies of remote services and low-value imported goods made through their platforms by non-residents to consumers in New Zealand. An unintended consequence of the recent amendment is that the electronic marketplace rules will also apply to arrangements that are purely domestic in nature and which are already covered by existing agency rules in the GST Act. Because there is only a very limited ability to opt out of the electronic marketplace rules, the effect is that the electronic marketplace rules will override the existing agency rules as they apply to these domestic arrangements, which was not intended. As the suggested amendment is taxpayer-friendly and aligns the law with the policy intention, officials recommend that the suggested amendment should apply from 1 December 2019 with a savings provision to protect tax positions taken by taxpayers in reliance on the amendment made in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Knowledge offence for consumers and underlying suppliers providing incorrect or misleading information Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials recommend an amendment to the knowledge offences in the Tax Administration Act 1994 to provide that a recipient of a supply of low-value imported goods commits a knowledge offence if he or she knowingly provides altered, false or misleading information for the purpose of avoiding paying GST. Officials also recommend a further amendment to provide that a non-resident underlying supplier selling low-value goods through an electronic marketplace commits a knowledge offence if it knowingly provides false or misleading information which results in the operator of the marketplace underpaying GST to Inland Revenue. Comment Section 143A(1)(g) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that a recipient of a supply of remote services commits a knowledge offence if he or she knowingly provides altered, false or misleading information about his or her residency or GST registration status to avoid being charged GST. 155 This provision was overlooked when the GST on low-value imported goods legislation was drafted, largely because it was presumed that section 143A(1)(c) 14 would be sufficient to cover the situation where a recipient of a supply of low-value imported goods provides incorrect or misleading information to avoid being charged GST. However, given the existence of section 143A(1)(g) for remote services, officials consider that it would be clearer and more transparent if the scope of section 143A(1)(g) was extended to low-value imported goods, or if a similar provision specifically for low-value imported goods was inserted. The suggested amendments to the knowledge offence provisions would also be in keeping with recent amendments to the GST Act that provide the Commissioner of Inland Revenue with discretion to require a person (being the recipient of a supply of low-value imported goods or a non-resident underlying supplier selling through an electronic marketplace) to register and pay GST that should have been charged when: • the person knowingly provides altered, false or misleading information which has resulted in GST being underpaid; and • the amount of GST is substantial or the behaviour is repeated. Officials propose that this amendment would apply from the date of enactment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Requirement to include GST information in import documentation Submission (Matter raised by officials) The requirement for a supplier of low-value imported goods to take reasonable steps to ensure that its GST registration number and information about whether GST was paid at the point of sale should only apply if GST is required to be charged on the supply of all or some of the goods in the consignment. Comment For the purpose of preventing double taxation, new section 24BAC requires suppliers of low-value imported goods to take reasonable steps to ensure that its GST registration number is included in the import documentation for a consignment of low-value imported goods, along with an indication of whether GST was paid at the point of sale on each item being shipped. 14 Section 143A(1)(c) provides that a person commits a knowledge offence if the person “provides altered, false, incomplete, or misleading information to the Commissioner or any other person in respect of a tax law or a matter or thing relating to a tax law”. 156 This requirement applies broadly to all supplies of low-value imported goods – including supplies that are generally excluded from the requirement to charge GST at the point of sale, such as supplies to GST-registered businesses. This potentially creates unnecessary compliance costs in respect of bulk shipments of many low-value items to GST-registered businesses in New Zealand where Customs will collect GST on the consignment regardless of whether this information is included in the import documentation. Given that the proposed amendment is taxpayer-friendly and is purely administrative in nature, officials recommend that the proposed amendment should apply from 1 December 2019 to avoid imposing unnecessary compliance costs on suppliers of low- value imported goods. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Requirement to include amount of tax charged on receipt Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials recommend removing the requirement for suppliers of low-value imported goods to include the amount of GST charged on receipts issued to consumers. Given the requirement for the receipt to include an indication of which items listed on the receipt had GST charged at the point of sale and which had not, the separate requirement to include the amount of tax on the receipt is not needed and may lead to unnecessary compliance costs for suppliers in some instances. Comment For the purpose of preventing double taxation, new section 24BAB requires a supplier of low-value imported goods to issue a receipt if GST has been charged on a supply. This provides the consumer purchasing the goods with documentation that they can provide to Customs as evidence that GST was charged at the point of sale so that Customs does not collect GST again when the goods are imported into New Zealand. If GST has been charged on all the goods included on the receipt, the requirement to indicate those items that had GST charged at the point of sale and those that did not can be met by simply including the total GST-inclusive price on the receipt and stating that this price includes GST – making the additional requirement to state the amount of GST charged unnecessary. As some suppliers will simply charge GST on all goods they supply to consumers in New Zealand, there is no benefit from requiring them to make changes so that their receipts will include the amount of GST charged when a statement that the price is inclusive of GST should suffice. Given that the proposed amendment is taxpayer-friendly and is purely administrative in nature, officials recommend that the proposed amendment should apply from 1 December 2019 to avoid imposing unnecessary compliance costs on suppliers of low- value imported goods. 157 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 158 OTHER GST ISSUES Issue: Removing a GST barrier to buying homes using co-ownership and rent- to-buy arrangements Submission (Russell McVeagh) Co-ownership and rent-to-buy arrangements under which a third party investor (not related to the home buyer or developer of the house) co-owns the house to assist the home buyer to become a full owner over time should be afforded the same GST treatment as a “financial service”. The current GST laws are likely to impose a barrier to using co-ownership and rent-to-buy arrangements because: • compliance with the relevant GST rules can be highly complex; • it treats a co-owner as if they were a dealer in property, whereas in substance the arrangement is to provide funding; and • there would be increased volatility that will be priced into the cost of housing for the home owner. Comment Officials agree that the current GST laws are likely to disadvantage these arrangements compared to more traditional mortgage financing. However, rather than introducing an amendment to the current Bill, officials consider that further policy work and consultation would be required to: • determine whether or not “financial services” is the most appropriate GST treatment (as opposed to other policy options); • design a proposed definition or set of rules; • check that the proposal would accommodate the full range of existing and potential rent-to-buy and co-ownership arrangements. As the submitter points out, a “range of legal arrangements for co-ownership and rent-to-buy models are possible”. The Government has announced an intention to develop a progressive home ownership scheme (which could take the form of a rent-to-buy arrangement), but at this time the details of this proposal are still being developed; and • check that the proposal does not create unintended consequences such as creating a mechanism that enables property developers to avoid paying GST on their profits from their property development activities. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to officials’ comments. 159 Issue: GST deductions for capital raising costs – remedial reference to participatory securities Submission (Matter raised by officials) A special rule allows GST deductions for capital raising costs associated with issuing equity or debt securities. A remedial amendment should be made so this rule also applies to participatory securities. Comment In 2017 a provision was introduced to allow a GST registered person who principally makes taxable supplies to recover GST incurred in the issue of a debt security or an equity security. However, because of an oversight, the provision does not refer to the issue of a participatory security, despite the fact that the corresponding financial services definition refers to “the issue of... an equity security or participatory security”. Like equity and debt securities, participatory securities can be issued by businesses to raise capital. Adding a reference to “participatory securities” would be consistent with the policy intention of allowing GST deductions for capital raising costs. The proposed remedial amendment should apply from 1 April 2017 as this is the date that the rule allowing GST deductions for capital raising costs took effect. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarifying the scope of an exemption for certain government grants provided to social housing providers Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 5(6F) of the GST Act should be amended to clarify that all types of payments by Government to social housing providers under a tailored agreement to provide social housing are exempt from GST. Comment Like other residential landlords, social housing providers are exempt from GST for their supplies of accommodation in dwellings provided to their tenants. In 2015, a provision was added to the GST Act to ensure that payments made by the Government to social housing providers under reimbursement agreements and tailored agreements to provide social housing are treated as consideration for an exempt supply of accommodation in a dwelling. 160 The tailored agreements that have subsequently been agreed include several types of payment: a rent subsidy, an operating supplement, and in limited cases, a capital grant. There is uncertainty as to whether or not all of these types of payment would qualify for the existing GST exemption in section 5(6F). If the GST exemption was found to not apply to some types of payment, the Government would need to gross up these payments to social housing providers in order to subsidise the same amount of tenancies in social housing accommodation. From a policy perspective, the overall purpose of the tailored agreement is to provide social housing tenancies so it would be appropriate to clarify that all the payments made under a tailored agreement are deemed to be consideration for an exempt supply. The proposed remedial change would provide certainty and reduce compliance costs for social housing providers and the Government. As it would align with existing practices, the remedial amendment should apply from May 2015, when section 5(6F) was introduced. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 161 HYBRID AND BRANCH MISMATCH RULES Issue: Disregarded hybrid payment rule – no deduction denial for reimbursement of external group costs Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Russell McVeagh) The disregarded hybrid payment (primary) rule, which is contained in section FH 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007, should be amended to ensure that the New Zealand branch of a non- resident company or a New Zealand resident hybrid entity is allowed a deduction for a payment to the extent that: • the payment reimburses third party expenditure of a group member; and • the third-party expenditure is non-deductible (in New Zealand and in the foreign jurisdiction). This amendment should be retrospective to the application date of the provision. That is, it should apply for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Comment Officials agree with this submission because the current rule would apply to payments that, when considered alongside the third-party expenditure described above, do not produce the net deduction-no inclusion hybrid outcome that the rule is targeted at. However, officials believe that this amendment should only apply when the third-party expenditure is non-deductible because the income of the branch or hybrid entity is not taxable in the foreign jurisdiction. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Opaque election – exemption for transitional expenditure Submission (Deloitte) Expenditure arising from the transition of a foreign hybrid entity (with transparent tax treatment in New Zealand) to an opaque entity under section FH 14 should not be subject to deduction denial under the hybrid and branch mismatch rules. Comment The opaque election rule was designed as a mismatch-eliminating option for taxpayers which would reduce their compliance costs. It is therefore inappropriate for the hybrid and branch 162 mismatch rules to apply on a one-time basis to expenditure that arises from making an opaque election under section FH 14. Officials consider that this amendment should be retrospective to the application date of the provision. That is, it should apply for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Defensive branch rule – counteraction should be for margin on branch charge rather than gross amount Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The drafting of the defensive branch rule contained in section FH 6 should be amended to ensure that the included income for the taxpayer is the margin on the branch charge, not the entire amount. Comment Officials have not yet seen practical examples demonstrating the problem this issue causes, and as a result the need for including an amendment to this Bill is not established. Officials will consider the issue further. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Defensive branch rule – limitation of scope to foreign offset situations Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Consistent with the approach taken to section FH 8, the scope of section FH 6 should be limited such that it does not apply in the case of a foreign branch of a New Zealand entity that is making losses and cannot offset those losses against the income of another person or entity in the foreign country. Comment Officials have not yet seen practical examples demonstrating the problem this issue causes, and as a result the need for including an amendment to this Bill is not established. Officials will consider the issue further. 163 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Exemption from hybrid and branch mismatch rules for small businesses Submission (Russell McVeagh) To reduce compliance costs, small businesses should be exempt from the application of the hybrid rules. The submitter suggested in oral submission to the Committee that this exemption could take the form of a de minimis based on the turnover or net income/loss of the business. Comment The hybrid and branch mismatch rules, which were introduced in the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018, are based on the OECD recommendations on hybrid and branch mismatch arrangements. Those recommendations did not contain a recommendation for a small business exemption or de minimis threshold. Officials are not aware that any other countries have adopted or proposed such an approach for their hybrid mismatch rules. The rules apply to complex cross-border structuring and this fact should generally exclude small businesses from interacting with the complexity of the provisions. Section FH 8 has a specific exclusion for New Zealand companies that operate in foreign countries through a branch or a hybrid entity but do not have the ability to offset foreign losses against the income of another entity. This exclusion is designed as a safe harbour for small businesses that conduct their operations in a foreign jurisdiction. The OECD-designed framework of hybrid and branch mismatch rules also weighs against such an exemption. This is because of the primary and defensive rules interface; most mismatches can be addressed by more than one country. If New Zealand’s primary rule does not apply because we have an exemption, then a foreign jurisdiction’s defensive rule will apply. For this reason, a small business exemption would be unlikely to have an effect, because New Zealand’s exemption could be undone by a foreign jurisdiction’s rule. For New Zealand-based businesses, overall compliance costs could be increased by an exemption as it may become necessary to apply a foreign jurisdiction’s hybrid and branch mismatch rules instead of New Zealand’s rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 164 WORKING FOR FAMILIES TAX CREDIT MATTERS Issue: Adjusting payment due dates for some Working for Families tax credit recipients Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment should be made to adjust the payment due date for some tax credit recipients, if their income tax assessment cannot be finalised because Inland Revenue needs to complete another person’s assessment first to determine their entitlement to tax credits. Comment Eligibility for Working for Families requires an assessment of family income. This requires both partners to be assessed for income tax. This can result in a timing issue where one partner has an extension of time for their tax obligations. This results in some peoples’ income tax assessments being unable to be finalised by their tax due date, because they are dependent on another person’s income tax assessment being completed first. Those people affected are: • Working for Families (WfF) recipients who had a partner at any time during the year; and • those with potential entitlement to the independent earner tax credit (IETC) who were a partner of a WfF recipient during the tax year. Under current rules, any tax payable of $100 or more is subject to penalties and interest from the original payment due date. Officials consider that Inland Revenue should be able to adjust the terminal tax due date for some tax credit recipients, to provide 30 days to pay any debit amount, from the date their assessment is finalised. The proposed amendment would ensure that a person will not be subject to interest and penalties from the original due date, in situations where their assessment cannot be finalised because of dependence on another person’s assessment. The proposed change in due date would impact any payment due for that person on the terminal tax date, that is WfF, income tax, and student loan. The proposed change would apply for assessments for the 2020 tax year onwards. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 165 Issue: Use of current Working for Families tax credits entitlement to repay prior year overpayments Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment should allow recipients to use their Working for Families (WfF) current entitlement to offset earlier overpayments, paid by either Inland Revenue or the Ministry of Social Development, in the year the overpayment occurred. Comment Current provisions allow WfF recipients to use their current entitlement to repay overpayments from an earlier year, if they received their WfF from Inland Revenue in the year the overpayment occurred. However, WfF recipients who were beneficiaries receiving their WfF from MSD in the year the overpayment occurred cannot use their entitlement in this way. Officials consider that all WfF recipients who are receiving their payments from Inland Revenue should be able to use their current WfF entitlement to offset prior year overpayments, regardless of which agency made the WfF payments in the year the overpayment occurred. The proposed amendment would ensure that all WfF recipients paid by Inland Revenue have the same options available to them to manage any overpayments. The option for Inland Revenue paid WfF recipients to use their current entitlement to repay prior year overpayments would be available from the 2020 tax year onwards. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 166 APPLICATION OF SECTION 120KBB GUIDANCE Issue: Further guidance would be desirable Submission (KPMG) We consider that further guidance and examples would be desirable on application of the “interest concession rules” in section 120KBB of the Tax Administration Act 1994. While a Tax Information Bulletin was prepared following the enactment of those rules, there are a number of nuances and practical issues that are not covered, which could usefully be clarified so that there is consistent understanding of how the interest concession rules apply. Comment Officials will look at including examples in the Tax Information Bulletin that covers this Bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 167 CLARIFICATION FOR TAXPAYERS WHO PAY PROVISIONAL TAX IN ONE OR TWO INSTALMENTS Issue: An interpretation issue exists with sections RC 13(3), RC 14 (2) and RC 9(9) Submission (Deloitte) There is an interpretation issue with sections RC 13(3) and RC 14(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 which reference section RC 9(9)(b) and (c). Section RC 9(4)(c) applies where a person is liable to pay provisional tax but has not provided a return in the preceding year and whose residual income tax (RIT) in the year before the preceding year is less than $2,500. It means that sections RC 13(1)(b) or RC 14 (1)(b) will apply so that provisional tax is payable in either two or one instalment(s), depending on when the prior year’s return is filed. It appears there is a missing link for these scenarios in sections RC 13(3) and RC 14 (3) respectively. These sections refer only to initial provisional taxpayers, so taxpayers are not provided legislative guidance as to how many instalments to pay or how to apply sections RC 13 or RC 14 in other cases. Comment While we understand taxpayers’ and Inland Revenue’s administrative practice is to ignore the fact that section RC 9(9) only technically applies to initial provisional taxpayers, we agree this should be corrected so that it is clear how many provisional tax instalments are payable in those situations. For those taxpayers, use-of-money interest will apply across three instalments rather than the number of instalments. However, the distinction is important when considering the application of late payment penalties and whether taxpayers have met conditions for interest concession rules, such as the safe harbour to apply. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 168 CLARIFYING THE AMOUNT ON WHICH INTEREST AND LATE PAYMENT PENALTIES ARE APPLIED Issue: Inland Revenue’s systems are not calculating interest in accordance with legislation Submission (Tax Management New Zealand Limited) Inland Revenue’s system is coded to use the formula found in section RC 10(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 to calculate the amount due at an instalment. The system also replaces the term “residual income tax” (RIT) as defined in subsection 3 with the actual RIT for the year if this figure turns out to be lower. As a result, an issue arises in situations where: • a taxpayer files the previous year’s return – which has a significantly higher RIT than the return from two years ago which they used as the basis to calculate their first instalment – between their first and second instalment dates; and • a third of the current year RIT turns out to be lower than the uplift amount due at the second instalment. That is because Inland Revenue systems are calculating the amount payable at the second instalment based on the lesser of: • the actual RIT for the year, multiplied by two and divided by three, minus the 110 percent uplift amount at the first instalment; or • the previous year’s RIT uplifted by 105 percent, multiplied by two and divided by three, minus the 110 percent uplift amount at the first instalment. We believe what Inland Revenue is doing operationally to calculate the amount payable at the second instalment is not consistent with section 120KBB(3)(b). Either the system or the legislation should be clarified. Comment This issue has been raised with officials previously by the submitter and it was confirmed to them that for the 2017−18 income year there was a programming issue with the old technology platform, FIRST. We have identified the affected taxpayers, and this is being corrected where those taxpayers have been overcharged penalties or interest. In the unlikely situation where a taxpayer has been undercharged penalties and interest no action is being taken. This issue has been corrected in Inland Revenue’s new technology platform, again the submitter has been previously informed of that. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 169 OTHER MATTERS Issue: Clarification to the filing rules for individuals Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 22H of the Tax Administration Act 1994 sets out the process for finalising accounts under the individuals’ income tax rules that were enacted as part of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018−19, Modernising Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2019. Officials consider that this section requires two amendments. The first is to ensure that an individual can finalise their account up to and including 7 July. The second is that a further provision is required to allow for late filing, as this has been inadvertently removed. These proposed amendments ensure that the law will not cut short a taxpayer’s ability to file a return and will permit them to late file, if required. The proposed application date for this change should be retrospective to 1 April 2019, the date that the income tax changes for individuals were enacted. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarifying when interest starts for individuals Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 120C(1)(iib), which defines the date interest starts, refers to a “qualifying individual” but this needs to be amended to “qualifying individual, or an individual who is treated as a qualifying individual”. Comment This amendment is necessary to ensure that the date interest starts is aligned for qualifying individuals and individuals who are treated as qualifying individuals. This accords with the policy intent which is to provide the same rules across the individuals’ income tax regime to both qualifying individuals, and individuals that have been treated as qualifying individuals. A person is a qualifying individual if they only earn income that has been reported to Inland Revenue within a short time after the end of the tax year such as salary and interest income. If a person earns other income such as overseas income or rental income, they do not meet the definition of a qualifying individual. 170 In some instances, a person who is not a qualifying individual may be treated as such by Inland Revenue. The policy intent is that that person should have the same rights as a qualifying individual. That is, they would be able to make changes and update information held by Inland Revenue without being subjected to penalties or interest. This applies until the terminal tax date which is usually 7 February of the year following the end of the tax year. The proposed application date for this change should be retrospective to 1 April 2019, the date that the income tax changes for individuals were enacted. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarifying when the Commissioner is required to issue a notice of proposed adjustment Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 89C requires an amendment to make it clear that the Commissioner is not required to issue a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) before making an assessment under section 22H(1). Comment Section 89C(l) was amended by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018−19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 to say that the Commissioner does not need to issue a NOPA to amend a qualifying individual’s assessment and, in accordance with section 22G(6) can amend a qualifying individual’s assessment at any time up to the timebar by notifying the individual. This type of amendment will occur when the Commissioner has automatically calculated a person’s tax assessment and the Commissioner subsequently becomes aware of further information that changes the person’s tax position. The Commissioner would add the additional information into the person’s tax information and would finalise their tax position based on the information held. The Commissioner would notify the person of the assessment and they would be able to challenge the assessment if they did not agree with it. The problem that arises is that the amendment made is not the correct equivalent to the prior section. Pre-amendment the section deals with issuing an assessment, but post-amendment the section sets out the ability of the Commissioner to amend an assessment that has already been made. An additional provision is also required specifying that the Commissioner is not required to issue a NOPA before assessing a qualifying individual. This is necessary to make it clear that the Commissioner does not have to issue a NOPA before making an amendment and finalising a qualifying individual’s tax assessment. 171 The proposed application date for this change should be retrospective to 1 April 2019, the date that the income tax changes for individuals were enacted. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Repealing a redundant provision that relates to “non-filing” taxpayers Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 141JA is redundant and should be repealed. This section covers the application of penalties to non-filing taxpayers and was updated in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018−19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 to reflect a change in terminology when the law on income statements was abolished and replaced with the new individuals’ income tax regime. The current law says that penalties will not apply to a non-filing taxpayer who has withheld their own PAYE and who is required to provide other income information where the Commissioner considers that other income information to be correct. The problem is that a taxpayer who provides “other income” information, or one who earns PAYE income, is not a “non-filing taxpayer”. These taxpayers will be squared up at the end of the year under the new rules. The section as drafted is in conflict because it deals with the application of penalties to a non-filing taxpayer but requires the taxpayer to provide other income information to satisfy the section (which makes them a filer). Under previous law, there was a rationale for this section, but it no longer exists. Comment Officials consider that section 141JA should be repealed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 172 Issue: Minor amendment to the write off rules for individuals Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment is proposed to schedule 8 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to ensure that the Commissioner has discretion to write off small amounts of tax payable. Schedule 8 Part B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 sets out a number of provisions that provide for a write off of tax payable. These rules largely apply from 1 April 2019. As per section 112 of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018−19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019, an updated version of schedule 8 is set to apply from 1 April 2020 to make provision for the “extra pay period” write-off which applies from that date. The updated version that comes into force on 1 April 2020 also includes a clause to allow for the Commissioner to write off small amounts of tax payable. Officials consider that this provision should have come into force on 1 April 2019. Comment Officials consider that Schedule 8 Part B clause 3 as contained in section 112 of the amending Act, which is set to apply from 1 April 2020, should apply retrospectively to 1 April 2019. A 2019 application date is necessary to support the efficacy of some of the other write off provisions that were enacted for 1 April 2019. For example, the policy intent is not to exclude a taxpayer from a write off under the income tested benefit write-off rule where they had a few dollars of interest income taxed at a rate lower than their marginal tax rate (schedule 8 Part B clause 1(b)(i)). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Minor amendments to the refund rules for back years Submission (Matter raised by officials) Two amendments are proposed to section MD 1 of the Income Tax Act (1994 and 2004 versions). First, sections 362 and 370 of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018−19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 replace section MD 1(b) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and 1994 respectively. This is an error. The sections are intended to replace section MD 1(1)(b). Section MD 1(b) does not exist. Second, a small change is proposed to both iterations of section MD 1 to ensure that the timebar does not restrict a taxpayer’s ability to obtain a refund at any point in time, provided the Commissioner was satisfied of the taxpayer’s entitlement to the refund within the time bar period. Comment Officials consider that the first proposed amendment is a simple drafting matter. 173 For the second proposed amendment, the effect of section MD 1 as it has been amended, is that for a certain period of time refunds that arise from amended assessments are still timebarred in circumstances where they should not be. This is because the law currently requires the time bar period to have not ended for a refund to be paid out for an amended assessment. The timebar restriction to amended assessments is meant to prevent a taxpayer from amending outside the timebar period to receive a refund, not from being able to be paid out a refund outside the timebar where the Commissioner was satisfied within that timeframe of their entitlement to the refund. This amendment is necessary to ensure that taxpayers are treated fairly and can receive the refunds they are entitled to. The proposed amendments to the Income Tax Act 1994 should apply from 1 April 2005. The proposed amendments to the Income Tax Act 2004 should apply from 1 April 2000. This accords with the application dates given to the original changes as applied in the amending Act. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: New provision required to be added to the Income Tax Act 1994 – refund rules Submission (Matter raised by officials) The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018−19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 added a number of provisions for back year periods that provide that, where the law previously acted as an impediment to a refund, that amount may now be refunded. The provisions added do not cover the period from 1 October 2004, the start of the inconsistent refund period, to 1 April 2005, the date that section 364 of the amending Act starts its coverage for. An additional provision is proposed to cover the period from 1 October 2004 to 31 March 2005 to ensure that taxpayers that are seeking refunds in respect of this period are not treated unfairly. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Investment income reporting – dividends paid by a listed PIE Submission (Matter raised by officials) The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017−18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018 added section 25G to the Tax Administration Act 1994 174 (“TAA”), which, as part of a wider reporting framework, requires payers of dividends to report “investment income information” in relation to the payments. An unintended consequence of the provisions is that information in relation to dividends paid by a listed PIE is not required to be reported. An amendment is proposed to ensure that dividends paid by listed PIEs fall under the definition of investment income. The amendment should apply from 1 April 2020, being the date that mandatory reporting for investment income applies from. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Definition of “custodial institution” Submission (Matter raised by officials) A definition of “custodial institution” should be added to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 so that the obligations of custodians can be clarified and distinguished from those imposed on payers of investment income. This provision will be optional from 1 April 2020 and mandatory from 1 April 2021. Comment A custodial institution acts as a conduit between an investment income payer (for example, a company paying a dividend) and an investor. Custodians undertake various functions including settlement services and asset management. Inland Revenue has received feedback that where a custodian is interposed between the payer and the investor, the investment income withholding and reporting rules are a poor fit for custodians’ business models. As a result, officials seek to clarify how the withholding and reporting rules apply to custodial institutions. A definition of a “custodial institution” is required for this purpose and will be introduced at Select Committee. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 175 Issue: End investor treatment of foreign custodians and aggregation of the underlying investors Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials propose that a foreign custodial institution is treated as an end investor for investment income withholding and reporting purposes. Officials further propose that where the foreign custodian is treated as an end investor, withholding and reporting is undertaken at an aggregated level. It is proposed that these changes should be voluntary from 1 April 2020 (which is the date that the investment income reporting regime applies) and compulsory from 1 April 2021. Comment Treating a foreign custodian as the end investor for withholding and reporting purposes Officials propose that a foreign custodian is treated as the end investor for investment income withholding and reporting purposes. This means that the investment income payer is only required to report that the payment has been made to the foreign custodian, and is not required to report details of each underlying investor. The end investor proposal is intended to reduce the compliance burden on the New Zealand custodian whilst ensuring the obligation for accurate withholding is retained. Further, officials note that Inland Revenue does not need to obtain details of a non-resident investor for investment income reporting purposes. Officials are of the view that requiring a custodian to look through the foreign custodian for withholding and reporting purposes would create an undue compliance burden. Officials note that custodial institutions are subject to international tax compliance and other requirements which form a safeguard preventing misuse of the proposed relaxation. These requirements include reporting requirements under the Common Reporting Standard and US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act which ensure that information which identifies investments is passed to the ultimate investor’s country of residence. Aggregate level withholding and reporting Officials propose that where a New Zealand custodial institution pays income offshore to another custodial institution the withholding is operated at an aggregated level. In many cases, a non-resident investor’s liability to New Zealand tax is fully satisfied by NRWT or AIL and the taxpayer will not be required to file a return. This means that where the payment passes into the hands of another custodial institution, which is treated as the end investor, the withholding would only take account of types of investment income (for example, dividends or interest) and classes of taxpayers (for example, for a dividend, those investors entitled to the benefit of particular treaty rates and those subject to NRWT in full). 176 Example Tony is tax resident in the United Kingdom. He has invested via custodians into Savoury Mints Ltd, a New Zealand listed company. Figure 2 UK custodian Tony NZ custodian Savoury Mints Ltd Savoury pays a gross dividend of $100 to the New Zealand custodian as the New Zealand custodian has RWT exempt status. The New Zealand custodian treats the United Kingdom custodian as the end investor for withholding and reporting purposes. 1. For reporting purposes, the report will only contain the details necessary to identify the United Kingdom custodian as the recipient of the payment. Tony’s details do not need to be provided to the New Zealand custodian or to Inland Revenue. 2. For reporting purposes, the United Kingdom custodian has told the New Zealand custodian that the ultimate investors are all United Kingdom tax residents entitled to the benefit of a 15% rate of withholding under the NZ-UK Double Taxation Agreement. The New Zealand custodian therefore withholds NRWT at the 15% rate and remits this to Inland Revenue This proposal is subject to the condition that the New Zealand custodial institution that operates aggregate level withholding must be satisfied that the foreign custodian has supplied sufficient information to support the rate of withholding. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Transfer of investment income withholding and reporting requirements for RWT and NRWT Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials recommend that provisions are introduced into the Income Tax Act 2007 and Tax Administration Act 1994 to clarify how the withholding and reporting obligations for investment income will pass from the payer to a custodial institution. It is proposed that these provisions are voluntary from 1 April 2020 (which is the date that the investment income reporting regime applies) and compulsory from 1 April 2021. 177 Comment Under current law, the investment income payer is required to withhold tax from investment income and remit it to Inland Revenue. Under certain conditions, that obligation can be passed on to a custodial institution interposed between the payer and the end investor. However, the current provisions lack clarity where custodial institutions sit between the payer and the ultimate investor, particularly where the income passes through the hands of more than one custodial institution before being paid to the ultimate investor. There is also an obligation for investment income payers to report to Inland Revenue, but there is no ability under current rules to permit a payer to pass on the reporting obligation. Accurate reporting of withholding tax is an important part of Inland Revenue’s ability to automatically assess refunds and tax to pay. Providing for transferable obligations will support this objective. The framework will have the following features: • Withholding and reporting will be undertaken by one entity. An ability to provide for variations to this rule will be provided. • Withholding and reporting must take place before the income passes to the end investor. The end investor may be a direct investor (New Zealand resident or non- resident) or a foreign custodian. • If the payer and subsequent custodians do not determine which has the obligation for withholding or reporting, the custodial institution which pays to an end investor (whether a direct investor or a foreign custodian) will be responsible for the payment of RWT and NRWT and reporting to Inland Revenue. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Relaxation of investment income reporting requirements for custodial institutions Submission (Matter raised by officials) In order to support officials’ proposal to allow reporting requirements to be transferred to custodial institutions, it is further proposed to limit the reporting requirements for custodial institutions to information that they hold or can reasonably obtain. It is proposed that these amendments should be voluntary from 1 April 2020 (which is the date that the investment income reporting regime applies) and compulsory from 1 April 2021. Comment The reporting requirements for investment income information are set out in Schedule 6 of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and 178 Remedial Matters) Act 2018. Under current law, the payer must provide the prescribed information. A custodian may not have access to the same information as a payer and may be unable to obtain this information through reasonable efforts. It is proposed that the reporting requirement be relaxed where the information cannot reasonably be obtained by the custodial institution. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarification of the investment income error correction rules in relation to approved issuer levy Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials propose an amendment to clarify how the error correction rules apply in relation to approved issuer levy (AIL). It is proposed that section RF 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007 be amended to clarify that an AIL election must have been received prior to an interest payment for a 0% NRWT rate to apply. Officials propose that this provision would apply from the date of enactment. Comment Payers of investment income and custodians are uncertain whether the current investment income error correction rules can be used to remediate NRWT previously withheld in favour of a late election into AIL. Officials consider that the proposed clarification will make it clear that the error correction rules cannot be used to allow remediation of a failure to meet the requirements for AIL treatment. It is intended that the error correction rules only be used to correct a tax position in circumstances where the correction will put the taxpayer into a position to which they were always entitled. For example, error correction could be used where on the payment date the payer of AIL understood that 47% of investors were eligible for AIL treatment, but after the payment it becomes apparent that 51% were eligible. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 179 Issue: RWT – additional foreign exchange rate Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials propose an amendment to allow payers and custodians to withhold and report investment income at the foreign exchange rate on the transaction date. Officials propose that this provision would apply from the date of enactment. Comment Under current law, where RWT is withheld in a currency other than New Zealand dollars (NZD), the amount of RWT to be paid to Inland Revenue is calculated at the close of trading spot rate on the first working day after the month in which RWT was withheld, or if the withholding is an Australian imputation credit account company, a specific conversion rate chosen by the company. Payers and custodians will typically use a transaction date foreign exchange rate in investor statements. This means that the investor may see a different NZD value in their investment statement from the value in myIR. This can result in the investor having to make an adjustment for any difference. Under the proposed amendment, the payer will have the option to withhold and report investment income to Inland Revenue using the foreign exchange rate which applied on the date of the transaction. Aligning the rate provided to Inland Revenue with the rate reported to the investor will aid accurate pre-population of taxpayers’ accounts. This means that a taxpayer will be less likely to have to account for any difference in their tax return at year end. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Repeal of information sharing legislative provision Submission (Matter raised by officials) The current information sharing provision between Inland Revenue and the Serious Fraud Office (Schedule 7, clause 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994) must be repealed to avoid conflicting legislation with the serious crime approved information sharing agreement (AISA) between Inland Revenue (and the New Zealand Police, currently being extended to include the Serious Fraud Office and New Zealand Customs Service. Comment Officials from Inland Revenue, the Serious Fraud Office and Customs are working on extending the current serious crime information sharing agreement between Inland Revenue and the Police agreement under the Privacy Act 1993. The agreement extension will enable 180 information from Inland Revenue to be shared with these two agencies to tackle serious crime. The current legislation governing information sharing between Inland Revenue and the Serious Fraud Office will need to be repealed with effect from the same date the new AISA applies from. The date the AISA will apply from will be determined by Order in Council. If the provision is not repealed then it will conflict with the AISA, affecting its operation. Cabinet approved the repeal on 23 September 2019. The Parliamentary Counsel Office will prepare Orders in Council, which will approve the information sharing agreement, in accordance with the Privacy Act 1993, as well as the consequential Order to repeal the existing sharing legislative provision between Inland Revenue and the Serious Fraud Office. Application date is the date of assent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Fringe benefit tax and private vehicle use Submission (Tim Hewitt) The exemption from fringe benefit tax for work-related vehicles should be repealed. The current exemption for work related vehicles creates incentives for businesses to purchase or lease vehicles such as utes, which have a generally larger carbon footprint than cars which are typically non-exempt. Comment Officials note that this submission raises issues that would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 181 Issue: The number of remedial amendments Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The number of remedial amendments is a concern. While tax is a complex subject area and remedial amendments will always be necessary, the volume of amendments suggests that the policy development process is not always working as required. That a thorough consultation process needs to be undertaken, where appropriate, to prevent remedial changes in the future. Comment Officials agree that the complexity of tax does mean that a number of remedial amendments will be necessary to ensure that the tax legislation is consistent with the policy intent. This in turn helps ensure that the tax system continues to be fit for purpose. Officials do not agree that more consultation would necessarily reduce the number of remedial amendments, as many of the amendments contained in the Bill have arisen as a result of ongoing consultation. The Business Transformation change process within Inland Revenue has also identified many remedial issues and some of these are included in this report. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Securitisation vehicle amendments Submission (PwC supplementary) That there should be an ability (but not a requirement) to make a formal election into the transparency regime at the time an arrangement is established and the assets are transferred. For existing special purpose vehicles (SPVs) established before the new rules came into effect, there should be an ability (but not requirement) to make a formal election into the transparency regime from the date of the election or from the beginning of the subsequent income year. That the requirement that all originators be members of the same wholly-owned group of companies be removed from the definition of “originator” in section YA1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The key requirement should be that assets appear on the consolidated financial statements of the person assuming the tax obligations of the SPV, or the consolidated financial statements of a wholly-owned group company. Alternatively, if the restriction on third party originated receivables is not completely relaxed, the definition of “originator” should be amended so that the requirements are only required to be met form the effective date of the election. 182 Comment Officials note that the submission raises issues that would require prioritisation and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Amend sections RC 29 and RC 33 to ensure provisional tax is correctly calculated Submission (Matter raised by officials) Sections RC 29 and RC 33 of the Income Tax Act 2007 outline how a new consolidated group or amalgamated company should calculate their standard method uplift amount of provisional tax. The standard method uses either 105% of the preceding year current year-1 (CY-1) or 110% of the year prior to the preceding year (CY-2). Currently both sections RC 29 and 33 only refer to the CY-1 calculation. These should also refer to the CY-2 year where the entities forming the group or amalgamated company have yet to file their CY-1 tax return and can therefore only base their provisional tax on the CY-2 residual income tax. It is recommended sections RC 29 and 33 be amended to refer to both the CY-1 and CY-2 calculations “as applicable” for the 2020−21 and later income years. Comment Although taxpayers have practically been applying this rule it should be corrected in the legislation. A number of tax agents have raised this with us as an issue that should be clarified. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Standardise the term “person with an initial provisional tax liability” Submission (Matter raised by officials) A person with an initial provisional tax liability is essentially a person who is in the provisional tax regime for the first time. The Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Income Tax Act 2007 use a number of different terms for a “person with an initial provisional tax 183 liability” including “new provisional taxpayer” and “person with a new provisional tax liability”. This can create confusion when all these terms mean the same thing. It is recommended these terms be standardised as “person with an initial provisional tax liability”, to avoid confusion, from the 2020−21 and later income years. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Ensure the definition of “taxable activity” includes partners in a partnership and members of unincorporated bodies Submission (Matter raised by officials) In determining whether a person has an initial provisional tax liability the definition of “taxable activity” is used to determine if someone has started a business. This definition refers to the definition in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. This Act, however, excludes partners of partnerships and members of other unincorporated bodies as, for GST purposes, it is the partnership/unincorporated body which is carrying on the taxable activity. This appears to be a loophole which is not consistent with the framework of the provisional tax regime as these entities are look-through entities they are not themselves subject to provisional tax. It is recommended this definition be amended to ensure that for the purposes of the provisional tax rules partners and members of unincorporated bodies are considered to be undertaking the taxable activity rather than the partnership from the 2020−21 and later income years. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Ensure the early payment discount applies as intended Submission (Matter raised by officials) Inland Revenue’s legal team have identified an issue with the legislation and the application of the early payment discount to taxpayers who meet the criteria. Inland Revenue’s systems are currently applying the law as it should apply, however, to improve certainty for taxpayers we recommend that the legislation be aligned. 184 It is proposed that section RC 37 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is amended to ensure that the early payment discount applies as intended by changing the wording “not liable to pay provisional tax” to “liable to pay provisional tax under section RC 3(1)(a) but not obligated to make any payments under section RC 3(3)”. The proposed amendment would apply from the 2020−21 and later income years. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarify the definition of “provisional tax” Submission (Matter raised by officials) The current wording of section 120L of the Tax Administration Act 1994 refers to “provisional tax” which is not defined. This item should include both provisional tax and any late payment penalties on that provisional tax. It is proposed that section 120L of the Income Tax Act 2007 is amended to ensure that the term “provisional tax” includes any late payment penalties in relation to that provisional tax from the 2020−21 and later income years. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Align the treatment of overpaid tax by a company using the accounting income method (AIM) with tax paid on behalf of AIM shareholders Submission (Matter raised by officials) There are two ways in which an AIM company can transfer overpaid tax to its shareholders. The first is where the company creates a provision for shareholder employees’ salary and pays tax on that on behalf of the shareholders to enable the company to take a tax deduction for the provision. In this situation the company acts as an “agent” for the shareholder employee and the tax is “transferred” as a tax credit reducing the shareholder employee’s residual tax liability. The second situation is where the company overpays tax most likely because shareholder remuneration is not deducted by the company until the end of the year in which case the overpayment transfers at the shareholder’s provisional tax dates. 185 These rules should be standardised to simplify them for taxpayers and reduce compliance and administration costs. It is proposed that the treatment of overpayments by an AIM company be standardised so that in both situations the transfer will reduce the residual income tax of the shareholder employee (subject to the safeguards that already exist to reduce the ability to game the rules). The proposed amendment would apply from the 2019−20 income year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Inclusion of a tolerance for provisional tax instalments Submission (Matter raised by officials) The Tax Administration Act 1994 contains a safe harbour provision from the application of use-of-money interest (UOMI) to some provisional taxpayers. The safe harbour applies where a taxpayer has residual income tax that is less than $60,000, they have used the standard uplift provisional tax calculation method and they paid all their instalments as required. The result of this concession is that no UOMI is charged on any unpaid tax until the taxpayer’s terminal tax date (which is generally February of the year after the income year where the liability arises). If the safe harbour does not apply, then UOMI would generally apply from the date of their final instalment of provisional tax for the income year in question. This is generally nine months earlier than the terminal tax date. Thus, the safe harbour provides a significant concession to those who fit the criteria. Some issues have arisen the result of which is that a small underpayment is providing an adverse result to taxpayers that is disproportionate to the error being made. In one case a taxpayer who accidently underpaid their instalments by 30 cents resulted in a UOMI bill of $2,400 because of the loss of the protection of the safe harbour. It is proposed that a tolerance be included in the legislation to deal with these issues. This tolerance will allow taxpayers to retain the benefits of the safe harbour even though they underpaid by a small amount. We recommend the amount of the tolerance be $20 per instalment which aligns to the amount of the small balance write-off amount (for tax other than auto-calculation assessments ). This will ensure that a person who underpays by small amounts will not be disproportionately penalised for that omission. Officials also recommend this amendment be retrospective to the 2017−18 income year to address the existing cases where this adverse outcome had occurred. 186 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Amend the definition of “START tax type” in the Tax Administration Act 1994 to include Release 4 tax types Submission (Matter raised by officials) Release 4 of Business Transformation will migrate more tax types onto Inland Revenue’s new technology platform, START. Section 183C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 deals with rules around the cancellation of interest. These rules are specific to the START platform only and as taxes migrate to that platform the rules for cancellation of interest change over what was done in the old technology platform, FIRST. It is necessary to include those tax types that are being migrated to START as part of Release 4 in the definition of “START tax type” so that the cancellation of interest rules are applied correctly. It is proposed that these tax types be included in the definition of START tax types in the Tax Administration Act 1994: • PAYE deductions; • child support deductions made by an employer; • student loan deductions made by an employer; • KiwiSaver deductions made by an employer; • compulsory employer KiwiSaver contributions; and • specified superannuation contribution tax (SSCWT or ESCT or both). The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2020 when Release 4 of Business Transformation goes live. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 187 Issue: Adding START tax types to section 184A(5) of the Tax Administration Act Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials recommend an amendment to section 184A(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to include reserve schemes and unclaimed monies in the definition of tax, for the purpose of this section. Comment As part of the Business Transformation Release 4, new tax types are being introduced into START. With the inclusion of the new tax types Inland Revenue is able to direct credit returns through section 184A. However, some of the tax types included in Release 4 do not fall within the definition of tax in section 184A(5) but should be added. The proposed new tax types to be included are: • reserve schemes (income equalisation schemes and environmental restoration account schemes); and • unclaimed monies for the purpose of the Unclaimed Money Act 1971. The proposed amendment would apply from the date of assent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Income tax treatment of Nga Whenua Rahui kawenata Submission (NSA Tax) Amounts received in respect of a Nga Whenua Rahui kawenata for a specified term pursuant to section 77A of the Reserves Act 1977 should be excluded from being income. Comment The intention of the current amendment is to ensure that payments for the grant of a permanent easement are not subject to tax. This submission suggests that a separate exclusion should be provided for a Nga Whenua Rahui kawenata. Officials consider that this submission raises further issues that would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 188 Issue: The monetary system Submission (John Tax) The submitter raised a number of concerns with the monetary system generally. Comment Officials consider these concerns to be out of the scope of a tax bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Tax rates Submission (John Tax, R Craig) Submitters proposed a flat rate of tax to reduce the complexity of the tax system (John Tax) and introducing a tax-free threshold to assist low income earners. (R Craig) Comment It is unlikely that a flat rate of tax would significantly reduce the complexity of the tax system. Much of the complexity of the tax system is because of the need to define what is taxed, rather than the rate at which it should be taxed. If the objective of introducing a tax-free threshold is to assist low income households, then a tax-free threshold is unlikely to be the most effective policy. Transfers (for example, welfare benefits or tax credits) are generally better targeted than income tax reductions for this group. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 189 Maintenance items 191 MAINTENANCE ITEMS (Clauses 7(1), 72–74, 78, 80, 85, 98, 100, 102, 111, 112, 113(3), (4), 113(11), (12), (15), 116– 118, 135, and 138) Issue: Proposed amendments are supported Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) That the proposed maintenance amendments in the clauses listed above are supported.

3 OVERVIEW The Bill introduces a tax credit for research and development (R&D) conducted by businesses in New Zealand from the 2019–2020 income year. The Government has set a target of raising the total amount of R&D performed in New Zealand to two percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2028. To meet this goal, there needs to be a significant increase in the amount of business R&D performed in New Zealand. By providing a tax incentive in the form of a tax credit, the Government will lower the cost to businesses of performing R&D. This will create an incentive for firms already performing R&D to do more, and for other firms to start undertaking R&D. The rationale for providing R&D tax credits to businesses is that there is under-investment by businesses in R&D because the investing firm does not capture all the benefits of the investment. Some of the benefit is captured by other businesses or consumers, rather than by the investing firm. The tax credit is intended to provide an offset for the likely spill-over benefits to other firms and individuals in New Zealand. This is expected to help transform the New Zealand economy into a high-skill, knowledge-based economy. There will be an evaluation of the tax credit in five years to determine whether it is effective in meeting these objectives. A tax credit has been selected as the instrument for providing the subsidy because of the wide reach of the tax system. The tax system also provides certainty because firms can access support based on predefined rules. The tax credit is available for eligible businesses that have incurred eligible expenditure on R&D activities. Below is a high-level summary of how the credit works, the eligibility criteria for the credit (set out in the Bill as introduced into Parliament), and the main themes from submissions. How the credit works The tax credit is used to offset the income tax payable by claimants who are in a tax paying position. Limited refundability (up to $255,000) is available to some businesses in loss, or with insufficient tax payable to offset all their tax credits. To be eligible for limited refundability, a business must be a company (but not a listed company), must not derive exempt income, and twenty percent or more of its labour costs must be R&D- related. The Government has committed to reviewing and potentially introducing revised refundabilit y criteria fro m 1 April 2020. Eligibility requirements Eligible person To be eligible for the tax credit a person must: • Perform a core R&D activity in New Zealand, or have a contractor perform one on their behalf; • Carry on business through a fixed establishment in New Zealand (unless the person is a tax charit y or levy body); 4 • Have controlling rights in relation to the core R&D activity (or ensure these rights are held by a member of the person’s corporate group); and • Own the results of their R&D activities or have the right to use the results of the activities for no further consideration. The person can also satisfy the ownership requirement if the results of their R&D activities are owned by a member of their corporate group, as long as that company is a tax resident of a jurisdiction with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement. A person is not eligible if they meet one or more of the following: • Fail to file their income tax return and R&D supplementary return in time; • Receive a Callaghan Innovation Growth Grant for any part of the relevant income year; • Are an R&D contractor for the R&D activity; • Are, or are controlled by or associated with, a Crown research institute, district health board, or tertiary education organisation. R&D activity A core R&D activity is an activity that: • Is conducted using a systematic approach; • Has a material purpose of: − Creating new knowledge, or new or improved processes, services, or goods; and − Resolving scientific or technological uncertainty; and • Is performed in New Zealand; and • Has its day-to-day management conducted in New Zealand. An activity does not satisfy the uncertainty requirement if the knowledge required to resolve the uncertainty is: • Publicly available; or • Deducible by a competent professional working in the relevant scientific or technological field. An activity that does not satisfy the core R&D activity definition may be eligible as a supporting R&D activity provided it is inextricably linked to a core R&D activity. Certain activities are expressly excluded from being core R&D or supporting R&D activities. Eligible expenditure • A person needs to have approved research provider expenditure, or at least $50,000 of eligible R&D expenditure, to be eligible for the credit. 5 • The maximum amount a person can claim is $120m, unless they have received approval from the Commissioner to exceed this amount. • Most types of expenditure incurred on R&D activities are eligible, including expenditure on wages and salaries, consumables, depreciation, and the costs of creating intangible property. • Some expenditure is expressly excluded. This includes the up-front cost of acquiring assets, amounts that go towards creating tangible depreciable assets, interest, expenditure that relates to Government grants, and some employee-related expenditure. • Some expenditure is capped: − Eighty percent of amounts paid to R&D contractors (people paid to do R&D on behalf of claimants) is eligible. − A $3 million cap applies to eligible internal software development expenditure. − No more than ten percent of a person’s claim can relate to expenditure on R&D activities performed overseas. • Where expenditure is incurred on an R&D activity performed in the course of commercial production, a person’s claim is limited to the additional expenditure incurred because of that R&D activit y. Submissions Thirt y-two submissions were received on the R&D tax credit legislation. Most generally support the introduction of the credit. General themes were that sustainability and longevity of the regime are important, as well as clear legislation and guidelines. Eligibility of software R&D • Core R&D activity definition too narrow: the current core R&D activity definition is too narrow in the context of software. Software development activities are unlikely to have a material purpose of resolving scientific or technological uncertainty. • Internal software development cap too low: the $3 million cap on internal software development expenditure is too low and should be increased or removed. Expenditure on R&D contractors • Profit margin should not be split out: a principal’s R&D tax credit claim, when engaging an R&D contractor, should not be reduced by twenty percent to account for the R&D contractor’s profit margin. • Ineligible expenditure on R&D contractors should be eligible: ineligible expenditure incurred by R&D contractors should not be removed from calculations performed by principals to determine the amount of tax credit principals are entitled to. Foreign R&D expenditure cap • The foreign R&D expenditure cap is too low: the ten percent cap that applies to foreign expenditure is too low and should be increased. 6 • Cap applies too broadly: the cap should not apply to non-residents who perform R&D in New Zealand. Refundability • Broad refundability from year-one: there should be a broader refundability mechanism from the first year of the regime. • Entities that derive exempt income: the exclusion from refundability for entities that derive exempt income is too broad. Eligibility criteria • Sole control requirement may exclude joint ventures (JVs): the requirement that each claimant must have “sole” control over their R&D activities prevents JVs from being eligible for the credit. Only one JV member can have “sole” control, but in practice multiple members of a JV will often have control over the JV’s R&D. • Ownership requirement may exclude JVs: the requirement that each claimant own the results of their R&D activities would be difficult to meet for JVs. Businesses working together in a JV may not all own the results of the JV’s R&D activities. • R&D contractor exclusion may exclude subsidiaries of multinationals: subsidiaries of multinationals performing R&D in New Zealand on behalf of foreign parents should not be ineligible under the R&D contractor exclusion. In-year approval • Providing supporting information before claims declined: claimants whose applications would otherwise be declined should have the opportunity to provide additional information in support of their application first. • Allow significant performers to access general approval regime: a person who opts into the significant performer regime should also be able to obtain general approval for some of their R&D activities (if, for example, they are uncertain about the eligibility of the activities). • Extend general approval to include supporting R&D activities: the general approval process should be extended to include supporting activities. • In-year approval pilot in year one: the significant performer approval process should be available as early as possible, with the submitter wanting to be involved in a pilot process. • R&D certifier penalty regime overly punitive: the process for revoking R&D certifier status is overly punitive and should be amended. Other submissions • R&D expenditure should be recognised on an accruals basis: this would make the treatment of R&D expenditure more consistent with how expenditure is generally recognised for tax purposes. • Employee-related payments should be eligible: currently, expenditure on employee share schemes, bonuses, employee recruitment and relocation is ineligible. 7 • Orders in Council power needs constraints: Lack of appropriate criteria to limit the power, and no requirement that affected parties are consulted. 9 GENERAL SUBMISSIONS Issue: General support Submission (EY, PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund, Fisher & Paykel Limited, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, Corporate Taxpayers Group, ExportNZ, ManufacturingNZ, Zespri, Air New Zealand Limited) We support the introduction of the R&D tax credit. Comment Officials welcome the support. Recommendation That the submission be noted, no further action required. Issue: Support for refinement of proposals since the discussion document Submission (Air New Zealand Limited, EY, PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund, Fisher & Paykel Limited, ExportNZ, ManufacturingNZ) We support the refinement of the proposals since the discussion document. (EY, PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund, Fisher & Paykel Limited, ExportNZ, ManufacturingNZ) We are pleased that state owned enterprises (SOEs) will be eligible for the credit. (Air New Zealand Limited) We support the Government replacing the dual-purpose rule that was proposed in the discussion document with the commercial production rule. (ExportNZ, ManufacturingNZ) Comment Officials welcome the support. Recommendation That the submission be noted, no further action required. 10 Issue: Integrity and sustainability of the regime must be balanced against compliance and administrative costs Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY) The regime must have longevity and stability. Taxpayers need certainty because they invest considerable effort in understanding new tax regimes. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Integrity is essential but must be balanced against compliance and administrative costs. (EY) Comment Officials welcome this perspective. The incentive has been designed with integrity measures to help ensure it is sustainable. These measures have been balanced with compliance and administrative costs. Recommendation That the submission be noted, no further action required. Issue: The effect of the R&D tax credit on business expenditure on R&D Submission (Fisher & Paykel Limited, NZTech, PwC) The R&D tax incentive has the potential to significantly grow business expenditure on R&D, increase demand for highly skilled and well-paid jobs, and generate a wealth of technical knowledge and capability in New Zealand. (Fisher & Paykel Limited) The R&D tax incentive will lead to more tech investment. (NZTech) We have concerns about the R&D tax incentive in its current form, primarily because it will exclude a lot of software development. It is questionable whether it delivers upon the Government’s policy intent of increasing private sector R&D in New Zealand. (PwC) Comment Officials welcome the perspective that the R&D tax incentive will increase R&D in New Zealand. Officials note the concern about the form of the R&D tax incentive. One reason for requiring a 5- yearly evaluation (refer to proposed new section LY 10) of the regime is to ensure the policy is achieving its objectives. The Government has decided to put in place the R&D tax credit because the credit offers wide applicability and reach. It also provides certainty and predictability to businesses and is expected to help support long-term investment decisions. 11 By providing a tax incentive in the form of a tax credit, the Government aims to lower the cost to businesses of performing R&D. This will create an incentive for firms already performing R&D to do more, and for other firms to start undertaking R&D. The accessibility of the tax incentive for software development has been considered throughout the development of the policy. Whether to have a separate activity definition relating to software was considered but rejected because of the difficult boundaries this would create, especially as a lot of software development is integrated within other product or service development. Officials note that the activity definition has the same structure that applies in other jurisdictions such as Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. Canada, for instance, requires activities to advance knowledge or technology, and explains in guidance that this involves attempting to resolve scientific or technological uncertainty. These schemes support a wide range of software projects and the same outcome is expected in New Zealand. The published guidelines provide examples of software projects that would qualify for the tax incentive. Recommendation That the submission be noted, no further action required. Issue: R&D tax credit as part of a suite of incentives Submission (PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund, Roger Ford, NZRise) We support the R&D tax credit being part of a suite of R&D incentives. (PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund) The R&D tax incentive should be part of a suite of incentives. There has been no clear articulation of the context the incentive and the Government’s overall R&D strategy. (Roger Ford, NZRise) Comment The R&D tax credit is only part of a suite of incentives available to encourage R&D by businesses. Callaghan Innovation continues to operate R&D Project Grants and a range of other initiatives aimed at increasing R&D. The Government is also developing a Research Science & Innovation Strategy, which will (among other things) set out how it plans to achieve the goal of raising R&D to two percent of GDP by 2028. It will include further initiatives to elicit the step-change in business R&D that will be required. Recommendation That the submission be noted, no further action required. 12 ELIGIBLE BUSINESS Issue: R&D controlling rights requirement should be deleted (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 3(1)(c))) Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund, Russell McVeagh, Zespri) Proposed new section LY 3(1)(c) (the controlling rights requirement) should be deleted: • The “sole” controlling rights requirement only allows one person to have controlling rights. This is problematic because in a JV more than one party might have the right to stop, start or change the direction of the JV’s R&D activities. • R&D contractors are excluded already through an explicit exclusion (proposed new LY 3(2)(c)). The ownership/right to use requirement in LY 3(1)(d) should also exclude R&D contractors, because R&D contractors are unlikely to own the results of the R&D activities they perform on behalf of other people. • The controlling rights requirement is inconsistent with commercial practice for service contracts. It is unusual for a principal to have the sole right to stop contracted activities. A contractor would normally reserve the right to cease their activities should a principal fail to pay for their services as agreed. • It is unclear what “change the direction of an activity” and “choose whether results are followed up on or not” mean, and how these R&D controlling rights would be documented in commercial contracts. Comment Proposed new section LY 3(1)(c) requires a person (or a person in the same group of companies as the person) to have the sole right to control their R&D activities (“R&D controlling rights”). This includes the right to start and stop an activity and change its direction. The controlling rights requirement is aimed at ensuring that R&D contractors are not able to claim for R&D activities they perform for other people. It is expected that only principals will have controlling rights. It is the policy intent that joint ventures and informal R&D collaborations be eligible for the R&D tax incentive. Officials agree with the rationale provided by submitters for deleting LY 3(1)(c). In the absence of the controlling rights requirement in LY 3(1)(c), other criteria in the legislation should exclude R&D contractors from claiming tax credits for expenditure they incur performing R&D activities on behalf of other people. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 13 Issue: Subsidiary performing R&D on behalf of multinational parent company (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 3(2)(c))) Submission (EY, Fisher &Paykel Appliances Ltd) A subsidiary of a multinational company performing R&D in New Zealand should be able to receive the R&D tax credit. Comment The policy intent is for subsidiaries of multinationals to be eligible for R&D activities if they perform R&D activities on behalf of foreign parents. As currently drafted it may be unclear whether proposed new section LY 3 (in conjunction with the proposed new definition of “research and development contractor” in YA 1) allows a subsidiary of a foreign company doing R&D in New Zealand on behalf of its foreign parent to qualify for the R&D tax incentive. Section LY 3(2)(c) provides that an R&D contractor is not eligible for the tax credit. An R&D contractor is defined to include a person who performs an R&D activity on behalf of another person. Section LY 3(1)(b) prevents a person who does not carry on business through a fixed establishment in New Zealand from claiming the credit. The Bill as introduced could be interpreted so that it excludes: • A New Zealand subsidiary performing R&D activities on behalf of its foreign parent, because of the R&D contractor exclusion in LY 3(2)(c); and • The foreign parent of the subsidiary performing R&D on its behalf in New Zealand, because of the fixed establishment requirement in LY 3(1)(b). The general intention is that only principals can claim the credit, and not R&D contractors, so that the person who decides to invest in the R&D is incentivised. This is especially the case where both the principal and contractor are based in New Zealand, and (absent the R&D contractor exclusion in section LY 3(2)(c)) would both potentially be eligible for the tax credit. Officials recommend that the R&D contractor exclusion in LY 3(2)(c) be amended so that it allows an R&D contractor to be eligible for activities they perform on behalf of other people, where: • the R&D contractor satisfies the tax credit eligibility criteria (ignoring the existing R&D contractor exclusion in LY 3(2)(c)); and • the principal does not carry on business through a fixed establishment in New Zealand (that is, the principal is essentially based off-shore and would not itself be eligible for the tax credit). The aim of the R&D tax credit is to encourage R&D to be undertaken in New Zealand, because of the spill-overs associated with R&D being physically performed in New Zealand. A principal who does not carry on business through a fixed establishment in New Zealand is not eligible for the tax credit. Therefore, allowing a New Zealand-based R&D contractor to be eligible in this 14 situation will incentivise the performance of R&D activities in New Zealand without the risk of the same expenditure qualifying for the tax credit twice. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: The R&D ownership requirement in the context of joint-ventures and commercialisation partnerships (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 3(1)(d))) Submission (PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund, KiwiNet, Auckland UniServices Limited) The requirement that a claimant must own the results of their R&D or have the right to use the results for no further consideration may prevent JVs from qualifying. Businesses working together in a JV may not necessarily own the results of the JV’s R&D, or there may be restrictions on their use of the R&D results. Further, commercialisation arrangements exist whereby a business is furthering the R&D that was started by another party, with the results of that further R&D being licensed back to the business for consideration. These parties would not be able to access the credit, but there is no good policy reason to exclude such businesses provided the R&D activities are undertaken in New Zealand. (PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund) “Consideration” in LY 3(d)(ii) should be defined. It is unclear how the rules apply to a commercialisation entity under a commercial partnership model. This is where a public research organisation has advanced a research discovery to where there is a possibility for commercialisation. A commercialisation entity is formed – shareholders being private sector investors and the public research organisation. The intellectual property is held by the public research organisation and often licensed to the commercialisation entity, usually for no financial consideration. Absent a definition of consideration, however, there is a risk that where a commercialisation entity enters into a commercial arrangement that requires the provision of non- financial consideration in exchange for using the results of R&D, the commercialisation entity would be ineligible for the R&D tax credit. Commercialisation entities are currently eligible under the Callaghan Innovation Growth Grants regime and should continue to be eligible for support through the R&D tax credit. (KiwiNet, Auckland UniServices Limited, PwC) Comment Officials are sympathetic with the argument that not all parties to a JV may necessarily own the results of the JV’s R&D or have the right to use the results of the R&D for no considerat ion. Officials also consider that individual members of JVs may struggle to satisfy the criteria in section LY 3(1)(a) and (b). Section LY 3(1)(a) requires a claimant to have a core activity. Section LY 3(1)(b) requires a claimant to carry on a business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment. For example, neither member of a JV will be eligible (applying the Bill as introduced) where one member provides the funding and the other performs the R&D activities. 15 Officials recommend that joint ventures are able to satisfy all limbs in LY 3(1) as a collective, similar to how the rules operate for partnerships. In addition to this amendment, officials also recommend that section LY 3(2)(e) is amended so a member of a JV is ineligible if the member is not New Zealand tax resident. This second amendment brings the JV rules in line with the existing partnership rules in subpart LY and ensures that a member of a JV can only receive an R&D tax credit if they themselves have sufficient ties to New Zealand to be considered a New Zealand tax resident. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Allocation of R&D tax credits to members of Joint Ventures Submission (Matter raised by officials) That the R&D tax credit is allocated to members of JVs in accordance with their interest in the JV. Comment Officials recommend that the R&D tax credit is allocated to members of JVs in accordance with each member’s interest in the JV. This is similar to the treatment of partnerships. For partners in partnership, each partner receives R&D tax credits in accordance with their interest in the partnership. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Definition of “on behalf of” in the context of contractors (Clause 21(15), clause 10 (proposed new section LY 3)) Submission (EY) The legislation should define what “on behalf of” means in the context of an R&D contractor performing R&D on behalf of another person. Comment Officials recommend that the meaning of “on behalf of” is clarified in guidance. A key consideration is whether a claimant is contracting for: 16 • an outcome, for example producing a product – claimant is unlikely to be an R&D contractor); or • to perform an R&D activity – claimant is likely to be an R&D contractor. Control over an R&D activity, ownership of the results of an R&D activity, who bears the financial risk are also relevant considerations. A claimant that funds, controls, and owns the results of an R&D activity is highly likely to be considered a principal in respect of the R&D activity. Note that whilst officials recommend removing the controlling requirement in section LY 3(1)(c), control is still relevant when determining whether a person is performing R&D “on behalf of” another person. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Adopting the “on behalf of” test from 2008 tax credit regime (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 3)) Submission (KPMG) Separate out the control and ownership eligibility tests from the rest of LY 3, and group them together under a single concept, similar to the legislative framework used for the “on own behalf of” tests in the 2008 R&D tax credit regime (which required financial risk, ownership, and control over R&D activities). Comment Officials acknowledge that it is important the legislation is not confusing for taxpayers, and that many taxpayers are familiar with the “on behalf of” tests used in the 2008 tax credit regime. The proposed R&D tax credit regime is aimed at incentivising R&D that occurs in New Zealand because of the positive externalities associated with R&D being performed in New Zealand. Provided a taxpayer’s R&D activities are performed in New Zealand, the proposed regime is less concerned with whether the funding for the R&D activities comes from overseas, who ultimately owns the results of the R&D activities, and whether the activities are controlled by a New Zealand or foreign-based entity. As long as only one person can make a claim in respect of the relevant eligible expenditure and the R&D activities are performed in New Zealand, the proposed regime is intended to provide support for the activities through an R&D tax credit. In saying this, control, ownership and financial risk are still relevant to determining the meaning of “on behalf of” and therefore who is a principal or who is a contractor. Officials consider that this is best clarified in guidance, rather than in legislation. 17 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Contractor performing activities outside New Zealand resulting in ineligibility (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 3(1)(a))) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) A “to the extent” test should be added to subsection LY 3(1)(a) to ensure that to the extent a research and development contractor performs activities outside New Zealand, the person for whom those activities are performed is not ineligible for the R&D tax credit. Comment Officials disagree with the submitter. Section LY 3(1)(a) simply provides that the R&D rules apply to a person where a contractor performs a core R&D activity in New Zealand on their behalf. There is nothing to suggest that all their activities will be rendered ineligible if an activity is performed outside New Zealand – just those ones performed outside New Zealand may not be eligible. This point will be clarified in guidance. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Restrict ownership requirement to core R&D activities (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY3(1)(d))) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) It should be sufficient to own the results of core R&D activities, not also supporting activities. There are situations where supporting activities may include trials that are outsourced to a third party, and the third party undertaking those trials may own these results. The person performing the R&D should still be eligible despite the results of the support activity being controlled by other persons. Comment Officials disagree with the submitter. A person’s outsourced supporting activities (for example, tri als outsourced to a third party) may still qualify if the person owns the results or is able to use the results for no consideration, despite the third party owning the results. 18 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Half of intellectual property rights should be held by New Zealand (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 3(1)(d))) Submission (TEPHRA) Intellectual property rights should be held fifty percent by New Zealand and placed in the New Zealand superfund trust for the future. Comment Officials disagree with the submitter. The focus of the credit is on where the R&D activity is performed, not creation or ownership of the intellectual property. Giving effect to the submission would require a different framework for how the Government has decided to support research and development activity. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Contractually allocating rights to the results (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 3(1)(d)(ii))) Submission (Fletcher Building Limited) Subsection LY 3(1)(d)(ii) should be amended to allow parties to contractually allocate their rights to the results of the R&D activities to another person. Comment A person can contractually allocate their rights to the results of the R&D activities to another person, provided they still own the results (or a person in the same corporate group owns the results) or have the right to use the results for no consideration. Recommendation That the submission be noted, no further action required. 19 Issue: Using the results of the R&D within a corporate group (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 3(1)(d)(ii))) Submission (Russell McVeagh) A person should be able to satisfy LY 3(1)(d)(ii) if a member of their corporate group has the rights to use the results of the person’s R&D activity for no further consideration. Comment The Bill proposes that where neither a person nor their corporate group own the results of the R&D activities performed, the person will only be eligible if they may use the results of the R&D for no consideration. Subsidising R&D activities where a New Zealand company is required to pay to use the results of their R&D activity would degrade the externalities produced from the subsidised R&D performed in New Zealand. If there is evidence that this rule creates a significant barrier to the performance of R&D in New Zealand, then consideration could be given to amending the rule. Officials do not recommend amending the rule at this stage. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: New Zealand parent company should be able to own the results of the R&D (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 3(1)(d)(i))) Submission (Matter raised by officials) Subsection LY 3(1)(d)(i) should be amended to include a company that is resident in New Zealand. Comment Proposed new section LY 3(1)(d)(i) provides that a person satisfies the subsection where a company that is both resident in a country with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement, and in the same group of companies as the person, owns the results of the R&D activit y. As currently worded, a person would not satisfy this requirement where the parent company in New Zealand owned the results of the R&D, as New Zealand does not have a DTA with itself. This was unintended. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 20 Issue: Exclusion of non-resident partners and owners of look-through companies (Proposed new section LY 3(2)(e)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Unsure why a non-resident partner or non-resident owner of an interest in a look-through company is ineligible, if the person carries on business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment. Comment Absent this exclusion, claimants who do not have a New Zealand fixed establishment will be able to receive the R&D tax credit. The tax incentive has been designed to ensure that only people with sufficient presence in New Zealand receive R&D tax credits. This is important from an integrity perspective because claimants with ties to New Zealand are easier to follow up with if, for example, a claim is reassessed downwards, and credits need to be repaid (which is especially important for recipients of R&D tax credit refunds). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Growth Grant exclusion should be narrower (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 3(2)(b))) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Growth Grant recipients should also be able to receive the R&D tax credit, to the extent that the R&D undertaken is not covered by the Growth Grant. The exclusion for Growth Grant recipients should also not preclude those who choose to have their Growth Grant extended to 31 March 2020 from receiving an R&D tax credit for eligible R&D undertaken after this date. For example, a Growth Grant recipient with a 31 December 2021 balance date should be able to receive a Growth Grant for R&D undertaken from 1 January 2021 to 31 March 2021, and R&D tax credits for R&D undertaken from 1 April 2021 to 31 December 2021. Comment The Callaghan Innovation Growth Grant scheme will end on 31 March 2021. The R&D Grants Ministerial Direction has been implemented to effect this change. The R&D tax incentive replaces the Growth Grant, so claimants must make a decision as to which form of government assistance suits them best, and the best transition approach for their business. 21 For some recipients, this may mean ending their Growth Grant in 2020 to avoid a gap in their R&D funding. Alternatively, claimants may claim the Growth Grant for part of the year, and then claim the R&D tax incentive from the start of the next year. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Association test should be narrower (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 3(2)(d))) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) A person should not be excluded from the R&D tax credit if they are associated with a Crown research institute (CRI), district health board (DHB), or tertiary education organisation (TEO) under sections YB 6 to YB 9 (these sections associate beneficiaries of trusts with other trust participants). Absent this, inadvertent association may be formed with a CRI, DHB or TEO if they are beneficiaries of a trust which undertakes R&D. Comment Officials disagree with this submission. The associated person rules apply in many areas of the tax system without modificat ion. The operation of this rule will be monitored once the regime comes into force, to ensure it gives rise to appropriate results. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Non-business researcher – industry organisations (Clause 21(13)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The eligibility rules need to be flexible enough to allow industry organisations to qualify when they operate under a mixture of different organisation types. For example, the rules need to enable an incorporated society (which receives levies) with a one hundred percent investment in a company who undertakes R&D to be eligible for the incentive. 22 Comment Officials agree that the rules should be flexible to accommodate, as much as possible, the various corporate structures that claimants use. Officials have recommended that amendments are made to better enable JVs to qualify for the incentive. Officials consider that the situation described by the submitter would be eligible under the existing provisions in the Bill as introduced. The company would receive R&D tax credits, which the incorporated society could benefit from through dividends paid by the company to the incorporated society. Recommendation That the submission be noted, no further action required. Issue: Consolidated groups (Proposed new sections 68CB and 68CC, subpart LY and any associated provisions) Submission (EY) Consideration should be given to how the in-year approval rules will apply to businesses that are members of a consolidated tax group. Comment Officials agree with this submission. No changes are required to the legislation, but the treatment of consolidated tax groups will be taken into account operationally when designing the systems and processes for R&D tax credit claims. The treatment of consolidated tax groups will be clarified in guidance. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 23 R&D ACTIVITY DEFINITION Issue: Alternative R&D activity definitions (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 2)) Submission (Roger Ford, PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund) The R&D definition needs to be brought in line with international best practice. (Roger Ford) Having a tax credit specific definition that is different from R&D definitions for financial reporting and other tax regimes will lead to significant compliance costs for businesses. (PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund) Comment Officials consider that the proposed R&D activity definitions are in line wit h international best practice. It is based on the Frascati Manual (an OECD publication) and has the same elements as the tax credit definition used in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. Some modifications to the core R&D activity definition were made following the release of the discussion document to make it more inclusive of all sectors of the economy. Officials consider it necessary to have a definition of R&D activity that differs from the accounting standard. The accounting standard is based on creating a boundary between expensed and capitalised expenditure and does not have the robustness that is preferred for distinguishing between expenditure that is eligible for a subsidy and expenditure that is not. This robustness is achieved in the R&D tax incentive definition through the introduction of the scientific and technological uncertainty test. While differences between the proposed R&D activity definitions and existing definitions already used in New Zealand (such as the definition used for the R&D tax loss credit) will increase compliance costs, officials note the Government has commenced further work to review the R&D tax loss credit. Recommendation That the submissions be declined, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Core R&D activity – day-to-day management (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 2(1)(a)(iv))) Submission (EY, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG) This requirement should be: 24 • Deleted (EY, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) • Defined (Deloitte) • Amended (Corporate Taxpayers Group) • Moved to section LY 3(1)(c) and reconciled with the controlling rights requirement (KPMG) Comment The day-to-day management requirement in proposed new section LY 2(1)(a)(iv) currently forms part of the core R&D activity definition. Officials agree with EY and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand’s suggestion that this provision be deleted. The day-to-day management requirement does not add any additional rigour to the core R&D activity definition. There is already a requirement that to be a core activity, an activity must be performed in New Zealand (section LY 2(1)(c)). If a person performs their R&D activity in New Zealand, day-to-day management of that activity must also (impliedly) take place in New Zealand. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Core R&D activity – material purpose (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 2(1)(a)(ii) and (iii))) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY) The use of “material purpose” is likely to result in uncertainty, because materiality is generally applied as an accounting concept relating to whether misstatements could reasonably be expected to influence the decisions of users. There is a risk that the definition could include the accounting definit ion of material, which could be as low as five percent. Material purpose should be replaced with “significant purpose” or a purpose that is “not minor or incidental”. Comment Officials disagree with the submitters. Accounting concepts are not relevant in determining the meaning of “material” in this context because the R&D tax incentive regime is tax-based. “Material” is not defined in the legislation. The Oxford Dictionary defines material as meaning “significant” or “important”. The meaning of “material” and how this limb applies to claimants will be clarified further in the guidelines. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 25 Issue: Core R&D activity – remove “working” from the competent professional test (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 2(1)(b)(ii))) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, Deloitte) “Working” should be removed from the phrase “a competent professional working in the relevant scientific or technological field”. The inclusion of the term “working” makes the test too restrictive because it could exclude the knowledge of academics or professionals who are relevant and knowledgeable but not necessarily “working” in the relevant field. Comment Officials agree with the submitters. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Core R&D activity – knowledge required to resolve the uncertainty (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 2(1)(b))) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The wording “knowledge required to resolve the uncertainty” should be replaced with “knowledge required that resolves the uncertainty” to make clear that the answer to resolve the uncertainty must be publicly available or deducible by a competent professional, rather than just the process. In other words, if the person knows the process to resolve the uncertainty but doesn’t know the outcome, this should be sufficient uncertainty to qualify for the tax credit. Comment Officials disagree with the submitters. If the person knows an existing methodology or process to resolve the uncertainty, then it is not the kind of uncertainty that is eligible for the tax credit. The tax credit is available for “difficult” problems in science or technology. If a person doesn’t know the answer to a problem off the top of their head, but knows the process to determine the answer, then it is not the kind of problem that the tax incentive is seeking to incentivise the resolution of. Notwithstanding this, if what the person is trying to achieve goes beyond what is currently known to be achievable, and the person needs to investigate possible solutions, then this process of investigation could be R&D. This point will be clarified in guidance. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 26 Issue: Core R&D activity – excluding overseas activities (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 2(1)(c))) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare) Core R&D activities should be able to be performed outside New Zealand. Comment Officials disagree with the submitters. The requirement that the R&D is undertaken in New Zealand is at the heart of the tax incentive. Given that the core activity is the essential part of the R&D, requiring core activities to be undertaken in New Zealand follows logically. Activities that are performed overseas can be eligible for the tax incentive if they qualify as supporting activities. This means that an overseas activity, which in other circumstances might be considered a “core activity”, could be eligible if it supports an eligible core activity that is being undertaken in New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Supporting R&D activity definition (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 2(3))) Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY) “Required for” is too restrictive and should be removed. Many activities are undertaken to make R&D more efficient but aren’t necessarily required for the R&D to take place. (EY, Deloitte). “Only or main purpose” should be amended or removed. This part of the definition may exclude genuine expenditure on overheads in support of core R&D activities. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte). Comment Officials disagree with the submitters. The supporting R&D activity limb is designed to add precision to the questions of “when does an R&D activity start and stop” and “what is the scope of an R&D activity”. Removing parts of the definition would weaken this provisio n. Officials recommend that no changes are made to the wording of the supporting R&D activity definition. Officials recommend that the Government review the supporting R&D activity limb as the regime evolves, to ensure it continues to apply effectively and in a way that is consistent with the purpose of the R&D tax credit regime. 27 In relation to the submitters’ point on “required for”, officials note that the wording is not intended to prevent claimants from structuring their activities in the most efficient way. In response to the point on “only or main purpose”, overheads may qualify as an expense in relation to a core R&D activity. The overheads do not necessarily have to meet the supporting R&D act ivit y definit io n. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Site-specific R&D (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 2 generally)) Submission (Fletcher Building Limited) It should be made clear in legislation or guidelines that site-specific R&D will be eligible for the tax incentive. In the construction industry, there is often significant innovation arising from R&D performed at specific sites because of the unique features of the terrain. Comment Officials disagree with the suggestion to include this in legislation. This is not appropriate as there are no specific activity inclusions in the legislation. The guidelines will clarify the circumstances in which site-specific R&D may qualify for the tax credit. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 28 EXCLUDED ACTIVITIES Issue: Activities that are part of another eligible activity (Schedule 1 (proposed new schedule 21 part A)) Submission (Deloitte) The words “by themselves” should be added to the title of schedule 21 part A so that the title becomes “activities that, by themselves, are excluded from the definition of core research and development activity”. This would make clear that these activities could be part of another eligible R&D activity. Comment Officials disagree with the submitters. The suggested amendment would significantly reduce the impact of the exclusions in schedule 21. The amendment would enable claimants to argue that an excluded activity is eligible as a core R&D activity where it is performed in conjunction with another activity. This is not the policy intent. Activities excluded from the core R&D activity definition are outright excluded from being core R&D activities. These activities may be eligible as supporting R&D activities to the extent they are not also excluded from the supporting activity definition. The legislation as it currently stands is clear in this respect. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Impact of exclusions on software (Schedule 1 (proposed new schedule 21 generally)) Submission (PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund) The list of exclusions should be reconsidered from a perspective of the commercial impact on businesses, particularly the exclusions relating to software development. This includes whether the proposed R&D tax credit will result in less support than currently provided to these businesses under the Callaghan Innovation Growth Grant regime. Concerned that the exclusion for testing will place significant restriction on software development because testing is integral to the agile software development methodology. 29 Comment In developing the tax credit and associated policies, such as the transition arrangements for Growth Grant recipients, the Government has wanted to minimise any disruption to R&D performers. In switching from one scheme to another, however, it is not possible to guarantee that all firms will get the same support as they did with the Growth Grant. There are inherent differences between a tax credit and a grant. Some firms may be entitled to less money under the R&D tax credit, while other firms may be entitled to more than they would have received under the Growth Grant. Overall, the government considers that the settings within the tax credit will mean that a greater amount of support to a larger number of R&D performers will be provided. In relation to the submitters’ point about testing, testing is currently eligible as a supporting R&D activity. Recommendation That the submission be noted, no further action required. Issue: Pre-production activities, commercial viability and tooling up (Schedule 1 (proposed new schedule 21 parts A and B clause 1)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, PwC) The blanket exclusion of preproduction activities is ambiguous as all R&D is preproduction and could be caught. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY) Preproduction activities should still qualify as a supporting activity. This is still a high bar. “Tooling up” is too broad – prototyping of goods often requires tooling up where the tool will never enter commercial production. (EY) The preproduction exclusion should be limited to activities which take place after the R&D has been resolved and which take place as part of undertaking commercial production. The process of testing whether something is capable of commercial production should not be regarded as a “preproduction activity”. Demonstrating commercial viability and resolving uncertainty often occur together as part of the R&D phase. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Some technological uncertainty can still take place during preproduction and tooling up. The current exclusion is too broad and could capture activities that should be eligible, such as developing a specific tool that directly relates to a core R&D activity. Whether a product can be commercially produced – for example, whether products can be produced at sufficient volumes, within quality and cost constraints – may involve uncertainty. The exclusion should be removed, or at least amended to clarify the policy intent. Detailed guidance with examples should also be provided. (Fisher & Paykel Healthcare) There needs to be support for businesses to commercialise their R&D. (PwC) 30 Comment Clause 1 of schedule 21 parts A and B excludes from the core R&D activity and supporting R&D activity definitions respectively, “preproduction activities, including demonstration of commercial viability and tooling up”. Officials are sympathetic to the submitters’ concerns but do not recommend that the legislation is amended as an amendment may reduce the effectiveness of the exclusion. Instead, guidelines will be used to clarify how the exclusion is intended to apply. The exclusion is intended to prevent activities that occur after the scientific or technological uncertainty associated with a core R&D activity has been resolved from receiving the credit, such as commercial production. If a scientific or technological uncertainty arises which a competent professio nal cannot resolve using publicly available information, this may give rise to a separate eligible R&D activity. In response to Fisher & Paykel Healthcare’s concern, such an activity could include whether a product could be produced at scale, or within quality and cost constraints. Officials acknowledge the importance of commercialising R&D but consider standard market arrangements provide incentives for firms to do this without requiring government subsidy. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Complying with statutory requirements and standards (Schedule 1 (proposed new schedule 21 parts A and B clause 8) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Fletcher Building Limited) Concerned that this exclusion will prevent any R&D from being eligible where something new is produced (or an existing product is improved) in response to a new standard. It should be clarified whether the alteration of an existing product due to changing standards constitutes a new product. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Complying with statutory requirements or standards for pre-existing processes, services, or goods should be an eligible R&D activity. Most of our products exist in a highly regulated market with constantly evolving regulations. Compliance with these regulations is used to evaluate the success of the R&D. (Fletcher Building Limited) Comment Schedule 21 excludes activities involved in complying with statutory requirements or standards from being core R&D activities. A similar exclusion from supporting R&D activities also applies, but this is limited to pre-existing products. In other words, complying with statutory requirements or standards for a new product may qualify as a supporting R&D activity. Officials disagree with submitters that this exclusion will prevent R&D from being eligible where a new product is produced, or an existing product is improved in response to a new standard. The 31 legislation is clear that compliance with statutory requirements or standards for a new product may qualify as a supporting activity. Officials are sympathetic to submitters’ concerns regarding when the alteration of an existing product constitutes a new product. The answer will largely depend on the circumstances and the extent of the alteration. This will be clarified in guidance. The exclusion is also targeted at the testing and analysis of products or processes to determine whether they meet a new standard. Testing, by itself, is not intended to be an eligible activity; if R&D activity were required to develop or re-develop a new product in response to a new standard, the testing might be eligible as a support activity. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Management studies (Schedule 1 (proposed new schedule 21 parts A and B clause 9)) Submission (Deloitte) Does the management studies exclusion extend to all management studies? If not, the term should be clarified. Comment Proposed new schedule 21, parts A and B, clause 9 excludes management studies from being eligible as a core or supporting R&D activity. The term “management studies” is intended to include all types of management studies. Recommendation That the submission be noted, no further action required. Issue: Social sciences (Schedule 1 (proposed new schedule 21, part A, clause 12)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Supports revisiting the exclusion of social sciences, arts and humanities at a later date. 32 Comment Officials welcome the support. Recommendation That the submission be noted, no further action required. Issue: Minor adaption of, or improvement to, existing processes, services, or goods (Schedule 1 (proposed new schedule 21, part A, clause 15)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) This exclusion should be amended to “minor adaptation of, or improvement to processes, services or goods in current commercial use”. Absent this amendment, incremental improvements to products or processes which have not yet been commercialised would be excluded. Alternatively, it would be useful to understand what is a new good and what is an existing good – for example, is a kiwifruit which has less “fur” a new or an existing good. The definition of “minor” should be explained in guidance, for example, would R&D to create a new battery manufacturing technique which increases battery life by one percent be considered minor? Comment Officials will clarify in guidance when the alteration of an existing product constitutes a new product, and what is considered “minor”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Reverse engineering (Schedule 1 (proposed new schedule 21, part A, clause 22)) Submission (Matter raised by officials) The exclusion for reverse engineering should include the reproduction of a product or process by a physical examination of an existing product. Comment 33 The exclusion for reverse engineering in the Bill only applies to products or processes reproduced by a physical examination of an existing system or from plans, blueprints, detailed specifications, or publicly available information. It should be extended to cover products or processes reproduced by a physical examination of an existing product. Absent this extension, many products that have been reverse engineered may not be excluded, such as generic pharmaceuticals. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Exclusions from the supporting R&D activity definition (Schedule 1 (proposed new schedule 21, part B)) Submission (EY, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Fletcher Building Limited, Deloitte) Delete all supporting activity exclusions (EY, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Fletcher Building Limited), or reduce them significantly (Deloitte). Blanket exclusions from both the core and supporting R&D activity definitions may exclude genuine R&D expenditure from the regime. The supporting R&D activity definition sets a very high bar, so it is unnecessary to also specifically exclude items. (Deloitte) All items in part B should be cased in the language of “routine”. (Deloitte) Comment Officials disagree with the submitters. Outright exclusions remove uncertainty over whether something is eligible, so reduces compliance and administrative costs. There is a balance within an R&D tax incentive scheme between accommodating all R&D activities and the risk of non-R&D activities receiving a subsidy. There is also a balance between excluding some genuine R&D to ensure activities that are not R&D are not subsidised. Officials consider the submitters’ suggestions would tip this balance unfavourably. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Exclusion for market research, testing, development, or sales promotion (Schedule 1 (proposed new schedule 21, parts A and B, clause 6)) Submission (Matter raised by officials) 34 The supporting activity exclusion in schedule 21, part B, clause 6 should mirror the core activity exclusion in schedule 21, part A, clause 6. That is, the supporting activity exclusion should read: “Market research, market testing, market development, or sales promotion, including consumer surveys”. Comment The supporting activity exclusion in schedule 21, part B, clause 6 currently says “Market development or sales promotion, including consumer surveys”. Officials recommend broadening the exclusion so that it mirrors the core activity exclusion and extends to cover market research and market testing. Market research and market testing activities go towards resolving commercial uncertainty and supporting commercial objectives, so should not be eligible for the R&D tax credit. If an R&D project has a technological objective that can only be measured through testing that involves customers, such as sensory evaluation, that testing is not affected by this exclusion. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 35 SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT Issue: Internal software development expenditure and the $3 million cap (Clause 21(10), schedule 1 (proposed new schedule 21 parts A and B, clause 11 and proposed new schedule 21B part B, clause 17)) Submission (ASB Bank Limited, Air New Zealand Limited, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY, Fletcher Building Limited, KPMG, WSP Opus, PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund) The cap should be removed or increased to $10 million. (ASB Bank Limited, Air New Zealand Limited, Corporate Taxpayers Group, WSP Opus, Deloitte). • It should not matter that the business is not selling or publicising its R&D. The internal R&D will enable the business to be more profitable and pay more tax. • Software development can switch from being for internal use to both internal and external. • Should not have bias against certain types of software innovation. There are many spill- overs from encouraging software R&D. A lot of R&D will have a software component (for example, motor vehicles) (Corporate Taxpayers Group, WSP Opus). Absent removing the cap, there should be clear rules to differentiate between internal and external software development. Paragraph (a)(ii) of the internal software development expenditure definition (which relates to internal software development for the purpose of enhancing services to customers) should not be subject to the cap. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, WSP Opus). At a minimum, there must be a legislative commitment to review the cap at regular intervals. If the $3 million cap remains, amend the rules so that shareholding as low as fifty percent does not result in an internal software development group being formed. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, WSP Opus) Lift the cap to $5 million. (EY) Taxpayers should be able to apply to exceed the cap. (ASB Bank Limited, Air New Zealand Limited, Corporate Taxpayers Group, WSP Opus, Deloitte, Fletcher Building Limited, KPMG) Relax the definition of “internal software development expenditure” definition but require specific pre-approval for internal software development expenditure (Deloitte). Modify (b)(ii) so that software which is an integral part of services that are sold is not subject to the cap. (PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund) Software that is disposed of for no consideration (for example an app developed for free download) should be considered external software development expenditure and therefore not subject to the $3 million cap. “Disposal” should include where software is sold or made available to customers, even where the business retains a right to the products. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) 36 Comment The Bill proposes that internal software development expenditure be subject to a $3 million cap. “Internal software development expenditure” is defined in a proposed amendment to section YA 1 to mean amounts spent by a person to develop software for the purpose of: • Enhancing services provided by the person to their customers; and/or • The internal administration of the person’s business or that of their associates. The cap does not apply to software developed for the main purpose of disposal or as an integral part of goods that are disposed of the ordinary course of business. These activities are considered external software development. Some software development undertaken for the purpose of internal administration is excluded outright (that is, some amounts are effectively capped at $0 rather than $3m). Activities that are excluded outright include the software development of payroll, accounting, executive or management information, human resources, enterprise resource planning, invoicing, and inventory systems for use in the person’s business or that of their associates. Experience from other jurisdictions indicates that internal software development can be an area of fiscal risk, especially software development by financial institutions. Spill-overs in this area are also likely to be low because firms generally will be able to control the benefits arising from this R&D. Nonetheless, officials are sympathetic to submitters’ concerns, in particular, that there could be an arbitrary distinction between customer facing software that is considered internal because it is not sold and other software that is considered external because it is sold. Officials recommend two key amendments to the Bill as introduced. First, increasing the internal software development cap from $3m to $25 million. This recognises that there is an imprecise distinction between some types of internal and external software development. Second, broadening the outright exclusion for internal software development undertaken for the purpose of internal administration, so that it does not have an exhaustive list of excluded activities. That is, officials recommend that activities captured by paragraph (a)(i) of the internal software development expenditure definition are excluded outright. This broader internal administration exclusion is consistent with the rationale behind the internal software development exclusion. The spill-overs from internal software development are limited as they are often specific to the firm performing the internal software development activity. The exclusion is also consistent with Australia’s approach to internal software development expenditure and will help to offset some of the fiscal cost of extending the internal software development cap from $3m to $25m. Officials disagree with: • Removing the cap altogether. A cap is prudent to ensure the fiscal sustainability of the scheme, at least until we have more experience with the scheme and claims in this area. • Allowing taxpayers to apply to exceed the cap or having a pre-approval process for internal software development expenditure. These processes would increase compliance and 37 administrative costs and should not be necessary if the cap is increased in line with officials’ recommendations. • Widening the exclusion from the cap to include software that is an integral part of services that are disposed of. The current exclusion is limited to software that is an integral part of goods that the person disposes of. This is targeted at firmware – such as the software that runs inside a washing machine or TV remote. • Treating software that is disposed of for no consideration (such as an app developed for free download) as external software development expenditure. This is due to the fiscal risk of allowing this kind of expenditure. The increase in the internal software development cap from $3 million to $25 million should go some way to addressing the submitters’ concern. This will ensure that, for all but the largest R&D performers, there is no difference between the treatment of external software development, and internal software development that enhances services to customers. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to official’s comments. Issue: R&D activity definition in the context of software (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 2)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, BusinessNZ, Deloitte, PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund, NZRise, ExportNZ, ManufacturingNZ, NZTech, Advanced Management Systems Ltd, Matthew Sagen) The current core R&D activity definition is too narrow in the context of software. Software development activities are unlikely to have “a material purpose of resolving scientific or technological uncertainty”. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, BusinessNZ, PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund, ExportNZ, ManufacturingNZ, NZTech, Advanced Management Systems Ltd). Uncertainty in the context of software development should be “we are not sure we can pull this off” rather than “we are not sure if this is technically possible”. A lot of software development involves a clever combination of publicly available approaches, components and processes. This should be eligible. (Matthew Sagen) Consider adopting: • The Australian core activity definition (BusinessNZ) • A novelty test (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) • Canada’s R&D definition (Advanced Management Systems Ltd, NZRise) 38 Comment Officials consider that the current definition adequately incentivises software development. Widening the definition, such as by introducing a novelty test, would create an easier test and may let in activities of the kind that the government does not wish to incentivise. Officials have already made changes to the definition from what was originally proposed in the discussion document by dropping the requirement that the R&D is conducted using a scientific method, in order to better accommodate software development. By introducing a novelty test, a claimant could qualify where they have created something ‘new’, without it necessarily incorporating the degree of difficulty and risk required by the uncertainty concept (that is, being ‘hard’). Officials disagree that uncertainty in the context of software development should be “we are not sure we can pull this off”. This is a capability uncertainty – that is, do staff have sufficient expertise, rather than a scientific or technological one which asks whether the answer can be deduced by a competent professional in the relevant field. Officials note the guidance provides examples where software will be eligible. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Exclusion for software development for ordinary internal administration activities (Schedule 1 (proposed new schedule 21 parts A and B clause 11)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) This exclusion is not appropriate, provided the R&D activity definition is met. Improvements in administrative systems can lead to significant productivity increases within an organisation. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) This exclusion should be linked to the definition in section YA 1. (Deloitte) Comment Clause 11 of schedule 21 parts A and B excludes from the core R&D activity and supporting R&D activity definitions respectively, software developed for use in the ordinary administrative functions of the claimant’s business, such as payroll, accounting or invoicing. Software development in these areas may still be eligible for the tax credit, if developed with the main purpose of selling the software. Officials disagree with Corporate Taxpayers Group’s submission. Software development related to ordinary administrative functions of a business is specific to the firm and likely to have limited spill-over benefits. This is not consistent with the policy intent of the regime. As mentioned earlier 39 in the report, officials recommend extending this exclusion to cover all internal software development other than that which enhances services to customers. In relat ion to Delo itte’s submissio n, it would be incorrect to link this exclusio n to the definit io n of internal software development expenditure. It is only relevant for the cap on internal software development contained in clause 17 of schedule 21B part B. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Testing exclusions (Schedule 1 (proposed new schedule 21 part A, clauses 16 to 19)) Submission (PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Testing is a critical R&D activity for software development and should not be excluded. Comment Clauses 16 to 19 of schedule 21 Part A exclude various types of testing in software development from the core R&D activit y definit ion. Testing is not, however, excluded outright. Testing that is required to assess whether the scientific or technological uncertainty has been resolved may qualify as a supporting activity. The guidance makes this point clear. Officials do not consider it appropriate to allow testing to be an eligible core R&D activity. It does not seek to resolve scientific or technological uncertainty but identifies problems that need to be resolved. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Converting existing systems to new software platforms (Schedule 1 (proposed new schedule 21 part A, clause 20)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) 40 Converting existing systems to new software platforms should not be excluded if the business is able to satisfy the core R&D activity definition. There can be material technical risk associated with converting systems. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Is the exclusion limited to data migration activities, such that the creation of new software platforms is still eligible? This exclusion overlaps with 17 and therefore is redundant. (Deloitte) Comment Officials disagree with Corporate Taxpayers Group’s submission. Activities related to converting existing systems to new software platforms are often specific to a business. Therefore, the spill over benefits from resolving technological uncertainties related to such work are considered insufficient to justify the monetary risk to the Government of including such activities, hence the exclusion. In response to Deloitte’s submission, the exclusion is not limited to data migration activities, it covers all conversions of existing systems to new software platforms. The creation of new software platforms may still be eligible. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Integrating existing systems with new software platforms (Schedule 1 (proposed new schedule 21, Part A, clause 20)) Submission (Matter raised by officials) The exclusion for converting existing systems to new software platforms should be amended to also exclude integrating existing systems with new software platforms. Comment Officials recommend that integrating existing systems with new software platforms is excluded for the following reasons: • Limited spill-over benefits: integrating an existing system with a new software platform is likely to be specific to the business, and therefore the spill-over benefits are limited. • Fiscal risk: the cost of integrating large and complicated legacy systems with new software platforms can be very expensive. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 41 ELIGIBLE EXPENDITURE Issue: Commercial production rule (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 5(1)(c))) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, Fletcher Building Limited, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund, WSP Opus) Eligible overheads should be allowed where R&D is performed in the course of commercial production. (KPMG, Fletcher Building Limited, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare) “In the absence of” test is too restrictive and will narrow the scope of the credit for businesses who undertake R&D as part of their ordinary business. (PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund) Unclear how the rule is intended to apply. We understand that “commercial production” is intended to refer to bulk production manufacturing processes, but this language could equally apply to R&D performed in other commercial contexts. (WSP Opus) This test will be difficult for taxpayers to apply. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) “Commercial production” and “employee’s contribution to a research and development activity” should be clarified in legislation or guidance. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group) “Employee contribution” should be reworded as the language is unusual. It should also cover contributions made by contractors. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Instead of a commercial production rule, a specific anti-avoidance rule could be introduced. (PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund) Comment Where an R&D activity is performed in the course of commercial production, the amount a business may claim is limited to the amount relating to an employee’s contribution to the R&D activity, and expenditure that would not have been incurred in the absence of the R&D activity (in other words, the additional expenditure incurred because of the R&D). An R&D activity that occurs in the course of commercial production, for example, conducting experiments on the production line of a factory, or conducting software R&D in the course of implementing a new IT system, is a legitimate form of R&D that should be eligible for the tax incentive. However, the amount that is claimed in these circumstances must be appropriate. In particular, officials consider that it is not appropriate for all the costs of the commercial operation to be claimed as R&D expenditure. The commercial production rule is designed so that the extra costs associated with R&D are eligible but that the costs that would have been incurred anyway as a result of the commercial operations are not eligible. Officials consider this is the appropriate approach and therefore recommend that the submissions are declined. 42 In response to WSP Opus’s submission, the rule is not solely intended to apply in the manufacturing context. For instance, it also applies in the context of a professional services firm performing R&D in the course of designing a product for the customer. The meaning of “commercial production” and “employee’s contribution to a research and development activity” will be clarified in guidance. Officials disagree with Corporate Taxpayers Group’s suggest ion that “emplo yee’s contribution” should also cover contributions made by contractors. This would result in an exclusio n much wider than intended – for example, a cleaner contracted to clean the production line may be covered. This exclusion is intended to ensure that the costs of staff performing R&D are not ineligible under the commercial production rule. During consultation, there was a concern that the costs of staff who were redeployed to work on R&D may not be covered as the firm would have incurred their salary costs anyway, absent the R&D. Officials disagree with the suggestion to implement a specific anti-avoidance rule in lieu of the commercial production rule. The commercial production rule ensures the correct outcome from the outset by preventing business-as-usual expenditure from being claimed. Officials note that the Bill does contain a specific anti-avoidance rule in clause 7, which will be in addition to the commercial production rule. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Contracted R&D expenditure – profit margin (Clause 10 (proposed new sections LY 6(2) and LY 7(3))) Submission (EY, PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund, Deloitte, Russell McVeagh, Fletcher Building Limited, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, Biotelliga, WSP Opus, Zespri) A principal’s R&D tax credit claim, when engaging a contractor to perform R&D on their behalf, should not be reduced by twenty percent to account for the contractor’s profit margin. • All goods and services purchased by an entity claiming an R&D tax credit contain a profit margin. • It would create a bias towards doing R&D in-house. In many instances it is more efficient and cost effective to outsource aspects of the R&D. • Driving businesses to in-house their R&D will create duplication of resources across industries and may also fail to capture the opportunity available as it excludes specialised resources which may not be able to be in-sourced. • Twenty percent margin may be too high in many cases. 43 Comment Officials agree with the submitters. The 0.8 figure was proposed to remove the contractor’s profit margin. A person doing R&D in their own right does not get to claim the credit for any profit margin or finance cost, so the reduction on contracted R&D was designed to provide equivalent treatment. This approach is consistent with the approach that some other countries take. However, officials have been persuaded by submitters’ arguments. The contractor’s profit margin is a true cost to the principal in getting the R&D performed. Further, firms may be incentivised to conduct R&D in house even though it would be more efficient to outsource it. Officials therefore agree with submitters that the 0.8 figure should be removed from proposed new sections LY 6 and LY 7. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Contracted R&D expenditure – ineligible expenditure (Clause 10 (proposed new sections LY 6(2), LY 6(3)(b), LY 7(3) and LY 7(4)(b))) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Russell McVeagh, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, Fletcher Building Limited, EY, KPMG, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte) Ineligible expenditure should not be removed from the contract amount when determining the amount eligible for the R&D tax credit: • Difficult for businesses to obtain this information from a contractor. • The information is commercially sensitive. • It requires the principal to rely on a declaration made by the contractor. • Introduces complexity for contractors to comply with something where they do not benefit. • Limiting eligible expenditure is inconsistent with the wider objective of the R&D tax incentive, which is to increase R&D spend in New Zealand. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Russell McVeagh, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, Fletcher Building Limited, EY, KPMG) An R&D contractor should be required to provide a declaration describing the work undertaken and the amount of the ineligible expenditure. A principal should be able to rely on this declaratio n and not be subject to the proposed anti-avoidance rule in GB 56. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte). A de minimis rule of $10,000 should be considered to reduce the overall compliance burden (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte). 44 Comment The Bill proposes that where a person engages an R&D contractor to perform R&D on their behalf, expenditure that is ineligible must be removed from the contract price before determining the amount of R&D tax credit the person is entit led to. Ineligible expenditure must also be taken out where a person is performing R&D on their own behalf, and therefore the rule ensures consistency in that respect. Officials disagree with submitters that this provision should be removed. If ineligible expenditure is not taken out of the contract amount for R&D tax credit purposes, then the integrity of the scheme would be undermined. There would effectively be no list of ineligible expenditure where a contractor was engaged, resulting in claimants receiving a credit on expenditure that was not intended, for example, the cost of purchasing depreciable property used in the R&D. The legislative requirement could be complied with by including a condition in the contract whereby the contractor must declare the amount of ineligible expenditure in the contract price. Officials disagree that this is commercially sensitive information. The commercially sensitive aspect of the contract is more likely to be the contractor’s profit margin. This could not be ascertained from determining how much of the contract price was spent on ineligible expenditure, as the contract price is also made up of eligible expenditure and profit margin. Officials disagree that a principal relying on the contractor’s declaration should not be subject to the anti-avoidance rule in proposed new section GB 56. Reliance on the declaration is likely to be evidence that the person has taken reasonable care, and therefore penalties are unlikely to apply. The anti-avo idance rule is still necessary to enable the Commissioner to reconstruct the person’s claim to the appropriate amount. Officials do not recommend including a de minimis rule as allowing ineligible expenditure for a large number of small claims may undermine the integrity of the regime. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Use of “incurred” (Clause 10 (proposed new subpart LY), schedule 1 (proposed new schedule 21B)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Replace “paid” with “incurred” in all sections that use “paid”, such as LY 6(3)(a) and Schedule 21B: • “Paid” would require businesses to keep a set of accounts for R&D purposes only. • Certain expenses may be deemed ineligible if the activity occurs in year one, but the expenses haven’t been paid until the following year. • Inconsistent with other sections which use “incurred”. 45 Comment A general concept in the tax system is that a taxpayer can claim a deduction for expenditure once that expenditure has been incurred. This means that the taxpayer is definitively committed to paying the amount, and it can be reliably estimated. For tax purposes, a deduction would be allowed where a person had contracted to pay an amount, despite not having paid it. Officials agree with submitters. It would be inefficient to require accounts to be kept on a “cash” basis for R&D purposes, when accounts are kept on an accruals basis for tax purposes. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: R&D performed in New Zealand by non-residents (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 7)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, Deloitte, WSP Opus) The ten percent cap should not apply to activities undertaken in New Zealand. • This is inconsistent with the policy to increase R&D in New Zealand. • There is already adequate spill-overs from the non-residents performing R&D in New Zealand. • There are not enough skilled workers in New Zealand. There are spill-overs from New Zealand staff learning from non-residents. Comment The Bill proposes that foreign R&D expenditure can be no more than ten percent of a person’s overall R&D claim. Foreign R&D expenditure is made up of expenditure incurred on an R&D activity outside New Zealand that is integral to a core R&D activity performed in New Zealand, as well as salary payments and payments for services to non-resident employees or contractors performing the R&D in New Zealand. Officials disagree with submitters. There are virtually no restrictions on a foreign multinational fro m undertaking R&D in New Zealand and having its New Zealand subsidiary receive the credit. Generally, officials consider this will produce the right outcomes in terms of encouraging R&D to be performed in New Zealand. However, we consider it prudent to guard against a mult inat ional establishing an R&D operation in New Zealand solely to take advantage of the tax credit and with minimal connectivity to other economic activity in New Zealand. This restriction limits that risk. The ten percent threshold recognises that suitably skilled workers will not always be able to be found in New Zealand. 46 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Alternative approach to the ten percent cap (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 7)) Submission (Air New Zealand Limited) The Bill should be more inclusive of overseas joint venture R&D. Air New Zealand is actively involved in joint ventures with overseas partners. Comment The intent of the legislation is to incentivise New Zealand-based R&D, not New Zealand investment in foreign-based R&D. R&D undertaken offshore may be eligible for an R&D incentive in that jurisdiction. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The ten percent cap is too low (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 7)) Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund, ExportNZ, ManufacturingNZ) The current cap of ten percent is too low: • The necessary expertise is often offshore. • Quarantine restrictions prevent importation of particular items which may be necessary for the R&D. • Certain environmental conditions do not exist in New Zealand. • Targeted populations don’t reside in New Zealand. (EY, PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund, ExportNZ, ManufacturingNZ) 47 The cap should be lifted to twenty percent (PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand). The cap should be across the life of the project, so that taxpayers can exceed the cap in a given year provided that the overseas expenditure doesn’t exceed ten percent of the overall project cost. Otherwise, firms will be unduly disadvantaged simply because there are greater overseas costs in one year than in others. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment Officials disagree with the submitters. There are significant spill-over benefits from the R&D being done in New Zealand. Benefits to New Zealand are diluted the more the cap is increased. The ten percent cap recognises that some R&D needs to be performed overseas and is a compromise between the different perspectives. Officials note that this approach is slightly more generous than that in 2008 (because that also included project by project restrictions) and more generous than the Growth Grant, which treats all overseas expenditure as ineligible. Allowing taxpayers to apply the cap over the life of the project would add complexity to administration and compliance as it would require tracking over time. The way the rule is currently drafted does allow a taxpayer to take advantage of amounts under the cap within its portfolio of projects. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Formula doesn’t work (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 7(2))) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The formula in LY 7(2) does not work if either of the components in sections (3) or (5) is $0. Comment The formula in LY 7(2) provides that a person’s eligible research and development expenditure includes the lesser of the person’s overseas expenditure or their capped overseas expenditure amount (this is the amount eligible under the ten percent cap). Officials disagree with submitters. If one of the components in the formula is $0, then no expenditure is added to a person’s eligible research and development expenditure. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 48 Issue: Approval process for overseas expenditure (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 7(2))) Submission (PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund, Woolalchemy NZ, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Fletcher Building Limited, Zespri, EY) Should have the ability to exceed the cap via an approval process where the relevant expertise is not available in New Zealand. Comment The focus of the incentive is to increase R&D in New Zealand and maximise spill-over benefits to New Zealand. New Zealand receives limited benefit where the R&D happens overseas, even if there is no choice but to perform the R&D overseas. A separate approval process would add to compliance and administration costs. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Evidence of eligible expenditure (Clause 10 (Subpart LY and schedule 21B part A generally)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) It should not be necessary to collate invoices to show what eligible expenditure has been incurred. If documentation doesn’t contain sufficient detail, businesses should still be able to self-assess. Comment Businesses will not be required to provide invoices with their supplementary R&D return, and therefore can still self-assess. However, businesses will be expected to keep records of these invoices in the event of a review. Officials consider it reasonable that where public money is being claimed, the claimant has an obligation to have sufficient records to substantiate that claim. Recommendation That the submission be noted, no further action required. 49 Issue: Depreciation allowed for full income year where equipment available for use (Schedule 1 (proposed new schedule 21B, part A, clause 1)) Submission (Fletcher Building, Corporate Taxpayers Group) Depreciation on R&D specific equipment should be allowed for the full income year provided the equipment is available for use. (Fletcher Building Limited) When calculating the time an asset has been used in R&D, the calculation should be based on actual use, not idle time. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment Depreciation on R&D equipment is calculated based on the amount of time the asset is used for R&D purposes as a proportion of total use. Therefore, if an asset is used ten percent of the time for R&D purposes and not used for any other purpose, then the full depreciation will be eligible for the R&D tax credit. However, if an asset is not used for R&D purposes during the income year, but is just available for use, none of the depreciation will be eligible for the tax credit, given the calculation is based on actual use. This will be clarified in guidance. Recommendation That the submission be noted, no further action required. Issue: Depreciation rate on buildings (Schedule 1 (proposed new schedule 21B, part A, clause 1)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) For R&D tax credit purposes, the depreciation rate on buildings should be three percent because buildings do depreciate. Comment Officials recommend following the depreciation rules which exist for tax purposes, which do not allow depreciation for buildings. Following the rules that exist for tax purposes will reduce the compliance and administration costs associated with calculating depreciation on assets used in R&D. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 50 Issue: Anti-double dip provision (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 5)) Submission (Matter raised by officials) An anti-double dip provision should be added to prevent two firms being able to claim an R&D tax credit twice for the same expenditure. Comment The exclusion for R&D contractors in LY 3(2)(c) should largely prevent both the principal and contractor from claiming a credit on the same expenditure. For the avoidance of all doubt, however, officials recommend an additional provision that says a credit will only be given once for an amount of eligible R&D expenditure. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 51 INELIGIBLE EXPENITURE Issue: Scope of schedule 21B part B (Schedule 1 (Proposed new schedule 21B, part B)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The group appreciates the need to constrain what costs are eligible for the credit, however the current constraints are too extensive: • Unduly restricts part of the true cost of performing R&D from being eligible. • Undermines the attractiveness of the regime • Reduces the effective tax credit to below fifteen percent. Comment Officials agree that the exclusion list is overly restrictive in some areas and are recommending some amendments. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: $120 million cap (Schedule 1 (proposed new schedule 21B, part B, clause 1)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) It is unnecessary to include the $120 million cap in schedule 21B, part B when it is already covered in section LY 4. It causes confusion over how the legislation applies if the business has obtained an “approved research and development cap”. Comment Officials disagree with the submitter that schedule 21B part B, clause 1 should be removed. The difference between the rule in section LY 4 and the one in schedule 21B, part B is that in schedule 21B, part B the associated person rule is brought in. Officials do however recognise the submitters’ point in relation to the approved research and development cap, and therefore recommend that schedule 21B part B clause 1 is amended so that the associated person rule applies to a person’s $120 million cap or the approved research and development cap as appropriate. 52 Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Eligibility of capitalised expenditure (Schedule 1 (proposed new schedule 21B, part B, clause 3)) Submission (Air New Zealand Limited, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Fletcher Building Limited, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, Deloitte) Capitalised R&D expenditure should be eligible for the credit. In practice, expenses are capitalised early - capitalisation for financial reporting purposes is not linked to whether the uncertainty has been resolved. Delete the exclusion in schedule 21B, part B, clause 3 which relates to expenditure that contributes to the cost of creating tangible depreciable property. Comment Officials agree with submitters that, in principle, capitalised R&D should be eligible for the credit, though note that if expenditure has been capitalised, this can indicate that any scientific or technological uncertainty associated with the activity to which the expenditure relates has been resolved. For that reason, capital account expenditure that goes towards creating depreciable intangible property is eligible. The specific exclusion in schedule 21B, part B, clause 3 excludes capital account expenditure that goes towards the production of depreciable tangible property. Officials consider this exclusion necessary from a sustainability and fiscal risk perspective, because of the potentially high cost of producing some depreciable tangible assets, so do not agree with deleting the exclusion. A similar exclusion applies in Australia. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Pooled depreciation (Schedule 1 (proposed new schedule 21B, part B, clause 5)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) A person should be able to calculate depreciation for R&D tax credit purposes separately from the pool if the person is willing to incur the compliance costs to undertake the recalculation. The 53 exclusion for pooled property penalises taxpayers who have legitimately taken advantage of compliance cost saving pooling rules. Comment Schedule 21B, part B clause 5 excludes from the tax credit depreciation loss for an item of pooled property, unless all items in the pool are used solely in performing R&D. Officials disagree with submitters. If a person wishes to calculate depreciation separately, then the property should not be put into the pool. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Expenditure on employee share schemes (Schedule 1 (proposed new schedule 21B, part B, clause 9)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) A business should be able to claim an R&D tax credit on the value of a benefit provided under an employee share scheme, to the extent it relates to their employees performing R&D. Comment Officials agree with the submitters that employee share schemes should be eligible. They are a common form of remuneration for start-up firms performing R&D. It is recommended that the credit value is calculated on the value for tax purposes, with apportionment between R&D and non-R&D activities determined on the vesting date. Example: Employee share scheme Liam is employed by A Co, a pharmaceutical company developing a cure for a trial fibrillation. On 1 June 2020 he was granted an option to buy 1,000 shares for $500. The option vests on 1 June 2021. Liam has two years to exercise the option. Between 1 June 2020 and 1 June 2021, Liam spends seventy percent of his time on R&D. On 1 December 2021, A Co’s shares are worth $2 per share. Liam exercises his option for $500. The cost to A Co for tax purposes is $1,500 on 1 December 2021. Result for R&D tax credit purposes A Co may claim an R&D tax credit on $1,500 x 0.7 = $1,050. This is because at the vesting date Liam spent seventy percent of his time on R&D. The R&D tax credit A C o is entitled to is therefore $1,050 x 0.15 (15% credit rate) = $157.50. The tax credit may be claimed in the 2021 year. 54 Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Employee recruitment, relocation and bonuses (Schedule 1 (proposed new schedule 21B, part B, clauses 10 and 11)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, NZRise) Employee recruitment, relocation and bonuses should be eligible for the R&D tax credit because they are: • A genuine business cost • Critical for businesses to attract competent R&D staff • A common reward and retention mechanism particularly for early stage businesses. Comment These costs were excluded in the Bill as introduced because of the risk that their nexus with R&D activities might be difficult to establish, so there was a risk that these amounts would not be appropriately apportioned. Officials recognise, however, that the fiscal cost associated with these amounts is likely to be low and agree that such amounts should be eligible because they represent a genuine cost of R&D to businesses. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Acquiring an interest in intangible property other than software (Schedule 1 (proposed new schedule 21B, part B, clause 15)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Zespri) This exclusion may prevent a business claiming an R&D tax credit for R&D in creating new plant varieties. The legislation should be amended, or clear guidance given on how the rules are intended to apply to plant variety rights. Comment This clause is not intended to exclude plant variety rights. The R&D tax credit is not available for expenditure to acquire an interest in intangible property, such as expenditure incurred on 55 purchasing, leasing or obtaining a right to use intangible property. The exclusion does not apply to expenditure incurred to create that interest in intangible property, such as creating a new plant variety right. For the avoidance of doubt, it will be clarified in guidance that plant variety rights will be eligible for the credit. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Acquiring bespoke or customised software (Schedule 1 (proposed new schedule 21B, part B, clauses 15 and 16)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY) This exclusion is too wide and should be deleted. On current drafting it could exclude expenditure on contractors to build software. Comment The current exclusion in schedule 21B, part B, clause 16 reads “expenditure or loss in relation to software that is bespoke or customised or is not widely commercially available”. This exclusion is intended to target the purchase of customised software for fiscal cost reasons. It also prevents a firm from getting a credit for essentially purchasing another firm’s R&D. It is not intended to capture software that is created through R&D or as a supporting activity. Officials recognise that the exclusion as drafted is currently too wide. Officials recommend that the exclusion is amended so that it only applies to expenditure or loss that relates to purchasing, leasing, or acquiring software that is: • Bespoke • Customised, or • Not widely commercially available. Officials also recommend that clause 15 (which relates to acquiring interests in intangible property other than software) is similarly amended so that it is consistent with the recommended amendment to clause 16. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 56 Issue: Gifts (Schedule 1 (proposed new schedule 21B, part B, clause 19)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The cost of gifts should be eligible when provided to non-emplo yees. For example, a gift voucher for participating in a trial. Given gifts are likely to be small, the compliance costs associated with finding and removing them would likely outweigh the revenue cost of allowing them. Comment The cost of a gift voucher given to a participant in a trial is still consideration for a service and therefore eligible for the R&D tax credit. The gift exclusion is intended to prevent a person treating the nominal value of a gift used in R&D as expenditure for R&D purposes. Further, it prevents the donor of the gift from claiming an R&D tax credit on its value. This exclusion will prevent disputes as to whether a gift relates to R&D and is eligible for the credit. Recommendation That the submission be noted, no further action required. Issue: Feedstock (Schedule 1 (proposed new schedule 21B, part B, clause 23)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The drafting of the feedstock rule could be clearer, and further guidance on the feedstock rule would be appreciated. It is unclear: • Why energy is specifically mentioned • Whether the cost of energy is always ineligible, or only the amount, in conjunction with other inputs, that exceeds the value of the output • How expenditure for energy is identified and linked to the “good” produced. • What overhead costs are expected to be subject to feedstock • What is the market value – that is, a specific selling price of average for the year. Comment This will be clarified in guidance. 57 Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Loss on sale or write-off of depreciable property (Schedule 1 (proposed new schedule 21B, part B)) Submission (Matter raised by officials) Depreciation loss arising from an asset being written off or sold below its adjusted tax value should be ineligible for the tax credit. Comment To minimise compliance and administrative costs, there is no claw-back of R&D tax credits when depreciable property used in R&D is sold for more than its adjusted tax value. To ensure symmetry of treatment, officials propose that there is a corresponding restriction preventing an R&D tax credit claim for depreciation to the extent an asset is written off or sold below its adjusted tax value. Example – no tax credit for loss on disposal A company buys an asset for $1 million which is used wholly in eligible R&D. The R&D tax credit is claimed for depreciation on the asset. The asset is sold for $500,000. The book value of the asset at the time of sale is $600,000. No tax credit is available for the $100,000 loss. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Cost of purchasing land (Schedule 1 (proposed new schedule 21B, part B)) Submission (Matter raised by officials) The cost of purchasing land should not be eligible for the R&D tax credit. Comment It is not appropriate to give an R&D tax credit for land purchased for use in R&D for two reasons. The first is it is difficult to apportion what cost of the land relates to R&D given the land could be 58 used for non-R&D purposes later. The second reason is that land generally increases in value and therefore can be sold to recoup the cost. Rent or lease payments for buildings used in R&D (which might include the cost of land) are eligible for the credit however. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Adjustments to eligible expenditure Submission (Matter raised by officials) Adjustments should be made to prepaid eligible expenditure to ensure the amount of R&D tax credit claimed is appropriate. Comment For tax purposes, the unused portion of prepaid expenditure is added back as income at the end of each year. This prevents a taxpayer from claiming a deduction for something which has been prepaid but not yet used in the derivation of income. Similar rules are required for the R&D tax credit to ensure a taxpayer does not receive a tax credit for prepaid expenditure on something that has not yet been used in relation to an R&D activity. For example, if a person incurs $100,000 on consumables to be used in R&D but those consumables haven’t been used in the R&D process by the end of the year, eligible expenditure needs to be adjusted so that the person is not able to claim an R&D tax credit on the portion of the expenditure that relates to the unused consumables. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 59 CALCULATING THE CREDIT Issue: Support for minimum threshold and tax credit rate (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 4)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Corporate Taxpayers Group supports the $50,000 minimum expenditure threshold, and the 15% tax credit rate. Comment Officials welcome the support. Recommendation That the submission be noted, no further action required. Issue: Minimum threshold is too high (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 4)) Submission (Fleur Foods, TEPHRA) The minimum threshold should be reduced to $10,000 to incentivise SMEs. (TEPHRA) There should be no minimum threshold. (Fleur Foods) Comment Officials disagree with submitters. Setting a reasonable threshold helps avoid disproportionate compliance and administrative costs being incurred on small claims, where the cost might outweigh the benefit to both the Government and claimants from the incentive. The minimum threshold also acts as a filter to prevent claims for activities that do not satisfy the R&D activity definit io ns but are too small to warrant investigation. Officials note that businesses below the threshold may still qualify for the R&D tax credit if they use an approved research provider to perform R&D activities on their behalf. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 60 Issue: JVs satisfying minimum threshold as a collective (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 4)) Submission (Matter raised by officials) JVs should be able to satisfy the minimum threshold as a collective. Comment Officials recommend that section LY 4 is amended so that members of a JV may satisfy the $50,000 minimum threshold as a collective. This is consistent with the treatment of partnerships. This amendment would mean that where two members of a JV fail to satisfy the minimum threshold themselves, they may nevertheless satisfy the minimum threshold provided the JV (as a collective) has $50,000 or more of eligible R&D expenditure. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Replace tax credit with cash investment (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 4)) Submission (TEPHRA) The tax credit should be abandoned in favour of cash investment. Comment As the tax system has been chosen to incentivise R&D, a tax credit is deemed to be the most appropriate option to deliver this incentive. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Support for maximum threshold (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 4)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare) 61 The submitters expressed support for the $120m cap and the discretion to exceed the cap. Comment Officials welcome the support. Recommendation That the submission be noted, no further action required. Issue: Exceeding the maximum threshold (Clause 30 (proposed new section 68CD)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, Deloitte, EY) There should be a three-month deadline for the Commissioner to respond to requests to exceed the cap. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, Deloitte) “Substantial net benefit” should be defined in legislation. (EY) Concerned about the “substantial net benefit for New Zealand” test. It should not be necessary to meet all the criteria listed in the commentary. The applicant should be able to look wider than themselves when assessing the criteria. That is, the process or product being created will create opportunities for other businesses to grow jobs. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment The Bill proposes that a person may only receive an R&D tax credit on a maximum of $120 million of eligible R&D expenditure in a year. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue may approve a cap greater than $120 million provided the R&D gives rise to a substantial net benefit to New Zealand, and the chief executive of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment has been consulted. Officials disagree with imposing a three-month deadline for responding to claims in the legislation. In its administration of the R&D tax credit, Inland Revenue will set a performance standard for processing applications but does not think time constraints should be set in legislation. Officials propose that the “substantial net benefit” test is defined in guidance, rather than legislation. The criteria listed in the commentary are not definitive but are indicative of the type of things that will need to be established to show that the R&D gives rise to a substantial net benefit for New Zealand. Ultimately, a holistic view will be taken, with the weight of each criterion considered. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 62 Issue: Increasing the rate of the credit (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 4)) Submission (Dave Moskovitz, Anonymous submitter) The rate is not competitive with Australia who can access a 42% rebate. Increase the rate to at least 30%. (Anonymous submitter) Concerned that start-ups are not treated more generously. There should be an increased credit for firms that fall under certain thresholds – such as less than 10 employees, or less than $1 million revenue. (Dave Moskovitz) Comment Officials disagree with submitters. The 15% rate is similar to the median tax credit rate for R&D available across the OECD. The Australian scheme is a tax offset not a tax credit. The numbers describe different things and cannot be directly compared. The 43.5% rate in Australia for SMEs (37.5% for large businesses) is the headline rate taking into account corporate tax. The actual effective rate ends up being closer to 8.5%. The New Zealand scheme is actually more straightforward than the Australian scheme because there is one rate for small and large businesses. Officials disagree with having a more generous rate for start-ups. The purpose of the credit is to encourage more firms to undertake R&D. The focus is not on increasing R&D done by small firms only. Higher rates for smaller firms can create disincentives for firms to grow. The Government has already agreed to lower the threshold of eligible expenditure from $100,000 to $50,000. We estimate that this will allow an addit ional 250 small and start-up businesses to access the tax credit. The Government is also mindful that start-up businesses in particular often do not make a profit in their early years and so has made provision in the first year of the scheme for a measure of refundability (up to a maximum of $255k), which should help businesses with their cash-flow challenges. Work is also well under way for a second phase of the scheme to have a more developed policy on refundability in place by April 2020. More broadly the Government supports start-up businesses through a range of measures including the funding of a number of incubators and accelerator programmes to build capability amongst entrepreneurs, and in providing advice to new firms on how to access finance to grow. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 63 HOW TAX CREDITS ARE APPLIED Issue: Ordering rules (Clause 8) Submission (Deloitte, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) R&D tax credits that have been carried forward should be used before credits from the current year. Comment Officials agree with submitters. The oldest R&D credits should be used first in order to minimise potential credit loss following a shareholding change. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Provisional tax (Clause 21(17)) Submission (Deloitte) There should be a midway point in year one of the R&D tax credit regime which allows taxpayers to access the benefit of the provisional tax regime without compromising their status as a standard uplift method provisional taxpayer. Comment Firms in profit can access the benefit of the tax incentive through reduced provisional tax payments during the year. As the standard uplift method for provisional tax is based off the outstanding tax to pay from the previous year, taxpayers will only be able to obtain the benefit of the R&D tax credit in the first year if they estimate their provisional tax payments. Taxpayers who use the estimation method may be subject to penalties and interest if their estimation is incorrect. Officials disagree with submitters. It is appropriate that penalties and interest apply in the event of an incorrect estimate, due to the inherent uncertainty that arises from estimating tax payments. Tax payments are more likely to be correct when based on a five percent uplift from the previous year, and therefore a waiver of penalties and interest is appropriate for uplift taxpayers. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 64 Issue: Continuity period (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 8)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The continuity period should start on the first day of the next income year after the credit arises. Otherwise a shareholding change that occurred during the income year but before the R&D took place could result in a loss of the R&D tax credit. Comment Officials are sympathetic to submitters’ concerns, but disagree with the proposed solution, as this could result in shareholders who didn’t incur the cost of the R&D benefitt ing from the credit – for example, if the company were to do R&D in the first half of the year, with the business being sold in the second half of the year. If the continuity period didn’t begin until the following year, those new shareholders would be able to benefit from the credit. Instead, officials recommend that part-year continuity rules are introduced, similar to what exists currently for losses. This would largely address submitters’ concerns. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Alternative shareholder continuity tests (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 8)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, BusinessNZ, Russell McVeagh) A business should be able to carry forward credits if the company’s underlying business remains the same or similar. This would make the tax system more neutral, by removing the asymmetric tax consequences arising from risk taking. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Russell McVeagh, BusinessNZ). There should be no continuity rule applying to carry forward R&D tax credits. Start-ups are likely to breach continuity as more capital is needed to fund R&D activities. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Comment Officials recommend that the continuity rules for the tax credit mirror those that apply for losses. Therefore, a switch to a same or similar test would not be considered until the same test was used for losses. The Tax Working Group has considered loss continuity and ongoing consideration by government is possible. 65 Officials disagree with the submission that no continuity rules should apply to the tax credit. This would allow shareholders who didn’t incur expenditure giving rise to the credit, to benefit from it later once the firm became profitable. Officials also note that to the extent firms in loss qualify for refunds of their tax credit, continuit y is not an issue. The Government has committed to reviewing the policy on continuity with the likelihood that a different policy will apply from year 2. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Part-year continuity rules (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 8)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund) The part-year provisions that apply for tax losses should be included in the proposed R&D tax credit regime. Comment Officials agree with the submitters and recommend that the portion of the R&D tax credit that relates to the period where continuity was met may be carried forward to the next tax year, as long as adequate accounts are provided setting out the amount of the R&D tax credit attributable to that part year (in the case of continuity being lost during the year in which R&D is performed), or the amount of tax attributable to that part year (in the case of continuity being lost part way through a profitable year). Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Refundability – year 1 (Clause 9) Submission (PwC, Roger Ford, SonaSafe International Ltd, Biotelliga, NZTech, EY, Deloitte, Fisher & Paykel Appliances Ld) Refundability is important to provide support to early stage businesses and needs to be progressed as a priorit y. (PwC, Roger Ford, SonaSafe International Ltd) 66 Lift the refundability cap that applies in year 1 (Biotelliga, NZTech, EY, PwC) If refundability is not applied broadly in 2019–20, R&D tax credits carried forward should be refundable in subsequent years if requirements are met. (EY) There should be enhanced cash-out provisions for current growth grant recipients, such as a cap equal to existing growth grant funding. (Deloitte, Fisher & Paykel Appliances Ltd) Refundability should be broader from year 1 - everyone should be able to access refundability but cap it at $5 million. Other eligibly hurdles, such as PAYE cap, should be minimised. (EY) Comment Officials recognise that refunds are important to many businesses (especially start-ups) and that the issue needs to be progressed as a matter of priority. Officials note that the government has committed to having a more comprehensive policy in place on refundability from April 2020. In developing this regime, consideration will be given to allowing R&D tax credits that were carried forward from the 2019–20 year to be refundable. Officials recommend that the refundability policy currently in the Bill, which mimics the tax loss cash-out, continues to apply for the first year of the regime. A tighter regime in the first year of the regime is a useful precaution because in-year approval of the R&D activity will not apply until the second year of the regime. Officials disagree with providing enhanced cash-out provisions to growth grant recipients as it is unfair to give growth grant recipients greater assistance. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Full refundability (Clause 9) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Fisher & Paykel Limited) The tax credit should be fully refundable: • Cashflow will be essential to ensuring “borderline” projects succeed. • Will ensure investment in R&D continues during periods where businesses face funding challenges. • Non-refundability will disincentivise multinationals to undertake R&D in NZ. • Otherwise growth grant recipients won’t be encouraged to transition. 67 If the credit cannot be fully refunded then it should be limited by some measure, such as a cap. If this is not possible, then a same or similar test should be introduced so that tax credits may be carried forward without adversely disadvantaging start-ups seeking new capital. Comment The Government has committed to reviewing the refundability rules that apply from year 2 of the regime. These views will be considered as part of that review. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Refundability – entities that derive tax exempt income (Clause 9) Submission (Deloitte, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The exclusion from refundability for entities that derive exempt income is too broad and should be deleted. For example, the rule could prevent the following entities from qualifying for refundability: • A company receiving a dividend from a foreign subsidiary or from another company in the same wholly-owned group. • A co mpany wit h a shareholder employee, who pays an exempt reimbursement • Any charity • An organisation that has received a distribution from a Māori Authorit y Comment Officials acknowledge that the scope of the exclusion for exempt income is broader than the policy intent (which was aimed at non-taxpaying organisations). Officials therefore recommend that the exempt income provision is amended so that a person is not excluded from refundability if they derive exempt income under sections CW 9 and CW 10 (foreign dividends and dividends within New Zealand wholly-owned groups). While this will not fully address submitters’ concerns, it will cover the majority of situations and is consistent with how this issue has been treated elsewhere in the Income Tax Act 2007. For example, see sections OB 1(2)(a)(iv), CD 53(3), FM 31(1)(c) and FO 3(1)(c). Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 68 Issue: Standalone refundability rules (Clause 9) Submission (EY, Deloitte) Create standalone refundability rules instead of adopting the tax loss cash-out rules. Comment The refundability rules for the first year of the regime are based off the tax loss cash-out rules due to the limited time that was available to develop a new set of rules. From the second year of the regime, broader refundability will be available, which will be based on a standalone set of rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Refundability for non-business researchers (Clause 9) Submission (EY, Deloitte) The requirement that businesses must spend twenty percent or more of their salary costs on staff performing R&D will exclude non-business researchers from refundability. Comment The Bill defines a non-business researcher to mean a tax charity and an industry levy body. Officials recognise that any organisation which does not incur twenty percent or more of their salary costs on staff performing R&D will be excluded from refundability in the first year of the regime. This is likely to include charities and industry levy bodies. As noted above, a wider refundability regime will be available from year 2 of the regime. Recommendation That the submission be noted, no further action required. Issue: Legislative requirement for future work phases Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) 69 There should be a legislative requirement for intended future phases of the regime to be completed, for example the work on refundability by 2020. Comment This can be achieved operationally, without the need for a legislative requirement. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Applying the credit to outstanding tax first before carrying it forward (Clause 9) Submission (Deloitte) The R&D tax credit should first be applied to outstanding tax liabilities from previous tax years before being carried forward to a future tax year. Comment Under the current amendment to section LA 5, only the R&D tax credit that is refundable (that is, amounts up to $255,000 where the recipient meets the specified criteria in LA 5(4B)) is first offset against outstanding tax liabilities from previous tax years. Officials disagree with the submitter’s suggestion that non-refundable R&D tax credits are first applied to outstanding tax liabilities from previous tax years before they can be carried forward. This effectively elevates the credit to a refundable one, as instead of a person paying their tax liability with cash, they can use their R&D tax credit and keep the cash. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Support for imputation (Clauses 11 – 20) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The group supports giving an imputation credit equal to the R&D tax credit. 70 Comment Officials welcome the support. Recommendation That the submission be noted, no further action required. Issue: Imputation debits (Clauses 11 – 20) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The rules should provide for imputation debits in the event an R&D claim is reassessed downwards. Comment Officials agree that an imputation debit should arise where an R&D claim is reassessed downwards, so that the amount of imputation credits does not exceed the amount of R&D tax credit that the submitter was entitled to, however believe that the bill as drafted already allows for this. Proposed new sections OB 9C, OK 6C and OP 11C provide that a person has an imputation credit (or Māori authority credit, as applicable) equal to the R&D tax credit they are entitled to. The use of the words “entitled to” will ensure that where an R&D claim is assessed downwards, so is the amount of imputation or Māori authority credit. Recommendation That the submission be noted, no further action required. Issue: Applying R&D tax credits to shortfall penalties Submission (Matter raised by officials) The legislation should be amended so that refundable R&D tax credits are required to be offset against all shortfall penalties before they are offset against outstanding income tax to pay, other outstanding tax, or refunded to claimants. An ordering rule should apply to ensure that refundable R&D tax credits are offset against shortfall penalties before losses are used. 71 Comment Officials recommend introducing a provision that requires refundable R&D tax credits to be offset against shortfall penalties, so that a claimant’s R&D tax credits are only refunded once they have been used to pay any shortfall penalties, outstanding income tax, and other outstanding tax. It also makes the treatment of refundable R&D tax credits consistent with the current treatment of other tax credits. Officials do not recommend allowing non-refundable R&D tax credits to be offset against shortfall penalties, because this would essentially treat the R&D tax credit like a refundable tax credit. Any unused non-refundable R&D tax credits can be carried forward to a future income year provided shareholder continuity requirements are met. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 72 ADMINISTRATION Issue: Approved research provider requirements – facilities in New Zealand (Clause 25 (proposed new section 15ZB of the Tax Administration Act 1994)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte) It is unclear what is meant by “facilities”. Does this mean that if an approved research provider has no facilities (that is, because they undertake their activities at the client’s site) they are excluded? (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The words “to the extent” should be inserted before “has in New Zealand the facilities...”, to ensure a person is not precluded from becoming an approved research provider if facilities are not required and the services are performed on the client’s premises. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment The Bill provides that in order for the Commissioner to approve a person as an approved research provider, the person must, among other things, have in New Zealand the facilities needed to perform research and development activities. Officials are of the view that the legislation is sufficiently clear due to the use of the word “needed”. The application of this provision and the meaning of “facilities” will be clarified in guidance. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Approved research provider requirements – services at market value (Clause 25 (proposed new section 15ZB)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The Commissioner should accept that if an approved research provider is providing services to a non-associated party that the activities are undertaken at market value. Comment One of the requirements to become an approved research provider is that the person performs or will perform research and development activities on behalf of other persons for market value consideration. 73 Officials disagree with the submitters’ suggestion. Experience with the Australian regime has indicated that non-market value transactions can occur even where the parties are not associated. For the integrity of the regime it is important that safeguards such as this remain in place. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Notification in writing (Clause 25 (proposed new section 15ZB(6))) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) If the Commissioner approves a person to be an approved research provider, the Commissioner’s notification of that approval should be in writing. Comment Officials agree with the submitters that notification should be in writing. This can be carried out operationally, without the need for legislative change. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Duplicate requirements (Clause 25 (proposed new section 15ZB(4))) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Sections 15ZB(4)(a) and 15ZB(4)(c) essentially say the same thing and should be condensed into one paragraph. Comment Section 15ZB(4) outlines the requirements a person must satisfy for the Commissioner to approve them as an approved research provider. Section 15ZB(4)(a) is about whether the person is capable of performing R&D activities on behalf of others, whereas (c) asks whether they are available to perform those activities. Officials disagree with the submitters’ that these requirements are the same. Capability looks at whether the person has the necessary skills and expertise to perform R&D on behalf of others, 74 whereas availability looks at whether or not they have the time available to perform services on behalf of others not associated to them. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Support for record keeping (Clause 26) Submission (Deloitte) Supports keeping records. Comment Officials welcome the support. Recommendation That the submission be noted, no further action required. Issue: Compliance costs of record keeping (Clause 26) Submission (PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, NZTech, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Concerned about the compliance costs, particularly for small businesses. (PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, NZTech) Records should be able to be created after year end, as opposed to contemporaneously, and should not have to record who created them. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) A simplified compliance regime should be introduced for smaller firms. (PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) A less stringent set of requirements should apply in the first year of the regime because of the Bill being introduced after the regime starts to apply to early balance date taxpayers. (PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund) 75 Comment Officials note that it is important for compliance costs to be minimised as much as possible. However, at the same time, to uphold the integrity of the regime, a sufficient level of record keeping is required. In relation to keeping contemporaneous records and naming the creator, this is not an absolute requirement but adds legitimacy to the records. Officials recognise the important of a suitable compliance regime for small businesses. In addition to the 5-yearly evaluation required by the legislation, Inland Revenue will, as part of its administration of the scheme, review the appropriateness of its requirements for all claimants. Officials disagree with introducing a less stringent set of record keeping requirements in the first year of the regime. Businesses could reasonably expect that if they wanted to claim an R&D tax credit, they would need to keep records. Since the Bill will not be enacted until after the regime starts to apply, there will be some leniency taken in respect of the compliance approach taken. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: R&D supplementary return (Clause 27 (proposed new section 33E)) Submission (PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund) Worried that R&D supplementary returns might require significant information from businesses. Any information required should be information that is already available to businesses as part of their normal commercial and business activities. Addit io nal informat ion requirements should be kept to a minimum. Comment Information businesses already collect will be used to the extent possible. However, additional information will be required to verify claims, evaluate the regime, and maintain policy outcomes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 76 Issue: Filing of R&D supplementary return (Clause 27 (proposed new section 33E)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte) Section 33E presupposes that the person eligible for the R&D tax credit is filing an income tax return. The section should be amended to cover persons who are not required to file a tax return, such as a charity. Comment Officials agree with the submitter and recommend that an amendment is made to resolve this issue. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Fixed date for filing (Clause 27 (proposed new section 33E)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Provide a fixed date for filing, such as the last working day of the month. Counting 30 days from a variable date creates unnecessary compliance costs and risk of error. Comment The Bill proposes that the R&D supplementary return is due 30 days after the person files their tax return. Officials are sympathetic to the submitters’ point, however, due to operational constraints, recommend that the return is due 30 days after the tax return is due to be filed under section 37 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 77 Issue: Credit date for imputation and Māori authority credits (Clauses 12, 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19) Submission (Matter raised by officials) Imputation and Māori authority credits should be credited from the date the company or Māori authority files its income tax return. Comment The Bill as introduced requires imputation credits (proposed new section OB 9C and OP 11) and Māori authority credits (proposed new section OK 6C) to be credited on the date a claimant files their R&D supplementary return for the relevant income year. Officials submit that the credit date for imputation credits and Māori authority credits should be amended so that it is the date a claimant files their income tax return. Operationally, a person will claim their R&D tax credits through their income tax return. Therefore, the date the return is filed is a more appropriate credit date for imputation credits and Māori authority credits. The R&D supplementary return itself does not create an R&D tax credit claim, but rather requires the provision of information to: • support an income tax return in which R&D tax credits are claimed; and • satisfy the Commissioner that a claimant is eligible and has complied with the legislative requirements. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 78 INTEGRITY MEASURES Issue: Exceptions from secrecy too broad (Clause 31) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Subsection (w) should be amended to provide that only aggregated statistical information will be shared and that there will not be any sharing of details of R&D activities. Subsection (x) should be amended to state that information will only be provided which is necessary for the administration of section 68CB (general approval). Comment Clause 31 provides for some exceptions from tax secrecy. Subsections (w) and (x) allow Inland Revenue to share information with select government agencies. Officials disagree with submitters. It will be necessary in some circumstances to share taxpayer specific details rather than rely on aggregated data. Information will only be shared with a small set of carefully selected government agencies. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Publication of claimant details (Clause 30 (proposed new section 68CE)) Submission (EY, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) It should be clarified what details of claimants will be published and whether businesses will receive advance notification. Disclosure shouldn’t extend to the ultimate parent. (EY) The time period between the end of the year to which the R&D tax credit relates and the publication of claimant details should be extended from two years to: • Three years. For late balance date taxpayers, the lag is only 18 months between year-end and publication of the R&D tax credit details. This is because the two-year time period in legislation is based on a tax year concept. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) • Five years. Alternatively, allow it to be extended if the R&D project is still ongoing. R&D projects may be jeopardised where the claim information is published before the R&D 79 project has been finalised and the IP protected. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The published names should be on a group basis, not individual companies. This is because R&D may be undertaken in special purpose entities and the publication of the name may give additional information about what type of R&D is being undertaken, for example, a company named “square apple limited”. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Schematically, this provision sits better in “Part 4- Secrecy” of the Tax Administration Act 1994. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment Proposed new section 68CE requires the Commissioner to publish the names of people who have received R&D tax credits, and the amount of the claim, in appropriate dollar bands. This information must not be published until at least two years have passed since the end of the tax year to which the person’s R&D tax credit relates. In response to EY’s submission, the legislation is clear that it is the names of claimants that will be published. Businesses will be notified as part of the claim process that their name and claim amount within an appropriate dollar band will be published – this can be carried out operationally without the need for legislative change. The intention is that the claimant is named, not the ultimate parent company. Officials disagree with extending the time period for publication beyond two years. Publication of a claimant’s name is unlikely to jeopardise their R&D project as it provides no information about their actual R&D project. Officials disagree with Corporate Taxpayers Group’s suggestion that group names are published, rather than the individual claimant. Officials recommend that if a claimant does not want to give addit ional informat ion away about their project, that they do not name their co mpany after their commercially sensitive R&D programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Support for 5-year evaluation (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 10)) Submission (EY, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, BusinessNZ, ExportNZ, ManufacturingNZ) We support that the R&D scheme will be objectively and independently reviewed every 5 years. Comment Officials welcome the support. 80 Recommendation That the submission be noted, no further action required. Issue: Frequency of evaluation (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 10)) Submission (EY, ExportNZ, ManufacturingNZ, BusinessNZ) Evaluation should be ongoing. (EY) The R&D tax incentive should be evaluated within 4 years of commencement. (ExportNZ, ManufacturingNZ, BusinessNZ) Comment Government agencies’ monitoring of the scheme will be ongoing. Inland Revenue and MBIE have set up the Research and Development Advisory Group comprising various private sector representatives. The Group will meet quarterly to discuss issues relating to the R&D tax credit, including the monitoring and evaluation of the scheme. Officials consider 5 years an appropriate timeframe for evaluation. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Content of evaluation (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 10)) Submission (Deloitte, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, Corporate Taxpayers Group) The following should also be included in the evaluation: • The appropriateness of including social sciences (Deloitte) • The approach to internal software (Deloitte) • The appropriateness of the $3 million internal software development cap and the inclusion of additional core and support activities (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) 81 • $120 million cap (Fisher & Paykel Healthcare) • Thresholds generally (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment The criteria listed in section LY 10 are not intended to be absolute. The evaluation could cover the items listed by submitters. Officials recommend that another paragraph is added to LY 10 to cover “anything else specified by the Minister of Research, Science, and Innovation”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Party responsible for evaluation (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 10)) Submission (EY) Responsibility for the 5-year review should lie with an independent party, not the Minister of Research, Science and Innovation. Comment Officials disagree with the submitter. The responsibility must rest with the Minister of Research, Science and Innovation as the Minister is accountable for the research and development tax incentive. The Bill requires that the Ministers’ report is objective and independent. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Independent and objective (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 10)) Submission (Deloitte) The Bill should introduce additional specifications on how the evaluation will be independent and objective. 82 Comment The legislation already requires that the review is independent and objective. Officials consider that the ordinary meaning of these words is sufficient to ensure that the review is independent and objective, without the need for additional criteria. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Measuring success of the regime (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 10)) Submission (EY, BusinessNZ, ExportNZ, ManufacturingNZ) Measure of the success of the regime should go beyond R&D expenditure as a proportion of GDP and include things like growth in science/technology employment, revenue, profit growth or export revenue growth for R&D tax incentive recipients. This could be achieved by capturing appropriate data during the application process. (EY) The review should seek to ascertain whether there has been any meaningful increase in innovation, investment and productivity on a national basis due to the tax incentive’s introduction. The review should involve a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis and recommend whether or not the incentive should continue. (BusinessNZ, ExportNZ, ManufacturingNZ) Comment As mentioned above, the criteria in LY 10 are not intended to be exhaustive. The Minister may take the above into account when measuring the success of the regime. Recommendation That the submission be noted, no further action required. Issue: Policy intent of the regime for evaluation purposes (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 10)) Submission (EY) The Bill should specify what sources can be relied upon for outlining the policy intent of the regime. 83 Comment Officials disagree with submitters. The usual documents that are used to explain the policy intent of tax law, such as the cabinet papers, Bill commentary and tax information bulletin, can be relied upon for identifying the policy intent of the regime. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Orders-in -Council - safeguards (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 9)) Submission (Legislation Design and Advisory Committee, DAC, EY, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Fletcher Building Limited, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The Governor General should be required to consult with businesses before amending the schedules. (EY, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Fletcher Building Limited, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) At a minimum, the Research and Development Advisory Group should be required to consider any Order in Council before it is issued by the Governor General. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Any change to the schedules should apply from the beginning of the following year. (EY, Fletcher Building Limited) This power covers a matter of policy that could be better dealt with by primary, rather than secondary, legislat ion. Important policy should be a matter determined by Parliament through an open, democratic process. The Order in Council proposes to amend what qualifies for the R&D tax credit – which goes to the core of the Bill. Legislation should empower secondary legislation to amend or override an Act only if: • there is a strong need or benefit to do so • appropriate criteria are included to limit the power to only what is needed to achieve the objective; and • consultation with people affected by the power occurs. (Legislation Design and Advisory Committee) Comment The Bill proposes that the Governor-General have the ability to make changes to schedules 21 and 21B on the joint recommendation of the Minister of Revenue and the Minister of Research, 84 Science and Innovation. Schedules 21 and 21B determine what activities are considered to be R&D, and what kinds of expenditure qualify for the credit. Officials have subsequently consulted wit h the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee (LDAC), and recommend: • An explicit reference in section LY 9 to the purpose section (section LY 1(1)) • Adding a requirement to consult with affected parties • Adding a requirement that any additions or removals have to meet the purpose stated in LY 1(1). Officials are consulting further with LDAC on section LY 9, and will keep the Committee informed as consultation with LDAC progresses. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Broadening the scope of the Order in Council provision (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 9)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG) The scope of this provision should be extended to include an ability to amend sections LY 2, LY 3 and the $3 million cap on internal software development. (KPMG) There should be an ability to increase thresholds (that is, refundability cap) contained in the legislation, as well as the tax credit rate, the expenditure cap and the capped overseas expenditure amount via Order in Council. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Comment Officials disagree with submitters. Consistent with Legislation Design and Advisory Committee’s submission above, Orders in Council should only be used where there is a strong need or benefit to a prompt response. Officials do not consider that the above suggestions meet this threshold. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 85 Issue: The general anti-avoidance rule is sufficient (Clause 7 (proposed new section GB 56)) Submission (EY) Clause 7 should be deleted. The general anti-avoidance rule in section BG 1 would cover R&D tax credit arrangements. Comment Officials disagree with the submitter. The general anti-avoidance rule does not apply to R&D tax credits as they are not defined as “income tax”. The specific anti-avo idance provisio n is targeted specifically at R&D tax credit arrangements as well as non-market transactions, which may not be “arrangements”. In that respect it is broader than tax avoidance arrangements that the general anti-avoidance provision is targeted at. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Indirect purpose or effect (Clause 7 (proposed new section GB 56)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Delete “or indirect” as it does not add anything. The language “direct or indirect purpose or effect, not being a merely incidental purpose or effect” is redundant language as an indirect effect is likely to be merely incidental. Replace the language with “an arrangement has a purpose or effect” to be consistent with the language of other specific anti-avoidance provisions. Comment Officials agree with the submitter. The direct and indirect distinction was intended to capture effects or purposes from persons not party to the arrangement, however this is covered in section GB 56(2) so is unnecessary. Officials recommend that the provision is amended to read “an arrangement has a purpose of effect, not being a merely incidental purpose or effect...”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 86 Issue: Non-market rule is unnecessary (Clause 7 (proposed new section GB 56)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Section GB 56(1)(b) (the non-market value rule) is unnecessary given that schedule 21B already limits non-market value expenditure. Comment Officials agree with the submitter. Schedule 21B part B clause 18 already disallows expenditure to the extent it is greater than the market value of the goods or services. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Transactions should be readjusted to market value (Clause 7 (proposed new section GB 56)) Submission (Deloitte, Corporate Taxpayers Group) Section GB 56(2) should be clarified so that the Commissioner, in the case of an inflated transaction, is required to reduce the person’s claim to the amount that would have arisen had the transaction occurred at market value. Comment Officials are recommending that the non-market value provisio n is removed fro m the ant i- avoidance rule, as outlined in the above submission. This addresses the submitters’ point. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Promoter penalties – contingency fee arrangements (Clause 37) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) 87 A person shouldn’t be considered a promoter because they offer services on a contingency fee basis. It should only apply where a person deliberately assists a claimant to inflate their claim. (PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The Group understands that the concern with contingent fees is that they might encourage aggressive positions and also “grave digging” in prior periods to increase R&D tax credit claims. However, the Bill contains some additional protections from “grave digging”. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment Officials disagree with submitters. A promoter penalty will only apply where the advisor has offered 10 or more contingency fee arrangements in relation to R&D tax credit claims, and one or more of the advisor’s clients has been subject to a shortfall penalty for abusive tax position in relation to that arrangement. An abusive tax position is a very high standard and requires a dominant purpose of avoiding tax (reducing tax liabilities or increasing tax benefits). For example, it would apply where an advisor has assisted a taxpayer to recharacterize non-R&D expenditure as R&D expenditure. In relat ion to Corporate Taxpayers Group’s submission, promoter penalties for contingency fee arrangements are still necessary to disincentivise aggressive tax positions and to prevent inflated claims from the limited “grave digging” (this is where a person reclassifies their expenditure as R&D expenditure after the end of the year) that is allowed under the Bill. The Bill does not prevent a person operating on a contingency fee basis. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Promoter penalties – software (Clause 37) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Unclear how the use of software should be subject to promoter penalties unless there is outright fraud being undertaken (in which case other penalties apply). Comment The Bill proposes amendments to the definition of promoter, so that a promoter includes a person party to, or significantly involved in, formulating software from which an arrangement is offered. This rule is intended to capture people who offer software which calculates R&D claims. This person will be subject to a promotor penalty where they have offered the arrangement involving use of the software to ten or more people, and one or more of these people has become liable to a shortfall penalty for abusive tax position as a result of the R&D credit calculation undertaken as a result of the arrangement. 88 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Promoter penalties – definition of contingency fee (Clause 37) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) “Contingency fee” should be a defined term. It should not include an arrangement where a fee has a ceiling of a maximum percentage of the R&D tax credit, but otherwise the costs are based on market rates. Comment Officials consider that the ordinary meaning of “contingency fee” is sufficient. The arrangement described by submitters would not be classified as a contingency fee as the fee is not conditional on the claim being successful. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Deadlines for filing and amending assessments (Clause 35) Submission (EY) Clause 35 should be deleted. There should be no restriction on the number of NOPAs or section 113 requests that can be made by a taxpayer within the time bar period. Comment The Bill proposes that a person is only able to adjust their R&D tax credit claim upwards once and must do so within two years of the due date of their income tax return for the relevant income year. This restriction applies whether a person issues a NOPA or requests an amendment under section 113. Officials disagree with the submitter. This restriction is intended to limit taxpayers’ abilit y to retrospectively reclassify expenditure as R&D expenditure. This practice is seen with the Australian R&D scheme. 89 As outlined in a later submission, officials are recommending reducing the two-year time period to one year, to further limit claimants’ ability to retrospectively reclassify expenditure. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 90 IN-YEAR APPROVAL Issue: Cost of in-year approval applications (Clause 43 (proposed new sections 68CB and 68CC)) Submission (KPMG) No fees should be applied to in-year approval applications. Comment Officials agree with the submitter. Cost is not referred to in the legislation, but the guidance will clarify that no fees will be charged for in-year approval applications. Recommendation That the submission be noted. No further action is required. Issue: Support for certainty provided by in-year approval (Clause 43 (proposed new sections 68CB and 68CC)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) General support for both the general approval and significant performer regimes as a practical way for taxpayers and Inland Revenue to obtain more certainty. Comment Officials welcome the support. Recommendation That the submission be noted. No further action is required. Issue: Administrative burden on Inland Revenue (Clause 43 (proposed new sections 68CB and 68CC)) Submission (EY) 91 Concern regarding Inland Revenue’s access to sufficient resources to conduct due diligence on in-year approval applications, with a rush of applications expected in January to May each year. Comment Officials are confident that Inland Revenue will have access to sufficient resources. This submission will be taken into consideration operationally when allocating resources to the in-year approval process. Recommendation That the submission be noted. No further action is required. Issue: In-year approval process should not be compulsory (Clause 43 (proposed new sections 68CB and 68CC)) Submission (EY) In-year approval should be optional, because while it would improve the integrity of the regime, it could lead to a greater compliance burden. Many businesses would be comfortable with self- assessment in exchange for a reduced compliance burden. Comment Evidence from other jurisdictions suggests that the integrity of the system requires compulsory in-year approval. In any event, it is not anticipated that in-year approval will result in an additional compliance burden for claimants, because the provision of information via in-year approval applications will result in less information being requested at the R&D supplementary return stage. For general approval customers, the effect of the new in-year approval requirement in year two is, therefore, a timing difference. Instead of providing all claim information at the end of the year in an R&D supplementary return, a claimant will be expected to provide some of their claim information in an in-year approval application and the rest of their claim information in their R&D supplementary return. Splitting the provision of information between these two interaction points with Government/claimants is expected to help smooth the workload of both officers administering the regime and claimants. Compared with general approval applications, significantly less information will be required from customers seeking to opt into the significant performer regime. Officials are still working on the requirements of the significant performer criteria and methodologies approval process but are considering the compliance burden on claimants as part of this work. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 92 Issue: Timeframe for processing applications (Clause 43 (proposed new section 68CB)) Submission (EY, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The Commissioner should be required to process and respond to an application within 28 days of receiving the application. (EY) There should be a legislative requirement that the Commissioner must respond to applications within a set time frame, such as three months following receipt of an application. The deadline could be subject to a waiver by the taxpayer if the Commissioner asks for additional information. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment Officials agree that expedient processing of in-year approvals is a necessary foundation of the scheme in order to provide businesses with certainty to support their R&D programmes. No change to legislation is proposed because this is an operational consideration. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Process for declining applications Clause 43 (proposed new sections 68CB and 68CC)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY) If the Commissioner declines a person’s application, the person should be entitled to provide additional information to support their application. Comment Officials agree that before a person’s application is declined, the Commissioner should be required to contact the person to discuss their application (and, where appropriate, provide the person wit h the opportunity to supply additional information). It is recommended that the legislation be amended to require the Commissioner to contact a claimant before declining their application. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 93 Issue: Dual eligibility for general approval and significant performer regime (Clause 43 (proposed new sections 68CB and 68CC)) Submission (EY) A person who opts into the significant performer regime should also be able to obtain general approval in respect of some of their core R&D activities. Comment Officials acknowledge that significant R&D performers would benefit from the certainty afforded by the general approval process for some of their R&D activities. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Disputing the Commissioner’s decision to decline applications (Clause 43(proposed new sections 68CB, 68CC) and clause 44 (amendment to section 138E)) Submission (EY) Applicants should have an option (additional to judicial review) to dispute decisions made by the Commissioner to decline approval applications. Proposed new sections 68CB and 68CC should be removed from the proposed amendment to section 138E. Comment In-year approval applications which would otherwise be declined will not be declined until the Commissioner has contacted the applicant about their application. If an application is declined despite contact with the applicant, the applicant is nevertheless able to file another application provided they are within the prescribed timeframe for in-year approval applications. An additional disputes process is unnecessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 94 Issue: Due date of applications and variations to applications (Clause 43 (proposed new sections 68CB and 68CC)) Submission (EY, Deloitte) Approval applications (and any variations to them) should be due by the end of the fifth month after the end of the relevant income year. Requiring applications (and variations to applications) to be made on or before the seventh day of the second month after the end of the relevant income year provides businesses with insufficient time, seems unnecessarily arbitrary, and is a time of year that is generally very busy for most businesses who will be undertaking year-end lodgements and audits. It also does not provide businesses with enough time to vary their applications if they require a variation due to a significant transaction or restructure. (EY) The variation limitation means taxpayers have significantly less flexibility for R&D projects that span multiple years. This does not encourage innovation. (Deloitte) Comment Businesses can file their applications any time from the start of their income year to the seventh day of the second month after the end of the relevant income year. That is, businesses have thirteen months and seven days to lodge their applications, and any variations to their applications, with Inland Revenue. If businesses file their applications and receive approval from Inland Revenue earlier in the year, they will receive certainty that their R&D activities are eligible and may even be able to use their approval to obtain finance. The in-year approval process has been designed to encourage businesses to discuss their intention to do R&D with Inland Revenue before commencing their R&D activities. Businesses are also encouraged to use their R&D plans as a basis for their applications and to keep contemporaneous records of their R&D activities. Pushing out the in-year approval deadline would reduce the incentive for businesses to discuss their activities with Inland Revenue up-front and keep contemporaneous records. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: General approval of supporting activities (Clause 43 (proposed new section 68CB)) Submission (Deloitte, EY, KPMG, Corporate Taxpayers Group) General approval should be available for core and supporting activities, so that businesses have certainty regarding whether their activities are eligible. Experience with other jurisdictions 95 indicates that the eligibility of supporting activities can be contentious, so the ability to obtain approval of supporting activities could minimise these issues. Comment General approval is currently only available for core activities, but officials agree with extending the general approval process to supporting activities. The distinction between core and supporting activities is not always overtly clear so the extension will provide businesses with more certainty Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Multi-year approvals (Clause 43 (proposed new sections 68CB and 68CC)) Submission (Deloitte) A person should only have to apply for in-year approval once if they intend for it to span three years. Requiring a person to apply each year is administratively inefficient. Comment The legislation only requires a person to apply for in-year approval once if they intend for the approval to apply for multiple income years. Applicants with multi-year approval of their activities are only required to confirm that there have been no material changes to their R&D in subsequent income years. Recommendation That the submission be noted. No further action is required. Issue: General approval application form (Clause 43 (proposed new section 68CB)) Submission (KPMG) Businesses should be required to provide a brief explanation of how their R&D activities satisfy the relevant definitions. If a business has to vary an existing approval, there should be a fast track procedure to obtain approval of the variation. 96 Comment The legislation gives the Commissioner the power to prescribe a general approval application form. There is no legislatively prescribed timeframe for processing variations to existing general approvals. The Commissioner will take this submission into consideration when designing the general approval application process and deciding on the appropriate timeframes for processing variation requests. Recommendation That the submission be noted. No further action is required. Issue: Early availability of significant performer approval process and pilot programme (Clause 30 (proposed new sections 68CB and 68CC)) Submission (Fisher & Paykel Healthcare) We support the significant performer approval being available as early as possible and would welcome a pilot approach and working with officials on the detailed design. Comment Officials appreciate the support for the significant performer approval process. Officials agree that a pilot approach has merit, and that the legislation should be amended to enable a binding pilot process for both general approval and significant performer criteria and methodologies approval in year one for a sample of appropriate claimants. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Requirements of R&D certificates unclear (Clause 42 (proposed new section 15ZC)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Section 15ZC does not specify what an R&D certificate has to cover. 97 Comment It is a legislative requirement that any claimant who opts into the significant performer regime obtain an R&D certificate from an R&D certifier. It is envisaged that an R&D certifier will be an accounting or law firm with the relevant legal and accounting expertise to provide R&D certificates. Each R&D certificate must be in the form prescribed by the Commissioner. Work is currently under way on the form that will be prescribed for R&D certificates. Officials will consult as appropriate with stakeholders on the design of the form. Guidance will also be provided on what the R&D certification process is expected to cover. Recommendation That the submission be noted. No further action is required. Issue: Revocation where client has been subject to a shortfall penalty (Clause 42 (pr oposed new section 15ZC(7))) Submission (EY, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) This provision should either be deleted or amended. If it is amended, it should be clear that section 15ZC(7) only applies to an R&D certifier where: • The certifier has provided an R&D certificate in relation to a claim that resulted in a shortfall penalty being applied in relation to R&D tax credits; • The shortfall penalty was for gross carelessness or a higher standard, such as aggressive tax planning or evasion; and • The certifier has provided an R&D certificate in relation to ten claims that resulted in a shortfall penalty for gross carelessness (or a higher standard) being applied. An R&D certifier should not have their approval revoked because of an omission or minor error. (EY) This provision is unlikely to be effective because an R&D certifier could decline to complete another R&D certificate for any clients who receive a shortfall penalty. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Comment Section 15ZC(7) requires the Commissioner to revoke an R&D certifier’s approval if the R&D certifier has provided an R&D certificate to a claimant who has been liable to a shortfall penalty in relation to R&D credits at any time in the last two years. Officials agree that since R&D certifiers will be at a firm level rather than an individual level, proposed new section 15ZC(7) is overly punitive. 98 Officials recommend amending the subsection so that it is triggered by a higher standard of non- compliance. The proposed amendment would require an R&D certifier’s status to be revoked only if: • The R&D certifier receives a promoter penalty; or • The R&D certifier provides an R&D certificate to someone who is liable (in relation to an R&D tax credit claim) for shortfall penalties for tax avoidance, taking an abusive tax posit ion, or tax evasio n. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Whether an R&D certifier is at the individual or firm level (Clause 42 (proposed new section 15ZC)) Submission (EY, Deloitte) It is unclear whether the “person” referred to in proposed new section 15ZC is an individual or an entire firm. It is also unclear how the penalty regime fits in with this. Comment An R&D certifier will be a firm as a whole (for example, a partnership or an entire company), rather than an individual within a firm. Officials recommend that: • Where a firm is approved as an R&D certifier, the firm be required to provide Inland Revenue with the names of individuals with delegated authority to issue R&D certificates on behalf of the firm. • The section is amended so that it is clear that: − Once an application is approved, R&D certifier status starts from the date of a firm’s application to be an R&D certifier; and − R&D certifier status ends on the date a firm’s revocation is published in a publication chosen by the Commissioner. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 99 Issue: Expertise required of an R&D certifier (Clause 42 (proposed new section 15ZC(2)(b))) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) It may be difficult for a person to provide a statutory declaration that they have the legal, accounting, and scientific or technical expertise necessary to be an R&D certifier. Larger accounting and legal firms might have access to this expertise on a regional or global basis but may have insufficient local expertise to make the declaration. Section 15ZC(2)(b) should be amended so that a person can make the declaration even if they do not have the required expertise themselves but have the ability to access to it. Comment Officials agree that it is important that potential R&D certifiers are able to satisfy the declaration required by section 15ZC (2), but foreign expertise does not necessarily translate to expertise of the New Zealand R&D tax credit regime. R&D certifiers must have the necessary accounting and legal expertise (required by proposed new section 15ZC(2)(a)) in-house to provide the statutory declaration needed to become an R&D certifier. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Require R&D certifiers to be members of an appropriate professional body (Clause 42 (proposed new section 15ZC)) Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund) The legislation should require each R&D certifier to be a member of an appropriate professional body, to ensure that they are competent and bound by professional ethics. Comment It is expected that most R&D certifiers will be members of an appropriate professional body. Such membership is not a legislative requirement, however, as the statutory declaration required by section 15ZB(2) regarding competency and expertise should be sufficient to ensure R&D certifiers have the ability to provide R&D certificates. The penalty regime established by section 15ZC (which allows the Commissioner to revoke the approval of an R&D certifier in certain circumstances) should be sufficient to ensure R&D certifiers act ethically. 100 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: No time limit on reapplication to be an R&D certifier where the person requested revocation (Clause 42 (proposed new section 15ZC)) Submission (EY) There should be no timeframe limiting approval as an R&D certifier where the person has previously requested revocation of approval under section 15ZC(3). Comment Section 15ZC(6) allows the Commissioner to revoke an R&D certifier’s approval at her discretion. She is also required to revoke approval, under section 15ZC(7), where an R&D certifier has provided an R&D certificate to a claimant who has received a shortfall penalty in relation to their R&D tax credits at any stage over the past two years (unless the claimant wilfully misled the R&D certifier). R&D certifiers are also able to request the Commissioner revoke their approval under section 15ZC(3). Section 15ZC(4) provides that the Commissioner must not approve a person whose approval the Commissioner has revoked in the last 2 years, irrespective of why the approval was revoked. Officials agree that the circumstances in which the Commissioner must decline an application (under section 15ZC(4)) should be limited to circumstances where the Commissioner has revoked an R&D certifier’s approval under section 15ZC(7), or where the R&D certifier has surrendered their approval in anticipation of a revocation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Commissioner should provide reason for revocation (Clause 42 (proposed new section 15ZC)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The Commissioner should be required to provide a reason for revoking approval as an accepted R&D certifier. 101 Comment From an operational perspective, it is expected that the Commissioner will provide reasons for revoking her approval of R&D certifiers. No legislative amendment is required. Recommendation That the submission is noted. No further action is required. Issue: JVs should be able to satisfy the $2 million R&D expenditure threshold as a collective (Clause 43 (proposed new section 68CC)) Submission (Matter raised by officials) A JV should be able to satisfy the $2 million of eligible R&D expenditure threshold by grouping the expenditure of the members of a JV and considering their total eligible R&D expenditure as a collective. Comment Proposed new section 68CC provides that a person may opt-out of the general approval regime if they have, or reasonably estimate that they will have, more than $2 million of eligible R&D expenditure for the relevant income year. The Bill as currently drafted allows a person to satisfy the $2m threshold in their own right, as a partner in a partnership (looking at the partnership’s expenditure as a collective), or by grouping the person’s expenditure with the expenditure of other members of their corporate group. To be consistent with the treatment for corporate groups and partnerships, JVs should be able to satisfy this threshold as a collective. In other words, if a JV (as a whole) has, or expects to have, $2 million of eligible R&D expenditure, all members of the joint venture satisfy the $2m threshold in proposed new section 68CC. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Cost estimates should not be required from significant performers (Clause 43 (proposed new section 68CC)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) 102 Claimants wishing to opt into the significant performer regime should not be required to provide an estimate of their eligible R&D expenditure for the income year. Requiring an estimate will only cause problems if there ends up being a material difference between the estimate and a person’s actual R&D tax credit claim as returned in their income tax and R&D supplementary returns. If an estimate is required, then it needs to be clarified whether the estimate has to be filed on a global basis or for each individual R&D activity. Comment To be eligible for the significant performer regime, claimants will need to reasonably estimate that they will incur more than $2m of eligible R&D expenditure. Therefore, it is necessary for claimants to estimate their expenditure to confirm that they are eligible to opt into the regime. Claimants’ actual eligible R&D expenditure, as filed, is not required to match the estimate. Claimants will not be required to split their estimate up into amounts spent on individual activities. An estimate of the entire amount a claimant expects to incur over the course of an income year will suffice. An estimate of eligible R&D expenditure is also useful because it can provide the Government with an indication of the likely fiscal cost of claims by larger R&D performers. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Material change to the provisions of subpart LY (Clause 43 (proposed new section 68CC(2)(b)(iii))) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Inland Revenue should contact affected claimants directly if it considers there has been a material change to the provisions in subpart LY that would affect the criteria and methodologies approval of a significant R&D performer. There should not be many claimants with criteria and methodology approval, so contacting each claimant should not be overly administratively burdensome for Inland Revenue. Section 68CC(2)(b)(iii) should be amended so that it also refers to the schedules. Alternatively, there could be a defined term of “R&D tax credit rules” that lists all the relevant provisions. Comment Criteria and methodologies approval provided by the Commissioner under section 68CC(2)(b) binds the Commissioner for up to three years, provided certain criteria are met. One of the criteria is a requirement that no material change in the provisions in subpart LY, or any associated provisions, has taken place for the income year. 103 Officials agree that any material change to the R&D tax credit legislation that would have a material impact on approval applications would need to be communicated to affected claimants. Any legislative change would be accompanied by appropriate communication and a reasonable notice period. It is expected that changes that take effect during an income year would only occur in exceptional circumstances, and that for the most part any legislative change would take effect from the income year after the change is first announced. Any approvals in place at the time a legislative change takes place would only be affected to the extent the legislative change is directly relevant to the approvals, and the impacts – and equity – of any legislative change on existing approvals will be taken into consideration before any changes are made. Officials do not consider it necessary to specifically refer to the schedules as it is clear from the drafting of subpart LY that the schedules are associated provisions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: More information needed on criteria and methodologies approval process (Clause 43 (proposed new section 68CC)) Submission (Fletcher Building Limited, Deloitte) The Government should provide additional information on what protection criteria and methodologies approval provides applicants. It would also be helpful if there were more guidance on what information will be required as part of the criteria and methodologies approval application process (Fletcher Building Limited). The legislation is currently ambiguous as to the nature of criteria and methodologies approval claims where a person has multiple, distinct R&D activities (Deloitte). Comment Work is currently under way on the criteria and methodologies approval process. Information on the regime and the likely information requirements will be publicised once the process has been further developed. Stakeholders will also be consulted, as appropriate, on their views regarding the criteria and methodologies approval process. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 104 Issue: Circular logic (Clause 43 (proposed new section 68CC)) Submission (Deloitte) Subsection LY 3(1)(bb) should be excluded from subsection 68CC(2). The proposed R&D certification process means that a certifier is required to certify compliance with subpart LY, however section LY 3(1)(bb) means that this cannot occur until approval is received under section 68CC. This is circular. Comment Officials disagree with the submitter. The legislation does not require the certifier to certify compliance with subpart LY and therefore there is no issue of circularity. Proposed new subsection 15ZC(1) provides that a “research and development certificate” is in relation to a person’s research and development tax credit. The information that must be contained in the certificate is not prescribed by legislation. As outlined in the commentary it is expected that R&D certificates will be required to confirm that: • an R&D certifier (typically a law or accounting firm) has reviewed a sample of a person’s eligible R&D expenditure; • the expenditure sample reviewed by the R&D certifier was calculated in accordance with the R&D tax credit rules; and • the person incurred, or was reasonable in estimating that they would incur, more than $2 million of eligible R&D expenditure in the relevant income year. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 105 DRAFTING Issue: Purpose statement – “business-as-usual activities” is too restrictive (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 1(1))) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, EY, WSP Opus, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, Roger Ford, KPMG) “Business-as-usual activities” is too restrictive, and for some companies includes eligible R&D. (EY, WSP Opus, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare) “Business-as usual” should be defined (Roger Ford, Deloitte, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare) or replaced (Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, KPMG) or clarified so that policy intent is clear (Fisher & Paykel Healthcare). Replace: “ensure that business-as-usual activities do not qualify for” with “ensure that commercial or operational activities are not artificially reclassified to qualify for...”. (EY) Use more direct language, such as “ensuring that only eligible R&D activities are funded by the tax credit”. (KPMG) Comment Officials agree with submitters that “business-as-usual activities” is too restrictive and recommend that section LY 1(1)(b) is amended to better reflect the policy intent of the regime. The policy intent is to provide a tax credit for activities that generate new knowledge, and to ensure that activities that are not R&D do not inappropriately qualify. Officials are currently consulting with the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee (LDAC) on the content of the purpose statement, as it is relevant to LDAC’s submission on Orders in Council. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Defined terms (Clause 6, clause 10 (proposed new sections LY 1 and LY 3)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) “Input tax” should be added to the list of defined terms under section LY 1. (Deloitte, Corporate Taxpayers Group) 106 “Research and development tax credit” should be replaced with “research and development activities” in the list of defined terms in section EE 6. (Deloitte, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) “Group of companies” should be added to the list of defined terms under section LY 3. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment Officials agree with the submitters. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Foreign research and development expenditure (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 7)) Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The drafting should make it clear that the R&D expenditure must relate to supporting activities. It is unclear why core activities are excluded from the overseas rule. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Section LY 7(1)(a) refers to a research and development activity performed outside New Zealand”, an R&D activity is defined to include both core and support activities. This makes the policy intent unclear that core R&D activities cannot be performed outside New Zealand. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Comment Officials recommend that the legislation is amended to clarify that only foreign expenditure for an activity that is integral to a core activity conducted in New Zealand is eligible for the credit (that is, a supporting activity). Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Deadlines for filing and amending assessments (Clause 35) Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) 107 Section 113E could be more clearly drafted - it could cross-reference to section 89DA and 113. The cross reference to section 108(1E) (which is a 2-year period) is inconsistent with the four- month time period for taxpayers to file a notice of proposed adjustment. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Proposed section 113E is confusing and should be rewritten to clarify that a person can only: • adjust their R&D tax credit claim upwards once; and • the claim must be completed within two years of the due date of their income tax return for the relevant income year. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment Officials recommend that the drafting is simplified so that it is consistent with Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand’s suggestion. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Ability to dispute assessments Submission (Matter raised by officials) A person should only be able to make a section 113 request to amend their R&D tax credit assessment if they have provided an R&D supplementary return within the time allowed under section 33E. Comment Officials recommend introducing a provision to prevent a claimant from filing a section 113 request to amend their R&D tax credit assessment unless they have filed an R&D supplementary return within the time allowed under proposed new section 33E. Currently, proposed new section 89DA(1)(ab) only prevents a person filing a NOPA (but not a section 113 request) if they have not provided their R&D supplementary return within the time allowed under section 33E. It is proposed that R&D supplementary returns be due within 30 days of the due date of a claimant’s income tax return under section 37 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This means that for a claimant with a standard balance date of 31 March, their R&D supplementary return would be due by 30 April. Similar to proposed new section 33E and the amendment to section 108, the rationale for this recommended amendment is to limit claimants’ ability to retrospectively reclassify expenditure. If a claimant receives R&D tax credits for R&D they were unaware of at the time the R&D activities took place, the R&D tax credit regime has not provided any incentive to the person to undertake additional R&D. 108 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Time bar for amending R&D tax credit assessments (Clause 33) Submission (Matter raised by officials) Proposed new section 108(1E) should be amended so that the Commissioner may only amend an assessment so as to increase an amount of R&D tax credit if one year or less has passed from the latest date to provide a return of income for the relevant tax year. Comment The Bill as introduced allows the Commissioner to increase a person’s R&D tax credit claim amount, provided the amended assessment takes place within two years of the person’s latest date for filing their income tax return. For a person with a tax agent (so with an extension of time) claiming R&D tax credits for the year ended 31 March 2020, their income tax return would be due by 31 March 2021 and the Commissioner would be able to amend their assessment upwards any time before 31 March 2023. The changes to section 108(1E) recommended by officials would reduce the amount of time available for increasing assessments to one year after a person’s income tax return due date. So for the person in the above example, the Commissioner would only have until 31 March 2022 to amend the person’s assessment to increase their R&D tax credit claim. Similar to proposed new section 33E and the amendment to section 108, the rationale for this recommended amendment is to limit claimants’ ability to retrospectively reclassify expenditure. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: General structure of subpart LY (Clause 10) Submission (Deloitte, Corporate Taxpayers Group) Section LY 1(2)(c) should be expressed in the same way as (a) to (f). (Deloitte) Sections LY 5, 6 and 7 are not explained in LY 1(2). (Deloitte, Corporate Taxpayers Group) 109 Comment Officials’ disagree with the submitter’s suggested amendment to section LY 1(2)(c) as there would be no substantive difference if the provision was re-expressed as suggested. Section LY 1(2)(c) is merely a sign-posting provision. Officials agree that sections LY 5, 6 and 7 should be explained in LY 1(2). Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: GST adjustments (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 1(5) to (7))) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Section LY 1(5) is unnecessarily complicated – the Bill should refer to section DB 2 concepts. LY 1(5) should only be overridden by LY 1(6) and (7) “to the extent” those sections apply. In LY 1(6), GST adjustments can be positive or negative so “reduced” should be replaced with “adjusted”. Comment Officials agree with the submitters and recommend that the drafting is simplified by referring to section DB 2. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Ordering of definitions (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 2)) Submission (EY) The definition of R&D activity should go before the definition of core activity. Comment Definition sections in tax legislation must be in alphabetical order. 110 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Unintended implication (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 3(1)(c))) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The wording “the person or a company in the same group of companies as the person has” should be reworded to “the person, or if the person is a company, a company in the same group of companies as the person has...”. The current draft implies that the person must be a company. Comment Officials are recommending that subsection LY 3(1)(c) be deleted. This will resolve the submitter’s concern. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: No further consideration (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 3(1)(d)(ii))) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Section LY 3(1)(d)(ii) should be amended to refer to “no further considerat ion”. Comment Amending the legislation in line with the submitters’ suggestion implies that some consideration for the results of the R&D is permissible. This is not the policy intention. Consideration to use the results of the R&D activity is separate from any consideration to create the results of the R&D activity. Any consideration a principal pays a contractor to perform the R&D activity is not considered to be consideration to use the results of the activity. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 111 Issue: Consistency in referring to R&D activity or R&D activities (Clause 10 (proposed new subpart LY)) Submission (EY, Corporate Taxpayers Group) The Bill should be consistent in referring to either “R&D activity” or “R&D activities”. (EY) All three definitions in section LY 2 should be refined as “activities” rather than “activity”. For example, when applying the rule that expenditure that would have been incurred in the absence of the R&D activity is ineligible, applying a single activity approach would mean that if a business was running 2 concurrent R&D activities (one large project (Project A) and one smaller project (Project B)) which required an R&D lab facility to run trials, Project B couldn’t have lab costs attributed to it because those lab costs had already been incurred for Project A. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment Officials disagree with submitters. Under ordinary principles of statutory interpretation and the Interpretation Act 1999 singular and plural concepts can be interchanged. In response to Corporate Taxpayers Group’s point, if a claimant is performing R&D in a commercial environment, then the additional costs of the R&D would be claimable. Costs are only claimable once. If the lab costs have been claimed for project A, then they cannot be claimed for project B. If some of the additional costs relate to project B and have not been claimed as part of project A, then the commercial production rule wouldn’t prevent them from being claimed. If the addit ional lab costs relate to both projects, then it is appropriate to claim the percentage that relates to each activity. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarification that rules apply on an income year basis (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 3(2))) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Section LY 3(2) should state “despite subsection (1), this subpart does not apply for a person for an income year”, to make clear it applies on an income year basis. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 112 Issue: Unnecessary drafting (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 3(3))) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Not sure that LY 3(3) is necessary. Comment Section LY 3 outlines when subpart LY applies. LY 3(3) provides that where the person does not meet the eligibility criteria in LY 3(1) and (2), section LY 8 still applies to allow the person to carry forward their R&D tax credits to the next tax year. This rule is necessary to allow a person who has R&D tax credits from a previous year to carry them forward to the next tax year. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: “An” or “the” (Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 5(1)(a))) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Should the reference to “an income year” in LY 5(1)(a) be “the income year”? Comment Officials agree with the submitter that the reference should be to “the income year”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Punctuation (Clause 7 (proposed new section GB 56), clause 43 (section 68CC(1)(a))) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Sections GB 56(1)(a) and GB 56(1)(b) should be joined with “; and”. 113 There are missing commas in section 68CC(1)(a). “Has or reasonably estimates that that” should be “has, or reasonably estimates that, the...”. Comment Officials disagree with the submitter’s proposed amendment to section GB 56 as it would substantially change the meaning of the section. Under the Bill as currently drafted, section GB 56 applies either where there has been an arrangement with the purpose of defeating the intent and application of subpart LY, or where there has been an inflated transaction. If the submitter’s suggestion was adopted, both an arrangement and an inflated transaction would be required for proposed new section GB 56 to apply. Officials consider that section 68CC(1)(a) would read better with commas as follows “...has, or reasonably estimates that the person will have, eligible research and development expenditure...”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Definition of “R&D tax credit rules” (Clause 21 (section YA 1)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The Bill contains numerous references to the “R&D tax credit rules”. Consideration should be given to defining this. Comment The Bill does not contain reference to the “R&D tax credit rules”. Officials do not consider that a definition is necessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Incorrect cross reference (Clause 21(4)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The cross reference should be to section LY 8(4) not LY 8(3). 114 Comment Officials agree with the submitter. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Reference to associate should be to associated person (Schedule 1 (proposed new schedule 21B part B)) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The reference to an “associate” in schedule 21B part B clause 8 should be to an “associated person”. Comment Officials disagree with the submitter’s suggestion. “Associated person” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is defined to include “other expressions indicating the association of persons with each other”. Therefore, the use of “associate” is correct. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Replace “intent” with “purpose” (Clause 43 (section 68CC(8))) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Replace “intent” with “purpose”. Comment Officials agree with the submitter that “purpose” would be more suitable in this context given subpart LY has a “purpose statement” in LY 1(1). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 115 Issue: Drafting suggestion (Clause 33) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The reference to “the latest date to provide a return of income for the relevant tax year” should be a reference to the filing dates under section 37, consistent with the drafting in section LY 3(2)(a). Comment Officials disagree with the submitter. The current wording in clause 33 is consistent with the existing wording in section 108 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 116 GUIDANCE Issue: Information that should be included in guidance Submission (Fletcher Building Limited, KPMG, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund, EY) Guidance should: • Include examples of fact patterns from the 2008 regime (Fletcher Building Limited) • Provide more information on when records need to be created (KPMG) • Clarify that an R&D contractor can be undertaking an R&D activity on behalf of more than just one person, for example, in a joint venture between person A and person B, the contractor can perform the activity on behalf of both A and B (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) • Clarify that site-specific R&D can qualify. (Fletcher Building Limited) • Explain: − the meaning of “relevant adjustment” in LY 1(6) (Deloitte) − the meaning of “business-as-usual” (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) − how the ordering rules will apply for consolidated groups (Deloitte) − how the legislation should be interpreted for software R&D (EY, Deloitte, Corporate Taxpayers Group) − the day-to-day management requirement (Corporate Taxpayers Group) − the meaning of “material purpose”. (Fletcher Building Limited, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) − the work/costs/documentation needed to meet the uncertainty requirement, especially for mult i-year projects. (PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund) − what is required for someone to “own the results” of an R&D activity and that owning the results of the R&D refers to the IP of the R&D activity and not the product itself. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Fletcher Building Limited, Deloitte) − how the Order in Council powers will be used (Deloitte) − when imputation credits arise for an entity in tax loss (Corporate Taxpayers Group) 117 − what constitutes a “material omission” or “material change” in section 68CB(2) (Deloitte) − when it would be reasonable for the Commissioner to revoke approval to be an R&D certifier (EY) − the meaning of “cosmetic” and “stylistic” (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment Officials will clarify these points in guidance, to the extent they remain relevant. Some points are already covered in the draft guidance material which has been published. Others points will be included in the revised guidance which will be published after the Bill receives Royal assent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 118 OTHER SUBMISSIONS Issue: The R&D tax credit will make some people worse off compared to Callaghan Growth Grants Submission (PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund, ExportNZ, ManufacturingNZ, NZTech) Concerned that growth grant recipients, especially software developers, will not receive any or as much support under the R&D tax incentive because of the lack of refundability and the narrow scope of the R&D tax credit regime. (PwC, Angel Association New Zealand, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund, ExportNZ, ManufacturingNZ) Concerned that the cessation of the growth grant may disadvantage a number of New Zealand firms, particularly start-ups and SMEs. (NZTech) Comment In developing the tax credit and associated policies, such as the transition arrangements for Growth Grant recipients, the Government has wanted to minimise any disruption to R&D performers. However, in switching from one scheme to another, given the inherent differences between a tax credit and a grant, it is not possible to guarantee that all firms will get the same support as they did with the Growth Grant. Overall, the Government considers that the settings within the tax credit will mean that a greater amount of support to a larger number of R&D performers will be provided. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Eligibility for the tax credit and Callaghan project grants differ Submission (KPMG) It is relevant to the overall policy goal of supporting R&D that there is a misalignment of eligibility requirements between the R&D tax credit and the R&D Project Grant administered by Callaghan Innovation. Comment To some extent, different criteria are to be expected since the policies have different aims; some differences may be resolved when Project Grants are reviewed. Recommendation That the submission be noted, no further action required. 119 Issue: Reduce and then eliminate the Callaghan grants system Submission (Anonymous submitter) Reduce and then eliminate the current Callaghan grants system. Comment Callaghan Innovation’s Growth Grants will be phased out by 31 March 2021. All of Callaghan Innovation’s other services and products, including R&D Project Grants and R&D Student Grants are not affected by this measure. Recommendation That the submission be noted, no further action required. Issue: Deductibility of feasibility expenditure Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Feasibility expenditure should be deductible for tax purposes. The Group has long advocated for a “catch-all” provision which would allow business expenditure which is not otherwise deductible to be spread over an appropriate time period, for example, five years. Feasibility and R&D go hand-in-hand. Failure to fix this issue will result in a significant risk that the regime does not lift R&D to desired levels. Comment This submission is outside the scope of the changes proposed in this Bill. The deductibility of feasibility expenditure will be considered as part of the Government’s response to the Tax Working Group report. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Company tax rate Submission (Anonymous submitter) The company tax rate should be twenty percent for local SMEs (not mult i-nationals) and then increasing one percent per additional $1 million revenue through to $18 million (28% tax rate). 120 Comment Officials note that this submission is outside of the scope of the current changes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Future measurement of R&D – Statistics New Zealand’s R&D survey Submission (ExportNZ, ManufacturingNZ)) Statistics New Zealand’s R&D survey definition should take into account the new R&D tax credit definit ion. MBIE and StatsNZ need to determine: • The extent to which the R&D tax credit definition will influence the current definition used in the StatsNZ R&D survey; and • Given any changes to the R&D definition, how best to ensure the statistics collected for the R&D survey prior to the enactment of the Bill match what is classified as R&D from the 2019–20 tax year onwards. Comment Officials have referred these points to MBIE for their consideration. Recommendation That the submission be noted, no further action required.

NZX Milk Price Futures Contracts: an expected value approach (draft) Page 2 of 13 Determination G31 | Draft for feedback 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) When to use this determination 1. This determination provides the method that must be used by a Farmer who enters into an NZX MKP Milk Price Futures Contract (MKP Futures Contract) to calculate the income derived and the expenditure incurred over the term of that contract. 2. This determination applies to a Farmer who: a. enters into a MKP Futures Contract for the sole purpose of Hedging the price received for all or part of their anticipated milk solids production; and b. does not use IFRSs to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements under the financial arrangements rules in the Act. 3. A Farmer to whom this determination applies must use this determination for MKP Futures Contracts they enter into on or after 1 April 2020. What is an MKP Futures Contract? 4. An MKP Futures Contract is a cash-settled futures contract traded on the NZX Derivatives Market. It is a financial arrangement under the Act. 5. The underlying asset of an MKP Futures Contract is the price for 6,000 kilograms of milk solids (one Lot) as set by reference to the Farmgate Milk Price. 6. A Farmer initiating a price hedge against all or part of their reasonably anticipated milk production for a Season will sell (short) one MKP Futures Contract for every 6,000 kilograms of anticipated milk solids (kg MS) that the Farmer wishes to hedge for that Season. 7. Each MKP Futures Contract is identified by a Contract Month, as specified in the Expiry Calendar. The month is September in the year of expiration. The contract may have a term of up to 5 years during which it may be traded before expiring. The Expiry Calendar identifies the significant dates corresponding to each Contract Month. For example, the Expiry Calendar for the September 2021 Contract Month, provides as follows:  the first Trading Day was 17 September 2018  the Last Trading Day is 9 September 2021  the Expiry Date is 30 September 2021  the Settlement Day is 1 October 2021 8. A Farmer enters into an MKP Futures Contract by placing an order, through a Broker, to buy or sell a contract. The Farmer will be required to pay an Initial Margin, as collateral for their obligations under NZX Milk Price Futures Contracts: an expected value approach (draft) Page 3 of 13 Determination G31 | Draft for feedback the contract. The Initial Margin will be periodically recalculated and will typically reduce over time. The Farmer will also generally pay a fee to the Broker, which is not part of the Initial Margin. 9. Due to the movement in the daily Closing Price over the term of an MKP Futures Contract, the parties to an MKP Futures Contract may be required to pay, or may receive, Variation Margin.  The NZX clearing house, CHO, at the close of each business day during the term of an MKP Futures Contract calculates the Daily Settlement Price for the contract.  CHO uses the Daily Settlement Price to calculate the daily Variation Margin for the contract. The Variation Margin is the difference between the Daily Settlement Price of a Lot at the close of the day of calculation and the Daily Settlement Price of a Lot at the close of the business day immediately prior to the day of calculation.  Upon the calculation of the Variation Margin, CHO attributes the daily profit and loss amounts, with any profit an amount payable by CHO to a Clearing Participant and with any loss an amount payable by a Clearing Participant to CHO.  The daily profit and loss amounts for all derivatives contracts in respect of which a Clearing Participant has an open position are netted between CHO and the Clearing Participant and a nett amount is settled between CHO and the Clearing Participant.  Due to the complex of interrelated contracts relevant to an MKP Futures Contract any daily profit is an amount payable to the Farmer by their Broker and any daily loss is an amount payable by the Farmer to their Broker. 10. Farmers do not have direct access to CHO. They are required to place their trades with an NZX approved participant – a Broker. Where the Broker is a Clearing Participant the Broker clears the trades with CHO otherwise the Broker uses a Clearing Participant to clear the trades. A Broker may charge a Farmer an amount additional to the amount of Initial Margin or Variation Margin calculated by CHO. 11. The specific terms and administrative procedures that apply to and regulate MKP Futures Contracts are set out in the Contract Terms. 12. The rights and obligations relevant to an MKP Futures Contract are set out in a complex of interrelated contracts that create back-to back rights and obligations in relation to Initial Margin and Variation Margin such that a Farmer, as principal, has:  an obligation to pay Initial Margin at the commencement of an MKP Futures contract; and  an obligation to pay and the right to receive Variation Margin during the term of an MKP Futures Contract. Expected value approach 13. This determination applies an expected value approach to calculate the income derived or expenditure incurred by a Farmer under an MKP Futures Contract over the term of the contract. The income or expenditure over the term of an MKP Futures Contract is the total of the expected component and the unexpected component. 14. The expected component is calculated at the date the Farmer enters into an MKP Futures Contract and the amount is spread over the term of the contract. However, because the Trade Price will match the NZX Milk Price Futures Contracts: an expected value approach (draft) Page 4 of 13 Determination G31 | Draft for feedback Forward Rate, and the Initial Margin will be offset by a matching amount at Maturity, there will be no expected component to spread. 15. The Initial Margin and any changes in that Initial Margin are not recognised until the income year of Maturity under a base price adjustment calculation. 16. The unexpected component is updated at the end of each income year, other than the income year the base price adjustment is calculated, to reflect the profit or loss realised through payment of the Variation Margin. This change in the unexpected component, through the receipt or payment of Variation Margin since the previous income year is income or expenditure in the income year it is calculated. 17. The final unexpected component is recognised when a base price adjustment is required to be calculated on the Maturity of the MKP Futures Contract. 18. The base price adjustment is income for the Farmer if it is a positive amount and is expenditure for the Farmer if it is a negative amount. The amount is allocated to the Farmer’s income year in which the calculation is required to be made. 2 Reference This determination is made under section 90AC(1)(d) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 3 Scope 1. This determination applies to the tax treatment of an MKP Futures Contract that is entered into by a Farmer, on or after 1 April 2020, for the sole purpose of Hedging if the Farmer does not use IFRSs to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements under the financial arrangements rules in the Act. 2. Under section 90AC(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this determination is binding on a Farmer described in clause 3.1 who is subject to the financial arrangements rules in the Act and is required, under section EW 12 of the Act, to use a spreading method or is a cash basis person who has chosen, under section EW 61 of the Act, to apply a spreading method. This determination does not apply to a Farmer who is a cash basis person under section EW 13(3) of the Act unless they have elected to apply a spreading method under section EW 61 of the Act. 3. This determination applies only to a Farmer who is a person resident in New Zealand under section YD 2 or YD 3 of the Act. 4. This determination does not apply to an MKP Futures Contract that is part of a wider financial arrangement. 5. This determination applies only to an MKP Futures Contract if the period between the first Trading Day and the Last Trading Day for the contract is 5 years or less. NZX Milk Price Futures Contracts: an expected value approach (draft) Page 5 of 13 Determination G31 | Draft for feedback 6. For the avoidance of doubt, this determination does not apply to any other derivative products trading on the NZX Derivatives Market or another market. In respect of the NZX dairy derivatives market as at the date of this determination, these other derivative contracts are entitled WMP Futures, WMP Options, SMP Futures, SMP Options, AMF Futures, BTR Futures and MKP Options. 4 Principle 1. An MKP Futures Contract is a financial arrangement under section EW 3(2) of the Act. 2. This determination applies an expected value approach to calculate the income derived or expenditure incurred by a Farmer under an MKP Futures Contract. 3. Under this approach:  The gross income derived or expenditure incurred by a Farmer under an MKP Futures Contract, over the term of the contract, is the total of the expected component and the unexpected component.  The amount of the expected component: o Is determined at the date a Farmer enters into an MKP Futures Contract and spread with an amount allocated to each income year over the term of the contract except for the income year in which the Farmer is required to calculate a base price adjustment. o Will, however, be zero. The Trade Price for the contract is the same as the Forward Rate for the contract, and the Initial Margin will be offset by a matching amount over the term of the contract.  The unexpected component at the end of each income year is the total amount paid to, or received by, the Farmer as a Variation Margin for an MKP Futures Contract at the end of the last day of the current income year minus any amount paid or received in all previous income years.  The final unexpected component is the difference between the Trade Price of the MKP Futures Contract and the Final Farmgate Milk Price for the Farmgate Milk Price Season minus any Variation Margins paid or received and returned in all previous income years and is recognised by performing a base price adjustment, under section EW 31 of the Act, on the Maturity of the MKP Futures Contract or when a base price adjustment is otherwise required to be calculated under section EW 29 of the Act. If the result of the base price adjustment is: o Positive it is, under section EW 31(3) of the Act, income of the Farmer derived in the income year for which the calculation is made. o Negative it is, under section EW 31(4) of the Act, expenditure of the Farmer incurred in the income year for which the calculation is made. 5 Interpretation In this determination (and in the explanation to this determination) – Act means the Income Tax Act 2007. Broker means a CHO approved participant who has entered into a client agreement (that is, a written agreement containing provisions describing the relationship between a participant and a client) with a Farmer.

Where the Forecast Farmgate Milk Price for a Season is expressed as a range, the Forecast Farmgate Milk Price is the mid-point of the range. Fonterra means Fonterra Co-operative Group Limited. Final Settlement Amount means the amount payable or receivable (if any) on the Settlement Day to settle and discharge all obligations under an MKP Futures Contract. Forward Rate is the MKP Futures Contract Rate available to be traded on the NZX Trading System at any point in time. Hedging means a Farmer entering into an MKP Futures Contract for the sole purpose of managing the price risk in relation to the Farmer’s future supply of milk to a dairy processor. Individual Contract Specification means the terms of a class of contract notified by the NZX to the NZX Derivatives Market. Initial Margin means that amount that a party must pay to the Broker as collateral before an MKP Futures Contract can be executed and subsequent increases or decreases, if any. Last Trading Day means the last Trading Day on which an MKP Futures Contract may be Traded as specified in the Individual Contract Specification. Lot means 6,000 kilograms of milk solids (kg MS). Maturity means the Settlement Day for an MKP Futures Contract. MKP Futures Contract means a contract that: (a) is made expressly or impliedly on the Contract Terms and the applicable Individual Contract Specification; and (b) has as its underlying asset the price for one Lot as set by reference to the Farmgate Milk Price. NZX means NZX Limited. NZX Derivatives Market means the derivatives market operated by the NZX. Season means a period of 12 months ending on 31 May in each year. Settlement Day means the business day on which the settlement of all obligations in respect of an MKP Futures Contract occurs. Settlement Amount means the amount in money when an MKP Futures Contract is held to its Expiry Day or is Closed Out prior to its Expiry Day being the gross difference between the Contract Rate and the Closeout Price or the gross difference between the Contract Rate and the Final Farmgate Milk Price. Trade Price means the actual price (expressed in NZ dollars on a per Lot basis) at which an MKP Futures Contract is Traded in the Trading System. The Trade Price will be the Forward Rate prevailing at the time an MKP Futures Contract is entered into. NZX Milk Price Futures Contracts: an expected value approach (draft) Page 8 of 13 Determination G31 | Draft for feedback Traded means any resulting transaction or a linked series of transactions where an order to buy (long) or sell (short) MKP Futures Contracts is matched in the Trading System with an order to sell (short) or buy (long) MKP Futures Contracts respectively. Trading Day means a business day on which an MKP Futures Contract may be Traded on the NZX Derivatives Market. Trading System means the systems, facilities and services provided by NZX for lodging quotations and orders for trading and reporting trades of MKP Futures Contracts. Variation Margin means: (a) an amount equal to the difference between the Daily Settlement Price of a Lot at the close of the day of calculation and the Daily Settlement Price of a Lot at the close of the business day immediately prior to the day of calculation (the NZX prescribed amount); and (b) any amount charged by a Broker to a Farmer additional to the NZX prescribed amount. 6 Method 1. The gross income derived or expenditure incurred by a Farmer under an MKP Futures Contract over the term of the contract is the total of the expected component and the unexpected component. Determination of expected component 2. The amount of the expected component is determined and must be calculated as at the date in the income year a Farmer enters into an MKP Futures Contract. 3. The expected component is the difference between the Forward Rate and the Contract Rate. 4. There will be no expected component. The Trade Price and the Forward Rate are the same and the Initial Margin will be offset by a matching amount at Maturity. Spreading of expected component 5. As there is no expected component under an MKP Futures Contract there will be no amount to spread in the income years during the term of the contract. Unexpected component 6. The payment or receipt of a Variation Margin by or to the Farmer is an unexpected component. The total Variation Margin, less any amount returned in previous income years, is required to be returned as income or allowed to be deducted as expenditure at the end of each income year, or other period that the Farmer is required to file an income tax return. NZX Milk Price Futures Contracts: an expected value approach (draft) Page 9 of 13 Determination G31 | Draft for feedback 7. The final unexpected component is recognised by performing a base price adjustment, under section EW 31 of the Act, on the Maturity of the MKP Futures Contract or when a base price adjustment is otherwise required to be calculated under section EW 29 of the Act.  A positive base price adjustment is, under section EW 31(3) of the Act, income of the Farmer derived in the income year for which the calculation is made.  A negative base price adjustment is, under section EW 31(4) of the Act, expenditure of the Farmer incurred in the income year for which the calculation is made. 8. Where an MKP Futures Contract is held to the Expiry Day and settled on its Settlement Day, the unexpected component will be the difference between the Contract Rate and the Final Farmgate Milk Price, on a per Lot basis minus any Variation Margin required to be returned as an unexpected component in previous income years.  Any difference between the Contract Rate and the Final Farmgate Milk Price will be the Settlement Amount.  The unexpected component will be the Settlement Amount minus any Variation Margin required to be returned as an unexpected component in previous income years, on a per Lot basis. This will be the amount of the base price adjustment calculation. 9. Where an MKP Futures Contract is Closed Out prior to the last Trading Day for the contract, the unexpected component will be the difference between the Contract Rate and the Closeout Price minus any Variation Margin required to be returned as an unexpected component in previous income years, on a per Lot basis. This will be the amount of the base price adjustment calculation.  Any difference between the Contract Rate and the Closeout Price will be the Settlement Amount.  The unexpected component will be Settlement Amount minus any Variation Margin required to be returned as an unexpected component and will be the amount of the base price adjustment calculation. 10. The base price adjustment formula from section EW 31(5) of the Act is as follows: consideration − income + expenditure + amount remitted Where, for each MKP Futures Contract:  consideration includes: o the Closeout Price minus the Contract Rate multiplied by 6,000 kg MS; and o the total of all Initial Margin paid or received  income includes Variation Margin returned as an unexpected component in previous years  expenditure includes Variation Margin deducted as an expected component in previous years 7 Examples In the following examples:  a short contract refers to a futures contract under which the Settlement Amount received increases when the Final Farmgate Milk Price decreases, and decreases when the Final Farmgate Milk Price increases; and NZX Milk Price Futures Contracts: an expected value approach (draft) Page 10 of 13 Determination G31 | Draft for feedback  a long contract refers to a futures contract under which the Settlement Amount received increases when the Final Farmgate Milk Price increases, and decreases when the Final Farmgate Milk Price decreases. A farmer wanting to hedge the milk price risk of their anticipated production would enter into a short contract. Example A: Entering into an MKP futures contract for hedging On 1 June 2020, a farmer enters into 10 MKP Futures Contracts (that is, contracts hedging the prices of 10 Lots), each with a Contract Month of September 2021. As the farmer wants to hedge the milk price risk of their anticipated production, they enter into short contracts at a Contract Rate of $7.00 (that is, contracts for 60,000 kilograms of milk solids (kg MS) at $7.00 per kilogram). On the date on which the contracts are entered into, the Forecast Farmgate Milk Price for the 2021 Farmgate Milk Price Season is $6.75 per kg MS. The farmer must calculate the expected component for each contract at the date on which the contract is entered into. There is no difference between the prices because the Contract Rate (which is also known as the Trade Price) of $7.00 per kg MS is the same as the Forward Price of the contracts. The expected component is therefore zero and there is nothing to spread over the term of the contract. At the end of the farmer’s 2020−21 income year, September 2021 MKP Futures Contracts have a Forward Rate of $7.45 and the farmer has paid a total Variation Margin of $2,700 per MKP Futures Contract. The farmer’s unexpected component is calculated as follows:  Variation Margin per contract = ($7.00 × 6,000) – ($7.45 × 6,000) = ($2,700)  Total unexpected component = -$2,700 × 10 = ($27,000) The farmer is allowed a deduction for income tax purposes of $27,000 in their 2020−21 income year. Example B: Settlement price lower than final farmgate milk price The same farmer in Example A holds the 10 short contracts until they mature in September 2021. The Final Farmgate Milk Price announced by Fonterra for the Farmgate Milk Price Season ending 31 May 2021 (falling in the 2021−22 income year) is $7.50 per kg MS. The farmer has incurred a total loss of $0.50 for each kilogram of milk solids for which the price is hedged under the 10 contracts. The total loss under the 10 contracts is $30,000:  Total gain/(loss) = (($7.00 - $7.50) × (10 × 6,000)) = ($30,000)  The financial loss incurred under the 10 contracts is offset by the $7.50 per kg MS paid to the farmer for the actual amount of milk solids supplied that is hedged by the 10 contracts.  The net effect of the contracts is that the farmer derives total revenue of $420,000 in relation to 60,000 kg MS supplied. The farmer can be confident, that on 1 June 2020 when the contracts were NZX Milk Price Futures Contracts: an expected value approach (draft) Page 11 of 13 Determination G31 | Draft for feedback entered into the farming operation will earn exactly 1 $420,000 in relation to 60,000 kilograms of the farm’s milk production. The farmer must calculate a base price adjustment for each contract because the contracts have matured and have been settled. The base price adjustment corresponds to the final unexpected component minus the unexpected component already required to be returned for each contract.  Unexpected component per contract = (($7.00 × 6,000) – ($7.50 × 6,000)) – (-$2,700) = ($300)  Total unexpected components = (-$300 × 10) = ($3,000) o ($27,000) of unexpected components relating to the Variation Margins on the 10 contracts were paid and returned in the 2020−2021 income year  Base price adjustment = consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted o BPA = -$30,000 – 0 + $27,000 + 0 = ($3,000)  As the base price adjustment for the 10 contracts is negative, this amount is expenditure and is allowed as a deduction allocated to the farmer’s 2021−22 tax year. The farmer’s $30,000 loss on the 10 contracts is offset by the additional $30,000 of income that the farmer receives for supplying 60,000 of kg MS at the Final Farmgate Milk Price of $7.50 per kg MS. Example C: Multi-year contracts On 1 June 2020, a farmer enters into 10 MKP Futures Contracts (that is, contracts hedging the prices of 10 Lots), each with a Contract Month of September 2022. As the farmer wants to hedge the milk price risk of their anticipated production, they enter into short contracts at a Contract Rate of $7.00 (that is, contracts for 60,000 kilograms of milk solids (kg MS) at $7.00 per kilogram). On the date on which the contract is entered into, the Forecast Farmgate Milk Price for the 2022 Farmgate Milk Price Season is $6.75 per kg MS. The farmer must calculate the expected component for each contract at the date on which the contract is entered into. There is no difference between the prices because the Contract Rate (which is also known as the Trade Price) of $7.00 per kg MS is the same as the Forward Price of the contracts. The expected component is therefore zero and there is nothing to spread over the term of the contract. At the end of the farmer’s 2020−21 income year September 2022 MKP Futures Contracts have a Forward Rate of $7.45 and the farmer has paid a total Variation Margin of $2,700 per MKP Futures Contract. The farmer’s unexpected component for the year is calculated as follows:  Variation Margin per contract = ($7.00 × 6,000) – ($7.45 × 6,000) = ($2,700)  Total unexpected component = -$2,700 × 10 = ($27,000) The farmer is allowed a deduction for income tax purposes of $27,000 in their 2020−21 income year. 1 The average farmer in this situation supplying to Fonterra would earn exactly this amount but any individual farmer may earn slightly more or less depending on other factors such as when in the season the milk was supplied or whether they were supplying to another milk producer. For simplicity the examples ignore these factors. NZX Milk Price Futures Contracts: an expected value approach (draft) Page 12 of 13 Determination G31 | Draft for feedback At the end of the farmer’s 2021−22 income year, September 2022 MKP Futures Contracts have a Forward Rate of $7.30 and the farmer has paid a total net Variation Margin of $1,800 per MKP Futures Contract over the two income years (including the $2,700 paid in the 2020−21 income year). The farmer’s unexpected component is calculated as follows:  Variation Margin per contract = ($7.00 × 6,000) – ($7.30 × 6,000) = ($1,800)  Total net unexpected component = -$1,800 × 10 = ($18,000) o Total unexpected component (Variation Margins) paid and returned in the 2020−2021 income year was ($27,000)  2021−22 tax effect of unexpected component = -$18,000 – (-$ 27,000) = $9,000 The farmer is required to return $9,000 of income in their 2021−22 income year. Example D: Held to maturity The farmer holds the 10 short contracts until they mature in September 2022. The Final Farmgate Milk Price announced by Fonterra for the Farmgate Milk Price Season ending 31 May 2022 (falling in the 2022−23 income year) is $7.35 per kg MS. The farmer has incurred a loss of $0.35 for each kilogram of milk solids for which the price is hedged under the 10 contracts. The total loss under the 10 contracts is $21,000:  Total gain/(loss) = (($7.00 - $7.35) × (10 × 6,000)) = ($21,000)  The financial loss incurred under the 10 contracts is offset by the $7.35 per kg MS paid to the farmer for the actual amount of milk solids supplied that is hedged by the 10 contracts.  The net effect of the contracts is that the farmer derives total revenue of $420,000 in relation to 60,000 kg MS supplied. The farmer could be confident, that on 1 June 2020 when the contracts were entered into, that the farming operation will earn exactly $420,000 in relation to 60,000 kilograms of the farm’s milk production. The farmer must calculate a base price adjustment for each contract because the contracts have matured and have been settled. The base price adjustment corresponds to the final unexpected component minus the unexpected component already required to have been returned for each contract in the previous two income years.  Unexpected component per contract = (($7.00 × 6,000) – ($7.35 × 6,000)) - -$2,700 - $900 = ($300)  Total unexpected components = (-$300 × 10) = ($3,000)  Base price adjustment = consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted o BPA = -$21,000 – $9,000 + $27,000 + 0 = ($3,000)  As the base price adjustment is negative, this amount is expenditure and is allowed as a deduction allocated to the farmer’s 2022−23 tax year. The farmer’s $21,000 total loss on the 10 contracts is offset by the additional $21,000 of income that the farmer receives for supplying 60,000 of kg MS at the Final Farmgate Milk Price of $7.35 per kg MS. NZX Milk Price Futures Contracts: an expected value approach (draft) Page 13 of 13 Determination G31 | Draft for feedback Example E: Partial closeout On 1 October 2020 a farmer enters into 35 MKP Futures Contracts, each with a Contract Month of September 2021, at a Contract Rate of $7.25 per kg MS. On 5 January 2021, the farmer reduces the hedged position by 10 contracts because they expect that production will be lower than initially expected when the hedge contracts were made. The 10 contracts are Closed Out at a price of $7.20 resulting in a gain of $0.05 per kg MS hedged under the contracts.  The total gain from the 10 contracts Closed Out on 5 January 2021 is $3,000 o Total gain/(loss) = (($7.25 - $7.20) × (10 × 6,000)) = $3,000 The farmer must calculate a base price adjustment for each of the 10 contracts that have been Closed Out and settled early. The base price adjustment will correspond to the final unexpected component minus the unexpected component already required to be returned (which in this case is zero) for each contract.  Unexpected component = (($7.25 × 6,000) – ($7.20 × 6,000)) - $0 = $300 per contract  Total unexpected components = ($300 × 10) = $3,000  Base price adjustment = consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted o BPA = $3,000 – 0 + 0 + 0 = $3,000  As the base price adjustment is positive, this amount is financial arrangement income allocated to the farmer’s 2020−21 tax year. The farmer will calculate the expected component for their remaining 25 MKP Futures Contracts at the end of their 2020−21 year and the unexpected component and base price adjustment for their 2021−22 year. Example F: Long term hedge On 15 July 2021, a farmer enters into 20 short MKP Futures Contracts, each with a Contract Month of September 2024, at a Contract Rate of $8.00 per Lot (that is, 6,000 kg MS at $8.00 per kilogram). On the date on which the contracts are entered into, there is no Forecast Farmgate Milk Price for the 2024 production season. Fonterra had published a Forecast Farmgate Milk Price of $7.75 per kg MS for the 2022−23 season only. The expected component for each contract is zero because the Trade Price of $8.00 per kg MS is the same as the Forward Price. The farmer is required to calculate the unexpected component for each of the 2021−22 to 2023−24 years using the same method as example C. The final unexpected component will not be known until the contracts mature in 2024 or are Closed Out early when a base price adjustment must be performed.
1 Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue December 2019 Proposed changes to the income tax treatment of leases where IFRS 16 applies The Government has agreed to proposed changes that would allow taxpayers who apply the New Zealand Equivalent to International Financial Reporting Standard 16 Leases (NZ IFRS 16 or IFRS 16) to more closely follow their accounting treatment of leases for tax purposes. The proposed changes will be included in a tax bill in early 2020, and would apply for income years starting on or after 1 January 2019. Background The Government has agreed to proposed changes that would allow qualifying taxpayers to more closely follow their accounting treatment of leases for tax purposes, if they choose to do so. The proposed tax changes result from the replacement of the previous accounting standard for leases, New Zealand Equivalent to International Accounting Standard 17 Leases (NZ IAS 17), with New Zealand Equivalent to International Financial Reporting Standard 16 Leases (NZ IFRS 16 or IFRS 16). IFRS 16 applies to income years starting on or after 1 January 2019. The proposed rules will be included in a tax bill planned for introduction in early 2020. They would apply to taxpayers with IFRS reporting obligations for income years starting on or after 1 January 2019, to align with the commencement of IFRS 16. Summary of the proposed changes No changes for non-IFRS taxpayers No changes are proposed to the tax treatment of leases for taxpayers that do not have IFRS reporting obligations. Updates to the tax definition of finance leases and operating leases The definition of finance lease in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 refers to NZ IAS 17. The proposed changes would update the definit ion to refer to IFRS 16. No changes are proposed to the existing boundary between finance leases and operating leases for tax purposes. 2 Finance leases and the yield to maturity method Section EW 15I allows a person who has a tax finance lease that is classified as an operating lease under NZ IAS 17 to apply the yield to maturity method. IFRS 16 removes the accounting distinction between operating and finance leases for lessees. However, the yield to maturity method will continue to be available for these leases. Lessors under tax operating leases for IFRS taxpayers No changes are proposed to the tax treatment of lessors. Lessees under tax operating leases for IFRS taxpayers The proposed changes are optional. IFRS taxpayers who choose not to align with IFRS 16 for tax purposes can continue to follow their existing treatment. Optional election A taxpayer that applies IFRS 16 can make a one-off choice to more closely align their accounting and tax treatment of operating leases for tax purposes. It is proposed that the election would be made by calculating deductions using the proposed rules in the income tax return for the year the choice is made. No separate election would be required. Once a taxpayer makes this choice they will have to continue to follow this method in all future years where they follow IFRS 16 for accounting purposes. Leases within the scope of the proposed rules A taxpayer choosing to align with IFRS 16 for tax purposes would be required to follow the proposed rules for all tax operating leases where they are the lessee. This would apply to all existing leases at the time the choice is made, as well as all operating leases entered into after this. However, it is proposed that a taxpayer would continue to follow their existing treatment for the following tax operating leases: • a lease of real property; • a lease from an associated party; and • a lease where the asset is subleased. Real property The Income Tax Act 2007 already treats all leases of real property as an operating lease. The proposed rules carve out real property, using the existing boundary, so that a lease of real property will continue to follow the existing treatment even when a taxpayer has chosen to align with IFRS 16 for tax purposes for other leases. Associated parties The different treatment between lessors and lessees under IFRS 16 means that if a taxpayer could choose to align with IFRS 16 for tax purposes for an asset they leased to an associated party, it would result in a tax timing advantage compared to retaining it in the first taxpayer. To prevent this scenario the proposed rules continue to use the existing tax treatment for all operating leases from an associated party. 3 Two unassociated parties might enter into an operating lease under the proposed rules and then subsequently become associated, for example because of a change in shareholding. It is proposed that the tax treatment of that lease would revert to the existing treatment including an adjustment, as described in the ceasing to be a lessee to a qualifying lease section. Subleases Under IFRS 16, when an asset is subleased to a second person the asset in the first person’s balance sheet changes from a right-of-use asset to a lease receivable where the sublease of the lessor is a finance lease for accounting. If the tax treatment followed the accounting treatment, a taxpayer would not be entitled to deductions for the amortisation of the right-of-use asset. To resolve this situation the proposed rules continue to use the existing tax treatment for all operating leases when the asset is subleased to another person. If an asset is subleased to another person part way through a lease term, then the tax treatment of that lease would have to revert to the existing treatment and include an adjustment, as described in the ceasing to be a lessee to a qualifying lease section. Officials expect that the exclusion of real property leases from the new rules will significantly reduce this situation occurring. Transitional adjustment A taxpayer that chooses to align with IFRS 16 for tax purposes must calculate the difference between its current tax treatment and the IFRS 16 treatment for all previous periods for all outstanding leases. Officials expect taxpayers will typically calculate this adjustment in the year they first follow IFRS 16 for accounting purposes. However, it could be a subsequent year if the taxpayer chooses to do so. The transitional adjustment may be deductible expenditure or assessable income. In either case this should be spread equally over the year the choice to align with IFRS 16 for tax purposes is made and the four subsequent years. A taxpayer choosing to align with IFRS 16 for tax purposes will calculate a single transitional adjustment to be spread over five years – this would include leases that will mature before the end of that five year period. Leases that do not follow IFRS 16 A taxpayer that follows IFRS 16 for accounting may have individual leases that are not accounted for by following IFRS 16. Examples of this include certain low-value or short-term leases. It is proposed that if these leases would qualify under the new rules (that is, they are a tax operating lease that is not providing real property, with an associated party or a sublease) this non-IFRS 16 treatment will also be acceptable for tax purposes. Officials expect the accounting treatment for these specific leases will be similar to the existing tax treatment. Adjustments The proposed rules are not intended to significantly accelerate tax deductions compared to those available under the existing rules. It is proposed that tax adjustments set out in Table 1 may be required where a taxpayer has chosen to align with IFRS 16 for tax purposes and there are amounts that are spread. 4 Table 1: Results of spreading and the proposed tax adjustments that may be required If the spreading results in accounting deductions that are... ...then it is proposed that a tax adjustment is made. in advance of when the expenditure is incurred (for example, impairment, fair value or revaluation amounts or make good costs) • to ensure that tax deductions are only available in a similar period to when the expenditure is incurred. later than when the expenditure is incurred (for example, certain direct or mobilisation costs) • to ensure tax deductions are available in a similar period to when the expenditure is incurred, and • it would be optional, so that a taxpayer who would incur higher compliance costs in making the adjustment than the perceived value of that adjustment will not be required to do so. Officials are still finalising the exact details of how these adjustments would be calculated. Further details will be available in the bill containing the proposals when it is introduced, and the associated bill commentary. Officials expect the exclusion of real property from the proposed rules will significantly reduce the number of tax adjustments required. Ceasing to be a lessee to a qualifying lease When a taxpayer ceases to be a lessee to a qualifying lease, it is proposed that they calculate an adjustment to ensure total deductions match what would have been available under the existing tax treatment. This adjustment would be similar conceptually to a base price adjustment under the financial arrangement rules. The adjust ment would be required when: • the lease matures; • the lease ceases to qualify because the lessee and lessor have become associated; • the asset has been subleased to another person; or • the lessee ceases to follow IFRS 16 for accounting. Officials expect the result of this adjust ment to typically be zero when a lease runs for its full term. Application date It is proposed that the rules would apply to income years starting on or after 1 January 2019, to align with the application date of IFRS 16. It is possible for taxpayers to elect to apply IFRS 16 for earlier years, and officials are aware that a small group of taxpayers have done so. Taxpayers who have elected to apply IFRS 16 in earlier years would t ypically be expected to file their tax returns on or before 31 March 2020. It is not possible for the bill containing these proposals to be enacted before this date. Officials consider it would be desirable for the new rules to also be available in the year of adoption for taxpayers who elect to adopt IFRS 16 early. We will work with affected taxpayers to determine the best way to resolve this.
