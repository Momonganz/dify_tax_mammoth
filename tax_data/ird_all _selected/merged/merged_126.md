The information in this document was current at the time of publication. Please refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. Business Ngā Ūmanga March 2022 This fact sheet explains the help your business can get from the Government during the COVID-19 Omicron outbreak. Help for your business during the COVID-19 Omicron outbreak Money to keep your business running The Government has announced 3 fortnightly COVID-19 Support Payments. The amount of each payment is $4,000, plus $400 for each employee (up to 50 employees). You'll need to apply for each payment. The first payment opened for applications on 28 February. To get this payment you'll need to show your revenue is 40% lower in a 7-day period any time between 16 February 2022 and 4 April 2022, compared to a typical week between 5 January and 15 February in either 2021 or 2022. The second payment opened for applications on 14 March. To get this payment you'll need to show your revenue is 40% lower in a 7-day period any time between 7 March 2022 and 4 April 2022, compared to a typical week between 5 January and 15 February in either 2021 or 2022. The third payment opens for applications on 28 March. To get this payment you'll need to show your revenue is 40% lower in a 7-day period any time between 21 March 2022 and 4 April 2022, compared to a typical week between 5 January and 15 February in either 2021 or 2022. More information is available on the Inland Revenue website at ird.govt.nz/csp Removing penalties and interest on late tax payments If you paid your tax late because you were affected by COVID-19, Inland Revenue may be able to remove (remit) the penalties and interest that were charged. This is often done automatically. Send Inland Revenue a message in your myIR account at ird.govt.nz if you have a question about this. Low or no-interest loan If your income was 30% lower recently than it was the year before, you might be able to get a loan from the Government's Small Business Cashflow Scheme (SBCS). This could be up to $20,000, plus $1,800 for each full- time employee, up to a maximum of $110,000. You'll be able to choose to borrow the whole amount at once, or in up to 4 separate withdrawals taken out before the end of 2023. You have 5 years to pay it off. The first 2 years of new and existing loans will be interest-free, as long as you keep to the terms of the loan. After that, the interest rate is 3%. You can find more details at ird.govt.nz/sbcs and apply for an SBCS loan in your myIR account at ird.govt.nz Changes to existing loans If you already have a loan, you might be able to borrow some more. If you have kept to the terms of the existing loan, you can apply for a top-up loan of an additional $10,000. Plus, if you did not borrow the full amount you were able to in your existing loan, you'll be able to add this amount to your top-up loan. The top-up loan will have a new 5-year repayment period, with the first 2 years being interest-free. You can borrow the whole amount at once, or in 4 separate withdrawals taken out before the end of 2023. You can find more details at ird.govt.nz The information in this document was current at the time of publication. Please refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. More time to pay your tax If you are not able to pay your tax on time because of COVID-19, you can pay it off over time. This is called an instalment arrangement, and you can set it up in your myIR account at ird.govt.nz or by calling Inland Revenue on 0800 227 774. If you tick the box saying you have been significantly affected by COVID, Inland Revenue will remove any penalties and interest from your recent tax bills. The tax must be paid by 7 April 2024 to reduce interest and penalties. If you need more help than this, get in touch with Inland Revenue. They may be able to agree to a longer payment plan, or in some cases write off some of the tax. Money to pay employees who have to stay home and cannot work If your employees have to stay home and cannot work because they are waiting on test results for COVID or have to self-isolate, you can get a payment to help you keep paying them. These are called the Short-Term Absence Payment and the Leave Support Scheme. Find out more at workandincome.govt.nz
1 BUSINESS TAX U PDAT E Inland Revenue's tax news for businesses BUSINESS TAX U PDAT E We have several planning calendars to help you meet your obligations. Remember that if a due date falls on a weekend or public holiday, we can receive your return and payment on the next working day without a penalty being applied. But for provincial anniversary dates, this only applies if you’re in the province celebrating the holiday, and only if you usually make tax payments over-the-counter at Westpac. If you have any suggestions for topics you'd like covered in this newsletter, Email BusinessTax.Update@ird.govt.nz COVI-19 Update Inland Revenue will write-off any penalties and interest for businesses unable to pay taxes on time due to the impact of COVID-19. Don’t worry about contacting us right now. Get in touch with us when you can. We’re working hard to provide essential services for business and individual customers during this stressful and difficult time. Payments, including Working for Families customers, will still be made. To help get correct payments to people we would like employers to still file their returns as normal. This helps us work out the right amounts for people and helps the Government continue to respond to what is happening in the economy. Contacting IR During the lockdown our phone services will be severely limited and the most effective way to contact us, will be online and through myIR. Within Inland Revenue, all front office services are now closed and almost of our staff are working from home. Inland Revenue is still working on all critical matters related to tax entitlements and payment obligations. We know these are matters causing real stress and uncertainty and we are working urgently to provide as much certainty as quickly as we can. Please use our online services to contact us – preferably through your myIR account. Wage subsidies The Ministry of Social Development (MSD) is the government organisation responsible for the administration of the wage subsidy. Any questions relating to how and when it is administered should be referred to MSD. There is more detail at Work and Income. Inland Revenue has some tax-related guidance for employers about the wage subsidies. It is important employers pass on the wage subsidies to workers and process them as part of the employee's normal wages. All deductions (such as PAYE, KiwiSaver and child support) should be made as normal. If the total wage (the subsidy plus the employer funded pay) amounts to the same wages as previously, the pay and deductions on their payslip should be the same. Employers won’t be liable for income tax or GST on the subsidy received from MSD and will not be entitled to an income tax deduction for wages paid out of the wage subsidy. Payment options As we’ve already said, if a business is unable to pay its taxes on time due to the impact of COVID19, we will understand. Get in touch with us when you can and we’ll write-off any penalties and interest. (continued on next page) Issue No 108 • April 2020 • IR381 BUSINESS TAX UPDATE • Issue No 108 • April 2020 2 But if a business can pay there are several options - with internet banking or using myIR are the easiest. Businesses can also make credit card or debit card payments over the phone or set up direct debit payments through their myIR account. For further details on alternative ways to pay Only some Westpac branches will be open one day a week, on a Wednesday, during the COVID-19 lockdown. Customers who can pay their tax bill at their local Westpac branch will be unable to do so until they can visit a branch on it’s open day. Instalment arrangements We’re enabling more flexibility and lowering the threshold for instalment arrangements set up in myIR. The new minimum repayment rates are: - Weekly $20 (previously $50). - Fortnightly $40 (previously $100) - Monthly $80 (previously $200). Compliance activity At Inland Revenue, we recognise this is a concerning time for tax agents and customers and we want to support you wherever we can through any current audits or disputes. We know you’re under a lot of pressure and uncertainty currently, and we want to work with you on a case by case basis. This may be by delaying the progress of an audit or dispute for a period. Extension of time Inland Revenue has decided to extend the timeframe for filing Basic Compliance Packages (BCPs). The new due date is 30 June 2020. Please forward any questions about this to bcp@ird.govt.nz Information sharing In these extraordinary circumstances, Inland Revenue is now required to operate very differently. IR holds a lot of information that may enable other government agencies to reach those who need assistance the most and the Government has recently passed legislation allowing us to share certain information. We are putting in place safeguards to ensure any information we share is kept safe. We will share only enough information so other agencies can provide the relevant relief and assistance. Any information received by the other agency will not be able to be used for other initiatives outside of COVID-19. Thank you We’re working hard to provide businesses and tax agents with as much certainty as we can, as quickly as we can. Thank you for your patience in what is a difficult time for all New Zealanders.

We're switching off the old KiwiSaver website Over the last year and a half, we’ve been working to improve our website, by rebuilding it on a modern and enduring platform so we can give our customers a great online experience. With most content now on our new site, we’re nearing the end of this journey. To complete this process, we’re working to switch off the heritage website and subsites in the coming months. On 1 April, we switched off KiwiSaver.govt.nz Last September we started testing re-written KiwiSaver content on our main site. After reviewing testing and customer feedback we’re confident this new content meets the needs of our customers. To ensure you will still get to the new KiwiSaver material when you click on an old URL, we're providing temporary redirects for several months. Set up new links now We suggest you visit and set up new links and favourites to pages you may refer to or visit often. Remember, the links you have set up to content on the old subsite won’t work, or will only temporarily redirect you to the new content. You can find the new KiwiSaver site at www.ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver

If you have not traded for more than 12 months, you need to let us know by completing a Non-active company declaration - IR433. You can do this in your myIR account: go to I want to...More. However if you traded at any time in the last year – even for just part of it, you still need to file an IR4. Visit ird.govt.nz/IR4 for more information. Remember, file your Companies tax return today. Issue No 116 • December 2020 • IR381 Business Tax Update comments generally on topical tax issues relevant to businesses.

With a little bit of planning and preparation, you can avoid serious problems later. Employment New Zealand has simple answers to common questions that businesses have. Can I close down my business over the holiday period and require staff to take annual leave? You can have an "annual closedown" for your whole business or part of it, but you must comply with the legal rules that include: • Employees must be given at least 14 days' notice in writing. • Employees can be required to use their existing annual leave (annual holidays) to cover the closedown period. If they don't have sufficient leave, they can take leave without pay or you both can agree to them taking annual leave in advance. I need my employee to work during the Christmas and New Year holidays. What do I need to do? You can only make your employees work on a public holiday if two conditions are met: • the public holiday falls on a day the employee would otherwise have worked and • the requirement to work on the public holiday is noted in their employment agreement. Unless these conditions are met, your employee does not have to agree to work during a public holiday. How much do I need to pay them, if they work on a public holiday? When the public holiday falls on the day an employee would normally work, they are entitled to be paid time and a half for all the hours actually worked, plus a paid day off at another time. If the holiday does not fall on a day they normally work, they are entitled to just pay of time and a half. Do I have to allow my employees to cash-up their annual holidays? Employees can request to cash-up up to one week of their minimum four weeks' annual holidays in any entitlement year, provided you agree. To decline their request you have to do this in writing, but you don't have to give a reason. My business is really busy, can I cancel my employee's approved annual leave? You cannot cancel your employee's approved annual leave, unless they agree to it. They may have already paid for all or part of the holiday or organised the holiday with the rest of their family. If you would like your employee to cancel their leave, you should approach them in good faith and make sure that there are no consequences if the employee declines to cancel their leave.

BUSINESS TAX UPDATE • Issue No 106 • February 2020 2 Income equalisation schemes From April we will manage income equalisation schemes in our new system. This will mean: • You can tell us about deposits, and request withdrawals for income equalisation in myIR – the paper form (the IR155) will be discontinued. • You can make deposits electronically in myIR or via internet banking. • You can see scheme balances and other transactions, such as interest, at any time in myIR under the new accounts (Income Equalisation). • All withdrawals will be paid out by direct credit. • You can see scheme balances and other transactions, such as interest, at any time in myIR under the new accounts (Income Equalisation). • Deposits and withdrawals will be shown in your income summary and prepopulated into the “other income” field on your income tax returns in myIR. Once the income equalisation schemes move into our new system you will no longer need to use cheques for deposits or withdrawals. Deposits can be made using an alternative payment method and you can supply your bank account details for withdrawals. For more information about alternative payment methods visit: ird.govt.nz/payments New tax technical website coming We’re building a new tax technical website to help people find tax technical answers more quickly. The new site will be available on the main Inland Revenue site but will operate separately to it. We’re improving the site in stages throughout 2020. The first release is planned to be available in the next few months and will make it easier to browse and search our tax technical publications, public consultations, and the Tax Information Bulletin (TIB). Over the year we will add more features including: • the ability to browse for keywords eg motor vehicles, depreciation rates • filters to narrow your results • better linking between publications and other websites • better interlinking of TIB issues and their individual publications. The development of this website follows on from our work to modernise the Inland Revenue website over the past year. Prescribed interest rate decreases The prescribed rate used to calculate fringe benefit tax on low-interest, employment-related loans has decreased from 5.77% to 5.26% effective 1 October 2019. Our website has been updated. Employer-provided travel from home to a distant workplace New operational statement OS 19/05 clarifies and simplifies the tax rules around employer-provided travel to distant workplaces. For example, a person who works in Wellington but lives in Auckland, or who travels greater distances in working from home or at multiple workplaces. It sets out our approach to determining whether or not employer-provided travel to a distant workplace is exempt from income tax (PAYE) or fringe benefit tax (FBT). We recognise that some taxpayers may need time to implement the approach set out in OS 19/05. We do not expect taxpayers to apply the statement to travel taken before 1 April 2020. However, taxpayers can apply the statement from the date it is issued if they wish to. You can find the statement at www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword OS 19/05).

1 BUSINESS TAX U PDAT E Inland Revenue's tax news for businesses BUSINESS TAX U PDAT E We have several planning calendars to help you meet your obligations. Remember that if a due date falls on a weekend or public holiday, we can receive your return and payment on the next working day without a penalty being applied. But for provincial anniversary dates, this only applies if you’re in the province celebrating the holiday, and only if you usually make tax payments over-the-counter at Westpac. If you have any suggestions for topics you'd like covered in this newsletter, Email BusinessTax.Update@ird.govt.nz Small business cash flow scheme (SBCS) loan Applications are now open for the Small Business Cashflow (Loan) Scheme (SBCS) - a one-off loan to small to medium businesses impacted by COVID-19. The SBCS is for businesses with 50 or fewer full-time equivalent employees, including sole traders and those that are self-employed. In most cases, eligible businesses will be entitled to a loan amount of $10,000 plus $1,800 per full-time-equivalent employee, to a maximum of $100,000. The eligibility criteria is the same as for the Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS) and you can apply even if you haven’t applied for the WSS. Please note you’ll have to declare you’re a viable business, use the money for core business operating costs and enter into a legally binding loan contract. We recommend you talk to your financial advisor before applying. The only way to apply is in myIR under ‘I want to’ and applications are open till 12 June 2020. Funds will be paid directly into your bank account within five working days once approved. You must be legally allowed to borrow money for your entity to be able to apply for the SBCS loan. Please note your tax agent can not apply on your behalf. For more details on how the scheme will work, eligibility criteria and a calculator to determine the loan amount that can be borrowed, go to ird.govt.nz/Covid19 Temporary loss carry-back Businesses expecting to make a loss in either the 2019-20 income year or the 2020-21 income year can use that loss to offset profits they made the year before. In other words, they can carry the loss back one year to the preceding income year. This can be done before the loss year return is filed. There are two ways to claim your loss carry-back. • Include the carried-back loss in your tax return – we will automatically refund any overpaid tax. • Ask for a refund of any provisional tax you have paid for 2019-20 if you are going to carry back a loss from 2020-21. We can refund some or all of the tax already paid for the preceding year before the loss year has finished by enabling customers to estimate their loss. If you choose to use the loss carry-back scheme you must first elect to participate in the scheme under the ‘I want to’ section of myIR. Refunds will be processed quicker for claims made through myIR. Note: You do not need to have filed the loss year return to claim the loss carry-back.

Depreciation deductions have been reinstated for non–residential buildings from the 2020-21 income year. The threshold for claiming a deduction for the full cost of a low-value business asset in the year it was purchased increases from $500 to $5,000 for assets purchased in the period 17 March 2020 to 16 March 2021. For any assets purchased from 17 March 2021 the threshold reduces from $5,000 to $1,000. Depreciation is still available for business assets over those values. The residual income tax threshold at which provisional tax becomes payable increases from $2,500 to $5,000 for the 2020-21 and later income years. The application date for the broader refundability rules for R&D tax credits is brought forward. For a detailed explanation a special report on Covid-19 tax legislation is available at taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/ publications Website changes complete and Tax Technical site live Our work to redevelop the Inland Revenue website is complete, with all content now housed on our new site. This includes the first release of our new and improved Tax Technical website (taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz), which is the place to go to view all rulings, determinations, interpretation statements and more. Over the past few months we’ve been beta-testing the site. Customer feedback received during this time helped us further improve this website before the official release.

You can no longer use excess deductions from your property to offset other income such as salary and wages. The new residential property deduction rules (also known as the ring-fencing rules) apply to most residential rental properties. The rules do not apply to some residential properties such as your main home and residential properties that are subject to the mixed-use asset rules. Completing your income tax return The new rules mean that when you complete your 2019-20 income tax return, your total residential rental property deductions generally cannot be more than your residential property income. If you have excess deductions (rental losses), this amount must be carried forward to the next year that you earn income from your residential property. If you own more than one residential rental property and use the portfolio basis for them, you can offset deductions for all properties in the portfolio against income from all properties in the portfolio. Filing a return in myIR In the "Build your return" section of your income tax return, make sure both “Residential rental income” and "Other Rental Income" are selected. You need to manually select "Residential rental income". Unless you have commercial rental income - leave the "Other Rental Income" box blank. Filing a paper return Complete the “Residential property” section in a paper return. We encourage you to use the Residential property deductions - IR1226 worksheets to help you work out the amounts to put on your income tax return and where to enter them on the return. We also encourage you to use the Rental income - IR264 guide and the relevant income tax return guide. You can find these on our website. For more information about the changes to residential property deduction rules go to ird.govt.nz/ring-fencing Important Message for Research and Development Tax Incentive (RDTI) applicants Before applying for your General Approval, RDTI applicants need to be familiar with the RDTI requirements.

You will be able to provide comments while on the site using the feedback button on each beta page. Feedback we receive during this time will help us to improve the site before the first release. RWT exemption register We have introduced a new online RWT exemption register listing the IRD numbers of all customers who are exempt from having RWT deducted from the interest and dividends they receive. Currently we issue successful applicants with a certificate of exemption from RWT. This process will remain in place until 31 March 2020. From 1 April, payers of investment income (eg payers of interest and dividends) will access the register to confirm which of their customers have RWT exempt status. They will no longer ask for or accept physical certificates of exemption. The register: • is automatically populated by Inland Revenue • identifies customers only by their IRD number • can be searched by exemption status, IRD number and when the information was last updated • is updated overnight every business day (Monday to Friday) – so it provides near real time information. Payers can use the register now to verify if a customer has an exemption, or to check the exemption status (e.g. cancelled, revoked or end-dated (expired)). If a customer has an exemption under an Act that is not administered by Inland Revenue, they may need to apply to us to be included on the register. If you are a charity registered with Charities Services you do not need to apply for RWT exempt status. We will automatically put you on the register. A factsheet has been developed to help payers understand what the changes from 1 April 2020 will mean for them. You can find out more and access the register and factsheet at www.ird.govt.nz/rwt-exemption Research and Development Tax Incentive – website The Research and Development Tax Incentive (RDTI) supports Government's target to increase New Zealand's R&D expenditure to 2% of GDP by 2027. In February a new RDTI website was introduced to help businesses understand the benefits of undertaking R&D and to encourage more businesses to invest in it. Designed for busy business decision-makers, the website features an easy-to-follow introductory guide to RDTI eligibility and a step-by-step overview of how to apply. The RDTI is jointly administered by Inland Revenue and Callaghan Innovation. Information on the new website has been developed collaboratively by both agencies with support from MBIE.

Meeting your legal requirements will also help you to build your reputation as a good business with your employees and customers. Your employment records must show: • you've correctly given your employees all their minimum employment entitlements such as the minimum wage and annual holidays, and • you have complied with the Employment Relations Act 2000 and the Holidays Act 2003. You must keep all records for at least 7 years and be able to demonstrate your compliance to Labour Inspectors. Record keeping Maintaining proper records helps to avoid non-compliance costs ranging from infringement notices to major financial penalties and serious reputation damage that could reduce the value of your business. Ensure you know the payroll details you must cover, including: • employment agreements • the kind of work an employee does • wages, and • time sheets. Also verify regularly that your payroll systems and processes (manual or computerised) record your employees' hours and pay accurately, and are current for latest employment law. More information For information covering essential records, record templates, information guides and learning modules, visit www.employment.govt.nz enter the search words "keeping accurate records". On the site you can also subscribe for employment law updates via our newsletter. If you need personalised help with information call us on 0800 20 90 20. Finally, for more support contact a professional advisor such as a lawyer, accountant or payroll provider. Avoid penalties or interest If you provide the wrong period date when paying tax it can take longer for your funds to go to the right place. This can lead to late payment penalties or interest. The period date is not the due date or the date that you are paying us, it's the end date of the taxable period that you are paying for. If paying online, your bank might ask for the 'Period ending' date, or you may need to provide it in the 'Payee Code' field. For example, GST for the taxable period ending 31 May is due to be paid by 28 June. So, your payee code information would be "GST 31052020".

Sick leave. Do you know your obligations? (on behalf of Employment New Zealand) The COVID-19 situation has highlighted the importance of your business complying with employees’ sick leave rights and knowing their legal obligations. During all alert levels employment heath and safety laws still apply Minimum rights and obligations for sick leave All employees (including part-time and casual) have the right to 5 days' sick leave if they meet one of the conditions below: • 6 months’ current continuous employment with the same employer, or • worked for the employer for 6 months for an average of 10 hours per week, and • at least one hour in every week or 40 hours in every month. (continued on next page) Issue No 115 • November 2020 • IR381 Business Tax Update comments generally on topical tax issues relevant to businesses. Every attempt is made to ensure the law is correctly interpreted, but articles are intended as a brief overview only. The examples provided are not intended to cover every possible factual situation. ird.govt.nz Email: BusinessTax.Update@ird.govt.nz BUSINESS TAX UPDATE • Issue No 115 • November 2020 2 Sick leave can be used if your employee, members of their immediate family or dependants are sick or injured. After the first 6 months, they get an extra 5 days for every year of employment. This can build up for up to 20 days. These rights are not pro-rated. For example, even if your employee work 3 days a week, they will be able to have 5 days’ sick leave after the first 6 months and so on. You can offer more than the minimum 5 days. Giving more than the minimum sick leave can help attract skilled employees, and make sure that sick employees don’t come to work and spread an illness, therefore reducing your business overall productivity. Any extra entitlement should be written in the employment agreement. Sick leave may not be cashed-up or be part of any final payment when an employee leaves, unless it is agreed as part of the employment agreement. Breaches of health and safety or employment laws can result in serious penalties from labour or health and safety inspectors. Leave for medical appointments and medical certificates You do not have to give your employees paid time-off work to visit the doctor or dentist unless their employment agreement says so. Your employees can ask to use sick leave, annual leave, unpaid leave, special leave or time in lieu. Some businesses allow 2 or 3 paid (or unpaid) hours for these situations. If your employee has been absent for 3 or more days (including weekends) you can ask for a medical certificate. If you want a certificate for less than 3 days, you can ask for one but you must pay for the doctor's visit. Sick leave payments Payment for sick leave is only made when it is for a day your employee would have worked if they were not sick. It's at the rate they would be paid on the day they were sick i.e. relevant daily pay (or their average daily pay where applicable).

(Submitted by Employment New Zealand) During COVID-19, some of your employees on parental leave may want to return to work early for financial or other reasons. Employment New Zealand has guidance on the rights and responsibilities of employers and employees in these situations. You and your employee must act in good faith to make sure an early return benefits both parties. As an employer, you must be clear whether an employee's return to work is occasional, temporary or permanent. Occasional return to work If you agree, your employee on parental leave can return to paid work on occasional days, using 'keeping in touch' days. The employee can do a maximum of 64 hours paid work during their parental leave payment period, and cannot work within the first 28 days after their child is born. Recent temporary law changes also allow some employees to return for up to 12 weeks without losing their remaining entitlement to parental leave, and its associated payments and protections. For more information visit employment.govt.nz (search keywords: "Keeping in touch days" and "parental leave and Covid"). Permanent return to work Generally, employees on parental leave can only return to work early if you agree.

They may now be eligible for Working for Families tax credit payments. ird.govt.nz/topics/working-for-families/can-i-get-working-for-families Employee or contractor? It pays to get it right at the start (article supplied by MBIE) Are you thinking of taking on more staff, and trying to decide whether you need an employee or contractor? Take care. The initial appeal of a contractor may not be right in the eyes of the law and getting this wrong can be costly to you and your business. Employment New Zealand have useful guidance to help you get it right and save you time and money. Employee vs contractor the differences Hiring workers as either employees or contractors can be lawful providing that the correct type of working arrangement is used in each situation. Employees work for you, while contractors work for themselves. Employment New Zealand have useful guidance to help you get it right and save you time and money.

Every attempt is made to ensure the law is correctly interpreted, but articles are intended as a brief overview only. The examples provided are not intended to cover every possible factual situation. ird.govt.nz Email: BusinessTax.Update@ird.govt.nz BUSINESS TAX UPDATE • Issue No 113 • September 2020 2 How to decide – the legal tests You need to know whether your worker is an employee or a contractor because your responsibilities as a business will be very different. To make the correct decision focus on the real nature of the working relationship, not what you want to call them. The courts have developed some legal tests to help you tell the difference, they are the: •Intention test (what the parties intended the relationship to be). •Control vs independence test (the greater the control exercised over the worker the more likely they are an employee). •Integration test (if the work performed by the worker is fundamental to the organisation they are more likely to be an employee). •Fundamental/economic reality test (looking at the full circumstances of the work relationship to determine its economic reality). Consequences of getting it wrong If you hire someone as a contractor when they are actually an employee, you may be liable for many costs. These potentially include unpaid PAYE, minimum wages, holidays and leave entitlements, penalties from Inland Revenue and/or penalties from the Employment Relations Authority, and being banned from bringing in workers from overseas. Also, you may get negative publicity that could harm your customer goodwill, reputation and potentially the value of your business. Employment laws Most employment laws don’t cover contractors in the same way as employees. Unlike employees, contractors: don’t get minimum employment rights like annual holidays, sick leave and the minimum wage and much more, plus they can’t bring personal grievances. However, health and safety laws apply to both employees and contractors. Go to employment.govt.nz (search key words: Health and safety at work) to find out more. For information about employment laws covering employees’ rights go to employment.govt.nz (search key words: Minimum rights of employees ). Employment New Zealand can help you get it right In many simple cases, a business can decide what is the correct status for a worker. We have simplified the main legal tests into handy questions for you. For more information go to employment.govt.nz (search keywords: Contractor versus employee). Employment New Zealand also have the employment law database so you can search cases from the Employment Relations Authority, go to employment.govt.nz (search keywords: Employment law database). For comprehensive information on your employment rights and responsibilities, visit the Employment New Zealand website: employment.govt.nz Wage subsidies and Employment Information If you’re an employer who has received the wage subsidy, get your deductions and Employment Information right from the start. Wage subsidies should be passed onto the employee by the employer and processed as part of the employee's normal wages. All deductions (such as PAYE, KiwiSaver and child support) should be made as normal. The subsidy doesn't need to be accounted for separately when filing your Employment Information each payday. Include the subsidy and any employer-funded pay as 'total wages paid' for each employee.

Any tailoring will be discussed and refined in consultation with the preferred service provider before any variations are made. Aligning to Managing Successful Programmes (MSP™) and Better Business Case guidance. •The methodology has been refined to align with MSP and the Treasury‟s Better Business Case guidance. A glossary is provided to outline differences in terminology. Further detail on programme execution in accordance with these methodologies is provided in the Programme Execution Plan, including the development of business cases throughout the lifetime of the programme. Drawing on existing IR methodologies •Where the BTM can draw on existing IR products and processes these will be used as the starting point, with amendments made where required to support transformation. •Alignment between existing Inland Revenue (IR) methodologies and the BTM will be achieved in the first instance in practical ways by aligning the tools, techniques and templates from existing methods. •The BTM will not add complexity or additional process by duplicating work done in existing methodologies. Maintaining agility •This methodology will be used principally for the Strategic Projects within the programme adopting a waterfall approach. For the Quick wins and Tactical workstream, the intent is to use an agile approach for which an appropriate method will be agreed. It is envisaged that the agile approach will use components of the System Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and Change Initiative Lifecycle (CIL). IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE BT Programme Business Transformation Methodology The diagram below outlines the Business Transformation Methodology (BTM). The methodology is consistent with requirements set by central monitoring agencies and will be applied in a way that is consistent with Managing Successful Programmes (MSP) and the Better Business Case guidance.

IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 35 Term Definition Better Business Case Better Business Case refers to a set of guidance developed by NZ Treasury and other central agencies to provide a structured and standardised approach to the development of business cases in the New Zealand public sector. CR&A Corporate Risk and Assurance Cost and Benefit Analysis Cost and Benefits Analysis involves the definition of the expected costs of the Programme over its duration. The benefits will be highlighted as expected values over a period of time. Benefits will include owners of those benefits. Current State Assessment and Definition Assessment of the current state of a number of attributes of Inland Revenue‟s current environment, including data, people, policy, process and technology. Current State Processes Also known as “as is” processes. The current state processes represent what happens, not what should happen, or could happen. They are used as the baseline for gap analysis. Detailed Design Is the elaboration of the high level design to provide a detailed understanding of the future state processes, requirements (functional, non-functional and integration) and organisational impacts of the change. The Detailed Design will include a review of the costs and benefits to provide a greater level of delivery certainty. EPMO Enterprise Portfolio Management Office FRICE F.R.I.C.E stands for Forms, Reports, Interfaces, Conversions and Enhancements. Future State Processes Also known as “to be” processes. The future state processes define how the business wants to complete a business function or activity in the future. High Level Design The activity to define the current and future state of the changes down to 3 levels of business process composition which will include the definition of the Scope of Work, the business pain points and business requirements Glossary (1/3) IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 36 Term Definition Investment Objectives The Investment Objectives articulate the desired investment outcomes of the Programme. They were used to inform an assessment of options within the Programme Business Case, which was agreed by Cabinet. Investment Objectives are supported by appropriate metrics and targets, which will be used to evaluate the success of the Programme. Levels of decomposition Level 0: Business Function (Organisational Grouping) – includes Strategy and Policy, Delivery, Service and Support. Level 1: Mega Process (Process Grouping) - defines different views of how processes are structured to deliver the business focus at Level 1. Level 2: Major Process (Core Process) - comprises of process groups that are defined in detail in the business process flows at Level 3. Level 3: Process (Business Process Flow) - contains process flows and describes the sequence or flow between sub-processes. Each process at this level must add value to the business or be an essential requirement. Level 4: Sub-Process (Operational Process Flow) - defines in more detail the business process flows defined at Level 3. It includes detailed sub-process design with links to written procedures, business rules, application functions and technology. Level 5: Activity (Detailed Process Flow) - provides further detail for the operational process flows and is specific to an individual operational role. Detail will be described in a procedure document or workflow. Managing Successful Programmes (MSP) MSP is a recognised programme management methodology developed by the Office of Government Commerce, which is part of the UK Cabinet Office. The methodology is now a recognised standard for public sector programme management internationally. Outcomes Roadmap The Outcomes Roadmap identifies key outcomes and themes for Transformation across 4 stages, over a 10- year period. The Outcomes Roadmap has been presented and finalised by IR and authorised by the Ministers (in July 2012). Glossary (2/3) IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 37 Term Definition Package Fit/Gap Analysis Involves the detailed analysis of software packages/solutions identified in the initial solution options paper developed as a part of the Detailed Design. The detailed fit/gap analysis evaluates, based on an agreed criteria, the extent to which the software package/solution options meets the business and technical requirements. Roadmap The Roadmap defines and sequences the work packages that constitute the Programme and break these down into Stages. This is equivalent to a „Project Dossier‟ in MSP. Scope Definition The work that must be performed to deliver a product, service, or result with the specified features and functions. Defines the initial high-level parameters for design and includes the definition of scope across process, organisation, country, language, time, organisational change management, technology and data. Stage The programme will be split into four stages. Each stage will consist of a number of work packages. This is equivalent to a „Tranche‟ in the MSP methodology. Stage One Scope Definition This document specifies the scope of work packages within Stage One. It details the scope in more detail than in the Roadmap and includes process scope, organisational scope, technology scope, data scope, country scope, language scope, time zone scope and currency scope. Stakeholder Requirements These are statements of the requirements of a particular stakeholder or class of stakeholders. They describe the stakeholder "wants" and how that stakeholder will interact with the change. Target Operating Model The The Target Operating Model defines the desired capabilities of the organisation. These are broken down into sub-capabilities; each sub-capability is described in more detail by a set of characteristics. Key Characteristic changes are grouped by People, Process, Platform and Policy, which provide a detailed description of the desired target state. This is the equivalent to the „Blueprint‟ in MSP. Work package IR‟s Business Transformation will be delivered through a number of work packages. Each work package will have a well-defined scope clearly articulating the start and end of the work to be performed, the pain points that the work package will resolve, the linked benefits and the outputs and capability improvements that it will deliver. This is equivalent to a „project‟ in the MSP methodology. Glossary (3/3) IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE

Busy orchardist advises small businesses to start payday filing now
===================================================================

**05 December 2018**

A Hawke’s Bay orchardist is advising fellow small businesses to be ahead of the game on payday filing.

This is the mandatory requirement from April next year for employers to file their payroll information to Inland Revenue every time they pay their staff.

Te Mata Figs owner Helen Walker has been paying her five staff fortnightly and sending across their details using the online entry method in myIR.

Inland Revenue Customer Segment Leader Richard Owen says he strongly advises customers to start payday filing as soon as they can.

“The customers who have started early don’t tend to regret the decision and find it far better than leaving everything to the last minute.”

Helen Walker at Te Mata Figs agrees and says compliance tasks are not something you want to put off.

“It took a while to get used to entering our details in the Payroll Returns account in myIR so we’re grateful we got started in July and not during our peak picking season in the late summer.

“The main benefit of adopting early is that there’s plenty of time to resolve issues that pop up.”

Mr Owen says the early adopters are playing a vital role in helping us improve the customer experience on payday filing.

“Helen at Te Mata Figs has been particularly great at highlighting issues and we’ve been happy to send someone along to her orchard to understand her point of view and try to improve the process for her.

Customers are advised to either check with their payroll software provider about when their payday filing solution is likely to be ready or they can follow in the footsteps of Te Mata Figs and start straight away through the online entry method in the Payroll Returns account in myIR.

Helen Walker says Inland Revenue is “humanising” the switch to payday filing by being approachable and responsive in providing all the support she has needed.

“I always prefer the personal contact and the local IR staff have been great to deal with. People shouldn’t feel apprehensive about dealing directly with them if they’re unsure about anything.”

Te hoko mai i te rawa whenua me te takune ki te hoko atu Buying property intending to resell it
===============================================================================================

Generally, if you buy property with the intention or purpose of reselling it, you’ll have to pay tax on any profit you make from its sale.

This is called the [intention rule](/api/glossary/item?id={A3637F26-4574-4352-B0EB-9A273CC990AA})
. It applies to both commercial and residential property, so you need to think about your intentions when you first buy a property. What you intend to do with it will determine your tax when you go to sell.

This usually does not apply to your [main home](/api/glossary/item?id={AD1B86A5-6B63-4FFF-B245-605A92C3446B})
 or if you bought the property as a long-term rental investment.

If you have several reasons for buying
--------------------------------------

The intention to sell does not need to be the main reason for buying the property - it could be one of several reasons for buying.

For example, if one of your intentions when buying is to [flip](/api/glossary/item?id={EBFD6FCF-D51E-469A-A201-DE3845DECC3F})
 the property, even if you rent it out, you'll still need to pay income tax on your profit when you sell it.

Time frames and the bright-line test
------------------------------------

The intention rule applies no matter how long you keep the property before selling it.

The intention rule also applies before the bright-line test, which only applies to residential property sold within a set period of time — the bright-line period.

[The bright-line test](/property/buying-and-selling/when-you-need-to-pay/the-brightline-test)

Example: Moana buys a family home

Moana buys a property with the intention of providing a home for herself and her children.

When Moana eventually sells her home, she hopes to make a profit and leave her children a legacy.

In a year's time she gets a new job and decides to sell the property to move closer to her new job. Property prices have risen, so Moana is able to sell the house for much more than she paid for it.

Moana will not pay tax on the profit from her property sale as her intention was always to provide a home for her family.

However, if Moana sells the property within the bright-line period, she needs to consider the bright-line test and whether the main home exclusion applies.

Example: Sue buys a property with the intention of making a profit

Sue buys a property with the intention of selling it for a higher price when the time is right.

Sue and her family decide they like the area the property is in, so they live in it in the meantime. Sue has a regular pattern of buying and selling residential properties.

2 years later, house prices rise, and Sue decides to sell the property for a profit.

The sale of Sue's property is taxable, because her intention at the time she purchased it was to sell it.

Example: Frances and Bruce buy a second property

Frances and Bruce buy a second property in the hope that it will quickly gain in value. They decide to rent it out in the meantime. One of their reasons for buying the property is to resell it for a profit.

When the property is sold, the profit on the sale is taxable because one of their reasons for buying the property was to resell it.

In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Government Administration and Expenditure Review Committee Inland Revenue’s July 2018 Transformation Update Proposal 1 This paper provides an update regarding Inland Revenue’s progress in modernising the revenue system. I am asking Cabinet to note the progress made to date and the preparations underway for implementing the next set of changes in April 2019. As outlined in the attached Transformation Update dated July 2018, these changes are significant as they will affect most New Zealanders to some degree. Executive Summary 2 Modernisation of the revenue system is now well underway, with the first two releases having been successfully implemented. Release 2 went live on 17 April 2018 introducing a pay-as-you-go option for provisional tax for small businesses, the automatic exchange of information (AEOI) to help combat global tax avoidance, improvements to the collection of employment information, and new online services for withholding taxes, fringe benefit tax, gaming machine duty and payroll subsidy. 3 The next release in April 2019 will be significant as the products in scope – income tax and Working for Families – affect most New Zealanders. New systems and processes combined with legislative changes will result in the biggest changes individual customers have experienced since the introduction of the personal tax summary in 2000. 4 Changes to the collection of employment and investment income information, and changes to the administration of individuals’ income tax 1 mean that, over time, most wage and salary earners will pay what they need to and get what they’re entitled to during the year, instead of having to wait until the end of the year. Working for Families tax credits entitlements will be more accurately monitored throughout the year to minimise the risk of customers being under or over paid. Inland Revenue will automatically issue refunds or tax to pay to customers whose only income is from salary, wages or investments. 5 The average value of end-of-year refunds or tax to pay will reduce over time as Inland Revenue receives more detailed, timelier information from employers and payers of investment income. 6 Customers’ interactions with Inland Revenue will change significantly over the next few years. There will be far less need for them to contact Inland Revenue as their tax and entitlements will be adjusted during the year as their circumstances change. Transitioning customers to new processes and reporting requirements will require on- 1 Subject to legislation going engagement and careful management. Meeting customer demand may be challenging for the department for a time. 7 This has been evident in the experiences of customers this year. Inland Revenue is well aware of the recent frustrations resulting from issues with its online services and is placing the highest priority on ensuring they remain available during this period of peak demand. Running old and new systems in parallel has added to the complexity and fragility of Inland Revenue’s technical environment. Completing transformation as quickly as possible will minimise the amount of time the old and new systems need to co-exist and is the best way to manage risk. 8 Some implementation decisions to be made over the coming months will influence the degree to which the changes being made impact individuals and other participants in the revenue system, such as intermediaries. Inland Revenue will make further changes to its operating model to reflect shifts in customers’ behaviour. 9 Once Release 3 is implemented in April 2019, we will have a significantly improved ability to make changes to tax products, including any tax-related recommendations from the Tax Working Group we decide to accept. Ideally, any changes arising from the Welfare Expert Advisory Group would align with the introduction of new systems and processes, to minimise costs and impacts on both customers and Inland Revenue. Background 10 A modern digital revenue system will help ensure that revenue is available to fund the high-quality public services New Zealanders expect and deserve. Customers will spend far less time and effort ensuring they meet their obligations and receive their correct entitlements. Tax will be correctly withheld and assistance provided at the time it is needed, contributing to a more productive, sustainable and inclusive society and economy. 11 New Zealand’s revenue system is being transformed in four broad, over-lapping stages – digital services, tax, social policy and a final wrap up. The systems, processes and legislative settings that support taxes and entitlements are being modernised in a series of releases within these stages. This is now well underway, with the first two releases having been successfully implemented. Major releases will typically occur on an annual cycle until 2021 to align with the beginning of the tax year in April. 12 Transformation is far more than an upgrade of technology; it is a fundamental review of how the revenue system is administered. A combination of changes to policy, process, technology and the organisation design of Inland Revenue are transforming the revenue system and deliver the outcomes committed to government. Once Transformation is completed, Inland Revenue will be agile, effective and efficient, customers will be able to self-manage with speed and certainty, and the Government will be able to make timely policy changes. 13 The timeframe for, and the costs and benefits / outcomes of Transformation which Inland Revenue committed to government remain unchanged. The go-live of Release 2 was successful 14 Release 2 was successfully implemented on 17 April 2018: 14.1 It is now easier for customers to meet their obligations for withholding taxes, fringe benefit tax, payroll subsidy, gaming machine duty, and GST. As at 29 June 2018, more than 30,000 returns had been filed using the new online eServices. 14.2 The accounting income method (AIM) provides a pay-as-you-go option for small businesses for provisional tax. As at 29 June 2018, just over 1,100 customers were using AIM. 14.3 The AEOI with international tax treaty partners helps combat global tax avoidance. 14.4 Employers are now able to send their information to Inland Revenue on payday if they choose to do so (they will have to do so from 1 April 2019). As at 29 June 2018, approximately 3,000 payday returns had been filed by just over 500 customers. 14.5 Income information is now being collected in START 2 enabling pre-population of individuals’ information to begin. 15 Responses from business customers and tax agents since go-live are largely positive. As with all new services, Inland Revenue expects uptake of AIM and payday reporting to be modest in the first year. 16 Lessons learned from implementing the Release 1 GST changes in February 2017 were applied to planning for Release 2. Changes made included greater engagement with stakeholders, more user involvement in design, and a more structured approach to supporting customers and staff in the period immediately after go-live. 17 The Families Package, Best Start and increases to Paid Parental Leave have been implemented in Inland Revenue’s heritage systems, and will be migrated to new systems and processes in line with the release plan. The changes being implemented from April 2019 are more significant 18 More comprehensive changes will be introduced in Release 3 in 2019. These include making tax simpler and easier for individuals, 3 mandatory reporting of PAYE information every payday for employers, changes to the reporting of investment income information, and migrating income tax and Working for Families to new systems and processes. 19 Release 3 is significant as the products in scope affect most New Zealanders. It is more complex and higher risk than the first two releases, as changes to systems, processes and legislation will affect businesses, individuals and financial institutions. For individual customers, these changes 4 will be the largest they have experienced since the introduction of the personal tax summary in 2000. 20 In addition to new systems and processes and legislative reforms, changes are also being made to Inland Revenue’s capabilities to better support customers. 2 START stands for simplified tax and revenue technology and is the name Inland Revenue has chosen for the GenTax software provided by FAST Enterprises LLC 3 Subject to legislation 4 Ibid Changes to policy and legislative settings 21 Changes to the collection of PAYE information, the collection and use of investment income information, and changes to the administration of individuals’ income tax 5 mean that, over time, most salary and wage earners will pay what they need to and get what they are entitled to during the year. Working for Families tax credits entitlements will be more accurately monitored and adjusted throughout the year. These changes are being progressively introduced and will be fully implemented by the 2020/21 year. 22 Inland Revenue will also make use of the more detailed, timelier information it will progressively receive from employers and payers of investment income to proactively help individuals during the year to ensure they pay and receive the right amounts. As a result, over the next few years the average value of end-of-year refunds or tax to pay will reduce. 22.1 For the year ended 31 March 2019, all individuals will have their end-of-year income assessed by Inland Revenue. Refunds or tax to pay will be automatically issued to customers Inland Revenue is confident it holds enough income information about. This will include most salary and wage earners. All refunds will be paid by direct credit, with limited hardship or practicality exemptions. Amounts of tax to pay under $20 will be written off. 22.2 For the year ended 31 March 2020, employers will file employee information every payday, and some payers of investment income will voluntarily provide more detailed information about recipients of investment income more often. This will allow Inland Revenue to act earlier to help customers get things right. More people will pay what they need to, and receive what they are entitled to during the year, so there will be fewer customers with end-of-year balances and their balances will be smaller. 22.3 For the year ended 31 March 2021, Inland Revenue will receive more detailed and timely employment and investment income information for individuals. The number of customers with end-of-year balances should drop further, as should the average amount. 23 It will take two complete tax cycles for the benefits of the changes to individuals’ income tax, employment and investment income information to be fully realised. 24 The obligation for customers to self-assess will remain at the core of the revenue system. While more income will have tax withheld from it and more customers will have income reported on their behalf, customers will continue to be responsible for reporting income, assessing liabilities and meeting obligations. Inland Revenue will make it easier for customers to see what they’ve paid and what they owe, and provide tailored services to help them get things right from the start. 25 While Inland Revenue will finalise end-of-year refunds or tax to pay for as many people as possible in the future, there will always be people who have to provide information because the department does not have it. This includes people who earn income that isn’t already reported to Inland Revenue by their employer or financial institution, for example people who earn business, rental or overseas income. 5 Ibid Migrating income tax and Working for Families to new systems and processes 26 Release 3 in April 2019 will complete the migration of income tax and implement Working for Families (the first release of Stage 3) in START. It will progressively improve experiences for both business and individual customers, and is a key trigger point for reducing the compliance costs faced by small-to-medium sized businesses. 27 The effort required by businesses to keep on top of their tax obligations will be significantly reduced. The likelihood of errors will be much reduced, resulting in greater certainty, fewer interactions, and less need for compliance checks. Businesses will be able to meet their tax obligations at minimum cost and minimum disruption. They will have: 27.1 on-line services for all tax products - for example filing returns, setting up payment plans and including attachments 27.2 integrated tax and business processes 27.3 faster, more accurate tax information, providing near real-time visibility of tax during the year, and 27.4 faster tax refunds. 28 Individual customers will progressively have easy, digital access to all the income and personal information Inland Revenue holds about them. This will make it easier for them to understand what their obligations and entitlements are and why, and they will be able to self-help the majority of the time. New myIR services will make it easy for individual and family customers to see: 28.1 what they’ve paid and what they owe 28.2 whether they have a refund or a tax to pay and when it was automatically issued to them 6 28.3 who they receive Working for Families payments for, and who they share the care of children with 28.4 why their Working for Families entitlement amount has changed, and 28.5 the personal information (such as name, address, bank account details) Inland Revenue holds about them. Transitioning customers to new processes and requirements 29 Inland Revenue is working through how best to transition customers to new processes and reporting requirements. During the transition period, some customers will no longer need to contact the department and some will do so to seek reassurance. At times, meeting customer demand may be challenging. This has been evident during the peak filing period this year. 30 During June 2018, Inland Revenue experienced some issues with its digital services and is carefully monitoring them in managing the peak period of demand from April to July. 6 Subject to legislation Inland Revenue is well aware of the frustration customers experienced as a result of these challenges. 31 Inland Revenue’s heritage systems and processes are complex and fragile. As new systems and processes are introduced, co-existence (the need for old and new systems to connect with each other) has introduced a further layer of complexity. Completing transformation as quickly as possible will minimise the amount of time the old and new systems need to co-exist and is the best way to manage this risk. 32 Customer experience through Inland Revenue’s online channels has returned to the levels normally expected at this time of the year. Inland Revenue did not apply late filing and late payment penalties to GST returns filed and paid by 4 July 2018. Once the peak filing period has passed, Inland Revenue will identify what further enhancements could be made to its digital services. 33 A customer information campaign will, subject to appropriate approval, 7 ensure New Zealanders understand what is changing, how it affects them and what they need to do. Changes to Inland Revenue’s capabilities 34 To administer a modern revenue system, Inland Revenue will have to change the way it works and make more intelligent use of information. New skills and abilities are required to better understand customers’ circumstances and needs across wider government, and to identify policy and service design opportunities to improve the overall wellbeing of New Zealanders. 35 The implementation of a new data and intelligence platform from late 2018 will enable Inland Revenue to better understand customers’ needs, tailor services to them, and help them get things right from the start. Errors and non-compliance, both inadvertent and deliberate, will be better detected and detected earlier. Some key design and implementation decisions have yet to be made 36 The changes being introduced for customers as part of Release 3 are significant. Inland Revenue advise me that some implementation decisions to be made over the coming months will influence the degree to which these changes impact customers and other participants in the revenue system, such as intermediaries. The key areas to be considered include: 36.1 How to ensure a smooth transition for individual customers through changes to the way tax is assessed and refunds are paid out. Depending on the design of services and processes, there will be different implications for the amount of contact individual customers will have with Inland Revenue, and for the business models of other participants in the revenue system, such as intermediaries. 36.2 When and how to ensure compliance with newly introduced requirements, such as payday reporting, or changed requirements, such as the lower electronic filing threshold. 8 Allowing a reasonable period of time for customers to transition is essential, particularly those who have customised systems or who are currently 7 Cabinet Office Circular CO (15) 4 8 From 1 April 2019, the threshold for electronic filing will reduce from $100,000 of PAYE and employer superannuation contribution tax to $50,000 not using digital services. Decisions about how long this period should be have yet to be made. 37 These decisions could potentially involve trade-offs between achieving desired outcomes, maintaining service levels, retaining public confidence in the revenue system, and encouraging continued voluntary compliance. I am assured by Inland Revenue that any significant implications and potential trade-offs will be highlighted for Ministers to consider before decisions are finalised. Upcoming releases are crucial to our plans to improve the fairness, balance and structure of the tax system and to overhaul the welfare system 38 Once Release 3 has been implemented, we will have significantly improved agility for any changes we wish to make to tax products. START will be the delivery vehicle for any of the Tax Working Group’s tax-related recommendations we accept. 39 However, the complex inter-relationships between income and social policy will continue to place some limits on agility. Full policy agility will be provided once Transformation is complete. 40 I am discussing how best to proceed with opportunities to improve the administration of social policy, identified as part of the Making Tax Simpler consultation, with Inland Revenue. 41 Our 100 day plan changes were implemented in FIRST, 9 however this is not ideal as the changes will have to be re-implemented in START in line with the release plan. Any other changes that would need to be implemented in FIRST to meet desired effective dates, for example changes to social policy products other than Working for Families, would also need to be implemented twice. This could affect Inland Revenue’s ability to provide the appropriate focus on and resource for transformation, and increase the risk of delivery and benefit realisation timeframes not being met. 42 Timeframes for implementing any recommendations made by either the Tax Working Group or Welfare Expert Advisory Group that we accept will need to be considered in this light. The cost and benefit assumptions in the business case for Transformation assumed that implementation of policy and system changes would be aligned. There will be further changes to Inland Revenue’s organisation design 43 During 2017, Inland Revenue consulted with its people on changes to the organisation design of its customer-facing areas. Implementation of the changes began in February 2018, with further changes to come. 44 As the changes to policy and legislative settings take effect and as more products are migrated to START, customers’ interactions with Inland Revenue will change considerably. Inland Revenue’s interactions with other participants in the revenue system, such as intermediaries, will also change. Accordingly, Inland Revenue will need to change its operating model to reflect these new ways of working and shifts in customers’ behaviour. 9 Inland Revenue’s existing system, being replaced by START 45 Between April and August 2018, the Executive Leadership Team is working with a range of staff and experts on how Inland Revenue could best work in 2021/22. The focus is on the parts of the organisation that support the customer-facing functions. The Public Service Association, Taxpro and the National Union of Public Employees are being involved at key points. All three unions have been invited to nominate members to take part in this work. 46 Further change will occur in 2019, including in customer-facing areas. Once Transformation is complete, Inland Revenue’s overall workforce is expected to reduce by 25–30%. Inland Revenue is continuing to use workforce management principles to guide decisions on filling vacancies as they arise. For example, avoiding permanent external appointments to existing positions in the current organisation structure. Instead, Inland Revenue is filling vacancies with fixed-term employees. The conclusion of fixed- term arrangements will contribute to the reduction in the workforce and realisation of business case benefits. 47 Inland Revenue is carefully monitoring the potential industrial action and do not expect it to have an impact on the transformation programme. Transformation is a complex undertaking and remains inherently high risk 48 Release 2 was a more complex implementation than GST. Release 3 is significantly more complex again. Multiple changes are being introduced to the systems and processes that customers use to meet their obligations and determine their entitlements, along with legislative changes that affect how often and how they do that. 49 Transformation combined with the Tax Policy Work Programme and Budget changes means that Inland Revenue has a full work programme. Factors that will need to be taken into account when considering new opportunities are: 49.1 Inland Revenue’s ability to deliver 49.2 customers’ capacity to absorb change and Inland Revenue’s capacity to support customers through change, and 49.3 operational risk in light of co-existence of old and new systems. 50 A summary of the most significant risks for Transformation as at June 2018 is included in Appendix 4 of Inland Revenue’s Transformation Update dated July 2018. An on-going monitoring programme is in place to provide assurance to stakeholders 51 Inland Revenue undertakes regular independent quality assurance (IQA) and technical quality assurance (TQA) reviews, and Gateway reviews. One external assurance review has been completed by KPMG since the last progress update provided to Cabinet. The review concluded that Transformation continues to be well managed and governed. The Minister of Finance and I are provided with the opportunity to talk directly with the review teams. We also receive copies of the reports once they have been finalised. 52 Inland Revenue is required to provide Transformation progress updates to Cabinet by July and December each year (CAB-15-MIN-0249 refers). The next update will be provided by December 2018. Next steps 53 The next steps are to: 53.1 continue preparations for the implementation of Release 3 in April 2019; 53.2 support the passage of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill which contains key transformation proposals; 53.3 progress next steps in social policy legislative reforms, following further Ministerial discussions; and 53.4 prepare a Transformation update for Cabinet to consider by December 2018. Consultation 54 A copy of this paper has been provided to the Accident Compensation Corporation, the Department of Internal Affairs, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Social Development, the New Zealand Customs Service, and Statistics New Zealand. Financial Implications 55 The proposals in this paper have no financial implications. Human Rights 56 The proposals in this paper have no human rights implications. Legislative Implications 57 The proposals in this paper do not require any changes to legislation. Regulatory Impact Analysis 58 The proposals in this paper do not require a Regulatory Impact Statement. Gender Implications 59 The proposals in this paper have no gender implications. Disability Perspective 60 The proposals in this paper have no implications for people with disabilities. Publicity 61 I intend to ask Inland Revenue to publish this paper on its website once it has been considered by Cabinet. Central agencies’ comment (The Treasury, State Services Commission and Government Chief Digital Officer) 62 Corporate Centre agencies were consulted on this update..The Corporate Centre’s delivery confidence assessment of the programme remains at amber/green. This assessment is based on past and current programme delivery, ongoing learning loops in place in the transformation programme and external delivery assurance. The next assurance review is planned for August 2018. The Corporate Centre continues to have good visibility of the programme and the risks/mitigations due to high standards of reporting and transparency applied by the programme team. 63 Since the February update, Inland Revenue has successfully implemented Release 2 and continues preparations for Release 3. The Corporate Centre are mindful that this Release will affect significantly more New Zealanders, and will work with Inland Revenue to ensure the upcoming changes are well-signalled to their customers. 64 Ministers should note that any change which has a substantial operational impact on Inland Revenue could impact their ability to deliver Business Transformation and realise the benefits committed to in the 2015 business case. This includes delays to the organisational change programme and the implementation of proposed legislation. The risk of the transition from the legacy systems to the new system is being actively managed and monitored by the programme. The Corporate Centre notes the importance of Inland Revenue remaining on track to realise these benefits, and will focus on monitoring this progress over the next six months. 65 The Corporate Centre will work with Inland Revenue on the interaction between Business Transformation and proposed changes arising from other Government initiatives, including the Tax Working Group. 66 In late June, Inland Revenue featured in the media due to customer reports of prolonged response times for the MyIR service. Inland Revenue are keeping the Corporate Centre and Joint Ministers updated on this issue, and will consider what further improvements are needed to prevent issues occurring in the future. 67 Inland Revenue’s organisational change has also featured in the media, largely due to the Public Service Association’s court proceedings. The Corporate Centre will continue to work with Inland Revenue as they implement a new organisational structure, and bring new developments to Ministers’ attention. Recommendations I recommend that the Committee: 1 note that Release 2 successfully went live on 17 April 2018; 2 note that Release 3 in April 2019 will introduce significant changes and includes: 2.1 mandatory reporting of PAYE information every payday for employers; 2.2 optional reporting of investment income information; 2.3 a new year-end process for individual customers; 10 2.4 moving income tax and Working for Families to new systems and processes; 3 note that some key design and implementation decisions for Release 3 are still to be made; 4 note that once Release 3 has been implemented, START will be the vehicle for any recommendations of the Tax Working Group that are accepted; 5 note that Transformation costs and benefits assume that policy changes are aligned with system and process changes; and 6 note that the next Transformation update will be provided to Cabinet to consider by December 2018.

1 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Government Administration and Expenditure Review Committee Inland Revenue’s July 2019 Transformation Update Proposal 1 This paper provides an update regarding Inland Revenue’s progress in modernising the revenue system. I am asking Cabinet to note the progress made to date, the challenges still ahead, and the preparations underway for the next set of changes in April 2020. Executive Summary 2 The changes introduced in April 2019 represent a significant milestone in the transformation of the revenue system. As a result of the changes made, more than 1.3 million New Zealanders had automatically been issued with their tax refunds totalling $572 million as at 25 July 2019. Some 271,000 have received a bill and have until 7 February 2020 to pay it. It is now much easier for them to do so, as customers can now file and pay all their taxes online, including setting up instalment arrangements. Working for Families customers can also do a lot more for themselves online. 3 One of the objectives of transformation is to make it simpler and easier for people to be certain they are paying and receiving the right amounts. While a significant number of people have been identified as being on the wrong prescribed investor rate (PIR) for their portfolio investment entity income, Inland Revenue’s new system, START, 1 is working as designed. This includes a large number of KiwiSaver members. Inland Revenue is now able to see all a person’s income information in one place and help them to get things right during the year, rather than waiting until the end of the year. 4 While there have been some issues, for example tax agents have requested a number of changes, by and large the new systems and processes are working well. People are filing their returns and payments are being made as they should. Tax professional bodies and Inland Revenue have worked together to identify and agree the top priorities to address for tax agents. 5 Supporting customers as they experience the new year-end process is continuing to require significant effort from Inland Revenue. Demand from customers for Inland Revenue’s services, whether in person, over the phone, or online, has been unprecedented. This traditionally busy time of year, known as peak season, has been compounded by the biggest changes to the revenue system in almost 20 years. Since go- live on 26 April until 30 June 2019, Inland Revenue received approximately 1.1 million calls. There were 16.9 million logins to myIR, Inland Revenue’s secure online service, approximately 90% higher than last year. myIR, has performed well during this period of 1 START stands for simplified tax and revenue technology and is the name chosen by Inland Revenue for the GenTax software provided by FAST Enterprises LLC Proactive release This document was released by Inland Revenue under section 81(1B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This release supports the purposes of the Official Information Act 1982 by increasing progressively the availability of official information to the people of New Zealand. 2 IN CONFIDENCE high demand. However, as with all peak seasons, there has been some customer frustration with phone wait times. 6 A lot of change has been introduced to the revenue system over the last three years. It will take time for customers to adapt. Encouraging customers to rely primarily on online services and not call Inland Revenue unless necessary will be a key focus. However some customers will always need more personal support, such as those with complex circumstances. This support will continue to be available. 7 There are more big changes to come for New Zealanders. Tax itself will continue to transform until 2021 as the benefits of the changes to employment and investment income reporting become evident. Increasingly, people will pay and receive the right amounts during the year as tax will be withheld correctly, and entitlements paid accurately at the time they are needed. KiwiSaver and Student Loans will migrate to new systems and processes in April 2020, followed by Child Support in 2021 as shown in the diagram below. These changes will affect 2.9 million KiwiSaver members, 720,000 student loan borrowers, and the approximately 300,000 people who either pay or receive Child Support through Inland Revenue. 8 Inland Revenue will continue to make changes to its organisation design as it both embeds and leverages the new capabilities delivered and becomes more efficient. 9 Transformation remains high-risk and will remain so until the programme is completed in 2021. Keeping both the new and legacy systems running and working in tandem, while maintaining services for customers and implementing more change, will continue to be challenging. April 2019 changes (Release 3) went live as planned 10 On 26 April 2019, Inland Revenue implemented the third release in its transformation programme. This release included migrating income tax and Working for Families to new systems and processes and introducing a new year-end process for individuals. In addition, employers must provide income information to Inland Revenue every payday, and payers of investment income can provide more detailed recipient information more frequently if they choose to (this becomes mandatory from 1 April 2020). 11 The most visible change is for individual customers. Between mid-May to mid-July, approximately 2.5 million wage and salary earners will have their year-end tax position automatically assessed for them. This process is well underway for the 2018/19 tax year. From 20 May to 25 July 2019, Inland Revenue (all numbers approximate): 11.1 Issued 1,330,000 refunds totalling $572 million. 3 IN CONFIDENCE 11.1.1 A further 354,000 refunds of less than $1, totalling $70,000, have been held by Inland Revenue to be paid out once the refund amount reaches $1. 11.2 Issued 271,000 bills for tax to pay totalling $96 million. Customers with a bill to pay have until 7 February 2020 to do so. 11.2.1 A further 529,000 bills totalling $3.6 million were written off as the tax owing was less than $50. The average write-off is $7 which is uneconomic for Inland Revenue to collect. 12 As at 25 July 2019, approximately 184,000 employers had filed approximately 2.1 million payday returns since 1 April 2019. A small portion of customers have not yet completed a payday return. Inland Revenue is proactively contacting them to understand if they require any assistance. Micro businesses are a particular area of focus as they adjust to the new requirements. 13 Customers now have online services for all tax products. They can file returns, set up payment plans, lodge their donations receipts, and include attachments online. Inland Revenue is using the employment and investment income information it receives more frequently to pre-populate individual customers’ online accounts. 14 Online services for Working for Families customers have also been significantly enhanced. For example, Inland Revenue now pre-populates as much information as possible for customers, including income and employment details for both them and their partner. 15 Depending on the scope, changes to tax policy can now be implemented more quickly and cost-effectively. Until all products are migrated to new systems and processes, policy changes that require Inland Revenue to develop new capabilities or which have flow on effects to social policy entitlements will still be challenging. 16 Government can now have greater confidence in the accuracy of reporting for income tax revenue following the migration of income tax to START. START creates monthly revenue estimates for each tax payer based on the latest available information, such as returns and payments received. This will result in a smoother allocation of income during the year and earlier recognition of revenue and refunds within the year. FIRST, Inland Revenue’s old system, did not have this capability. 17 There have been some challenges and, as expected, not everything has worked exactly as intended. For example, there have been some display issues in myIR, with Student Loan and Child Support balances displayed in a way that confused some customers. Some letters have been sent in error, for example to children, and Inland Revenue accepts that some of its messaging may have been confusing for customers, for example super- annuitants. However these issues did not affect people’s obligations or entitlements. On- going monitoring is ensuring that any issues identified are resolved as quickly as possible. 18 Inland Revenue is working closely with the tax agent community to address the things agents have identified that are making it more difficult or time consuming for them. Tax professional bodies and Inland Revenue have worked together to identify and agree the top priorities so the right mix of support can be provided to tax agents. The top 20 issues have been identified and Inland Revenue has set up a dedicated team to resolve them. 4 IN CONFIDENCE The scale of the changes is significant and Inland Revenue has responded commensurately 19 This has been a significant undertaking for Inland Revenue and is a significant milestone in the transformation of the revenue system. Before go-live, to ensure everything worked as smoothly as possible, just over 94,000 tests were conducted. Approximately 20 million customer accounts, 100 million transactions, and 8 million web logins were moved to START. Inland Revenue contacted approximately 2 million customers directly, most more than once, to let them know what the changes would mean for them. More than 350 seminars were run by Inland Revenue for businesses and tax agents. 20 Supporting customers as they experience new ways of doing things and use new services for the first time is continuing to require significant effort from Inland Revenue. 21 Millions of wage and salary earners and people who earn investment income have had a new experience with Inland Revenue this year, some potentially for the first time in a long time or ever. As a result, the department has experienced exceptionally high volumes of customer interactions (across phones, in its offices, and online services). At times, this has stretched Inland Revenue’s systems and its people. 22 There has been unprecedented demand for myIR, Inland Revenue’s secure online service. From go-live on 26 April until 30 June 2019, there were 16.9 million logins to myIR. This is an increase of approximately 90% on the 8.9 million logins recorded during the same period in 2018. Customers heeded the call to ensure their details were up to date and to use myIR to check the status of their refund or tax to pay. It is likely that customer use of myIR is also partly a response to more information being presented to them more clearly. 23 Inland Revenue invested substantial time and effort in ensuring that myIR would be available when people wanted to use it. myIR has performed well during this period of unprecedented high demand. While there have been some short periods when login times have been longer than acceptable or the service has been unavailable, these have been resolved very quickly. 24 Despite customers’ use of digital services, call volumes have still been high. From 26 April to 30 June 2019, 1.1 million calls were made to Inland Revenue. February to September is Inland Revenue’s traditionally busy time and the 2019 peak season was always expected to be challenging given the fundamental changes made. Inland Revenue brought on board an additional 325 people from its temporary labour force to help manage demand. They will remain with the department until September 2019. In addition, Inland Revenue is redeploying up to 900 of its existing staff to respond to demand in particular areas as needed. 25 Despite these efforts, Inland Revenue has, at times, been unable to answer all the calls it receives or provide the level of service customers expect and deserve. As with previous years, there has been some customer frustration with phone wait times. On 13 June 2019, Inland Revenue had to close its Palmerston North office as the building was found to be earthquake prone. This has reduced the number of people Inland Revenue has available to answer calls. The department is working on a range of options so services for customers can continue to be delivered until the new Palmerston North office is opened later this year. 5 IN CONFIDENCE 26 Once customers become comfortable with myIR being their first and best port of call, Inland Revenue expects call volumes to decrease. Realistically, it is likely to take another couple of end-of-year cycles, i.e. until 2021, for this to occur. Inland Revenue’s research shows that customers who are using the new online services report it is clear what their tax position is and what they need to do next. They report that myIR is clearly laid out and the content is easy to read. 27 The most significant changes to the tax system in almost 20 years, and the resulting demand from customers, has meant that Inland Revenue will not achieve some of its performance measures for the year ended 30 June 2019. While this is not ideal, I am comfortable the department has done all it reasonably could to provide the best level of service possible through what has been an extraordinarily busy period. There are still many challenges ahead to fully embed these changes 28 Implementing new processes and technology is just the start. Inland Revenue is very experienced at implementing releases of new technology and processes and is now focusing on embedding these changes. 29 A lot of change has been introduced over the last three years. It will take customers time to adapt and for Inland Revenue to leverage all the new capabilities it has delivered. Customer and people change is in some ways more complex than the admittedly complex technical changes. Fully realising the benefits of the changes that have been made and establishing a “new normal” for both customers and Inland Revenue will take time and effort. 30 For example, although all taxes are now administered in START, income tax itself will continue to transform until 2021: 30.1 Employers have been providing employment income information to Inland Revenue every payday since 1 April 2019. The year ending 31 March 2020 will be the first full year that Inland Revenue receives employment income information every payday. There remains a small portion of employers who may be required to file a payday return but, as yet, have not done so. Inland Revenue is sending reminder e-mails and is proactively phoning selected employers to understand if they require any assistance to file. 30.2 For the year ending 31 March 2020, Inland Revenue will receive information about recipients of investment income more often from payers of investment income who choose to provide it. 30.3 For the year ending 31 March 2021, Inland Revenue will receive more detailed and timely investment income information from all payers. 31 This more detailed and timely data will mean Inland Revenue can proactively contact customers during the year to ensure they are paying and receiving the right amounts. For example, Inland Revenue can suggest a tailored tax code to those it sees might benefit from one such as people using secondary tax codes, and suggest people correct their PIR where it identifies this isn’t right. 6 IN CONFIDENCE 32 A large number of KiwiSaver members have been on incorrect prescribed investor rate (PIR). Every year, portfolio investment entity (PIE) providers, 2 including KiwiSaver scheme providers, ask investors to check that they are on the correct PIR. PIE providers cannot check PIRs as they do not have information about investors’ other income. From mid-July 2019, Inland Revenue will begin proactively contacting customers who are on an incorrect PIR to let them know they need to change it to avoid paying too little or too much tax in the future. People will need to contact their PIE provider to change their rate. Subject to legislation, from 1 April 2020 Inland Revenue will go directly to PIE providers to get them to change PIRs for people defaulted on to the top rate of 28% if this is too high. 33 As a result, over the next two years, there will be fewer customers with end-of-y ear balances and their balances will be smaller. It will take time for Inland Revenue to develop the capabilities needed to achieve this and help customers, for example building its expertise in data analysis. 34 Inland Revenue also has a much greater ability to identify people who deliberately try not to comply with their obligations. The improved analytical capabilities available to Inland Revenue means people’s movements can be tracked throughout myIR and there are alerts built in to let the department know when anyone is attempting to do anything untoward. For example, in early June 2019, Inland Revenue was able to move quickly to shut down a scam where bank accounts appeared to have been misused to generate fraudulent transactions. 35 While most customers are now filing online (92% as at April 2019), it will take time to build their understanding of and trust in new processes and services. Customers now have far more online services for tax, for example they can now amend returns, pay their tax and set up instalment arrangements themselves, as well as file returns. The more customers can easily do for themselves online, and feel confident doing it, the more Inland Revenue’s administrative effort will reduce. If customer behaviour does not shift quickly enough, Inland Revenue is likely to continue to experience pressure on its performance. Overall, customers’ perceptions of Inland Revenue’s service and the ease of making sure they pay and receive the right amounts have not shifted significantly yet 36 While satisfaction with service delivery (88% as at 31 March 2019) and perceptions that Inland Revenue makes it easy for people to get it right (80% as at 31 March 2019) remain relatively high, they have not shifted significantly in recent years. While thi s is not unexpected given the amount of change customers have had to adapt to, it is not where Inland Revenue wants to be. 37 These measures should increase over the next couple of years, as peak season will change fundamentally and will not exist in the same way it does today. Customers will increasingly not need to do anything at the end of the year and more people will pay and receive the right amounts during the year. However, some customers will always need to contact Inland Revenue, for example social policy customers with complex circumstances. 38 For those who do need to interact with Inland Revenue, new services should make it much easier to do so. By 2023/24, the target is that 90% of people will find it easy to comply with their obligations. 2 A portfolio investment entity (PIE) is a type of entity (such as a managed fund) that invests the contributions from investors in different types of investments. 7 IN CONFIDENCE 39 Inland Revenue regularly surveys small-to-medium sized businesses about the time, money and effort they spend meeting their tax obligations. 3 Reducing compliance costs is one of the benefits of transformation Inland Revenue has committed to delivering. In 2018, small-to-medium sized businesses estimated they spent 27 hours each year meeting their tax obligations. This is unchanged since 2016 and is 9 hours fewer than the estimate these businesses made in 2013, which is the baseline for measuring progress against. 40 This result is largely as expected as, during 2018, businesses had to get used to some new ways of doing things and may have experienced some frustrations in not being able to use Inland Revenue’s online services at times. However, new digital services are making a difference. Those who use them report that it is making it easier for them to meet their obligations. As at 31 March 2019, approximately 105,000 customers were using accounting software, provided by Xero or MYOB for example, to file their GST returns. This represents around 15% of total GST customers. 41 These views are supported by customers in general. Inland Revenue has regularly surveyed customers in the lead up to and after go-live of the April 2019 changes. Customer comments included “There were no problems at all, it was quick and easy” and “Able to complete my task quickly and efficiently – no complaints”. The next set of changes will be implemented in April 2020 (Release 4) 42 There are more big changes to come for New Zealanders. Some complex social policy products are scheduled to be migrated to new systems and processes over the next two years. 43 While government now has greater agility for tax products, the complex inter-relationships between income and social policy products (which are still on FIRST) do place some limits on agility. Full policy agility will be provided once the programme is complete in 2021. 44 In April 2020, KiwiSaver and Student Loans will migrate to new systems and processes and some legislative changes will be introduced (CAB-19-MIN-0109 and CAB–19-MIN- 0085 refer). The changes mean that information will be processed more quickly, and new online services will make it easier for people to do even more for themselves online. 45 Approximately 3 million New Zealanders and a number of external stakeholders will be affected by these changes: 45.1 There are approximately 2.9 million people enrolled in KiwiSaver and more than 25 KiwiSaver scheme providers. 45.2 There are approximately 720,000 Student Loan customers. Inland Revenue jointly administers Student Loans with the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Social Development. 46 Inland Revenue will also make further enhancements to the administration of income tax and Working for Families and its digital services. For example, customers will be able to offset their current Working for Families entitlement against a prior year's overpayment or debt. They will be able to do this for themselves, through myIR. 3 Small-to -medium sized businesses are expected to benefit most from the changes being made as tax compliance is typically the responsibility of the owner. 8 IN CONFIDENCE 47 Hours paid information will be collected from employers who file through software and who already record their payroll on this basis. Not all employers will be required to provide this information. Collecting this information will help to improve the administration of Working for Families and Child Support as these payments are partly determined by the hours people are paid for. Once collected, Inland Revenue will share this information with Statistics NZ so that it can be used to support broader Government priorities such as pay equity, social wellbeing, and better understanding productivity. 48 In April 2021, Child Support will migrate to new systems and processes (Release 5). There are approximately 300,000 people who either pay or receive Child Support through Inland Revenue. Preparation for delivery of the April 2020 (Release 4) changes is progressing well 49 The social policies remaining in FIRST are complex products in their own right and their payment calculations rely on income information. Therefore, the risks of co-existence with old and new systems operating in parallel will remain high until Child Support is migrated in 2021. At this point, FIRST will be able to be decommissioned. The best way to manage risk is to maintain momentum and complete transformation as quickly as possible. 50 Some country-specific code and configuration will be required to administer social policy products on START. For example, tracking KiwiSaver contributions end-to-end and tracking student loan obligations. FAST Enterprises LLC will build these requirements into their core product so that Inland Revenue does not end up with a bespoke solution just for New Zealand. 51 Inland Revenue’s design and test teams are currently slightly behind schedule as the priority has been early life support for the April 2019 changes. Officials have assured me that, at this stage, there is no cause for concern and the go-live date of April 2020 is not at risk. 52 Inland Revenue and the Ministries of Education and Social Development are working closely together to ensure the changes to Student Loans are implemented successfully. Inland Revenue is also working closely with scheme providers to ensure KiwiSaver changes are also implemented smoothly. Inland Revenue is continuing the move to its new organisation design and continuing to invest in building the skills and capabilities of its people 53 To embed the changes implemented to date and to leverage the new capabilities delivered, Inland Revenue is continuing to move to its new organisation design. New performance, recognition and pay approaches support new ways of working and drive the behaviours and ways of working that are expected in the future. These new approaches will continue to be embedded during 2019 and into 2020 by focusing on capabilities, coaching, and recognition; learning and development; and supporting leaders and teams. 54 During 2019, Inland Revenue began consultation with its information technology team on changes that reflect the shift from technical skills in bespoke heritage solutions to working with trusted partners providing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions. This shift requires fewer people, with different skills and capabilities than Inland Revenue has today. 9 IN CONFIDENCE 55 Consultation on changes to Inland Revenue’s other back-office functions will get underway later in 2019. This will include ensuring Inland Revenue is set up to deliver government policy priorities in an agile and cost-effective way. 56 In the past, the complex, inter-connected and inflexible nature of FIRST meant that successive governments were required to invest to achieve the policy outcomes they wanted. The configurable nature of START provides far more flexibility and greater speed when making changes. For example, Inland Revenue has made approximately 1,800 minor enhancements to the new systems and processes introduced on 26 April 2019 in response to customer feedback and feedback from its people. 57 This cycle of constant iteration has been enabled by transformation. To ensure future governments can achieve the policy outcomes they want without the need for on-going investment, Inland Revenue needs to embed this approach right across the organisation. 58 That is not to say that investment to achieve policy outcomes will never be required. It will depend on how significant the changes required to Inland Revenue’s systems and process are, and whether any new capabilities are required. 59 Inland Revenue is replacing its enterprise support services platform 4 to provide for modern ways of working. The department is working with other agencies to ensure that these services are able to be used across the public sector. 60 Change for Inland Revenue’s people will continue into 2021 as a result of the transformation programme and beyond as the department continues to transform the way it works. Inland Revenue is already a smaller organisation and is building on the changes begun in 2018, supporting its people in a range of ways and providing them with choices where it can. The savings made are being reinvested in transformation as agreed by Cabinet (CAB-15-MIN-0249 refers). Fixed term employees now account for around 11% of Inland Revenue’s work force. The conclusion of these arrangements will contribute to the overall reduction of 25% to 30% of its workforce, which the department is on track to achieve by 2021. Costs and benefits remain on track 61 Inland Revenue is tracking within the funding approved by government for transformation (CAB-15-MIN-0249 refers). The three releases implemented to date have been delivered on time and under budget. Inland Revenue has not needed to call on the contingency funding held by the Ministers of Finance and Revenue. 62 Inland Revenue is on track to deliver the financial and non-financial benefits it has committed to. The administrative savings of $495 million to be achieved by 2023/24 have already been realised as this funding was removed from Inland Revenue’s outyear baseline funding in 2016. A progress update against the agreed indicators regarding benefit realisation will be included in the November 2019 update to Cabinet, once data for the year ending 30 June 2019 is available. Transformation is a complex undertaking and remains inherently high risk 63 Transformation is inherently high-risk and will remain so until its completion in 2021. Inland Revenue’s increased operational risk is the result of running new and legacy systems and 4 The internal processes and systems that support the day-to -day running of Inland Revenue, for example finance, procurement and human resources 10 IN CONFIDENCE keeping them working in tandem. As PAYE processing continues to be in FIRST, all payday filing information (between 550,000 to 580,000 employment information returns a month for April and May 2019) is received through START and then sent to FIRST. This will remain the case until the April 2020 changes are made. 64 The most significant external risks for the changes being made in April 2020 are: 64.1 Maintaining services to customers. Encouraging customers to change how they interact with Inland Revenue while ensuring their needs continue to be met will be challenging. Some customer groups will be slow adopters of digital channels and others may be reluctant or unable to do so. Inland Revenue recognises that customers with complex circumstances and those unable or unwilling to use digital services must continue to be supported. Encouraging customers who are able to manage their affairs online to do so will free Inland Revenue’s people up to provide more personal support to those who need it. 64.2 Change fatigue. Customers have experienced a significant amount of change since Inland Revenue began implementing new systems and processes in 2017. Three of five planned releases have now been completed, with two further releases to come. While maintaining momentum is critical, Inland Revenue recognises that further changes may not always be welcomed by customers. Continuing to focus on the benefits of the changes will help to alleviate any customer concerns. 64.3 Compliance costs for employers. Inland Revenue will be collecting some new information from employers as part of the April 2020 changes. Student loan repayments will be deducted from more types of income, meaning employers who pay these types of income will have to provide information about the amounts deducted to Inland Revenue. In addition, as noted in paragraph 47 some employers will be providing information about hours paid. The employers affected are likely to perceive that their compliance costs have increased. Inland Revenue is designing new systems and processes to make it easier and simpler for employers to meet their obligations. In addition, the department’s engagement and communications activity will mitigate this perception as much as possible. Next steps 65 The next steps are to: 65.1 continue preparations for the implementation of Release 4 in April 2020; 65.2 support the passage of the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans and Remedial Matters) Bill which contains key transformation proposals; 65.3 continue with the on-going programme of independent quality assurance; and 65.4 provide a further progress update to Cabinet by November 2019. Consultation 66 A copy of this paper has been provided to the Accident Compensation Corporation, the Department of Internal Affairs, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Social Development, the New Zealand Customs Service, and Statistics New Zealand. 11 IN CONFIDENCE Financial Implications 67 The proposals in this paper have no financial implications. Human Rights 68 The proposals in this paper have no human rights implications. Legislative Implications 69 The proposals in this paper do not require any changes to legislation. Regulatory Impact Analysis 70 The proposals in this paper do not require a Regulatory Impact Statement. Gender Implications 71 The proposals in this paper have no gender implications. Disability Perspective 72 The proposals in this paper have no implications for people with disabilities. Proactive Release 73 I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, and associated minutes in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Central agencies’ comment (The Treasury, State Services Commission and Government Chief Digital Officer) 74 The central agencies were consulted on this update. The Treasury’s delivery confidence assessment of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme remains at Amber, due to the programme having significant work remaining in order to achieve Releases 4 and 5, and the continued risk that co-existence between the old and new systems creates. The risk created by co-existence, while lower after the implementation of Release 3, remains significant. 75 This assessment is based on past and current programme delivery, ongoing learning loops in place in the transformation programme, external delivery assurance, and Inland Revenue’s own assessment. Central agencies also note the recent Gateway Review assessed ‘delivery confidence’ for Release 3 as Amber/Green and that the IQA/TQA review 5 rated the BT programme as Amber. This is relatively consistent with the Treasury’s own assessment of delivery confidence and that of Inland Revenue. 76 The central agencies continue to have good visibility of the delivery of the programme and are well informed by Inland Revenue of the risks as they arise and of the mitigations that are implemented. Central agencies also continue to receive reporting from Inland Revenue about how they are tracking towards achieving the benefits identified in the BT business case. Inland Revenue recently provided central agencies with the results of its compliance effort survey of small-to-medium sized businesses, which measures the time 5 KPMG undertake regular independent quality assurance (IQA) and technical quality assurance (TQA) reviews 12 IN CONFIDENCE and cost that these businesses face in meeting their tax obligations. This is one of the key performance indicators for how BT is making it easier for customers to comply with their tax obligations. The results from this survey show central agencies that Inland Revenue has achieved more reduction in the time and cost to comply with the tax system than expected at this time. However, the survey also shows central agencies that there does not appear to have been any significant reductions since the implementation of Stage 1 (GST) in 2017. Inland Revenue attributes this in part to customers getting used to new ways of complying with their tax obligations and service disruptions in mid-2018. 77 The central agencies are currently working with Inland Revenue to improve visibility of some output and operational metrics to provide greater assurance that administrative savings are on track to be sustainably realised. The central agencies are also working with Inland Revenue to test the assumptions underpinning the forecast revenue benefits from BT. The central agencies note that the size of these benefits are expected to increase substantially over the 2019/20 and 2020/21 fiscal years and that the cumulative administrative savings and additional Crown revenue identified in the Inland Revenue business case was $495 million and $2.88 billion respectively. It is important that there is a high degree of visibility of the business changes driving administrative savings to ensure they are being sustainably achieved. It is also important that forecast revenue impacts are as accurate as possible to minimize the fiscal risk to the Government. Central agencies will report back to Cabinet on the status of the visibility over benefits realisation at the next update in November 2019. 78 Since the October update, Inland Revenue has successfully implemented Release 3 and continues preparation for Release 4. The central agencies believe that Inland Revenue’s processes and extensive testing around Release 3 were a major reason for this success. In particular, the use of mock “go-lives” were an effective way to identify issues early and amend processes and timelines appropriately. 79 The central agencies believe that, after Release 3, Inland Revenue is now in a better position to implement policy changes relating to income tax and GST that impact on the operation of the tax system. However, substantial changes may increase the risk and cost associated with the programme. In addition, changes to social policy products such as child support and KiwiSaver at this time could substantially increase risk and cost. 80 The central agencies note that Inland Revenue is continuing to engage with tax agents and customers after Release 3 in order to improve the system for these groups. While there have been some complaints about the way the new system operates, central agencies are confident that Inland Revenue can address these issues in an effective and timely manner. 13 IN CONFIDENCE Recommendations 81 I recommend that the Committee: 1 note that it will take until 2021 for the benefits of the changes introduced in April 2019 to be fully realised; 2 note that the migration of income tax to START has enabled Inland Revenue to estimate income tax revenue more accurately; 3 note that KiwiSaver and Student Loans will migrate to new systems and processes in April 2020; 4 note that from April 2020 hours paid information will be collected from employers who file through software and who already record their payroll on this basis; 5 note that Inland Revenue is continuing the move to a new organisation design during 2019 and 2020; 6 note that the next progress update will be provided to Cabinet to consider by November 2019. Authorised for lodgement Hon Stuart Nash Minister for Revenue
1 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Government Administration and Expenditure Review Committee Inland Revenue’s November 2018 Transformation Update Proposal 1 This paper provides an update regarding Inland Revenue’s progress in modernising the revenue system. I am asking Cabinet to note the preparations underway for implementing the next set of changes in April 2019. Executive Summary 2 The changes being introduced in April 2019 will result in a fundamental shift in how New Zealanders interact with the revenue system. New systems and processes for income tax and Working for Families will make tax and payments simpler and more certain. Most people will pay and receive the right amounts during the year without having to do anything. Employers, tax agents and intermediaries will also experience change. 3 The changes include a new year-end process for individuals, new online services for Working for Families’ customers, new processes and reporting requirements for businesses and employers that will, ultimately, make tax and payments easier. 4 For individuals, subject to enactment of legislation that is currently before the House 1 , people that only earn salary and wages or investment income will no longer need to do anything at the end of the tax year. Inland Revenue will work out for them whether they have a refund or tax to pay. For the year ending 31 March 2019, approximately 1.67 million people will automatically receive a tax refund. This includes approximately 530,000 people who earn less than the minimum wage or are beneficiaries who have not previously applied for a refund. Approximately 263,000 people will have tax to pay. 2 5 Employers, financial institutions and tax professionals will be adapting to new legislative reporting requirements. Payday information and investment income information will be reported to Inland Revenue more frequently. Inland Revenue is engaging face-to-face with as many of these groups as possible to provide certainty about what they need to do to prepare for these changes. 6 For all businesses and individuals, there will be new systems and processes for income tax and Working for Families. It will be easier for customers to manage their tax obligations and Working for Families’ entitlements with new online services. 7 Given the scale of these changes, some disruption is to be expected from April 2019. Reactions to the changes are likely to be mixed, with individuals expected to be the most 1 Subject to legislation. The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill had its first reading on 3 July 2018 and was referred to the Finance and Expenditure Committee for consideration. 2 Ibid 2 IN CONFIDENCE positive. Some groups may be less positive about the changes, in particular, some tax agents and tax intermediaries because of the need to make changes to their systems and, in some instances, to their business model. Inland Revenue is engaging face-to- face with as many businesses, employers and tax professionals as possible to ensure they understand the changes and are taking the steps necessary to ensure a smooth transition. 8 Inland Revenue is committed to maintaining services throughout the implementation of these changes, but recognises that this will be a challenge. Customer behaviour will take time to change and they may still contact Inland Revenue to seek reassurance even when there is no requirement to do so. Intensive customer engagement activity is underway to prepare customers and intermediaries for these changes, and to help them understand what is changing and what it means for them, using a full range of communication channels. In parallel, Inland Revenue is well-advanced in its planning to ensure it is resourced to cope with additional customer contacts expected from April 2019. Inland Revenue has also undertaken remedial work to enhance the stability of its web services following the issues experienced by customers in June. 9 Once all taxes are migrated to Inland Revenue’s new systems and processes from April 2019, we will have more flexibility to introduce changes to the tax system. We will, however, need to use this flexibility judiciously. Transformation of the department’s systems and processes will remain high-risk until it is complete in 2021 at which time all of the social policy products that Inland Revenue administers will be managed from new systems. The benefits of any policy opportunities we want to progress must be weighed against the potential to further increase the risk of, or prolong, transformation. April 2019 is a significant milestone 10 The changes being introduced in April 2019 will result in a fundamental shift in how New Zealanders interact with the revenue system. 3 New systems and processes 4 for income tax and Working for Families will make tax and payments simpler and more certain. Most people will pay and receive the right amounts during the year without having to do anything. 11 Individuals will have tax correctly withheld and assistance provided at the time it is needed. Any refunds will be automatically paid and amounts of tax to pay of less than $20 will be written off. 5 12 New online services will make it easy for people to track what they’ve paid and what they owe, and what their entitlements are. Customers will have reassurance they’ve done the right thing. There will be fewer errors because Inland Revenue will identify problems during the year and prompt customers to address these, making any under or over payments easier to manage. 13 More people will be on the right tax code regardless of their employment arrangements. More frequent provision of payday information by employers will enable Inland Revenue to monitor more proactively during the year and ensure customers are on the right tax code, including a tailored tax code, particularly those with more than one employer and who are currently on a secondary tax code. 3 Subject to legislation 4 Ibid 5 Ibid 3 IN CONFIDENCE 14 Employers and financial institutions will provide information to Inland Revenue more often. These changes will ensure that Inland Revenue has more up-to-date and accurate income information that, in turn, will result in fewer errors, less chance of customers getting into debt and less need for compliance checks. For employees and investors, these changes mean that more people will pay and receive the right amounts during the year. 15 While the first two releases have been successfully implemented, Release 3 is a quantum leap in its scale and complexity. Almost all New Zealanders, regardless of their role in the revenue system, will experience some degree of change. The period from April to June 2019 represents the peak period of change. 16 The target date for Release 3 to go-live is 23 April 2019. Inland Revenue is likely to be closed for 3 days, including Good Friday and Easter Monday. This will be signalled to customers well in advance. While no time is a good time for this level of disruption, the date takes into account major customer and business events and the timing of public holidays. Changes will apply from the tax year ending 31 March 2019 17 The impact of the changes varies for different groups. Inland Revenue has an intensive programme of customer engagement underway, led by its senior managers. The engagement is tailored to different groups to ensure they understand what the changes mean for them, and are taking all of the steps needed to make this a smooth transition. 18 Individuals are likely to regard the changes most positively. For people whose only income is from salary, wages or investments, having to contact Inland Revenue at the end of the year to work out whether they will get a refund or have tax to pay will be a thing of the past. 19 To illustrate, Inland Revenue estimates that approximately 1.67 million people will automatically receive a tax refund next year. This is made up of: 19.1 950,000 people who have previously applied for and received a tax refund; and 19.2 an additional 720,000 people who have not previously applied for a refund. Just under three-quarters of this group, approximately 530,000 people, earn less than the minimum wage or are beneficiaries. 20 Approximately 115,000 people will have additional tax to pay for the first time next year. This number will decrease over time as Inland Revenue uses the income information it receives to prompt customers to make any necessary changes, avoiding a year-end debt. 21 The more than 330,000 families who receive Working for Families will have more accurate payments during the year. Payments will be adjusted more quickly as families’ circumstances change. This will avoid families being underpaid and missing out on assistance when they need it, or being overpaid and left with a debt to repay at the end of the year. 22 The groups who may be more concerned and potentially less positive, with whom Inland Revenue is working very closely, include: 4 IN CONFIDENCE 22.1 Personal tax summary intermediaries (PTSIs). 6 Their business model will fundamentally change as customers will automatically receive any tax refunds they are entitled to. Some PTSIs are changing their business model to offer more value-add services as tax agents, while others are deciding to cease trading. Inland Revenue is working closely with those who are closing their business before they do so to ensure their customers’ information is up-to-date in the department’s systems. 22.2 Tax agents. The changes will make it easier for tax agents to provide services to their clients. Tax agents will, however, have to update their own systems and processes before April 2019 to ensure they can continue to transact and exchange information with Inland Revenue’s systems. The department is working closely with tax agents through professional bodies, seminars, webinars and face-to-face meetings. 22.3 Financial institutions. Changes to the collection and use of investment income information, the implementation of the automatic exchange of information, and increased reporting requirements for anti-money laundering mean this sector is under pressure. Legislative changes for investment income will increase the frequency and the amount of data collected through digital channels. This information will enable Inland Revenue to pre-populate tax returns with investment income information, reducing the amount of effort required by customers. These changes become mandatory from April 2020, allowing more time for financial institutions to prepare and, should they choose, to opt in voluntarily from April 2019. Face-to-face meetings are ongoing to ensure financial institutions have plans in place to ensure a smooth implementation of these changes. 22.4 Employers. All employers, approximately 213,000, must comply with mandatory payday filing reporting requirements from 1 April 2019. Currently all employers provide salary and wage information to Inland Revenue on a monthly basis. While there are significant benefits from increased frequency of reporting, some employers may initially perceive that their compliance costs have increased as a result of this requirement. Inland Revenue is reaching out to employers to ensure they are aware of this requirement, and encouraging as many as possible to start to do so earlier. The department is running seminars across the country with small and medium-sized enterprises that have been well-attended. In addition, Inland Revenue is hosting webinars, meeting with industry groups, developing “how to” videos, contacting employers by phone and using all existing communications and channels to lift awareness of payday filing requirements. A lot of work is underway to ensure all groups are well-prepared for the changes 23 Inland Revenue is working hard to ensure: 23.1 Customers have a positive end-to-end experience and know online services are their first port of call if they need to do something or need additional information. 6 PTSIs work with their clients, the majority of whom are salary and wage earners, to determine whether they have an end- of-year refund. If they do, PTSIs request a PTS from Inland Revenue on behalf of their client and then confirm it. PTSIs pass the refund on to their client, after deducting a fee. 5 IN CONFIDENCE 23.2 Tax agents are fully briefed on the changes and have set up the appropriate delegations so they can continue to access their clients’ information. 23.3 A smooth transition for customers of PTSIs to the new end-of-year process. 23.4 Employers, payroll developers, payroll intermediaries and payroll bureaux are ready for mandatory payday reporting by April 2019. 23.5 Financial institutions are ready to meet new reporting requirements for providing investment income information between April 2019 (voluntary) and April 2020 (mandatory). 23.6 Online services are resilient and there are no unexpected disruptions. After some challenges earlier this year, Inland Revenue is doing a lot of work behind the scenes to ensure online services are available when people need them. 24 In addition to the accelerated engagement underway with PTSIs, tax agents, employers, software developers and financial institutions, information will be sent directly to customers via emails, texts and letters, and made available on Inland Revenue’s “Changing for you” website. Advertising campaigns using a range of channels will raise awareness of the changes and prompt individuals and families’ customers to ensure Inland Revenue has up-to-date contact and bank account details. Customers who do not already have a myIR account (Inland Revenue’s secure online service) will be encouraged to register. 25 Given the scale of the changes, Members of Parliament may be approached by the public wanting help to understand why the changes have been made and what they mean. I am working with Inland Revenue to determine what information should be made available to Members and electorate offices to help them respond to any queries they receive. Maintaining the confidence of the business community is a key priority. 26 Inland Revenue is engaging face-to-face with as many businesses, employers and tax professionals as possible. In these engagements Inland Revenue is focusing on the opportunities created by the changes and providing certainty to these groups about what they need to do. Payment dates are not changing, so more frequent reporting of employment and investment income will not impact businesses’ cash-flows or government revenue. This is being emphasised in all engagements with businesses. 27 New online services will make it easier for businesses to meet the new reporting requirements. Businesses will be able to file all their taxes through myIR and use new functionality such as more embedded calculations. In addition, there are choices to be made about when Inland Revenue begins to enforce compliance with the new requirements. Inland Revenue is getting ready to handle additional customer demand from April 2019 28 Traditionally, there is a significant increase in customer demand for Inland Revenue’s services from February to September each year, known as peak season. This is largely driven by end of the tax year activities for social policies when the next year’s assessments are issued for Child Support and Working for Families, and key income tax 6 IN CONFIDENCE and GST filing dates. The volume of customer contacts is also influenced by PTSIs’ advertising regarding potential tax refunds. 29 Once the April 2019 changes are in place, many of those who currently contact Inland Revenue to finalise their tax position through the Personal Tax Summary (PTS) will no longer need to do so. Peak season will not exist in the same way it does today. 30 Significant efforts are being made to ensure individuals know they do not need to contact Inland Revenue to get a refund next year and that they can update their Working for Families’ details themselves. Timeframes will be made explicit so that people know when they can expect a refund, if they are entitled to one. A range of options are being considered for refunds, including progressively crediting them to customer’s bank accounts, to ensure Inland Revenue can handle any resulting customer contacts. 31 Despite Inland Revenue’s best efforts, customers may still make contact to seek reassurance. The department has estimated the effects of the changes on its work volumes and expected customer contacts, and is planning to expand its workforce to manage increased demand post the go-live and throughout the 2019 peak period. In parallel, the department has an independent review of its systems underway to ensure these remain stable during peak demand. 32 The department’s service performance may dip while these changes are embedded. I will be kept regularly informed of any issues that arise. 33 Customers with more complex circumstances will still need to contact Inland Revenue. This is one of the objectives of transformation: people with straight-forward circumstances will not need to do anything, freeing the department up to support those customers with more complex needs. Delivery is progressing well 34 Inland Revenue is just over half way through the delivery phase of Release 3. Officials advise that the target delivery date is achievable but there is pressure in some areas, including testing, given the extent of the changes. Focused attention and rigorous prioritisation means Inland Revenue is confident it is on track for the go-live in April 2019. 35 Inland Revenue is ensuring its people are fully trained and ready to support customers as they become accustomed to the changes. Approximately 4,000 staff mainly in customer-facing areas will require a moderate to high level of training and support. I am advised by the department that internal communications, training and online help to reflect the greater depth and breadth of the Release 3 changes are well underway. 36 I am meeting with officials nearly every week between now and April 2019 to ensure everything remains on track and that customers and Inland Revenue are as well prepared as they can be. The department has been running year-end processes for the last 25 years. While April 2019 scales this up considerably, Inland Revenue has years of experience to call on. 37 In addition to its intensive preparations for Release 3, Inland Revenue is making good progress in enhancing its skills and capabilities and changing the way it works to better serve customers. These changes include implementation of a new data and intelligence platform from late 2018 that will enable Inland Revenue to better understand customers’ needs, tailor services to them, and help them get things right from the start. The 7 IN CONFIDENCE department is also progressing its future operating model, focusing on the capabilities of its corporate, policy and tax technical functions, supported by new enterprise support services and workplace tools. The Public Service Association, Taxpro and the National Union of Public Employees are being involved at key points. 38 The department remains confident that it will realise business case benefits from transformation. Administrative savings have been re-tested recently, indicating that these may be realised slightly later than originally planned given the need to support customers through the impacts of Release 3. Transformation costs continue to track within budget. We will have more flexibility to make changes to the tax system 39 After April 2019, all tax information will be in START 7 providing us with greater ability to make any changes to the tax system resulting from the Tax Working Group’s recommendations or other Government priorities. However, we will need to use this flexibility judiciously. The benefits of any opportunities we want to progress will need to be weighed against their potential to: 39.1 increase delivery risk for transformation; 39.2 prolong the inherent complexity involved in Inland Revenue operating its old and new systems in parallel until transformation is complete in 2021; and 39.3 overwhelm participants in the revenue system with change. 40 While we will have more flexibility, until firm recommendations from working groups are available it is difficult to assess the impact on Inland Revenue’s capacity for any additional work. It depends on the detail of any proposals. 41 For example, any changes to tax products that have flow-on impacts for social policy entitlements will be far more challenging. By way of example, Working for Families has ten different components, all of which interconnect. This makes it difficult to change one component without affecting all the others and makes it difficult for customers to understand the resulting payment. The challenges become more pronounced when administration is shared across agencies. Transformation is a complex undertaking and remains inherently high risk 42 Transformation is inherently high-risk and will remain so until its completion in 2021. Once Release 3 has been implemented, Student Loans, KiwiSaver and Child Support will be migrated to new systems and processes during 2020 and 2021. Initial work for migrating Student Loans and KiwiSaver in 2020 (Release 4) is underway. These are complex products and their payment calculations rely on income information. Therefore the risks of co-existence with Inland Revenue’s old and new systems operating in parallel remain high until 2021 when transformation is complete. 43 The most significant external risks for Release 3 are: 43.1 Customer readiness. Despite Inland Revenue’s best efforts, some groups of customers will not understand what the changes mean for them and others will not take the preparatory steps they need to before the go-live. These customers 7 START is Inland Revenue’s new system and stands for simplified tax and revenue technology 8 IN CONFIDENCE are likely to contact Inland Revenue to find out why things don’t work as they used to. Inland Revenue has customer engagement activity underway and this will ramp up in the lead up to go-live and continue afterwards. 43.2 The stability of Inland Revenue’s technology. Customers will be encouraged to use myIR to check whether they will receive a refund or have tax to pay, rather than contact Inland Revenue. As many of the approximately 2.5 million salary and wage earners will no doubt do so, the availability issues experienced with myIR this year clearly cannot be repeated. Inland Revenue is undertaking a complete review of its systems to identify what actions are needed to ensure that system availability is as close to 100% as possible. 43.3 Inland Revenue’s ability to support customers. It has traditionally been difficult for Inland Revenue to meet customer demand during peak filing periods. This may be even more challenging in 2019, particularly if the risks around customer readiness and system stability are realised. The number of customer-facing staff will be increased to manage anticipated volume of customer contacts, drawing on existing staff and a temporary labour force if required. 43.4 Early life support. As with previous releases, Inland Revenue will provide additional support to customers for the three month period after the go-live, known as early life support. Given the scale of the changes being introduced in April 2019, there is potential for customers to require support for a longer period of time compared to the first two releases. Inland Revenue is gearing up to ensure any issues that arise following go-live can be resolved quickly. Recent independent assurance reviews are positive 44 Inland Revenue undertakes regular independent quality assurance (IQA) and technical quality assurance (TQA) reviews, and Gateway reviews. The Minister of Finance and I are provided with the opportunity to talk directly with the review teams. We also receive copies of the reports once they have been finalised. 45 The latest Gateway review, completed on 5 October 2018, concluded that transformation continues to be well managed and governed. The review concluded that “Successful delivery appears probable however constant attention will be needed to ensure risks do not materialise into major issues threatening delivery”. Further independent assurance reviews are scheduled to take place in late February – early March 2019, before the go-live of Release 3 in April 2019. Next steps 46 The next steps are to: 46.1 continue preparations for the implementation of Release 3 in April 2019; 46.2 support the passage of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill which contains key transformation proposals; and 46.3 provide a further progress update to Cabinet by July 2019. 9 IN CONFIDENCE Consultation 47 A copy of this paper has been provided to the Accident Compensation Corporation, the Department of Internal Affairs, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Social Development, the New Zealand Customs Service, and Statistics New Zealand. Financial Implications 48 The proposals in this paper have no financial implications. Human Rights 49 The proposals in this paper have no human rights implications. Legislative Implications 50 The proposals in this paper do not require any changes to legislation. Regulatory Impact Analysis 51 The proposals in this paper do not require a Regulatory Impact Statement. Gender Implications 52 The proposals in this paper have no gender implications. Disability Perspective 53 The proposals in this paper have no implications for people with disabilities. Publicity 54 I intend to ask Inland Revenue to publish this paper on its website once it has been considered by Cabinet. Central agencies’ comment (The Treasury, State Services Commission and Government Chief Digital Officer) 55 Central agencies were consulted on this update. The Treasury’s delivery confidence assessment of the programme has moved from Amber/Green to Amber, due to the programme having minimal schedule contingency available to manage delays and still achieve its targeted Release 3 date. This assessment is based on past and current programme delivery, ongoing learning loops in place in the transformation programme, external delivery assurance, and Inland Revenue’s own assessment. We also note the recent Gateway Review assessed ‘delivery confidence’ for Release 3 as Amber/Green. This is relatively consistent with Treasury’s own assessment of delivery confidence and that of the IR Business Transformation Programme. Central agencies continue to have good visibility of the programme and the risks/mitigations due to high standards of reporting and transparency applied by the programme team. 56 Since the July 2018 update, Inland Revenue has continued its preparations for Release 3. Central agencies are mindful that this Release will affect significantly more New 10 IN CONFIDENCE Zealanders than in previous releases, and that Release 3 is the most complex stage of the project to date. Central agencies also note that Inland Revenue is continuing to engage with its customers to help them prepare for the upcoming changes. 57 Central agencies believe that, before Release 3 goes live, any policy changes that resulted in a substantial impact on the operation of the tax system could negatively affect Inland Revenue’s ability to deliver Business Transformation and realise the benefits committed to in the 2015 business case. After Release 3, Inland Revenue will be better positioned for future changes arising from other Government initiatives, including the Tax Working Group, but any requirement to implement these changes prior to completion of Release 5 would substantially increase risk and cost. 58 Inland Revenue customers experienced significant disruptions to online services following Release 2. Inland Revenue is working with one of its key suppliers to address the root causes, with a view to both minimising the likelihood of future disruptions, and ensuring a swift and effective response should one occur. Central agencies will continue working with Inland Revenue and can provide additional assistance should they require it. Recommendations I recommend that the Committee: 1 note that Release 3 in April 2019 will introduce significant changes and includes: 1.1 mandatory reporting of PAYE information every payday for employers; 1.2 optional reporting of investment income information; 1.3 a new year-end process for individual customers; 8 1.4 moving income tax and Working for Families to new systems and processes; 2 note that these changes will affect almost all New Zealanders; 3 note that the April to June 2019 period represents the peak period of change, and that there may be some disruption following the go-live of Release 3; 4 note that Inland Revenue’s performance may deteriorate for a time following go-live; 5 note that the next progress update will be provided to Cabinet to consider by July 2019. Authorised for lodgement Hon Stuart Nash Minister for Revenue 8 Subject to legislation
1 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence Off ice of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Government Administration and Expenditure Review Committee Inland Re venue’s November 2019 Transformation Update Proposal 1 This paper provides an update regarding Inland Revenue’s progress in modernising the revenue system. I am asking Cabinet to note the preparations underway for the next set of changes, the work still ahead, and the results achieved to date. Executive Summary 2 The way customers interact with Inland Revenue and the revenue system has now fundamentally changed. Changes to the collection and use of employment and investment income information have enabled more far-reaching changes to be made, including the introduction of a new year-end process for individuals. The combination of these changes means that, for most individuals, tax will be correctly withheld and entitlements paid accurately at the time they are needed. Customers no longer have to rely on a year-end process to be certain they have paid and received the right amounts. 3 Improved analytical capabilities are enhancing the integrity of the revenue system by providing a real-time view of issues customers are struggling with and areas that might require closer investigation. Inland Revenue now has more tools at its disposal to make smarter decisions about where to focus its resources. Errors and non-compliance, both inadvertent and deliberate, are being detected more effectively and detected earlier. Rules created by Inland Revenue’s compliance experts are constantly adjusted as customer behaviour changes. Inland Revenue is proactively working with customers to help them get things right, for example ensuring their investments are taxed at the right rate. 4 For the year ended 30 June 2019, Inland Revenue has achieved all but one of the indicators that track achievement of the investment objectives of transformation. Throughout transformation, Inland Revenue has focused on implementing changes as cost-effectively as possible. 5 While transformation is now well advanced and has been successful to date, there are still two big releases ahead. Student Loans and KiwiSaver are on track to migrate to new systems and processes in April 2020, with Child Support following in April 2021. These are complex products with multiple stakeholders and Inland Revenue is not complacent about the inherent challenges. Testing, to ensure new systems and processes work as they should, is underway and will continue until go-live. Inland Revenue expects to complete around 70,000 tests in total. 6 Other changes will be made progressively between now and April 2020. These include a new rulings service from 1 October 2019 that will provide customers with greater certainty, Proactive release: This document has been released by Inland Revenue under section 18(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Some information has been withheld as the Government has yet to make decisions on the matter or it i s not able to be released under the confidentiality provisions This release supports the purposes of the Official Information Act 1982 by increasing progressively the availability of official information to the people of New Zealand. Withheld under Section 9(2)(f)(iv) of 18(c)(i) of the Official Information Act 1982. 2 IN CONFIDENCE the reporting by financial institutions of more frequent and more detailed investment income information to Inland Revenue becoming mandatory from 1 April 2020, and further improvements to the online services customers use. Communication and engagement are already underway to ensure that customers and stakeholders understand what is changing and when, and what preparatory steps they may need to take. 7 There will also be changes to Inland Revenue’s back-office systems and further changes to its organisational design. This reflects the changing nature of Inland Revenue’s work and the different capabilities that will be required in some areas in the future. 8 Planning is well advanced to ensure that all these changes are implemented smoothly. Although transformation is now well advanced, two big releases are still ahead 9 Inland Revenue has implemented three of five releases, including the biggest changes for individual customers in almost 20 years. This represents a fundamental change to how individual customers interact with Inland Revenue. It reduces effort for them and provides them with greater certainty. The revenue system is now operating in close to real-time which means customers have greater visibility of their taxes and entitlements and can be more confident they are accurate. 10 For the year ending 31 March 2019, more than 1.3 million New Zealanders were automatically issued with tax refunds totalling $572 million. Compared to the year ending 31 March 2018, 557,000 more New Zealanders received a refund and $188 million more was paid out. Approximately 271,000 people have received a bill and have until 7 February 2020 to pay it. Customers now have more payment options and Inland Revenue has better ways to track payments to ensure they are made on time. 11 The changes made to the collection and use of employment and investment income information, together with the new year-end process, have laid the foundation for on-going improvements for individual customers. From 1 April 2020, payers of investment income will be required to provide more detailed recipient information more frequently to Inland Revenue. The year ending 31 March 2021 will be the first full year that Inland Revenue receives both employment and investment income information more frequently and receives more detailed information about the recipients of investment income. Over time, this will mean that more customers will pay and receive the right amounts during the year, further reducing the need for them to interact with Inland Revenue. 12 All taxes and Working for Families are now administered on new systems and processes, and customers have vastly improved online services to help them pay and receive the right amounts. The challenge now is to embed the benefits of these changes. 13 Student Loans and KiwiSaver will migrate to new systems and processes as part of Release 4 in April 2020, followed by Child Support as part of Release 5 in April 2021. In addition, a range of policy changes will be introduced subject to legislation. These are complex products with many different stakeholders. For Child Support in particular, the changes will affect some customers with complex personal circumstances. To ensure changes are implemented as smoothly as possible, customers and stakeholders are involved in the design and testing of new services. 3 IN CONFIDENCE 14 From April 2020, all products, except Child Support and paid parental leave, will be in the new system START. 1 This will enable Inland Revenue to further simplify requirements, reduce effort, and improve services for customers. 15 KiwiSaver and Student Loan information will be processed more quickly and will be more accurate. Improved self-service options will enable Student Loan borrowers to manage their loans more easily themselves and will provide KiwiSaver members with better information about their contributions and enable them to do more for themselves. Inland Revenue will share Student Loan information with other government agencies more quickly and efficiently and will transfer funds to KiwiSaver scheme providers more quickly, which may have a positive impact on people’s KiwiSaver balances. These changes will affect approximately 700,000 Student Loan customers and approximately 2.9 million KiwiSaver members. 16 While these are the headline changes, other changes will also be made over this period. 17 A new short-process rulings service has been available since 1 October 2019. This service will provide more certainty for any individual or business with an annual gross income below $20 million and a question involving tax below $1 million. These customers will be able to apply and pay for a ruling, and track its progress, online. 18 Also on 1 October 2019, Inland Revenue’s finance, procurement, and some human resources functions moved onto a new cloud-based platform which Inland Revenue has named Ātea. More changes are due to go live in early-mid 2020. 19 Inland Revenue has adopted ‘out-of-the box’ processes to follow a standard process model, which is now being packaged so it can be used by other agencies. These processes are being implemented using Oracle’s Software-as-a-Service suite of tools, configured ‘out-of-the-box’. Inland Revenue is testing whether its configuration can be reused by other agencies as an accelerator for back-office system replacement. The New Zealand Customs Service have signalled their intention to adopt the model and test whether the Oracle configuration can be used to replace their finance system. The GCDO, Treasury, SSC and Inland Revenue are working together to agree how the process model will be managed, delivered and sustainably funded in the future. 20 The back-end processing of PAYE will migrate to START in April 2020. This means employers will be able to manage all their information and obligations in one account and will have a consolidated view of all the deductions they make on behalf of their employees. There will be further changes to the look and feel of the services employers use, including their myIR online account, and they will be able to correct errors themselves. 21 Gateway services will be extended to make it easier for customers to deal with Inland Revenue via their software. This includes receiving alerts and notifications from, and sending correspondence to, Inland Revenue. It will be easier and simpler for employers to manage their employee deductions and meet their obligations through their own systems. Hours-paid information will be collected from employers who file through software and already record their payroll on this basis. Some employers may see this as creating additional work for them. 22 More flexibility will be introduced for approximately 370,000 Working for Families customers, to help ensure their payments will be more accurate during the year. This will 1 START stands for simplified tax and revenue technology and is the name chosen by Inland Revenue for the GenTax software provided by FAST Enterprises LLC 4 IN CONFIDENCE build on the flexibility already provided by the new systems and processes introduced for Working for Families customers in April 2019. For example, new customers who register part way through a year will be able to request any back payment to be paid out, rather than waiting until the end of the year. 23 Inland Revenue will further enhance its website and myIR online services for customers and explore opportunities offered by its new analytical capabilities to help customers get things right. 24 The focus on retiring heritage systems and processes will increase, as is to be expected at this stage of transformation. Release 4 is on track for delivery in April 2020 25 Testing the new systems and processes for Student Loans and KiwiSaver began in July 2019 and will continue up until go-live in April 2020. Inland Revenue expects to complete approximately 70,000 tests before go-live, and progress is on track. 26 Inland Revenue is continuing with its customer and stakeholder engagements and communication. Face-to-face meetings are again playing a key role in readying customers and stakeholders for change. Advertising, social media, direct contact, and information published on Inland Revenue’s website will draw people’s attention to the changes being made. 27 Although a date has not yet been set, Inland Revenue is likely to time go-live around public holidays to minimise the amount of time it is closed to customers. 28 Inland Revenue has recognised the need for an integrated plan for the April to July 2020 period. Release 4 will be implemented at the same time as the second year of automatically issued income tax assessments is underway. The first Working for Families rollover in START ( when entitlements for the following year are estimated and communicated to customers), and the first annual income tax returns cycle in START, will also be during this period. Inland Revenue is actively managing the risk of these events all occurring in the same window o f time. In addition to further releases, there are still changes to embed from earlier releases 29 Changes to the collection and use of employment and investment income information and the introduction of a new year-end process for individuals mean that, over time, more people should pay and receive the right amounts during the year. 30 Inland Revenue’s new systems and processes have been designed to ensure tax is withheld correctly and entitlements are paid accurately and when needed. Inland Revenue is now seeing data flows at a level it has not previously experienced and, in some cases, receiving data that could not previously be processed in the old system. The combination of new systems and processes and receiving more detailed data more often means that Inland Revenue is now able to see issues that have not previously been visible. It is now apparent that approximately 1.5 million people have been on an incorrect prescribed investor rate (PIR), and that some employers are calculating and deducting employer superannuation contribution tax incorrectly. 31 People who invest in a portfolio investment entity, such as KiwiSaver schemes, select a tax rate, referred to as their PIR. Currently, tax on portfolio investment entity income is a 5 IN CONFIDENCE final tax for people have selected a rate that is too high, which means they cannot get the overpaid amount refunded. Following media coverage and Inland Revenue’s efforts to contact people proactively, some people will have corrected their PIR. Planned legislative changes will further reduce the number of people on the wrong rate. Subject to legislation, from 1 April 2020, Inland Revenue will provide portfolio investment entities with correct PIRs for: 31.1 people defaulted on to the top rate of 28% if this is too high 31.2 existing investors; and 31.3 new investors if sufficient information is available to Inland Revenue. 32 33 Employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) is payable on contributions made by an employer to an employee’s superannuation scheme, including KiwiSaver schemes. Employers are responsible for calculating ESCT and paying it to Inland Revenue. As a result of payday filing, Inland Revenue can now see that some employers are calculating ESCT incorrectly. 34 Before 1 April 2019 when payday filing became mandatory, employers included ESCT as a lump-sum amount for all employees with the payment information they provided to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue did not receive an itemised amount per employee and could not check that ESCT had been calculated correctly. Since 1 April 2019, Inland Revenue has been receiving the ESCT amount for each employee. As a result, it is now possible to identify errors. I have asked officials to work with employers and payroll providers to better understand why errors in ESCT rates are occurring and what responses may be required to eliminate them, including whether the rules can be simplified. 35 Inland Revenue expects that issues such as these will continue to come to light. For example, once Release 4 has gone live, it will be easier for Inland Revenue to identify and deal with anomalies in KiwiSaver contributions and Student Loan repayments. Addressing errors and anomalies as they occur will ensure the benefits of transformation are enduring. 36 It will take two complete tax cycles for the benefits of the changes to individuals’ income tax, employment and investment income information to be fully realised. Improved online services are making it easier for people to update their personal details when they become aware of an error. As is to be expected, customers are taking time to get used to new ways of doing things. It is getting easier for customers to get things right and harder to get them wrong 37 To help customers pay and receive the right amounts, compliance remains a key area of focus. Inland Revenue now has more tools at its disposal to make smarter decisions about where to focus its resources. Improved analytical capabilities are enhancing the integrity of the revenue system and are providing a real-time view of the issues customers are struggling with and areas that might require closer investigation. Inland Revenue can be Withheld under Section 9(2)(f)(iv) of 18(c)(i) of the Official Information Act 1982. 6 IN CONFIDENCE more responsive in providing support where customers need it and act more quickly when obligations are being deliberately avoided. 38 Errors and non-compliance, both inadvertent and deliberate, are being detected more effectively and detected earlier. All returns are now automatically risk-profiled, whereas previously only GST returns were automatically assessed for risk. This is enabling Inland Revenue to better target its compliance activity by providing cost-effective interventions, ranging from advice and education where needed, to enforcement where necessary. 39 As an example, to help customers get things right, the information provided by employers is analysed to identify inaccuracies earlier and identify p eople on incorrect tax codes. Inland Revenue can then provide them with the correct code or suggest a tailored tax code. 40 Inland Revenue’s compliance experts have created rules, which are built into systems and processes, to identify potentially fraudulent activity. For example, there is a rule that analyses donations as a percentage of income. Rules are constantly monitored and adjusted in real time and by customer group, as Inland Revenue observes changes in customer behaviour. 41 Inland Revenue can now also search for internet addresses and the use of anonymisers or proxies to identify returns all completed at the same address, and to view online sessions if it appears information is being manipulated to minimise obligations or maximise entitlements. 42 Over time, these capabilities will improve voluntary compliance and enable non- compliance to be more readily detected. Inland Revenue’s compliance activities will adapt as these new capabilities become embedded and as customer behaviour changes. Interactions and interventions will be better targeted to customers’ needs. Inland Revenue’s organisation design will change further 43 Changes are being made to Inland Revenue’s organisation design, workplace technology and its enterprise support services 2 to support a greater focus on customers and the use of information and intelligence, and on faster and more cost-effective delivery of policy outcomes. In addition, the adoption of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) technology and cloud-based solutions, and the greater use of third parties, mean that Inland Revenue requires different capabilities for the future. 44 These changes will continue over the next two years as the nature of Inland Revenue’s work changes and to ensure the department can operate sustainably in the future. They have been built into Inland Revenue’s funding model and, once transformation is complete, baseline funding will reduce. 45 The conclusion of fixed-term arrangements and fewer contractors will contribute to the overall reduction in Inland Revenue’s work-force. Other changes are required to ensure that Inland Revenue has the skills and capabilities it needs for the future. This means that a number of permanent employees will leave Inland Revenue over the next two years, some voluntarily and others not. 2 The internal processes and systems that support the day-to -day running of Inland Revenue, for example finance, procurement and human resources 7 IN CONFIDENCE 46 The changes being made to Inland Revenue’s information technology team are significant and reflect changes to the mix of skills, capabilities and resources required. Some changes were made ahead of Release 3, and further changes are scheduled to be implemented in early December 2019. More than 80 people will leave Inland Revenue by December 2019, and a further approximately 100 people will leave over the next two to three years. This will leave around 90 people remaining in the information technology team, compared to approximately 330 prior to transformation. 47 During transformation, Inland Revenue has increased its investment in developing the capabilities of its people. This is intended to ensure people have transferable skills as work changes, and have opportunities to develop new skills, such as digital literacy and data analytics. This will continue into the 2020s. 48 Inland Revenue will continue to work closely with its people, to provide them with choices where it can, and with the unions, to ensure change is managed in a considered way. At times, challenging conversations will be required. Benefits and costs are tracking to plan 49 The fundamental changes made to the revenue system over the last three years are delivering significant value to New Zealanders. There are three main measures of success for transformation: 49.1 easier for customers 49.2 reduced time and cost to implement policy (policy agility), and 49.3 administrative savings to Inland Revenue. 50 In July 2017, the then Ministers of Finance and Revenue agreed to track achievement of the investment objectives for transformation against a number of lead and lag indicators. Inland Revenue has achieved all but one of the indicators for 2018/19, which are shown in the annex. 51 It is easier for customers to pay and receive the right amounts: 51.1 Online services are available for all taxes. Customers can provide information, set up payment arrangements, and keep track of everything online. More and more customers are using them, with 89% of returns filed electronically. 51.2 It is easy for customers to do what they need to do, with 80% saying they find it easy to comply. This is the indicator Inland Revenue did not achieve; the target was 85%. The changes introduced in April 2019 appear to have had an impact on customers’ perceptions. Inland Revenue expects the new services available to customers and its new analytical capabilities will make it easier for customers to comply, and harder not to, in the future. 51.3 Small-to-medium sized businesses say they are spending nine fewer hours a year meeting their tax obligations, and say new digital services are making a real difference. Since the first changes were made in early 2017, the value of the time saved by these business owners is $280 million. 8 IN CONFIDENCE 51.4 New infrastructure is more robust and secure, with customer-facing online services available 99.4% of the time. 51.5 New services and new analytical capabilities are making it easier for customers to pay and receive the right amounts, ultimately flowing through to Crown Revenue. For example, customers who set up their own instalment arrangements are more likely to meet their obligations compared to those Inland Revenue sets up arrangements for. Areas where analysis suggests compliance issues exist are more easily identified. For example, returns filed where customers have previously exhibited fraudulent behaviour, where ratios of income to credits are outside of the maximum legislated ratios, or where income information filed by the customers does not match the information Inland Revenue holds. 52 The time and cost of implementing policy changes is reducing. Case studies are demonstrating that it is easier for Inland Revenue to make changes and deliver the outcomes policy-makers are looking for, as new systems are configurable. For example, the implementation of the Research and Development Tax Incentive. 53 Inland Revenue is working more efficiently to collect and distribute money. Since transformation began, Inland Revenue has made savings of $60 million from improved administration, compared to a target of $15 million. As agreed by Cabinet (CAB-15-MIN- 0249 refers), Inland Revenue is using these administrative savings as part of its funding contribution for transformation. There are some challenges ahead for Inland Revenue as the department continues to support customers, embeds the changes delivered to date, and completes transformation while moving to a new organisation design. 54 Throughout transformation, Inland Revenue has focused on delivering new capabilities as cost-effectively as possible and rigorously managing risks. Inland Revenue has already returned $26 million in transformation funding in earlier years. 55 The Commissioner retains her contingency to manage any unexpected issues as Releases 4 and 5 are implemented in April 2020 and April 2021. During this period, Inland Revenue will continue to actively manage the costs of the transformation and look for further efficiencies where possible. Transformation remains inherently high risk 56 Transformation will remain high-risk until completion in 2021. Although the overall risk has reduced slightly following the implementation of Release 3, operational risk remains high as heritage and new systems and processes still need to run in tandem. Momentum must be maintained to ensure that Inland Revenue fully migrates off its heritage systems and processes in 2021. 57 Inland Revenue is well aware of the dangers of complacency. The remaining releases are big and complex in their own right. As noted in paragraphs 17 to 24, a number of significant changes are being delivered as part of Release 4, in addition to migrating KiwiSaver and Student Loans to new systems and processes. Release 5 will include the migration of Child Support, upgrading to a newer version of START, which will mean changes to the Withheld under Section 9(2)(f)(iv) of 18(c)(i) of the Official Information Act 1982. 9 IN CONFIDENCE online services that all customers use, and decommissioning of heritage infrastructure and the infrastructure built to support co-existence. 58 An on-going programme of regular assurance reviews will continue, including periodic reviews by the Office of the Auditor General, to provide confidence that transformation is being well managed and governed. Although transformation is not yet complete and risk and uncertainty remain, there are lessons to be learned from Inland Revenue’s approach to modernising the revenue system 59 In less than two years, Inland Revenue will have completed its transformation programme. It is a credit to the department that, to date, the changes have been successfully implemented, notwithstanding some challenges along the way. 60 It is also highly unusual for changes of this scale and complexity. Inland Revenue has kept providing services to customers while fundamentally changing almost every aspect of the way it operates. The department continues to share what it has learnt with other agencies and to actively engage with others to learn from them. I am of the view that there is much others can take from Inland Revenue’s experience. 61 Transformation has involved changing almost every aspect of the way Inland Revenue operates. Changes have been made to policy settings, processes, technology, and Inland Revenue’s organisation design. A clear programme roadmap, which set out what changes would be delivered when, has provided confidence and enabled the programme to be fully funded from outset. The breadth of the changes made has required effective leadership and discipline to ensure this is a truly transformational change and not simply a technology replacement. 62 I have observed that transformation is being led from the top in Inland Revenue. The Commissioner and her executive leadership team collectively own the outcomes of transformation. At times, they have made difficult but necessary decisions. Early on, Inland Revenue recognised that it did not have the skills and experience it needed to be successful and would not find them from within. During 2013 and 2014, an experienced team with a track record in delivering transformational change was recruited from both New Zealand and overseas. 63 As well as bringing the right resources on board, having the right partners has been critical. Using a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solution, provided by FAST Enterprises LLC (FAST), was challenging for an organisation used to designing and building its own systems. It has proved to be a key decision. Officials have recently seen the significant improvements planned by FAST for online services and inform me that if Inland Revenue had to build these improvements themselves, the cost would be considerably higher. Inland Revenue is setting aside some of its baseline funding, which has been adjusted for the department’s new COTS and as-a-service environment, for future upgrades to START. 64 Co-existence, running old and new systems in parallel, has been among the most complex challenges faced by Inland Revenue. In an innovative approach, the department partnered with Accenture to access a global network of the critical coding resources required to make changes to heritage systems. This has enabled Inland Revenue to minimise the impacts of co-existence on customers and stakeholders as much as possible. 10 IN CONFIDENCE 65 I am assured by officials that Inland Revenue’s subject-matter experts are working closely with FAST and Accenture to ensure that skills and knowledge are transferred and become business-as-usual for the department. 66 Actively engaging with customers and stakeholders, and involving them in design and testing, has helped Inland Revenue to put customer needs at the centre of its thinking. Lessons-learned exercises after each release have informed Inland Revenue’s approach to subsequent releases. For example, tax agents were brought into Inland Revenue after the first release, when the department realised it did not have a full appreciation of how agents actually worked in practice. By being open and prepared to listen, Inland Revenue has been able to deal with the inevitable problems that do occur. Additional support has been provided after the go-live of each release, to enable Inland Revenue to respond quickly to any issues. 67 The strong programme disciplines put in place from the outset have ensured that transformation has remained on schedule and that scope creep has been avoided. They have enabled Inland Revenue to and ensure that the benefits of transformation are enduring. Non-priority projects, even some that were worthwhile and sensible, have been stopped so that Inland Revenue’s people can focus on the main effort. 68 Governance arrangements are regularly reviewed and independent, external members on Inland Revenue’s governance bodies challenge the department’s thinking. Regular KPMG and Gateway reviews provide the Minister of Finance and me with assurance that transformation is being well managed. Next steps 69 The next steps are to: 69.1 continue preparations for the implementation of Release 4 in April 2020; 69.2 support the passage of the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans and Remedial Matters) Bill which contains key transformation proposals; 69.3 continue with the on-going programme of independent quality assurance; and 69.4 provide a further progress update to Cabinet by July 2020.

Proactive Release 77 I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, and associated minutes in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Central agencies’ comment (The Treasury, State Services Commission and Government Chief Digital Officer) 78 The central agencies were consulted on this update. The Treasury’s delivery confidence assessment of the Inland Revenue Business Transformation programme has moved from Amber to Amber/Green. Central agencies acknowledge Inland Revenue’s landmark achievement in successfully implementing Release 3, the biggest change to the revenue system since the introduction of FIRST in the early 1990s. The programme has significant work remaining in order to achieve Releases 4 and 5 and manage the continued risk that co-existence between the old and new systems creates. The central agencies continue to have good visibility of the delivery of the programme and continue to be well informed by Inland Revenue of the risks as they arise and the mitigations that are implemented. 79 The Treasury agrees with Inland Revenue’s assessment that although Transformation is tracking well, it remains an inherently high-risk programme until completion in 2021, and that momentum must be maintained to ensure that Inland Revenue fully migrates off its heritage systems and processes. Discussions with external assurance providers suggest that delivering of Business Transformation continues to require Inland Revenue to operate close to the edge of its capacity and capability. The Treasury observes that because Ministers are increasingly seeing Inland Revenue as a ‘centre of excellence’ for managing IT-based change, that it may seem appealing to them to use Inland Revenue as a provider of IT services to other parts of central or local government. We suggest Ministers take a conservative approach to adding any new expectations to Inland Revenue during this time, and that any future change to the function of the department and the expectations for the Commissioner are worked through in consultation with the State Services Commission. 80 The central agencies note that Inland Revenue have been successful in realising administrative savings above target to date. The size of these savings are forecast to increase substantially over the 2020/21 and 2021/22 fiscal years and coincide with the end of time-limited compliance funding. The challenge remains to ensure these savings 12 IN CONFIDENCE are sustainably realised. Information provided by Inland Revenue of glide-path targets is useful to track this progress. 81 The central agencies continue to work with Inland Revenue to test Crown revenue outcomes – the business case targets $2.880 billion cumulative additional Crown revenue by 2023/24, achieved through better compliance. There are significant technical difficulties in tracking this revenue impact, and the previously agreed approach for measuring revenue impact is case studies. To date, these case studies have provided limited insight into likely revenue impacts. Gaining a clearer picture of revenue impacts is important both for tracking progress against the business case, and ensuring that the changes Inland Revenue is making to realise administrative savings are sustainable and will not put revenue at risk. 82 Central agencies are pleased that Inland Revenue is sharing some of its ‘lessons learned’ from Business Transformation within the public sector. This contributes to wider learnings in the government investment management system. The Treasury is working with Inland Revenue on further sharing of these lessons with senior public sector leaders. Ministers may wish to check what plans their own agencies have to consider adoption of the common back office process model developed by Inland Revenue. Recommendations I recommend that the Committee: 1 note that Inland Revenue is on track to migrate KiwiSaver and Student Loans to new systems and processes in April 2020; 2 note that further changes will be made to Inland Revenue’s organisation design during 2019/20 and 2020/21; 3 note that for 2018/19, Inland Revenue has achieved nine out of the ten indicators agreed as the basis for tracking achievement of the investment objectives for transformation; 4 5 note that the next progress update will be provided to Cabinet by July 2020. Aut horised for lodgement Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Revenue Withheld under Section 9(2)(f)(iv) of 18(c)(i) of the Official Information Act 1982.
1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Business Committee Ex gratia payments to KiwiSaver members Proposal 1 I propose that the Cabinet Business Committee approve Inland Revenue providing ex gratia payments of up to $10 million to a number of KiwiSaver members. The ex gratia payments would compensate members impacted by delays in passing on contributions to scheme providers since 17 April 2020. The majority of contributions held were employer contributions. While Inland Revenue resolved the majority of these instances by 31 May 2020, a number of contributions were further delayed while issues were resolved. Using a generic formula, Inland Revenue proposes to compensate this group of KiwiSaver customers for the delay in transferring contributions to their investment provider by making ex gratia payments from within its existing appropriations. Cabinet approval is required for ex gratia payments of more than $75,000. Background 2 On 17 April 2020, KiwiSaver moved to new systems and processes as part of the implementation of Release 4 of Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme. 3 As a result, processing times for KiwiSaver are now much faster. For example, in October 2020, Inland Revenue passed on approximately 92% of contributions within two working days. Prior to KiwiSaver moving to Inland Revenue’s new system, START 1 , it could take up to three months to transfer contributions to scheme providers as Inland Revenue had to wait until employers had sent the funds. Processing of the annual government contribution is also much faster. In the first 9 working days of July 2020, more than $840 million had been transferred compared with $285 million at the same time in 2019. 4 KiwiSaver members have better information about their contributions and can do more online for themselves. Anomalies, such as deductions not being received from an employer, can now be identified more easily. 5 Inland Revenue’s primary focus following Release 4 go-live was on ensuring that the correct KiwiSaver contribution amounts continued to flow through to members’ accounts with their scheme providers. Since 17 April, the vast majority of employer and member contributions, representing a total value of approximately $3.4 billion, have been passed on quickly to scheme providers. 6 There are a number of cases where there have been significant delays in passing on contributions to scheme providers resulting from transitional issues. 7 During cut over for Release 4, when Inland Revenue was moving data between its old and new systems, some issues with the data in the legacy systems were encountered. Detailed analysis identified that these issues were not related to individual scheme members’ accounts. Inland Revenue made the call to move forward with the release and quarantined these issues for follow 1 START stands for simplified tax and revenue technology and is the name Inland Revenue has chosen for the GenTax software provided by FAST Enterprises LLC. 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] up after go-live. Transactions that related to these quarantined items were subsequently held up while the issues were resolved. There were a number of complexities involved in moving KiwiSaver to START. 7.1 KiwiSaver was previously managed in two separate systems and data had to be moved out of both these old systems into START. 7.2 Prior to 1 April 2020, Inland Revenue had to wait until funds had been received from employers before employer contributions could be passed on to scheme providers. From 1 April 2020, Cabinet agreed to allow Inland Revenue to pass on employer contributions as soon as an employer advises the amount, i.e. before the funds are received (CAB-19- MIN-0109 refers). This has led to some transitional issues as employer contributions have to be treated differently depending on what period they relate to. 8 Officials advise me that contributions held for review after Release 4 go-live in April and passed to scheme providers up until 31 May 2020 should be considered as having been sent in a reasonable time. Approximately 85% of the held contributions were passed on by 31 May 2020. Inland Revenue has now released the majority of the remaining 15% of contributions to scheme providers. There are still a small number of contributions Inland Revenue is working through. Many of the things that have caused delays are transitional and Inland Revenue expects to continue to improve the average speed with which contributions are passed on. 9 Members do receive interest on contributions Inland Revenue holds at a rate set by legislation. The interest rate payable since 8 May 2020 has been 0%. I believe it is appropriate that Inland Revenue compensates the KiwiSaver members that have had contributions held by the department for a significant period of time by making ex gratia payments to them. The investment market has performed well during the period these contributions have been held by the department. 10 Inland Revenue estimates the total amount of compensation to be paid to affected members is up to $10 million. Although up to 750,000 members are estimated to be affected, the majority of compensation amounts would be relatively small. Current estimates indicate that 95% of the affected members would receive compensation of less than $50. Calculation of payments 11 Compensation would apply to the contributions held for review after go-live of new systems and processes for KiwiSaver on 17 April 2020 and sent to scheme providers after 31 May 2020. 12 Inland Revenue would use a generic formula to calculate ex gratia payments to individual members, rather than considering each individual members’ circumstances. Given the number of members involved, a case-by-case approach would be complex and involve considerable work not only for Inland Revenue but also for scheme providers. 13 The formula assumes KiwiSaver members have invested in a growth fund. This would result in members, on average, being slightly overcompensated but it would vary from member to member. Inland Revenue has averaged the percentage change in unit price figures for growth funds from the default KiwiSaver scheme providers. 2 The unit prices used to calculate the compensation to be paid to members are for the last working days of the months between May to October 2020 and for 12 November 2020, when the majority of the held contributions were passed on. 2 Eight out of nine default KiwiSaver scheme providers use unit pricing to calculate investment returns. One does not use unit pricing as its base methodology for calculating investment returns. 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 14 In my view, this is a pragmatic and fair approach. It means that Inland Revenue would make ex gratia payments of up to $10 million to affected KiwiSaver members from its existing appropriations. These payments would be made as soon as possible following Cabinet’s approval and would be made on a pro rata basis to reflect the date members’ contributions were passed on. 15 I do not see any ongoing fiscal risk, as Inland Revenue’s new systems and processes will ensure members’ future KiwiSaver contributions are passed on to scheme providers in a timely manner. 16 Cabinet Office Circular CO 18 (2) requires ex gratia payments of more than $75,000 to be approved by Cabinet. 17 Inland Revenue would fund the payments from the existing appropriation for business transformation. There would be no impact on the delivery of the transformation programme. Consultation 18 Inland Revenue has consulted with the Treasury on this proposal. Treasury has advised that a new appropriation is required to make these payments as they are out of scope of existing Vote Revenue appropriations. Financial Implications 19 The proposals in this paper have no financial implications. Human Rights 20 The proposals in this paper have no human rights implications. Legislative Implications 21 The proposals in this paper do not require any changes to legislation. Regulatory Impact Analysis 22 The proposals in this paper do not require a Regulatory Impact Statement. Gender Implications 23 The proposals in this paper have no gender implications. Disability Perspective 24 The proposals in this paper have no implications for people with disabilities. Proactive Release 25 I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, and associated minutes, within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Recommendations I recommend that the Committee: 1 note that some KiwiSaver contributions have been held by Inland Revenue since 17 April 2020; 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 2 note that the delays in passing on contributions have been caused by transitional issues resulting from the move of KiwiSaver to new systems and processes on 17 April 2020; 3 note that departmental Chief Executives require authority from Cabinet to incur expenditure on ex gratia payments that are in excess of $75,000 (Cabinet Office Circular CO (18) 2 refers); 4 authorise the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to make ex gratia payments of up to $10 million to compensate those affected KiwiSaver members whose contributions were passed on to scheme providers after 31 May 2020; 5 note that Inland Revenue will use a generic formula for estimating lost investment returns for contributions passed on after 31 May 2020; 6 note Treasury advice that the proposed ex gratia payments are out of scope of existing Vote Revenue appropriations and that a new appropriation needs to be set up for this purpose; 7 agree to establish the following new appropriation: Vote Appropriation Minister Title Type Scope Revenue Minister of Revenue KiwiSaver ex gratia payments Non-departmental other expenses This appropriation is limited to ex gratia payments made to customers arising from delays in transferring KiwiSaver contributions held by Inland Revenue to scheme providers. 8 note that Inland Revenue is proposing to fund the ex-gratia payments from operating efficiencies in the ‘Transformation Multi-Year Appropriation’ and that the proposed fiscally neutral funding transfer to the ‘KiwiSaver ex-gratia payments appropriation’ will not impact on the delivery of the business transformation programme; 9 approve the following fiscally neutral adjustments to appropriations: $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 & Outyears Departmental other expenses: Transformation MYA (10.000) - - - - Non-departmental other expenses: KiwiSaver ex-gratia payments 10.000 - - - - 10 agree that the proposed change to appropriations for 2020/21 above be included in the 2020/21 Supplementary Estimates and that, in the interim, the changes be met from Imprest Supply; 11 note that the amount transferred to the 'KiwiSaver ex gratia payments' appropriation established in recommendation 9 above is an estimate and that Inland Revenue would seek approval from the Ministers of Finance and Revenue to return any unused funds to the ‘Transformation Multi- Year Appropriation’ once affected KiwiSaver members have been compensated.

Calculating a drop in revenue
=============================

Revenue refers to income generating activity by a business or organisation. 

For a cashflow business, such as a restaurant, this is likely to be the daily takings. For a business that invoices clients, this will be the activities the business carries out and then bills clients for. 

Income that is received passively - such as interest and dividends, and all forms of residential and commercial rent - is excluded as revenue. 

Calculating affected revenue due to a COVID-19 circumstance 
------------------------------------------------------------

Businesses and organisations needed to measure their revenue over a continuous 7-day period (7 days in a row) in the [affected revenue period](/api/glossary/item?id={582E59C5-1679-4F25-B3C4-AA702E455B8D})
 where the business or organisation had a drop in revenue due to 1 or more [COVID-19 circumstances](/api/glossary/item?id={C306A832-B894-487C-90F6-F46B93F1F835})
. 

The affected revenue periods were:

*   First CSP – 16 February 2022 to 4 April 2022.
*   Second CSP – 7 March 2022 to 4 April 2022.
*   Third CSP – 21 March 2022 to 4 April 2022.

After working out the revenue for the continuous 7-day period in an affected revenue period, it was compared against a typical 7-day revenue period in the 6 weeks between 5 January 2022 and 15 February 2022.  Alternatively, a typical 7-day comparison period between 5 January 2021 and 15 February 2021 could have been used. 

The affected revenue period and the [comparison period](/api/glossary/item?id={FFF9C949-BF90-4635-89A7-FA1D86BD49E2})
 must be calculated based on what has happened, not a forecast of what might happen. 

If the revenue drop calculated was 40% or more, a business may have been eligible for CSP. Standard accounting principles for income recognition applied. 

A record of your calculations must be kept so you can give it to us if we ask to see it. Records include: 

*   dates of the affected revenue period and comparison period 
*   amount of revenue earned in each period 
*   how the drop in revenue has been calculated 
*   how the COVID-19 circumstances affected the revenue. 

What is typical revenue 
------------------------

This is revenue that a business has earned during a continuous 7-day period that is considered to be normal or representative of the businesses' revenue. GST registered businesses used GST exclusive figures in their calculations.

If revenue is earned unevenly, then taking an average of the revenue in the comparison period and then selecting the 7-day period that is closest to the average was acceptable. 

Some businesses may have been closed during the 2022 comparator period and also not operating at the time of the 2021 comparator period. These businesses were not eligible for the CSP, unless they were businesses or organisations with highly seasonal revenue (see below). 

Seasonal businesses and organisations 
--------------------------------------

Businesses or organisations with highly seasonal revenue must have met the drop in revenue test set out above. However, they may select a 7-day comparison period which is before 5 January 2022 and which may be from a past year, which reflects their typical revenue.

Businesses acquired after 15 February and before 17 January 2022
----------------------------------------------------------------

If a business was acquired after 15 February 2021 but before 17 January 2022 the applicant could use the revenue that the business earned during a typical 7-day period in the alternative comparison period between 5 January 2021 and 15 February 2021 as long as the same sort of business was being run by the previous owner. The revenue earned by the business for the alternative comparator period could be the previous or new owners - depending on when the new owner started running the business.

[Recently acquired businesses](/covid-19/business-and-organisations/covid-19-support-payment/eligibility-for-the-csp/recently-acquired-businesses)

Example: Sparkle Electrical - no revenue drop

Sparkle Electrical issued no invoices during the Red setting of the COVID-19 Protection Framework as they chose not to trade. Most of their clients are not affected by the Red setting, and over this period, their billable hours are 90% of the typical week’s revenue from the 6 weeks before New Zealand moved to Phase 2 of the Omicron response on 15 February 2022.  Sparkle Electrical is not eligible for the CSP as it has not experienced a 40% reduction in its income generating activity due to one or more COVID-19 circumstances. 

Example: NZ Food Limited - Capacity restrictions (CPF)

NZ Food Limited operates a restaurant in Auckland CBD that can host up to 200 people at any given time. Due to NZ being in the Red setting of the COVID-19 Protection Framework (traffic light system), the restaurant has had to limit the number of customers it can host to 100 people (including children). Additionally, due to the increase in COVID-19 cases within the NZ community, customers are choosing to stay home and order take-out instead. NZ Food Limited has made several attempts to minimise its drop in revenue by offering various discounts for dining in, juggled staff rosters to deal with quiet periods, offering takeaway options.  Notwithstanding the steps taken to minimise the revenue drop, the restaurant has suffered a drop in revenue of 50% compared to the week before NZ entered into Phase 2 of the Omicron response being 15 February 2022 (being a typical week).  NZ Food Limited may be eligible for the CSP as their drop in revenue is more than 40% and is a result of 1 or more of the COVID-19 circumstances.  

Example: Scrumptious Cooking School - Revenue spreading and use of passes

The Scrumptious Cooking School runs 3 12-week cooking classes per year. These start in February, May, and October. Fees are paid before each class starts. Even though there was a change in settings from Orange to Red in the COVID Protection Framework in January, the classes were able to run by using COVID-19 Vaccine Certificates, no fees were refunded and there were no economic impacts due to Omicron experienced by the school. The income for the class starting in February is spread across February, March and April. This means there is no reduction in revenue in February, March or April, and they are not eligible for the CSP.

Calculating depreciation rates for assets with high residual values
===================================================================

2006 correction to the rules covering the method for calculating depreciation rates on assets that have a residual value of more that 13.5 percent of cost.

##### Section EE 25E of the Income Tax Act 2004

The rules covering the method for calculating depreciation rates on assets that have a residual value of more that 13.5 percent of cost have been corrected.

The word "before" had been inserted in the legislation rather than the term "on or after". The correction means that section EE 25E applies to plant and equipment acquired on or after 1 April 2005 and buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005. The rules apply for the 2005-06 and later income years.

Most people file their GST return in myIR which does the calculations for you. If you file a paper return the form tells you what calculations to make.

Regardless of how you file you need to work out your total:

*   sales and income
*   zero-rated supplies
*   debit adjustments
*   purchases and expenses
*   credit adjustments

### Sales and income

The way you work out your total sales and income depends on the [accounting basis](/api/glossary/item?id={5832934C-6FA4-4D0B-B892-7AB87138EE23})
 you use.

| You use the invoice or hybrid basis | You use the payments basis |
| --- | --- |
| In your GST return for the period include:<br><br>*   amounts you’ve notified customers to pay by invoice, even if you have not been paid yet<br>*   the full sale price amount if customers have paid any amount before you’ve invoiced them. | In your GST return for the period include:<br><br>*   amounts you've been paid by customers. |

### Zero-rated supplies

Add up all your zero-rated supplies for the [taxable period](/api/glossary/item?id={9E49B232-A857-40A5-867E-B65DDCD67E11})

 you use.

| You use the invoice basis | You use the payments or hybrid basis |
| --- | --- |
| In your GST return for the period include:<br><br>*   amounts you’ve paid to or been invoiced by suppliers if you hold taxable supply information, even if you have not paid the full amount yet. | In your GST return for the period include:<br><br>*   amounts you've paid to suppliers if you hold taxable supply information. |

Calling 'time' on cheques
=========================

**10 September 2019**

Inland Revenue and the Accident Compensation Corporation are calling ‘time’ on cheques.

From March next year, IR and ACC will no longer accept payments by cheque from customers who are able to use alternative payment options.

IR received more than 430,000 cheques last financial year, the largest number received by any public sector agency. ACC received approximately 25,000 cheques from business customers.  

Those numbers have been dropping by around 20 per cent annually and at the end of the financial year (June 2019) only around 5% of payments received by both IR and ACC were by cheque.

Inland Revenue Deputy Commissioner Sharon Thompson says New Zealanders are already embracing the digital world and IR wants to do everything it can to help customers switch seamlessly to cheque alternatives.

“Cheques are part of a paper-based world and don’t mesh with the increasingly digital world we now operate in. The number of cheques being used is spiralling down and will continue to trend that way. Electronic payments are simpler, easier and safer,” Sharon Thompson says.

“IR already has a number of alternative ways for people to pay their tax bill. We want to help as many as possible shift to those before the technology used to process cheques comes to the end of its working life next year.

“From 1 March 2020, Inland Revenue won’t process any cheques if customers have an alternative payment option available.  We’re also not accepting post-dated cheques dated 1 March or later. There’s nearly six months before that happens so if there are any questions or concerns, our customers can contact us or their bank.”

Both organisations will be supporting customers to transition to alternative payment methods, whether that be face to face, over the phone or with written material. 

ACC Head of Business Customer Service Delivery Phil Riley says ACC and IR have both agreed that business customers are better serviced using electronic payments.

“Electronic payments are more efficient and secure, with only a small percentage of customers still choosing to make their payments by cheque. Our digital portal MyACC for Business makes it really easy for business customers to set up and manage their payments.”

“We’ll be working closely with our affected customers to give them as much support as we can to make this change.”

**Inland Revenue - Options for payment:**

• Electronic via internet banking or direct debit in MyIR. Paying this way minimises delays and includes a formal notification of the date and time the payment was made to Inland Revenue.

• Customers can make payment by debit/credit card over the phone, through the unauthenticated payment page on the Inland Revenue website, and through myIR.

• Taxpayers can also set up direct debits in myIR.

• Cash or eftpos are still payment options but only at Westpac branches. They’re not accepted at Inland Revenue offices.

**Accident Compensation Corporation – Options for payment:**

• Electronic payment via internet banking.

• Direct debit payments and monthly instalments can be set up via MyACC for Business.

• Payment by debit/credit card over the phone, through the unauthenticated payment page on the ACC website, and through MyACC for Business.

• Cash or Eftpos are still payment options but only at Westpac branches. They’re not accepted at ACC offices.

Te whakakore i tō tautoko tamariki Cancel your child support
============================================================

If you're a [receiving carer](/api/glossary/item?id={ECAE3AEF-DAB7-4A41-BB04-B4E94EFA1B55})
 and you do not want to receive child support anymore, you can cancel it.

If there is recognised care in place for a child, all carers must agree to cancel.

[Sharing care of a child or children](/child-support/eligibility/sharing-care)

The easiest way to cancel is in myIR. You can cancel for an individual child or for a child support group, which is for all the children in your care that a liable parent pays you for. You may have more than 1 child support group.

![](/-/media/project/ir/home/inland-revenue-icons/icon-task.svg?iar=0&modified=20210930032934&hash=9C863F98721D0A79B5EC9B064966AB46)

*   the date you want child support to stop.

In myIR, select 'More...' on the Child support - Receiving carer panel
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[Taxation (Annual Rates, Trans-Tasman Savings Portability, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Act 2010](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-annual-rates-trans-tasman-savings-portability-kiwisaver-and-remedial-matters-act-2010 "Taxation (Annual Rates, Trans-Tasman Savings Portability, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Act 2010")

Cancellation of BETA debit balances relating to conduit relief
==============================================================

2010 Act restricts the use of debit balances in branch equivalent tax accounts to the extent that those balances arose from conduit tax relief.

The recently enacted Taxation (Annual Rates, Trans-Tasman Savings Portability, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 restricts the use of debit balances in branch equivalent tax accounts to the extent that those balances arose from conduit tax relief. A taxpayer may elect to use debit balances to satisfy income tax liabilities that relate to attributed CFC income. However, the Act restricts use to cases in which the attributed CFC income arose in an income year beginning before 1 July 2009 and there is a timely election.

### Background

#### Old international tax rules (BETA and conduit mechanisms)

Under the old international tax rules (replaced in the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009), a New Zealand taxpayer with an interest in a controlled foreign company was subject to two potential taxing events: firstly, when income was earned by the foreign company (tax on attribution); and secondly, when that income was repatriated to New Zealand by way of a dividend (tax on dividends). The purpose of the branch equivalent tax account (BETA) mechanism was to relieve this double taxation and ensure that, overall, a single layer of New Zealand tax was imposed on that income.

Normally a New Zealand company paid tax on attribution before dividends were paid. In this case, the company received BETA credits that it could use to offset subsequent tax on dividends. In the rarer event that dividends were paid before tax on attribution, say because of an interim dividend, the company received BETA debits which it could use to reduce the subsequent tax on attribution.

The conduit tax relief regime sat alongside the rules for BETAs. Under the conduit regime, New Zealand companies with non-resident shareholders were able to claim "conduit relief" from tax on controlled foreign company income. This meant that, to the extent of the non-resident shareholding, no tax was payable on either attribution or on dividends. That is, not only was there no double taxation, but (to the extent of the non-resident shareholding) no taxation at all.

However, BETA debits and credits were still generated in respect of income and dividends that had been conduit-relieved - as if tax had been paid. Accordingly, if a dividend was paid before the income was attributed, conduit tax relief would be provided on the dividend and a BETA debit would also be created. The BETA debit would then be used to relieve any tax when the income was attributed. This was done to avoid double counting of the amount of conduit relief (recorded as conduit credits). Such double counting of conduit credits would have been unfair to taxpayers if the number of New Zealand shareholders increased and a repayment of a portion of the conduit relief was required.

#### Transition to new international tax rules

The transition to the new international tax rules required decisions about how to dismantle the various memorandum accounts, including the BETA credit and debit accounts and the conduit credit accounts.

In the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009, the government introduced changes to the international tax rules that made BETA accounts for companies unnecessary in respect of foreign income that was earned under the new rules. In general, foreign dividends are now not taxable and so double taxation no longer occurs.

However, the government recognised there was a situation in which some double taxation could still occur if:

*   repatriated funds had been subject to tax on dividends prior to the changes; and
*   the income from which the funds were repatriated was subject to tax on attribution after the changes.

For this reason, the government announced that it would not cancel BETA debit balances for a period of two years.

#### Cancellation of some debit balances

It is apparent that the relief provided by non-cancellation of BETA debit balances is only required if tax was paid on the dividend that generated the BETA debits. If conduit tax relief was used to reduce or eliminate the tax liability, there is no possibility of double taxation and it is not appropriate to retain the BETA debits.

The Taxation (Annual Rates, Trans-Tasman Savings Portability, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 therefore restricts the use of BETA debit balances to the extent that they arose from conduit tax relief on foreign dividends.

### Key features

New sections OE 11B and OP 104B restrict the use of BETA debit balances that arise from conduit tax relief on foreign dividends.

The restriction is achieved by not allowing the relevant part of a BETA debit balance to be used to relieve tax on income attributed under the _new_ international tax rules.

This approach allows taxpayers to continue, for a period of up to one income year, to use their BETA debit balances - whether or not resulting from the use of conduit tax relief - to offset tax that arose under the _old_ international tax rules. The period of up to one income year is subject to restrictions to prevent manipulation of the new provision (essentially, to ensure the right amount of debits arising from both conduit-relieved and non-conduit-relieved dividends are used against pre-reform tax liabilities).

In contrast, outright cancellation of the relevant part of a BETA debit balance on entry into the new international tax rules would have resulted in simpler legislation, but would not have allowed continued use of debit balances against pre-reform tax liabilities. It was for this reason that outright cancellation was not pursued as an option.

### Detailed analysis

#### Structure of cancellation rules (sections OE 11B and OP 104B)

If a company has a BETA debit balance on entry into the new international tax rules or at a later date, it must apply the restriction on use of BETA debit balances.

To apply the restriction, the company firstly identifies the individual BETA debits that make up the beta debit balance at a particular time. This is done with the aid of an ordering rule (subsection (3)).

Then, to the extent that the identified debits arose from the use of conduit tax relief to reduce an FDP (foreign dividend withholding payment) liability, they form part of the "CTR-relief amount" at that time (paragraph (1)(b)).

In general, the CTR-relief amount is not able to be applied to reduce tax on attributed foreign income. However, there is an exception (subsection (2)). For a defined period, the CTR-relief amount may be applied to reduce tax on attributed foreign income that arose _under the old international tax rules_. The exception is subject to limitations to prevent manipulation.

#### Rules for ordinary BETA accounts (section OE 11B)

_Definition of affected year (subsection OE 11B(1))_  
An "affected year" is an income year in which the taxpayer applies the new international tax rules. The first "affected year" is the first income year beginning on or after 1 July 2009 (see the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009).

_Definition of CTR-relief amount (subsection OE 11B(1))_  
Paragraph (b) defines the "CTR-relief amount". At any particular time, this amount is a portion of a debit balance that exists in the BETA account of a BETA company.

The CTR-relief amount is determined by identifying the BETA debits that have arisen to create the debit balance. This is determined with the aid of an ordering rule (see the explanation of subsection (3) below).

Once the BETA debits that created the debit balance have been identified, they are classified. To the extent that each debit arose from a conduit-relieved liability to pay FDP on a foreign dividend, it is part of the CTR-relief amount. Conversely, to the extent that each debit did not arise from a conduit-relieved liability, it is not part of the CTR-relief amount. Sections OE 12 and RG 7 (or the corresponding sections in the Income Tax Act 2004) are the sections that would have applied in the case of such a conduit-relieved liability. Note that sections OE 12 and RG 7 have since been repealed.

Example 1: Calculating the CTR-relief amount

NZCo, a standard balance date company which has always been 70% New Zealand owned, received foreign dividends on 30 September 2007, 21 May 2008 and 30 September 2009. FDP was payable on these dividends (liabilities of $1.2 million, $1.5 million and $0.7 million respectively). NZCo claimed conduit tax relief to the extent it was able and paid the rest of the FDP at the time dividends were received. NZCo had tax liabilities for attributed CFC income of $1.8 million in the 2007-08 income year, $0.5 million in the 2008-09 income year and $0.2 million in the 2009-10 income year. The company used all available debit balances to relieve tax on attributed foreign income. No foreign tax credits were available because no foreign tax was paid.

_BETA account_

| Date | Event | Credit | Debit | Balance | Debit number |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1/4/07 |     |     |     | 0   |     |
| 30/9/07 | Dividend |     | 1.2m | \-1.2m | 1   |
| 21/5/08 | Dividend |     | 1.5m | \-2.7m | 2   |
| 30/3/09 | File tax return (attr. income) | 1.8m |     | \-0.9m |     |
| 30/9/09 | Dividend |     | 0.7m | \-1.6m | 3   |
| 28/3/10 | File tax return (attr. income) | 0.5m |     | \-1.1m |     |
| 1/4/10 | ENTRY INTO NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX RULES |     |     |     |     |
| 30/3/11 | File tax return (attr. income) | 0.2m |     | \-0.9m |     |

On 1 April 2010, the debit balance included $0.4 million of debit number 2, being the remainder after application of BETA credits for use of BETA debit balances. The debit balance also includes $0.7 million of debit number 3. In each case, 30% of the debit arose from the application of conduit tax relief. Therefore, the CTR-relief amount on 1 April 2010 is $0.33 million (being 0.4 x 30% + 0.7 x 30%). On 31 March 2011, following another BETA credit, the CTR-relief amount is $0.27 million (0.2 x 30% + 0.7 x 30%).

_Restrictions on use of CTR-relief amount (subsection OE 11B(2))_.  
A BETA company has historically been able to make an election to use all or part of a BETA debit balance to satisfy a liability for tax on attributed foreign income (subsection OE 7(3)).

Section OE 11B(2) restricts this election. The CTR-relief amount may not be used to satisfy a liability except in strictly defined circumstances, effectively reducing the available debit balance in all other cases to:

*   total debit balance \- CTR\-relief amount

More than "total debit balance \- CTR-relief amount" may be used to satisfy a liability only if four conditions are met.

*   The first condition is that all the conditions of section OE 7 are satisfied (this is implicit).
*   The second condition is that the liability relates to attributed CFC income that arose under the old international tax rules. More precisely, the liability must relate to attributed CFC income that is allocated to an income year that begins before the first affected year (as defined in subsection (1)). Allocation of attributed CFC income to a particular year is determined according to the existing rules in subpart BD.
*   The third condition is that when the election is made under OE 7, it must be made before any election under section OE 7 that is in respect of _post_\-reform CFC income. More precisely, suppose that an election is made to use part of a BETA debit balance to offset the tax liability on attributed CFC income that is allocated to the first affected year, or to a later income year. Then, at or after the time of that election, it is not possible to make an election to use the CTR-relief amount.
*   The fourth condition is that the election made under OE 7 must be made before the end of the first affected year.

The third and fourth conditions prevent manipulation of the rule. This is in response to a concern that by making elections out of order, a company could manipulate the CTR-relief amount. In normal circumstances (filing occurring on time, elections made at time of filing) these conditions are unlikely to be an obstacle.

Example 2: Use of the CTR-relief amount (all conditions met)

BETA account from Example 1.

| Date | Event | Credit | Debit | Balance | Debit number |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1/4/07 |     |     |     | 0   |     |
| 30/9/07 | Dividend |     | 1.2m | \-1.2m | 1   |
| 21/5/08 | Dividend |     | 1.5m | \-2.7m | 2   |
| 30/3/09 | File tax return (attr. income) | 1.8m |     | \-0.9m |     |
| 30/9/09 | Dividend |     | 0.7m | \-1.6m | 3   |
| 28/3/10 | File tax return (attr. income) | 0.5m |     | \-1.1m |     |
| 1/4/10 | ENTRY INTO NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX RULES |     |     |     |     |
| 30/3/11 | File tax return (attr. income) | 0.2m |     | \-0.9m |     |

The CTR-relief amount on 29/3/11 is $0.33m and the total debit balance is $1.1m. The company makes an election on 30/3/11 to use 0.2m of its BETA debit balance to offset the tax liability on attributed CFC income that it has allocated to the 2009-10 income year. The election is in respect of income that arose under the old international tax rules and is made before any election that is in respect of post-reform income. The election is also made just before the end of the first affected (2010-11 income) year. All conditions of (2) are met, so the election is permitted. It reduces the total debit balance to $0.9m and the CTR-relief amount to $0.27m.

For the 2010-11 income year, the company has a tax liability relating to attributed CFC income of $0.8m. It files an income tax return for the 2010-11 year on 29/3/12 and makes an election to use available debit balances to offset the $0.8m liability. Because the election is in respect of a tax liability on attributed CFC income that arose in a post-reform year, the condition in paragraph (2)(a) is not met and the company can elect to use only $0.63m of the BETA debit balance, being $0.9m - $0.27m. The remaining balance of $0.27m is no longer able to be used under section OE 7.

| Date | Event | Credit | Debit | Balance | Debit number |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 29/3/12 | File tax return (attr. income) | 0.8m\* |     | \-0.1m |     |

\* Made up of a $0.63m credit under section OE 7 and a $0.17m credit under section OE 6.

The total debit balance is reduced to $0.1m. In terms of the ordering rule, this credit reduces the debits that did _not_ arise from conduit relief first, then other debits. This means that the CTR-relief amount on 30/3/12 is $0.1m, the same as the total debit balance. It will not be possible to use any of the remaining debit balance by making an election under section OE 7.

Example 3: Use of the CTR-relief amount (condition of exception not met)

Recall Example 2, but suppose instead that the tax return for the 2009-10 year is not filed on 30/3/11, and no election is made to use the BETA debit balance to satisfy the 2009-10 attributed CFC income tax liability.

_BETA account_

| Date | Event | Credit | Debit | Balance | Debit number |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1/4/07 |     |     |     | 0   |     |
| 30/9/07 | Dividend |     | 1.2m | \-1.2m | 1   |
| 21/5/08 | Dividend |     | 1.5m | \-2.7m | 2   |
| 30/3/09 | File tax return (attr. income) | 1.8m |     | \-0.9m |     |

| 1/4/10 | ENTRY INTO NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX RULES |     |     |     |     |

As at 30/9/11, the CTR-relief amount is $0.33m.

In the 2010-11 income year, the company has a tax liability for attributed CFC income of $0.8m. It files an income tax return for the 2010-11 year on 1/10/11 and makes an election to use available debit balances to offset the $0.8m liability. Because the election is in respect of a tax liability on attributed CFC income that arose in a post-reform year, the company can elect to use only $0.77m of the BETA debit balance, being $1.1m - $0.33m.

| Date | Event | Credit | Debit | Balance | Debit number |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1/10/11 | File tax return (attr. income) | 0.8m\* |     | \-0.3m |     |

\* Made up of a $0.77m credit under section OE 7 and a $0.03m credit under section OE 6.

The total debit balance is reduced to $0.3m. In terms of the ordering rule, this credit reduces the debits that did not arise from conduit relief first, then other debits. This means that the CTR-relief amount on 30/3/12 is $0.3m, the same as the total debit balance.

On 2/10/11, the company finally files its tax return for the 2009-10 income year and recognises its $0.2 million of attributed foreign income. It is unable to elect to use any of the remaining BETA debit balance because it is made up entirely of the CTR-relief amount, and because:

*   it has already made an election in respect of post-reform income (a day earlier); and
*   it did not make the election before the end of the first affected year.

This violates both conditions in paragraph (2)(b).

| Date | Event | Credit | Debit | Balance | Debit number |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1/10/11 | File tax return (attr. income) | 0.2m\* |     | \-0.1m |     |

\* A credit entirely under section OE 6.

_Ordering rule for BETA accounts (subsection OE 11B(3))_

The ordering rule is used to determine which of the BETA debits in the BETA account make up an overall debit balance.

The purposes of the rule are firstly to ensure that it is possible to identify the part of the overall debit balance that results from the application of conduit tax relief, and secondly to ensure that credits relating to post-reform income cancel out debits that have _not_ arisen from conduit tax relief before other debits.

It is possible that a single debit could arise that results:

*   partly from the application of section RG 7 to reduce the required payment of FDP; and
*   partly from the actual payment of FDP, including a payment made under section RG 6 by reducing a loss.

Paragraph (a) requires that, for the purposes of applying the ordering rule, such a debit be split in two. One debit is equal to the reduction of FDP under section RG 7. The other is equal to the amount of actual FDP payment.

Paragraphs (b) and (c) then treat credits as cancelling out debits in two ways, depending on the type of credit.

1.  For a BETA credit that arises before the first affected year, paragraph (b) requires in almost all cases that the credit reduces BETA debits in the order in which the debits arise. When two debits arise at the same time and are not reduced to nil, they are reduced proportionately.  
      
    The paragraph (b) treatment also applies to a credit that arises on or after the first day of the first affected year, if:
    
    *   the credit arises as a result of an election under section OE 7; and
    *   the election is one that qualifies for the exception in subsection (2).
    
      
    The paragraph (b) treatment does _not_ apply to a credit that arises before the first affected year in one circumstance:
    
    *   the credit arose because of an election under section OE 7; and
    *   the election was made before the first affected year; and
    *   the election is in respect of post-reform attributed CFC income (so the condition in paragraph (2)(a) is not met).
    
      
    It is doubtful that the legislation is intended to allow an election giving rise to such a credit. If it were possible for one to arise, is exceedingly unlikely to be seen in practice (if such an election does occur officials are likely to recommend a clarification to ensure it is ineffective). If one did nevertheless arise and was effective, it would use the treatment in paragraph (c).

Example 4: Ordering rule, paragraph (b) treatment debits before affected year

A standard balance date company has the following entries in its BETA account.

_BETA account_

| Date | Event | Credit | Debit | Balance | Debit number |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1/4/07 |     |     |     | 0   |     |
| 30/9/07 | Dividend |     | 1.2m | \-1.2m | 1   |
| 21/5/08 | Dividend |     | 1.5m | \-2.7m | 2   |
| 30/3/09 | File tax return (attr. income) | 1.8m |     | \-0.9m |     |
| 30/9/09 | Dividend |     | 0.7m | \-1.6m | 3   |
| 28/3/10 | File tax return (attr. income) | 0.5m |     | \-1.1m |     |
| 1/4/10 | ENTRY INTO NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX RULES |     |     |     |     |

Each of the dividends was subject to FDP, which was reduced by 30% under section RG 7, with the remaining liability paid immediately.

The debit on 30/9/07 is treated as two debits. One is $0.36m, equal to the reduction under section RG 7, and the other is $0.84m, equal to the FDP actually paid. The debits on 21/5/08 and 30/9/09 are treated similarly.

The BETA account now looks like this.

| Date | Event | Credit | Debit | Balance | Debit number |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1/4/07 |     |     |     | 0   |     |
| 30/9/07 | Dividend (RG 7) |     | 0.36m |     | 1a  |
|     | Dividend (Other) |     | 0.84m | \-1.2m | 1b  |
| 21/5/08 | Dividend (RG 7) |     | 0.45m |     | 2a  |
|     | Dividend (Other) |     | 1.05m | \-2.7m | 2b  |
| 30/3/09 | File tax return (attr. income) | 1.8m |     | \-0.9m |     |
| 30/9/09 | Dividend (RG 7) |     | 0.21m |     | 3a  |
|     | Dividend (Other) |     | 0.49m | \-1.6m | 3b  |
| 28/3/10 | File tax return (attr. income) | 0.5m |     | \-1.1m |     |
| 1/4/10 | ENTRY INTO NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX RULES |     |     |     |     |

The credit on 30/3/09 arises before the first affected year. It is the result of an election under section OE 7 and the election is in respect of pre-reform income (the condition in paragraph (2)(a) is met). Therefore, the credit is treated as described in paragraph (3)(b) and wipes out all debits in chronological order, with pro-rating for debits that arise simultaneously.

The credit is treated as reducing debits (1a) and (1b) to nil, then proportionately reducing debits (2a) and (2b) at the same time, to 0.27m and 0.63m respectively. The CTR-relief amount immediately after the reduction is 0.27m.

The credit on 28/3/10 is also treated as described in paragraph (3)(b). It further reduces debits (2a) and (2b) to 0.12m and 0.28m respectively. The CTR-relief amount immediately after the reduction, taking into account that debits (3a) and (3b) have also arisen, is 0.33m.

The BETA account begins in the same way as Example 4.

| 1/4/10 | ENTRY INTO NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX RULES |     |     |     |     |

At the end of 28/3/10, the ordering rule treated 0.12m of debit (2a) and 0.28m of debit (2b) as remaining. If the income tax return for the 2009-10 year is filed on 30/3/11, and there are credits under OE 7 for 0.2m, the following entry occurs.

| Date | Event | Credit | Debit | Balance | Debit number |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 30/3/11 | File tax return (attr. income) | 0.2m |     | \-0.9m |     |

The credit on 30/3/11 arises after the beginning of the first affected income year, but the credit arises as a result of an election made under section OE 7 that qualifies for the exception in subsection (2). Therefore, the credit is treated as described in paragraph (b). The credit further reduces debit (2a) to 0.06m and debit (2b) to 0.14m. The CTR-relief amount after the credit is 0.27m.

2.  All other BETA credits are treated by paragraph (3)(c) as:

*   firstly, reducing branch equivalent tax debits that did _not_ arise from a reduction of an FDP liability under section RG 7, in the order they arose (with proportionate reduction of debits arising at the same time); and
*   secondly, to the extent that there is any remaining debit balance, reducing branch equivalent tax debits that _did_ arise from a reduction of an FDP liability under section RG 7, in the order those debits arose (again, with proportionate reduction of debits arising at the same time).

| 30/3/11 | File tax return (attr. income) | 0.2m |     | \-0.9m |     |

After 30/3/11, the ordering rule treated the remaining part of debit (2a) as being 0.06m and the remaining part of debit (2b) as being 0.14m.

If the income tax return for the 2010-11 income year was filed on 29/3/12, and there was a tax liability for attributed CFC income of 0.8m, the following entry would occur.

| Date | Event | Credit | Debit | Balance | Debit number |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 30/3/11 | File tax return (attr. income) | 0.8m |     | \-0.1m |     |

The credit arises after the entry into the new international tax rules. It does not arise from an election that qualifies for the exception under subsection (2), because it is in respect of post-reform income.

Therefore, the credit is treated under paragraph (c) as first reducing debits that did not arise from the application of section RG 7, the other debits. The credit wipes out the remaining 0.14m of debit (2b), wipes out debit (3b), wipes out the remaining 0.06m of debit (2a), and wipes out 0.11m of debit (3a), in that order. This leaves 0.1m of debit (3a) remaining. The CTR-relief amount, immediately after the application of the credit, is also 0.1m.

#### Rules for consolidated BETA accounts (section OP 104B)

Section OP 104B applies the same rules to consolidated BETA groups with BETA accounts that section OE 11B applies to BETA companies.

### Application date

The new rules apply for all income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009. This was also the date of application of most provisions in the new international tax rules.

Canterbury tax relief, GST loophole closed
==========================================

**14 August 2018**

Revenue Minister Stuart Nash has confirmed Parliament will extend tax relief for Canterbury businesses affected by issues relating to depreciation following the earthquakes.

Mr Nash has today introduced a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) to the Taxation (Annual Rates 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill currently making its way through Parliament.

“The SOP extends tax relief for Canterbury businesses affected by earthquakes. It extends depreciation roll-over relief for a further five years to the end of the 2023-24 income year. I have been advised that at least 40 Canterbury businesses will be adversely affected if current depreciation provisions are not extended.

“The tax issue arises because an insurance payout on a depreciable asset can attract a tax liability which may cause consequent cash flow problems. We do not want to hinder the city’s recovery or unfairly burden these taxpayers.

“Many Canterbury businesses are experiencing problems outside their control, such as delays with insurance payouts or finding tenants for properties or making progress on building projects. This measure will provide relief to affected businesses and further assist with the Canterbury rebuild.”

Mr Nash says the SOP will also close a loophole which allows non-profit entities to potentially avoid GST on income from asset sales. The change was signalled in an issues paper released on 15 May and will apply from that date.

“The GST treatment of non-profit organisations differs from other entities,” says Mr Nash. “Non-profits can register for GST and claim GST refunds on most of their expenses, even if their turnover is below the $60,000 threshold for GST registration. In many cases non-profit bodies do not pay much GST on their activities.

“In turn, when a GST-registered body sells an asset for which it has claimed GST expenses, it must pay GST on the income from the sale. Inland Revenue has applied this rule since GST was first introduced in 1986.

“Revenue officials have recently been advised of a new legal interpretation of this rule which exposes the tax system to potential losses. For the avoidance of doubt, the SOP introduced today will clarify the GST rules.

“The new interpretation is not consistent with the way the GST rules have been applied and understood in the past. If GST expenses have been claimed by a non-profit body in relation to an asset, GST should apply to the asset when it is sold or there is an equivalent event, such as an insurance pay-out.

“The tax system is based on fairness, and being simple and efficient to operate. The new interpretation threatens those principles and the law change restores certainty," Mr Nash says.

Cap on internal-use software expenditure eligible for a credit (sections LH 9 to LH 13 and LH 17)
=================================================================================================

2007 legislation means a maximum of $3 million of internal software development expenditure will be eligible for a research and development tax credit in any year.

A maximum of $3 million of internal software development expenditure will be eligible for an R&D tax credit in any year. Where businesses undertaking internal software development are under common control, they form an internal software development group and must count their expenditure on such development towards a single $3 million cap.

In exceptional cases, the level of the cap may be increased by the Minister of Finance for an individual or an internal software development group if certain conditions, essentially relating to national interest, are met.

In other jurisdictions, claims for R&D incentives relating to internal software development have been problematic. In Australia, the 125 percent and 175 percent deductibility R&D tax incentives are not available for software developed for solely internal use.

The New Zealand credit allows claims for internal software development, but caps these claims to limit the fiscal risk of abuse.

The cap does not affect a business's entitlement to credits for expenditure that does not relate to internal software development.

**Outline of the sections**

Section LH 9 adjusts the eligible expenditure on internal software development a business can claim a credit for. Subsection (1) determines when a business is eligible for a credit for internal software development and therefore has to apply section LH 9. Subsection (2) determines which other sections to use in adjusting the eligible expenditure.

Section LH 10 adjusts eligible expenditure on internal software development for periods when the business is not a member of an internal software development group.

Section LH 11 adjusts eligible expenditure on internal software development for periods when the business is a member of an internal software development group in which all members have the same income year.

Section LH 12 adjusts eligible expenditure on internal software development for periods when the business is a member of an internal software development group in which not all members have the same income year.

Section LH 13 sets the maximum annual eligible expenditure on internal software development, and allows for Ministerial discretion to increase the maximum in certain circumstances.

Section LH 17 defines the terms "associated internal software developer", "internal software development", "internal software development controller" and "internal software development group".

**Internal software development**

In section LH 17, "internal software development" is defined as a research and development activity of developing software that:

*   does not have as its main purpose sale, rent, license, hire or lease to two or more people who are not associated with the developer or with each other; or
*   has as a purpose the use of the software in the internal administration of the business activities of the developer (such as payroll, bookkeeping or personnel management) or of an associate; or
*   has as a purpose the provision of services to customers of the developer or an associate, if the main reason those customers use the services is to obtain services other than the use of the developer's (or associate's) computer technology or software (such as if they use the services to obtain accounting, consulting or banking services).

There is an exception to the definition - software which is an integral part of an electrical or mechanical device for which the software is developed is not internal software development if the electrical or mechanical device is developed mainly for sale, rent, lease or license to customers as part of the developer's business.

Software developed as a supporting activity, as well software developed as a SIE activity, is subject to the cap.

##### Examples: Definition of internal software development (main purpose of sale)

1.  Company B is undertaking R&D to develop software which it will use internally. The cap applies, because Company B is developing the software with no purpose of sale. Company B may not claim credits in any year for more than $3million of its software development expenditure.
2.  Company C is undertaking R&D to develop software which it will sell to Company D, its parent. The cap applies, because Company C is developing the software with a purpose of sale only to an associate.
3.  Company E is undertaking R&D to develop software which it will use internally. The board members of Company E have also discussed the possibility of sale of the software to other large companies that are not competitors, to recoup some development costs. The board members have instructed a staff member to investigate the potential market for the software and to ensure that the software is easily customised. The developers have been advised that they need to build some flexibility into the design of the software. The cap applies, because Company E has a purpose of sale of the software, but does not have a main purpose of sale of the software. The purpose of sale is ancillary to the purpose of internal use.
4.  Company F is undertaking R&D to develop software which it will sell to utility companies. It has signed contracts with three companies to supply the software and it is actively marketing to other interested parties. F will not be using the software in the internal administration of its business. None of these companies is connected in any way to Company F or to each other. In this case, the cap is unlikely to apply, since the main purpose of development is sale to multiple non-associates.

**Examples: Definition of internal software development (internal use or use to provide services)**

1.  Company G is undertaking R&D to develop software which it will sell to utility companies. It has signed contracts with eight companies to supply the software and it is actively marketing to other interested parties. G's parent company will also be using the software to bill its customers. The cap applies, since there is a purpose of using the software in the internal administration of the business activities of an associate of G.
2.  Company H is undertaking R&D to develop software to integrate a new enterprise resource planning package with its legacy information systems. Once it has done this, it intends to sell an integration package to other companies with the same legacy systems. The cap applies even though there is a purpose of sale of the software, because there is another purpose of using the software in the internal administration of the business.
3.  Company J, a management consultant, is undertaking R&D to develop software that will allow its clients to view all work they have commissioned and all past communications between the client andJ. The software will run on J's web server. A portion of clients' fees implicitly entitles them to authenticated access to a website controlled by the software. The cap applies - clients are using the service mainly to obtain management consulting services they have commissioned, and not mainly to obtain the use of J's computer technology or software.
4.  Company K, a telecommunications company, is undertaking R&D to develop software which will allow its customers to independently configure account settings, and add and remove lines and services. K plans to charge customers a licence fee for using the software. The cap applies because the software will be used by K's customers mainly to obtain a telephone service, and not mainly to obtain the use of K's computer technology or software.
5.  Company L, a bank, is undertaking R&D to develop web-banking software. L plans to charge its customers a licence fee for using the software. The cap applies because the software will be used by L's customers mainly to obtain a banking service, and not mainly to obtain the use of L's computer technology or software.
6.  Company M, a bank, is undertaking R&D to develop a computer game which simulates financial markets. The game is to be played on-line, and will run on the bank's servers. M plans to license access to the game to schools, and will not use the R&D for any other purpose. The cap is not likely to apply in this case, since schools which buy an access licence are doing so primarily to obtain the use of the software and not to obtain another (for example, banking) service.

**Examples: Definition of internal software development (exception when integral to hardware**

1.  Company N develops a stand-alone video recorder for sale. Software is developed to run inside the recorder and remove offensive language or images from incoming video as it is recorded. Assume the software development meets the definition of R&D. The software is written specifically for the video recorder and the video recorder cannot operate without it. The video recorder is developed for sale to the public. The software is integral to the recorder, and the recorder is developed for sale to customers as part of N's business, so the cap does not apply.
2.  Company P develops software to be used for conducting cash transfers between its customers over the internet. P also buys computer hardware and modifies it to prevent physical tampering. The software will run on the tamper-proof hardware, which will be administered by P's customer at its own premises. P intends to mass-produce the modified hardware and sell it to non-competitors who can use it to run their own security-sensitive applications. The software is not integral to the modified hardware and will not be supplied as part of the hardware when sold to external customers. It could also, with minor modifications, be run on other hardware. The software is subject to the cap, because it is not integral to the modified hardware and is not developed with the main purpose of sale.

**Internal software groups (section LH 17)**

To prevent multiplication of caps through the use of subsidiaries or other controlled entities, businesses that undertake internal software development are required to group themselves with other developers under the same control. The expenditure of the entire group counts towards a single cap.

Each business undertaking internal software development (a "developer") has an internal software development controller (a "controller"). The controller is the person, or group of people, who have ultimate control over the developer. In simple cases, the developer and the controller might be the same person. The intent is to ensure that the ultimate controller is identified, rather than any intermediate entity in a chain of controlling entities.

The test for control of an entity by a person is that the person has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity to obtain benefits from its activities. The test is based on the definition of "control" in New Zealand International Accounting Standard 27 (Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements), so if two people would be required to consolidate for financial reporting purposes, it is highly likely that they would be under common control.

When a business has the same controller as other businesses, those businesses are members of an internal software development group (a "group"). A business is a member for as long as its controller does not change, provided that there is at least one other business with the same controller at the same time.

A business can be a member of no group for all or part of the year, one group for all or part of the year, and more than one group over the course of a year.[**19**](#19)

##### Examples: Mechanics of internal software development groups

*   ACo, BCo and CCo have the same internal software development controller (implying they undertake internal software development) and are therefore members of an internal software development group. ACo stops doing internal software development. Therefore, ACo no longer has an internal software development controller, and ACo is not a member of the group any longer. The group continues to exist, however, with BCo and CCo as members.
*   DCo, ECo and FCo have the same internal software development controller and are therefore members of an internal software development group. DCo and ECo stop doing internal software development. Therefore, DCo and ECo no longer have an internal software development controller, and are not members of the group any longer. FCo no longer has any other person having the same internal software development controller, so the group ceases to exist.
*   GCo and HCo both have the same, single shareholder, Carol. GCo undertakes internal software development, and Carol is GCo's internal software development controller. HCo does not undertake internal software development. HCo begins internal software development. Therefore, GCo and HCo are now the members of an internal software group.
*   JCo and KCo are the members of an internal software development group, X, controlled by Mrs X. LCo and MCo are the members of another internal software development group, Y, controlled by Mr Y. Mr Y sells LCo and MCo to Mrs X. Group Y ceases to exist, and LCo and MCo become members of Group X.
*   At the beginning of the year, NCo, OCo and PCo have the same internal software development controller and are therefore in an internal software development group, Z. OCo is sold to a non-associate in the middle of the year. QCo is purchased by PCo in the last quarter of the year. NCo, OCo, PCo and QCo are all members of Z at some time over the course of the year. NCo and PCo are members for the entire year, OCo is a member for the first half of the year and QCo is a member for the last quarter of the year

##### Allocation of the cap (sections LH 10 to LH 13)

**When not a member of any group (section LH 10)**

For the period a developer is not a member of any internal software development group, the developer will have eligible expenditure on internal software development.

The eligible expenditure on internal software development for which a credit may be claimed is capped. The cap is $3 million for a full year. If the period for which the business is not a member of any group is not a year, then the formula in section LH 10(1)(b) prorates the $3 million on a daily basis.

##### Example: Credit for internal software development when not in a group

ACo undertakes internal software development. For the first 73 days of the year, ACo is not under common control with any other developer. However, on 13 June2008, BCo - also a developer - purchases 100 percent of ACo. For the purposes of claiming a credit, ACo adjusts down its eligible expenditure on internal software development, for the period it was not in any group, to a maximum of $3 million multiplied by 73 divided by 365 = $600,000. If ACo's eligible expenditure for the period in the absence of section LH 10 is $300,000, ACo will be able to claim a credit for $300,000. If ACo's actual eligible expenditure for the period in the absence of section LH 10 is $700,000, ACo will only be able to claim a credit for $600,000

**Allocation when a member of a group (sections LH 11 and 12)**

For the period that a business is a member of an internal software development group, it is not entitled to any credits for eligible expenditure relating to internal software development, but might be entitled to a share of credits for the combined eligible expenditure of group members.

The entitlement to credits for a share of the combined eligible expenditure of group members depends on the nature of the group, but in no case can a group allocate more than $3 million across all its members for a full year. The group members are free to decide the exact allocation, subject to the restrictions described below.

An overriding requirement in all cases is that no member may have eligible expenditure relating to internal software development which is greater than the eligible expenditure that business would have had, during the period of membership, in the absence of sections LH 9 to LH 13.

Note that in the special case where a business leaves a group and one member or no-one is left in the group, the group ceases to exist. In that case, the business leaving and the business remaining (if any) will have their entitlement to credits determined on the basis of part-year membership.

**Members of a group with identical income years (section LH 11)**

If all the members of the group have the same income year (same length of year and same balance date), a member can have eligible expenditure allocated to it and claim a credit.

The maximum eligible expenditure relating to internal software development that is available to be allocated to all group members is $3 million for a full year, and this amount is required to be prorated on a daily basis where the period for which the member is in the group is less than a full year.

**Members of a group with non-identical income years (section LH 12)**

If any member, X, of the group has an income year which differs from the income year of another member, X will only be able to receive an amount of credit if X has been a member of the group for X's entire income year.

The maximum eligible expenditure relating to internal software development that is available to be allocated across all group members is $3 million for a full year.

##### Examples: Allocation of the cap

*   ACo and BCo are members of an internal software development group. ACo and BCo have the same (standard) income years, and are members of the group for the entire year. ACo would have eligible expenditure relating to internal software development expenditure of $2.2 million for the year, in the absence of sections LH 9 to LH 13. BCo would have eligible expenditure of $1.5 million. ACo and BCo may share credits for eligible expenditure of $3 million. The allocation may be made as the parties see fit, as long as ACo receives credits for no more than $2.2 million and BCo receives credits for no more than $1.5 million.
*   CCo and DCo, which have standard income years, are not members of any internal software group, but are under common control. CCo and DCo begin internal software development on 1 July 2008. Therefore, they are the members of an internal software development group from 1 July. The group exists for 274 days of the incomeyear (1 July 2008 to 31 March 2009), and CCo and DCo are members for this entire period. CCo would have eligible expenditure relating to internal software development of $4 million in the absence of sections LH 9 to 13. DCo would have eligible expenditure of $5 million. CCo and DCo can share credits for eligible expenditure of $3 million multiplied by 274 divided by 365 = $2,252,054 (see subsection LH 11(5)). This can be shared in any way.
*   ECo and FCo are members of an internal software development group. ECo and FCo have the same (standard) income years, and are members of the group for the entire year. ECo would have eligible expenditure relating to internal software development of $2.2 million for the year, in the absence of sections LH 9 to 13. FCo would have eligible expenditure of $1.5 million. GCo, an internal software developer with a standard income year, is bought by FCo on 1 July 2008, so is a member of the group for 274 days of the year. In the absence of sections LH 9 to 13, GCo would have eligible expenditure relating to internal software development of $1 million for the first 91 days of the year, and $3 million for the other 274days. GCo calculates that the group can allocate up to $3 million multiplied by274 divided by 365 = $2,252,054 to it for the period it is a member (according to section LH 11). ECo and FCo calculate that the group can allocate up to $3 million to the pair for the full-year period they are members (again according to section 11). Assume GCo has received a credit for the full $2,252,054 available for the period it was a member. Then of the $3 million of eligible expenditure allocable to the group over the (full-year) period of ECo and FCo's membership, $747,946 is left for distribution to ECo and FCo. This distribution may be made as the pair see fit. GCo is also entitled to a credit for $3 million multiplied by 91 divided by 365 = $747,945 for eligible expenditure relating to internal software development incurred during its time outside the group.
*   HCo and ICo are members of an internal software development group. HCo and ICo have the same (standard) income years, and are members of the group for the entire year. HCo would have eligible expenditure relating to internal software development of $2.2 million for the year, in the absence of sections LH 9 to 13. ICo would have eligible expenditure of $1.5 million. JCo, an internal software developer with an income year ending 31 December 2008, is bought by ICo on 1July 2008, so is also a member of the group for 184 days of its income year. In the absence of sections LH 9 to 13, JCo would have eligible expenditure relating to internal software development of $2 million for the first 181 days of the year and $2 million for the other 184 days. HCo and ICo share credits for an eligible amount of $3 million (according to subsections LH 12(3) and (4)). The allocation may be made as the parties see fit, as long as HCo receives no more than $2.2 million and ICo receives no more than $1.5million. JCo receives no credit for the internal software expenditure incurred while a member of the group, because it is a member for less than its full income year (see subsection LH 12(2)). JCo is, however, entitled to a credit for $3 million multiplied by 181 divided by 365 = $1,487,671 for the eligible expenditure relating to internal software development incurred during its time outside the group (section LH 10).
*   KCo and LCo are members of an internal software development group. KCo has an income year ending 31 March and LCo has an income year ending 30 April. KCo would have eligible expenditure relating to internal software development of $2.2 million for the year, in the absence of sections LH 9 to 13. LCo would have eligible expenditure of $1.5 million. KCo is liquidated on 30 November 2008, and the group ceases to exist on this date. KCo and LCo are members of the group for only part of their 2008-09 income years and have different income years, so receive no credit relating to internal software development expenditure incurred while members of the group. LCo is entitled to credits for such expenditure incurred after the group dissolves, according to the formula in section LH 10.

**Level of the cap (section LH 13)**

The level of the cap is $3 million for a year. This is the level for an individual and for an internal software development group.

The $3 million cap is not expected to impact on most claimants, as few are likely to have more than $3 million of eligible expenditure on internal software development. In exceptional cases when expenditure does exceed the cap, a different level of the cap may be determined for an individual or an internal software development group, for a period, by notice in the New Zealand _Gazette_. The increase of the cap may be granted on application to the Minister of Finance if the Minister considers that three requirements, broadly relating to national interest, are met.

The three requirements are based on similar requirements for obtaining government-provided incentives in Australia and New Zealand, and are:

*   That the internal software development will be exploited mainly for the benefit of the New Zealand economy.
*   That New Zealand will derive a substantial net benefit from intended completion of the internal software development.
*   That the person (or in the case of the cap being increased for an internal software development group, the internal software development controller) has a commitment to retain the value of their business in New Zealand.

An increase in the level of the cap under section LH13 does not automatically entitle a person or internal software group to an amount of R&D tax credit. Allthe other requirements in the legislation, such as the requirement that the activity meet the legislated definition of R&D, must still be met.

The Minister of Finance may impose conditions on a determination to increase the level of the cap, and the determination will not apply unless those conditions are met.

* * *

**19** The legislation refers to the expenditure of members of an internal software development group for income years corresponding to a tax year (sections LH 11(5)(a) and 12(4)(a)). This includes only expenditure for the period the businesses are members of the group, since any other expenditure is no longer expenditure of a “member”.

Whether a support carer is taxed depends on if they provide care in their own home, or in the home of the person who needs care.

Providing care in their own home
--------------------------------

The Carer Support payment is a reimbursement. It covers a support carer’s costs to look after the person in need of care. The payment they get is not taxable, and the support carer cannot claim expenses for tax purposes.

Providing care outside their own home
-------------------------------------

If the carer provides care outside their own home, their payment is taxable.

Support carers who work for 30 hours a week or less are generally classed as private domestic workers and must pay their own tax and register as IR56 taxpayers. This means they are acting as their own employer.

Each month they earn income they should send us employer details, showing how much they have earned, and how much tax they have deducted. Income can be reported in myIR or using an Employment Information – IR348 form.

At the end of the year, if they do not have any untaxed income, we will send an income tax assessment that includes the support carer payments.

[IR56 taxpayers](/roles/ir56-taxpayers)

A full-time carer can choose to pay a support carer as their employee. The full-time carer would have to register with us as an employer.

[Register as an employer](https://www.ird.govt.nz/employing-staff/register-as-an-employer)

Self-employed support carers
----------------------------

If a support carer is in the business of providing care, the support payments are taxable. They should show these payments as self-employed income in an end of year tax return. The support carer may also need to register for GST.

Entitlements and repayments
---------------------------

We use yearly taxable income to work out Working for Families entitlements or student loan repayments. Self-employed and IR56 payers will need to tell us how much they expect to earn.

Example: Silvia cares full time for her son Max

Silvia is a full-time carer for her son Max. Silvia organises for a support carer, Joe to come to her home to provide care for Max.

As Joe is providing care in Silvia’s home Joe will need to keep records of the payments and register as an IR56 taxpayer.

Joe will account for his own tax on these payments as an IR56 taxpayer. Silvia does not need to register as an employer but can choose to.

If Joe works for more than 30 hours per week for her on a regular basis Silvia will have to register as an employer. In this case Joe will be an employee and no longer need to be registered as an IR56 taxpayer.

Case transfer and consolidation
===============================

2013 case note – CIR successful in application to have cases relating to the Trinity Scheme transferred to the High Court and consolidated with other cases.

Case

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Garry Albert Muir and others

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") was successful in her application to have a number of cases originally filed in the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") transferred to the High Court and consolidated with other High Court cases concerning the same dispute.

### Impact of decision

The transfer and consolidation will allow the court to deal with matters in a comprehensive, efficient and relatively inexpensive manner. In agreeing to the transfer and consolidation, the court considered and applied the same considerations set out in _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Deepsea Seafoods (No 1) Limited_ (2004) 21 NZTC 18,469 (HC) ("_Deepsea Seafoods_").

The litigation history, especially since 2002, was one of the strong reasons for awarding the orders.

### Facts

This application relates to the ongoing challenges filed by the respondents, disputing the finding that the Trinity Scheme was a tax avoidance scheme.

The Commissioner applied for the transfer of 66 proceedings (brought by 11 challengers) from the TRA to the High Court and consolidation of those proceedings with some related appeals and proceedings already in the High Court.

### Decision

Before considering the issues, the Court first had to determine whether the Commissioner could bring this application by way of an originating application under Part 19 of the High Court Rules. The Court granted leave to the Commissioner with reference to Randerson J's judgment in _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v McIlraith_ (2003) 21 NZTC 18,112 (HC).

In relation to the transfer of proceedings, Toogood J referred to the case of _Deepsea Seafoods_ where the relevant considerations for transfer of proceedings from the TRA to the High Court were considered, the main ones being:

*   the magnitude of the tax in dispute, public importance or complexity of the matter;
*   the likelihood of the matter arising again in the future assessments; and
*   the likelihood of appeals from the TRA.

The respondent objected to the transfer on the basis that:

*   the Commissioner is merely seeking to strike out the challenges;
*   the substantive issue is not complex;
*   not all Trinity challenges would be dealt with in the High Court if the Commissioner is successful in its present application; and
*   high litigation costs are asserted by the Commissioner and this is prejudicial to the challengers in circumstances where costs awards are not available in the TRA.

In response, Toogood J considered that:

*   as the issue is already before this Court in the appeal proceedings, no injustice to the challengers arises if the proceedings are transferred;
*   the issue is a complex one and even if it was not, it would not be an end to the matter;
*   the High Court is capable of addressing discrete issues even if proceedings are transferred, and there is a substantive similarity in the issues;
*   potential liability of respondents to costs in the High Court is not influential, and there is a public interest element in transferring the proceedings to eliminate a tier of appeals.

Toogood J also criticised the attitude the Trinity investors adopted, particularly those who did not settle their challenges after the _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289. He stated at \[25\]:

*   More compelling, in favour of transfer, is the attitude which has been adopted by the Trinity investors who did not settle their challenges after the _Ben Nevis_ decision of the Supreme Court. That has been to continue to seek avenues to relitigate the issues decided against them. I accept the Commissioner's proposition that little confidence can be placed in the challengers accepting any precedent-setting judgment or judgments which might be issued in the proceedings currently before this Court or in any one proceeding which might, as suggested by Dr Muir, be transferred as if it were, in effect, a test case. The prospect that notwithstanding an unfavourable outcome for the appeal proceedings currently before the Court, the other challengers will continue to argue their respective cases is not fanciful given the litigation history.

Toogood J referred to _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v A Taxpayer_ (2003) 21 NZTC 18,001 (HC),where O'Regan J determinedthat transfer of Trinity litigation underlying the _Ben Nevis_ decision was appropriate given the complexity of the issues and the amount of tax at stake. Toogood J stated at \[27\]:

*   … transfer will bring the resolution closer to finality. All relevant factors weigh heavily in favour of transfer.

In relation to the consolidation of the proceedings, Toogood J again referred t_o Deepsea Seafoods_ where consolidation was ordered. He applied the same considerations, and ordered consolidation, noting that consolidation was desirable to save time and cost for the parties and the Court.

In addition, the Court made ancillary orders requiring the respondents to file and serve on the Commissioner amended statements of claim in all of the transferred proceedings on or before 5 December 2013, with the Commissioner to file and serve statements of defence by 20 February 2014.

Costs were awarded to the Commissioner.

Cases involving alleged tax avoidance transferred to High Court and consolidated
================================================================================

2014 case note – CIR successful in having two related cases transferred from Taxation Review Authority to High Court and consolidated.

Case

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Bell Road Developments Ltd & Others & Kupuri Investments Ltd & Others

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, High Court Rules

### Summary

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") was successful in having two related cases transferred from the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") to the High Court. These cases were also consolidated.

### Facts

Bell Road Developments Limited, Tararua Street Developments Limited and Messines Developments Limited ("Bell Group") successfully undertook three major property developments. Mr C J Mason, Kupuri Investments Limited, and Trustman Services Limited as trustee of the Columbia Trust ("Mason Group") ultimately received the profit from the property developments. However, the profits were returned by Emborion International Limited ("Emborion") in the 2004-2008 income years on the basis the Bell Group was acting as its agent.

The Commissioner assessed the Bell Group's profit on the basis it entered into a tax avoidance arrangement that was void against the Commissioner. The Mason Group was assessed in the alternative on the basis the profit derived by the Bell Group flowed to the Mason Group (again on the basis the Mason Group entered into a tax avoidance arrangement). The Bell Group and the Mason Group (jointly "the respondents") each commenced separate challenge proceedings in the TRA in August 2013.

In this proceeding, the Commissioner applied to the High Court seeking orders to transfer and consolidate the challenge proceedings filed by the respondents.

### Decision

#### _Transfer_

The Court was satisfied that there were sufficient factors supporting transfer of the proceedings to the High Court.

In determining whether transfer to the High Court was warranted, the Court referred to the decision in _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Erris Promotions_ \[2003\] 1 NZLR 506 (CA) as also referred to in the _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v McIlraith_ (2003) 21 NZTC 18,112 (HC) decision.

_Taxpayer's choice of forum_

The Court considered the advantages available to the respondents in these proceedings being commenced and remaining in the TRA, namely; the TRA's specialist jurisdiction, its powers of a Commission of Inquiry, the informality, costs considerations, confidentiality and the fact it is not necessary to instruct a lawyer to conduct the challenge.

The Court determined that the fact the TRA is a specialist tribunal should not be overstated. The Court also held that while the TRA has the powers of a Commission of Inquiry there are existing authorities that support the transfer of proceedings in cases where there are complaints or challenges based on administrative law reasons. The Court agreed that the informality and costs considerations, generally, benefit taxpayers who commence challenge proceedings in the TRA.

The Court found that confidentiality did not appear to be an important feature to the respondents, or those associated with them. Accordingly, the Court found it necessary in this case to consider whether the reasons advanced by the Commissioner for transfer outweighed the factors favouring retention in the TRA.

The Commissioner had relied on the following factors in support of her application for transfer:

1.  the complexity of the arrangement;
2.  the significance of the litigation;
3.  issues of administrative law; and
4.  the likelihood of appeal.

_Complexity of arrangement_

The Court concluded that despite submission from counsel for the respondents, the matter was not straightforward and the fundamental features of the arrangement would have to be considered in a commercial and economically realistic way. The Court also noted that there were disputed facts. In addition, the Court referred to the TRA's minute of 20 November 2013, which recorded that Mr Russell estimated a 20-day hearing would be required and found that this was inconsistent with the respondents' submission that the matter was straightforward. The Court found that the proceedings were at least of moderate complexity.

_Significance of the litigation_

The Court noted, as a partial answer to the costs advantage of the TRA that due to the amount of tax in dispute (being in excess of $3.5m) and the limited number of parties affected, the argument that the costs in the High Court count against a transfer did not hold much weight. The Court also noted that tax disputes involving sums of this nature can properly be dealt with before the TRA. The Court concluded that while the use of a company with tax losses to offset tax was not novel, if the arrangement was found to be a tax avoidance arrangement there is potential for broader application. Accordingly, in principle there would be some precedential value in the case.

_Issues of administrative law_

The Court considered that the respondents' administrative law allegations (impugning the integrity and conduct of the Commissioner's officials, including an allegation of vendetta) supported a transfer to the High Court.

_Likelihood of appeal_

The Court acknowledged that the prospect of more than one appeal in this matter supported a transfer of proceedings to the High Court. However, the Court emphasised that weight should not be placed too heavily on the number of potential appeals that may arise but on the overall delay in resolution of the proceedings due to those potential appeals.

#### _Consolidation_

The Court noted that it has a broad discretion to grant consolidation under High Court Rule 10.12, albeit that it should be exercised in accordance with the interests of justice.

The Court found that the relationships between Emborion and the Bell and Mason Groups were interrelated and interlinked, and therefore consolidation would avoid repetition and conflicting findings of fact. The Court noted that the separate interests of the Bell and Mason Groups could be provided for as they could be separately represented and make their own cases in relation to their respective positions. The Court was ultimately satisfied that the interests of justice favoured consolidation and made orders consolidating the two proceedings.

Cash jobs leave a trail - new IR campaign launching
===================================================

**17 October 2017**

Tradies are being reminded that every undeclared cash job leaves a trail in a hard-hitting campaign from Inland Revenue.

The message will start appearing around Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch over the next few days as part of a long-running programme to address tax crime in the building sector.

Investigation work into the hidden economy uncovered $159 million worth of unpaid tax in the last year.

\[embed width="480" height="360" class="leftAlone" thumbnail="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IbNO8Tqiw5Q/hqdefault.jpg?r"\]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbNO8Tqiw5Q&SubsiteID=1\[/embed\]

Watch some kiwi builders talk about why declaring all their income is important for their business and reputation.

Inland Revenue Marketing and Communications Group Manager Andrew Stott says research shows that although most are doing the right thing, a large proportion of undeclared cash jobs are being paid for services like building, plumbing, painting and electrical work.

“There’s a misconception out there that this work flies under Inland Revenue’s radar but undeclared income leaves a trail, which can be easily uncovered when looking for irregularities in a tradie’s books.

“You place yourself in a difficult position when you accept these jobs so the best advice is to record everything, declare every dollar and make sure you’re charging GST if required.

“If you have been doing undeclared cash jobs, we can help you get back on track.”

Look out for the campaign posters

A recent Inland Revenue survey found a quarter of respondents were still prepared to pay their tradie with cash compared to 35% when the question was first asked six years ago.

“It’s great that fewer people are paying cash jobs,” says Mr Stott. “More people are aware that not declaring them is against the law.

“They’re grossly unfair on the tradies who play by the rules and they take away funding earmarked for improved public services.

“We’re trying to make people in the construction industry aware that there’s a risk associated with not declaring a cash job.

“Hopefully this makes them think hard about whether the risk is worth it.”

Cash prizes in sporting competitions - GST implications for organising club
===========================================================================

QB (May 2001) clarifies whether or not an amateur sports club can claim GST input deductions on cash prizes awarded to participants in competitions.

### Sections 5(10) and 10(14), Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 - supply where game of chance etc.

The secretary of a GST registered amateur sports club has asked us to clarify whether or not the club is able to claim GST input tax deductions on cash prizes awarded to participants in bowls competitions organised by the club. They have noted that section 10(14) permits the amount of prizes paid in cash to be deducted from total proceeds in relation to certain games and competitions, thus reducing the net amount of GST payable in respect of the competition. 

Many clubs run regular sporting competitions, and these competitions are part of the club's taxable activity.  A membership fee allowing a person to use the club facilities may be payable, and this fee may also allow members to enter competitions.  Alternatively, a separate fee may apply for entry into the competition.  In both cases such fees contribute towards the costs of administering and running the competition, as well as allowing the use of facilities. 

As a registered person, the club will return output tax on membership fees and competition entry fees. The club will be able to claim input tax on all the goods and services purchased in order to provide the competition.  "Goods" and "services" are both defined in section 2 of the Act.

"Goods" means all kinds of personal or real property; but does not include choses in action or money.

"Services" means anything which is not goods or money.

Trophies, bottles of wine, meat packs, or similar items fall within the definition of goods.  As such input tax deductions can be made.  If a prize is donated, there is no GST component as there is no consideration paid for that prize.

Cash prizes, however, are treated differently because they do not fall within either the definition of "goods" or "services".  The section 2 definitions of "goods" and "services" specifically exclude money.  Thus it is not possible for the club to claim GST on any money acquired for the purposes of awarding a prize, because money is not a good or a service.

Having concluded that money is neither "goods" nor "services", a further question arises as to whether the sporting competition is a "game of chance", "lottery", "prize competition", etc, in order for sections 5(10) and 10(14) to apply. 

Relevant sections of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 are:

Section 5:

(10) Notwithstanding anything in this Act, for the purposes of this Act where any person pays an amount in money to participate in a game of chance, lottery, New Zealand instant game, New Zealand lottery, New Zealand prize competition, or prize competition, the amount of money so paid to participate shall be deemed to be for a supply of services by the person, society, licensed promoter, or organiser who, pursuant to the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977, conducts the game of chance, lottery New Zealand instant game, New Zealand lottery, New Zealand prize competition, or prize competition.

 (11) For the purposes of subsection (10) of this section-

(a)     The terms "game of chance", "gaming machine", "lottery",  "prize competition", and "society" have the same meanings as defined in section 2 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977:

(aa) The terms "New Zealand instant game", "New Zealand lottery" and "New Zealand prize competition" have the same meanings as defined in section 71 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977:

(b)     The term "amusement device" has the same meaning as defined in section 10 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977:

(c)     The term "licensed promoter" has the same meaning as defined in Part V of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977:

(d)   The term "organiser" means the New Zealand Lotteries Commission established by section 72 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977.

Section 10:

(14) Where a supply of services is deemed to be made under section 5(10) of this Act, the consideration in money for the supply shall be deemed to be such portion of the amount in money a person pays to participate in a game of chance, lottery, New Zealand instant game, New Zealand lottery, New Zealand prize competition, or prize competition, as represents the total proceeds (after deducting the amount of all prizes paid and payable in money) in respect of that game of chance, lottery, New Zealand instant game, New Zealand lottery, New Zealand prize competition, or prize competition.

(15) For the purposes of subsection (14) of this section:

(a)   The terms "game of chance", "lottery", and "prize competition" have the same meanings as defined in section 2 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977:

(b)     The terms "New Zealand instant game", "New Zealand lottery", and "New Zealand prize competition" have the same meanings as defined in section 71 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977.

In addition, the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977 defines "game of chance" and "prize competition" in the following terms:

"Game of chance" means a game:

(a) In respect of which direct or indirect consideration is paid to participate; and

(b) That is played with a view to winning money or money's worth; and

(c) The outcome of which depends wholly or partly on chance;--

but does not include an athletic game, or a sporting event, or a New Zealand lottery, or a New Zealand prize competition:

"Prize competition" means a scheme or competition in respect of which direct or indirect consideration is paid to participate, and of which the result is determined partly by a considerable element of chance (whether chance plays the greater or lesser part), and partly by the performance by the contestants of some activity of a kind that may be performed more readily by contestants possessing or exercising some knowledge or skill, whether or not it may also be performed successfully by chance; but does not include--

(a)         An instant game; or

(b)         A New Zealand instant game; or

(c)         Any such scheme or competition to which Part VII of this Act applies:

Section 10(14) allows cash prizes to be deducted from the total proceeds of a "game of chance", "lottery", "prize competition", etc., thus reducing the net amount of GST  payable.  However, section 10(14) only applies to taxable supplies under section 5(10).   Section 5(10) deals with supplies where there is a "game of chance",  "prize competition", etc.  Paying money to participate in any of the defined "games of chance",  "prize competition", etc., is treated as payment for a supply of a service. 

The particular activities listed in the section are all defined in the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977, including the term "prize competition".  "Prize competition" has the same meaning in the GST Act as it does under the Gaming and Lotteries Act.  Thus, if an event is a "prize competition", the rules of the Gaming and Lotteries Act will apply. 

The Gaming and Lotteries Act definition of "game of chance" excludes an "athletic game" and a "sporting event".  A "game of chance" by definition is one that depends on luck, and not the skill of the competitor.  In the context of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, the definition of "game of chance" refers to "chance" in a gambling sense, i.e. the Gaming and Lotteries Act deals with the promoting, licensing, and regulation of gambling-related activities by a person, society, licensed promoter, or organiser pursuant to that Act. 

A sports competition does not become a "prize competition" for the purposes of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, simply because prizes are awarded.  A "prize competition" requires there to be a considerable elements of chance, and some skill or knowledge. A sports competition will not generally come within the definition of "prize competition", as the participants are competing on the basis of their skill or knowledge in the relevant sport.  Nor will such sporting competitions come within any of the other definitions referred to in section 5(10) as they will not be organised, licensed, or promoted pursuant to the Gaming and Lotteries Act.

Because section 5(10) does not apply, section 10(14) will not apply either.  Section 10(14) contains a particular concession for games of chance in which GST is only payable on the proceeds of the game of chance, prize competition, etc., after the amount of the prize money has been deducted.

Therefore, the sports club will not be able to rely on the provisions of sections 5(10) and 10(14) to deduct the amount of any cash prizes from the total proceeds received from the amateur sports (bowls) competitions. Accordingly, the GST payable in respect of the competition will not be reduced, or other GST relief obtained, in respect of cash prizes for clubs’ sports competitions.

While every case will depend on its own facts, the Commissioner does not generally consider the awarding of minor "spot" prizes as part of the sporting competition would alter this characteristic unless part of the fee could be seen to be attributed to the possibility of receiving such spot prizes.

Cash starts flowing to businesses
=================================

**12 May 2020**

Millions of dollars in cash support has begun flowing to businesses through the largest tax refund package in modern New Zealand history.

Revenue Minister Stuart Nash says the first week of operation of the $3 billion loss carry-back scheme has seen hundreds of applications refunded by IRD. A second support package, the Small Business Cashflow Loan Scheme, has also gone live.

“More than $62 million in tax refunds have been paid in the first week, to 676 businesses who applied under the loss carry-back provisions,” Mr Nash said. “The tax refunds are a cash lifeline for businesses with non-wage fixed costs, like rent, interest and insurance. Without this support these otherwise viable SMEs may be forced to close.

“My strong advice to businesses is to talk to their accountant, bookkeeper or tax agent, or log onto the MyIR portal, to ensure they take advantage of the government support as quickly as possible.

“A second package of support is available through the Small Business Cashflow Loan Scheme. It is now officially open for business, from today to 12 June. Payments will be made within 5 days of a loan being approved.

“The scheme is already proving very popular. In just the first couple of hours after it opened this morning, more than 6,000 businesses applied for a loan. The total applied for so far exceeds $100 million.

“So whether you are a sole trader, wanting to borrow up to $11,800 interest free, or have 50 staff and want to borrow up to $100,000 interest free, go online to the MyIR site and check out the details.

“In just a couple of weeks, IRD has built an entirely new system to process applications for loans that are interest free if repaid in the first year. These are an important source of working capital for businesses.

“Around 98% of IRD staff in the Capital are working from home during the lockdown. It is a testament to their skills and tenacity that the small business loan scheme has been stood up in such a short space of time.

“The scheme has been brought to life by some of the best public servants in New Zealand, working from their kitchen tables and home offices. They have given specialist briefings to tax agents and the accounting profession to help businesses apply. They have trained call centre staff and dedicated web teams to help answer technical questions. I am grateful for their service,” Mr Nash said.

Casual relief driver is employee
================================

2006 case note – Authority found that the relief courier driver was a casual employee of the disputant and the disputant was therefore responsible for the PAYE.

Case

TRA 003/05 Decision No 001/2006

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994 and the Employment Relations Act 2000.

### Summary

The TRA found that the relief courier drirver was a casual employee of the disputant. The disputant was therefore responsible for the PAYE.

### Facts

The disputant, a self-employed courier driver for a courier company, contested his PAYE assessments for the years ended 31 March 1999 to 2002 inclusive, at $259.87, $432.82, $1,465.73 and $940.81 respectively, as employing a relief driver but failing to deduct and pay PAYE to the defendant.

The disputant worked for the courier company pursant to terms of a contract ("the agreement"). The disputant engaged the services of a relief driver to cover any period when he was sick or on holiday. There was no written contract between the disputant and the relief driver and the terms of the agreement and practice between them were:

_I). The relief driver:_

1.  Would fill in for the disputant by completing his "run" making deliveries and pick-ups, complying with the guidelines and instructions of the courier company.
2.  Was paid a fixed rate of $125 for each day he worked for the disputant irrespective of the number of pick-ups or deliveries made.
3.  Worked the number of hours that were required to complete the deliveries and pick-ups for the day.
4.  Was responsible for finding a replacement driver if he was unavailable. The agreement between the disputant and the courier company provided that if a relief driver fails to carry out his duties, then the courier company may appoint its own relief driver (at the disputant"s cost).
5.  Was able to refuse a request to relief drive.
6.  Used the disputant"s courier vehicle.
7.  Did not supply any invoice for completed work.
8.  Used the disputant"s fuel card for fuel for the disputant"s courier vehicle.
9.  Was not liable for fines in respect of the vehicle, communications equipment or trailer.
10.  Did not incur ordinary business expenses, for example; telephone, electricity, repairs, maintenance and courier tickets.
11.  Only undertook the deliveries and pick-ups for the disputant in the latter"s absence and was not required to undertake further activities and obligations (specified in the agreement between the courier company and the disputant).

_II). The relief driver was not required to:_

1.  Hold a goods and services licence.
2.  Meet the outgoings in respect of the courier vehicle or provide another courier vehicle approved by the courier company or the disputant if required.
3.  Paint, at the relief driver"s own expense, the courier vehicle with the courier company"s colours and display advertising as may be required by the courier company.
4.  Install and maintain communication, data processing or other equipment at the relief driver"s own expense, if required by the courier company.
5.  Ensure the courier vehicle had a current warrant of fitness and complied with all statutory regulatory requirements.
6.  Take out and maintain insurance cover in respect of the courier activities.

_III). Other important facts are:_

1.  The disputant"s insurance policy covered the relief driver"s use of the courier vehicle.
2.  If the relief driver had failed to perform his courier duties, the procedure would be that the courier company would query this with the disputant who would then take appropriate action against the relief driver.
3.  The method of calculating remuneration for the disputant and the relief driver was different. The disputant was paid by the courier company for the services rendered in terms of the number of pick-ups and deliveries made; the relief driver was paid a fixed amount of $125 for each day of relief driving regardless of how many pick-ups and deliveries he did.
4.  The agreement between the disputant and the courier company expressly provided that the disputant was an "independent self-employed contractor" to the courier company and was not an employee.

### Decision

The Authority considered a number of tests which assist the courts in deciding whether a person is engaged as an employee or as an independent contractor. Judge Barber stated that in deciding whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor a consideration of the relevant facts in "a balancing exercise overall" needs to be considered: Case T13 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,080 at p.8,058.

Historically the "control test" has been applied to determine whether a person is an employee. This has, with other tests, been subsumed by the "fundamental test". For example, in Case U9 (1999) 19 NZTC 9,077, at paragraph 44:

"TNT Worldwide express (NZ) Ltd v Cunningham makes it clear, in terms of the established tests for deciding status, that the ‘fundamental test’ largely subsumes the others, called the control test, the organisation test, the multiple or mixed test, and the label or intention test."

The Privy Council in Lee Ting Sang v Chung Chi-Keung \[1990\] 2 AC 374 at p.382 quoted with approval Cooke J in Market Investigations Ltd v Minister of Social Security \[1969\] 2 Q.B 173, 184-185 that:

"the fundamental test ‘Is the person who has engaged himself to perform these services performing them as a person in business on his own account?’... although it can no longer be regarded as the sole determining factor...".

The Authority considered how the disputant paid the relief driver for work performed. Method of payment is a factor that has been taken into account by the courts to determine employment status. Fixed payments, irrespective of the actual work done or revenue created, are usually an indication of an employment contract. In James Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd \[2005\] NZSC 34 the Supreme Court reinstated a decision of the Employment Court which found that Mr Bryson was an employee in part because "his income was not linked in any way to the profits or losses of Three Foot Six".

In this instance, unlike the taxi drivers in Case U9 (1999) 19 NZTC 9,077 the relief driver was unable to make a profit from the sound management of his relief driving. If he drove more efficiently he would still be paid $125. In Case U9 relief drivers for taxis were held to be independent contractors. Barber DJ stated, at p 9,084: "The arrangement whereby a percentage of gross takings is paid to the objector, indicates to me an independent contractor set-up or structure". And; "I conclude that the reality of this situation is that each driver has the opportunity to profit from sound management of a taxi operating activity and from his or her own efforts". The relief driver also took no business risk.

The Authority considered the fact that the disputant provided all equipment used by the relief driver and the disputant paid all: maintenance and other expenses incurred in respect of the vehicle; the vehicles insurance; all fuel costs; including all other business expenses. That the disputant paid those expenses supports the proposition that the disputant was an independent contractor who employed the relief driver to relieve him.

The Authority looked at the fact the relief driver did not provide the disputant with an invoice for the work completed. Judge Barber said this indicated the relief driver did not see himself functioning in a capacity separate from the business of the disputant. In Enterprise Cars Ltd v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1998) 10 NZTC 5;126 (HC), Sinclair J noted that, in support of the mechanics being independent contractors, they submitted accounts for the work they performed.

Judge Barber stated that the disputant had "substantial control" over the relief driver. Such control included: the relief driver having to comply with all the guidelines and instructions of the courier company, for example diligence and care with which the service is provided, dress code; the depot instructed at which address pick-ups and deliveries were to be made, and the disputant controlled the appearance of the vehicles in that the disputant provided the vehicle to the relief driver.

The Authority considered whether the relief driver was a casual employee. Casual employees do not work fixed hours of work but work only when required. As noted by the Court of Appeal in Drake Personnel (New Zealand) Ltd v Taylor \[1996\] 1 ERNZ 324 at p.325 to 326, casual employees:

"...have no guarantee of continuous work, or indeed any work. They only have the opportunity of casual assignments. When one assignment ends, there is no certainty another will follow. No wages are paid for the period between assignments…each assignment is a separate engagement..."

It is not inconsistent with being a casual employee that the relief driver drove for other courier firms. In Drake personnel (New Zealand) Ltd v Taylor, McKay J delivering the judgment of the Court, noted at p.326 that Drake "accepts that they (the casual employees) may also be enrolled with other agencies and work for those agencies' clients".

An indicator of the status of a work relationship is the intention of the parties. The authority found that in the present case neither party gave any real consideration to the nature of their relationship nor did they evidence their intention in writing in anyway. Therefore the intentions of the disputant and the relief driver are not clear. Unlike in Case U9 the intention of the parties was to create the status of independent contractors for the relief drivers. Intention was evidenced by the wording of the contracts between the relief taxi driver and the taxpayer (owner of the taxi).

In view of the relevant tests, case law and consideration of the facts, Judge Barber concluded that the relief driver was not carrying on business for his own account but, simply, earning daily pay as a casual employee of the disputant. The relief driver was a casual employee of the disputant at all material times.

Non-attributing active insurance CFC status (TOWER Insurance Limited)
=====================================================================

CFC 2011/01 covers non-attributing active insurance CFC status for TOWER Insurance Limited.

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Investigations Manager under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

Under sections CQ 2(1)(h) and DN 2(1)(h) of the Income Tax Act 2007, subject to sections CQ 2(2B) and DN 2(2), no attributed CFC income or loss arises from a CFC that is a non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Section EX 21B(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that a CFC that is an insurer meeting the requirements of a determination made by the Commissioner under section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is a non-attributing active CFC. In the absence of such a determination, a CFC carrying on an insurance business is unlikely to be a non-attributing active CFC, because insurance income is otherwise treated as passive income and an attributable CFC amount by section EX 20B(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Section 91AAQ(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows a person to apply to the Commissioner for such a determination in respect of the members of a group of CFCs, if the members satisfy subsection (3). TOWER Insurance Limited has made application in respect of the members of the group of CFCs set out below.

It has been determined, having regard to the matters set out in subsections (4) and (5) of section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994, that the members of the group of CFCs satisfy the requirements set out in section 91AAQ(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and are accordingly non-attributing active CFCs for the purposes of section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Scope of determination

The CFCs to which this determination applies are:

| Name | Jurisdiction |
| --- | --- |
| National Insurance Company (Holdings) Limited | Fiji |
| TOWER Insurance (Fiji) Limited | Fiji |
| Southern Pacific Insurance Company (Fiji) Limited | Fiji |

### Interpretation

In this document, unless the context otherwise requires:

"Attributed CFC income or loss" means attributed CFC income under section CQ 2 or attributed CFC loss under section DN 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

"CFC" means a CFC as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

"Non-attributing active CFC" means a non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Determination

Pursuant to section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994 I hereby determine that the above CFCs are non-attributing active CFCs for the purposes of section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Application date

This determination applies for the 2009-10 and 2010-11 income years.

This determination is signed by me this 14th day of March 2011.

TOWER Insurance Limited has made application in respect of the members of the group of CFCs set out below.

It has been determined, having regard to the matters set out in subsections (4) and (5) of section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994, that the members of the group of CFCs satisfy the requirements set out in section 91AAQ(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and are accordingly non-attributing active CFCs for the purposes of section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Scope of determination

The CFCs to which this determination applies are:

| Name | Jurisdiction |
| --- | --- |
| Southern Cross Marine Limited | Papua New Guinea |
| TOWER Insurance (PNG) Limited | Papua New Guinea |

### Interpretation

In this document, unless the context otherwise requires:

"Attributed CFC income or loss" means attributed CFC income under section CQ 2 or attributed CFC loss under section DN 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

"CFC" means a CFC as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

"Non-attributing active CFC" means a non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Determination

Pursuant to section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994 I hereby determine that the above CFCs are non-attributing active CFCs for the purposes of section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Application date

This determination applies for the 2009-10 and 2010-11 income years.

This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Investigations Manager under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Under sections CQ 2(1)(h) and DN 2(1)(h) of the Income Tax Act 2007, subject to sections CQ 2(2B) and DN 2(2), no attributed CFC income or loss arises from a CFC that is a non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

In the absence of such a determination, a CFC carrying on an insurance business is unlikely to be a non-attributing active CFC, because insurance income is otherwise treated as passive income and an attributable CFC amount by section EX 20B(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Non-attributing active insurance CFC status (TOWER Insurance Limited)
=====================================================================

CFC 2013/01 applies to TOWER Insurance Limited and grants non-attributing active CFC status to the specified insurance CFC resident in the Kingdom of Tonga.

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Investigations Manager under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

Under sections CQ 2(1)(h) and DN 2(1)(h) of the Income Tax Act 2007, subject to sections CQ 2(2B) and DN 2(2), no attributed CFC income or loss arises from a CFC that is a non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Section EX 21B(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that a CFC that is an insurer meeting the requirements of a determination made by the Commissioner under section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is a non-attributing active CFC. In the absence of such a determination, a CFC carrying on an insurance business is unlikely to be a non-attributing active CFC, because insurance income is otherwise treated as passive income and an attributable CFC amount by section EX 20B(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Section 91AAQ(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows a person to apply to the Commissioner for such a determination in respect of a CFC, if the CFC satisfies subsection (2). TOWER Insurance Limited has made application in respect of the CFC set out below.

It has been determined, having regard to the matters set out in subsections (4) and (5) of section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994, that the CFC satisfies the requirements set out in section 91AAQ(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and is accordingly a non-attributing active CFC for the purposes of section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Scope of determination

The CFC to which this determination applies is:

| Name | Jurisdiction |
| --- | --- |
| National Pacific Insurance (Tonga) Limited | Kingdom of Tonga |

### Interpretation

In this document, unless the context otherwise requires:

Attributed CFC income or loss means attributed CFC income under section CQ 2 or attributed CFC loss under section DN 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

CFC means a CFC as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Non-attributing active CFC means a non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Determination

Pursuant to section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994 I hereby determine that the above CFC is a non-attributing active CFC for the purposes of section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Application date

This determination applies for the 2012-13 income year.

This determination is signed by me this 14th day of August 2013.

Non-attributing active insurance CFC status (TOWER Insurance Limited)
=====================================================================

CFC 2014/04 applies to TOWER Insurance Limited and grants non-attributing active CFC status to the specified insurance CFC resident in Tonga.

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Investigations Manager under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

Under sections CQ 2(1)(h) and DN 2(1)(h) of the Income Tax Act 2007, subject to sections CQ 2(2B) and DN 2(2), no attributed CFC income or loss arises from a CFC that is a non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Section EX 21B(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that a CFC that is an insurer meeting the requirements of a determination made by the Commissioner under section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is a non-attributing active CFC. In the absence of such a determination, a CFC carrying on an insurance business is unlikely to be a non-attributing active CFC, because insurance income is otherwise treated as passive income and an attributable CFC amount by section EX 20B(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Section 91AAQ(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows a person to apply to the Commissioner for such a determination in respect of a CFC, if the CFC satisfies subsection (2). TOWER Insurance Limited has made application in respect of the CFC set out below.

It has been determined, having regard to the matters set out in subsections (4) and (5) of section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994, that the CFC satisfies the requirements set out in section 91AAQ(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and is accordingly a non-attributing active CFC for the purposes of section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Scope of determination

The CFC to which this determination applies is:

| Name | Jurisdiction |
| --- | --- |
| National Pacific Insurance (Tonga) Limited | Tonga |

### Interpretation

In this document, unless the context otherwise requires:  
"Attributed CFC income or loss" means attributed CFC income under section CQ 2 or attributed CFC loss under section DN 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007.  
"CFC" means a CFC as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.  
"Non-attributing active CFC" means a non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Determination

Pursuant to section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994, I hereby determine that the above CFC is a non-attributing active CFC for the purposes of section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Non-attributing active insurance CFC status (TOWER Insurance Limited)
=====================================================================

CFC 2015/03 applies to TOWER Insurance Limited and grants non-attributing active CFC status to the specified insurance resident in Fiji.

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Investigations Manager under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

Under sections CQ 2(1)(h) and DN 2(1)(h) of the Income Tax Act 2007, subject to sections CQ 2(2B) and DN 2(2), no attributed CFC income or loss arises from a CFC that is non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Section EX 21B(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that a CFC that is an insurer meeting the requirements of a determination made by the Commissioner under section 91AAQ of the administration Act 1994 is a non-attributing active CFC. In the absence of such a determination, a CFC carrying on an insurance business is unlikely to be a non-attributing active CFC, because insurance income is otherwise treated as passive income and an attributable CFC amount by section EX 20B(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Section 91AAQ(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows a person to apply to the Commissioner for such a determination in respect of the members of a group of CFCs, if the members satisfy subsection (3). TOWER Insurance Limited has made application in respect of the members of the group of CFCs set out below.

It has been determined, having regard to the matters set out in subsections (4) and (5) of section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994, that the members of the group of CFCs satisfy the requirements set out in section 91AAQ(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and are accordingly non-attributing active CFCs for the purposes of section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Scope of determination

The CFCs to which this determination applies are:

| Name | Jurisdiction |
| --- | --- |
| National Insurance Company (Holdings) Limited | Fiji |
| TOWER Insurance (Fiji) Limited | Fiji |
| Southern Pacific Insurance Company (Fiji) Limited | Fiji |

### Interpretation

In this document, unless the context otherwise requires:

"Attributed CFC income or loss" means attributed CFC income under section CQ 2 or attributed CFC loss under section DN 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

"CFC" means a CFC as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

"Non-attributing active CFC" means a non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Determination

Pursuant to section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994, I hereby determine that the above CFCs are a non-attributing active CFC for the purposes of section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Application date

This determination applies for the 2015-16 and 2016-17 income years.

This determination is signed by me this 15th day of October 2015.

Non-attributing active insurance CFC status (TOWER Insurance Limited)
=====================================================================

CFC 2017/04 applies to TOWER Insurance Limited and grants non-attributing active CFC status to the specified insurance CFC resident in Tonga.

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Investigations Manager under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

Under sections CQ 2(1)(h) and DN 2(1)(h) of the Income Tax Act 2007, subject to sections CQ 2(2B) and DN 2(2), no attributed CFC income or loss arises from a CFC that is a non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Section EX 21B(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that a CFC that is an insurer meeting the requirements of a determination made by the Commissioner under section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is a non-attributing active CFC. In the absence of such a determination, a CFC carrying on an insurance business is unlikely to be a non-attributing active CFC, because insurance income is otherwise treated as passive income and an attributable CFC amount by section EX 20B(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Section 91AAQ(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows a person to apply to the Commissioner for such a determination in respect of a CFC, if the CFC satisfies subsection (2). TOWER Insurance Limited has made application in respect of the CFC set out below.

It has been determined, having regard to the matters set out in subsections (4) and (5) of section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994, that the CFC satisfies the requirements set out in section 91AAQ(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and is accordingly a non-attributing active CFC for the purposes of section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Scope of determination

The CFC to which this determination applies is:

| Name | Jurisdiction |
| --- | --- |
| National Pacific Insurance (Tonga) Limited | Tonga |

### Interpretation

In this document, unless the context otherwise requires:

“Attributed CFC income or loss” means attributed CFC income under section CQ 2 or attributed CFC loss under section DN 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

"CFC" means a CFC as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

"Non-attributing active CFC" means a non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Determination

Pursuant to section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994, I hereby determine that the above CFC is a non-attributing active CFC for the purposes of section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Application date

This determination applies for the 2017-18 and 2018-19 income years.

This determination is signed by me this 6th day of October 2017.

Non-attributing active insurance CFC status (TOWER Insurance Limited)
=====================================================================

CFC 2019/04 applies to TOWER Insurance Limited and grants non-attributing active CFC status to the specified insurance CFC resident in Tonga.

[TIB Volume 32 No 1 February 2020](/tib/volume-32---2020/tib-vol32-no1)

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

A person has no attributed CFC income or loss from a CFC under sections CQ 2 and DN 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 if the CFC is a non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007 because the requirements of sections CQ 2(1)(h) and DN 2(1)(h) are not satisfied.

Section EX 21B(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that a CFC is a non-attributing active CFC if it is an insurer that meets the requirements of section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Commissioner makes a determination under that section. In the absence of such a determination, a CFC carrying on an insurance business is unlikely to be a non-attributing active CFC, because insurance income is otherwise treated as passive income and an attributable amount under section EX 20B(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Section 91AAQ(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows a person to apply to the Commissioner for such a determination in respect of a CFC, if the CFC satisfies subsection (2). Pursuant to section 91AAQ(1)(a) and (7), TOWER Insurance Limited has made an application to extend an earlier determination in respect of the CFC set out below. TOWER Insurance Limited has a 30 September balance date.

It has been determined, having regard to the matters set out in subsections (4) and (5) of section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994, that the CFC satisfies the requirements set out in section 91AAQ(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and is accordingly a non-attributing active CFC for the purposes of section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Scope of determination

The CFC to which this determination applies is:

| Name | Jurisdiction |
| --- | --- |
| National Pacific Insurance (Tonga) Limited | Tonga |

### Interpretation

In this document, unless the context otherwise requires:

“Attributed CFC income or loss” means attributed CFC income under section CQ 2 or attributed CFC loss under section DN 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

“CFC” means a “controlled foreign company” as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

"Non-attributing active CFC" means a non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Determination

Pursuant to section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994, I hereby determine that the above CFC is a non-attributing active CFC for the purposes of section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Application date

This determination applies for the 2020 and 2021 income years.

This determination is signed by me this 5th day of December 2019.

Non-attributing active insurance CFC status (Tower Limited)
===========================================================

CFC 2021/04 applies to Tower Limited and grants non-attributing active CFC status to the specified insurance CFC resident in Tonga.

Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 1 - **[February 2022](/tib/volume-34---2022/tib-vol-34-no1)

---------

This determination is made under section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)
-----------------------------------------------------------

A person has no attributed CFC income or loss from a CFC under sections CQ 2 and DN 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 if the CFC is a non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007 because the requirements of sections CQ 2(1)(h) and DN 2(1)(h) are not satisfied.

Section EX 21B(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that a CFC is a non-attributing active CFC if it is an insurer that meets the requirements of section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Commissioner makes a determination under that section. In the absence of such a determination, a CFC carrying on an insurance business is unlikely to be a non-attributing active CFC, because an attributable CFC amount includes the CFC’s income from an insurance business or from being an insurer under s EX 20B(3)(f) of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Section 91AAQ(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows a person to apply to the Commissioner for such a determination in respect of a CFC, if the CFC satisfies subsection (2). Pursuant to section 91AAQ(1)(a) and (7), Tower Limited has made an application to extend an earlier determination in respect of the CFC set out below. Tower Limited has a 30 September balance date.

It has been determined, having regard to the matters set out in subsections (4) and (5) of section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994, that the CFC satisfies the requirements set out in section 91AAQ(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and is accordingly a non-attributing active CFC for the purposes of section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Scope of the determination
--------------------------

The CFC to which this determination applies is:

| Name | Jurisdiction |
| --- | --- |
| National Pacific Insurance (Tonga) Limited | Tonga |

Interpretation
--------------

In this document, unless the context otherwise requires –

“Attributed CFC income or loss” means attributed CFC income under section CQ 2 or attributed CFC loss under section DN 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

“CFC” means a “controlled foreign company” as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

“Non-attributing active CFC” means a non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Determination
-------------

Pursuant to section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994, I hereby determine that the above CFC is a non-attributing active CFC for the purposes of section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Application date
----------------

This determination applies for the 2022 and 2023 income years.

This determination is signed by me this 2nd day of December 2021.

Non-attributing active insurance CFC status (Tower Limited)
===========================================================

CFC 2024/01 applies to Tower Limited and grants non-attributing active CFC status to the specified insurance CFC resident in American Samoa. 

[Tax Information Bulletin - Vol 36 No 4, May 2024](/tib/volume-36---2024/tib-vol36-no4)

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

A person has no attributed CFC income or loss from a CFC under sections CQ 2 and DN 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 if the CFC is a non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007 because the requirements of sections CQ 2(1)(h) and DN 2(1)(h) are not satisfied.

Section EX 21B(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that a CFC is a non-attributing active CFC if it is an insurer that meets the requirements of section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Commissioner makes a determination under that section. In the absence of such a determination, a CFC carrying on an insurance business is unlikely to be a non-attributing active CFC, because an attributable CFC amount includes the CFC’s income from an insurance business or from being an insurer under s EX 20B(3)(f) of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Section 91AAQ(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows a person to apply to the Commissioner for such a determination in respect of a CFC, if the CFC satisfies subsection (2).  Pursuant to section 91AAQ(1)(a) and (7), Tower Limited has made an application to extend an earlier determination in respect of the CFC set out below.  Tower Limited has a 30 September balance date.

It has been determined, having regard to the matters set out in subsections (4) and (5) of section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994, that the CFC satisfies the requirements set out in section 91AAQ(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and is accordingly a non-attributing active CFC for the purposes of section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Scope of the determination

The CFC to which this determination applies is:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Name** | **Jurisdiction** |
| National Pacific Insurance (American Samoa) Limited | American Samoa |

### Interpretation

In this document, unless the context otherwise requires –

“Attributed CFC income or loss” means attributed CFC income under section CQ 2 or attributed CFC loss under section DN 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

“CFC” means a “controlled foreign company” as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

“Non-attributing active CFC” means a non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

###  Determination

Pursuant to section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994, I hereby determine that the above CFC is a non-attributing active CFC for the purposes of section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

###  Application date

This determination applies for the 2024 and 2025 income years.

This determination is signed by me this 26th day of March 2024.

Challenge of commissioner’s assessments
=======================================

2013 case note – Taxation Review Authority found the Sale and Purchase Agreement to be one agreement only – contractual interpretation.

Case

TRA 009/12

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2004, Income Tax Act 2007

### Summary

This was a capital/revenue case involving a sale and purchase of a shopping centre that was partially completed at the time of sale. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") considered that the Sale and Purchase Agreement contained two separate agreements, one for the completed portion of the shopping centre (an undeveloped land) as at the time of the agreement, and the other for subsequent development of the undeveloped portion.

The Commissioner assessed the taxpayer on the basis that monies received for the subsequent development were revenue receipts and taxable income. The taxpayer ("the vendor") argued there was only one agreement and that all payments were capital receipts and not taxable. The Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") found for the taxpayer and cancelled the Commissioner's assessments.

### Impact of decision

The TRA concluded, on the clauses contained in the relevant contract, that it is one agreement rather than two. The decision is confined to the clauses of this particular contract.

### Facts

The taxpayer, incorporated in 1987, purchased a block of land in January 1988. The shares in the taxpayer were sold to Company P in 1996, and transferred to Company G as nominee in 1999. The land was to be developed into a shopping centre ("the Centre").

Before the development was complete, Company Y put forward a proposal to purchase the Centre "in its entirety". According to the proposal, the remaining development was to be undertaken on a "joint venture" basis.

Company Y and the taxpayer entered into an agreement for the sale and purchase of the Centre on 12 December 2003 ("the Agreement").

The taxpayer continued working on the development without any change in the plans or contractors, and found tenants. The disputant obtained funding from Company Y to complete the development as it was going to be easier. Money was advanced on commercial terms with interest charged. The remaining development was completed over a period of five years.

### Decision

In relation to interpreting the Agreement and admissibility of extrinsic evidence, Sinclair DCJ, after referring to _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Renouf Corporation_ (1998) 18 NZTC 13,914, and Justice Tipping's judgment in _Vector Gas v Bay of Plenty Energy Limited_ \[2010\] 2 NZLR 444, held that she would not place any weight on the views of the parties as to their intentions in relation to the Agreement. Rather she focussed on the key clauses of the Agreement itself.

The Commissioner submitted that despite there being a measure of uncertainty in the recitals and definitions in the agreement, clause 4.1, which set out the purchase price, clarified that the Development Option was a separate agreement. The Commissioner argued that because the purchase price only took into account the price of the completed portion of the centre, and the land of the uncompleted portion, the further development was part of a separate agreement.

Sinclair DCJ held that this clause could not be looked at in isolation. She referred to other clauses within the agreement which she considered indicated it was one agreement for the sale of the completed shopping centre. In particular, she focussed on clauses 4.3 and 4.4 which provided a mechanism for the refunding of the purchase price paid in relation to any portion of the as yet undeveloped land, if that portion was unable to be developed into large format retailing. She concluded that these clauses clearly envisaged completion of the development, and were consistent with the taxpayer's position.

The main focus of the Commissioner's submissions was on the Development Option provided for in clause 15. The Commissioner argued that the option was independent of the sale of existing buildings and future development units ("FDUs"); that if the taxpayer did not take up the option under clause 15, it would not have been required to complete the development. Further, the Commissioner argued that the taxpayer was only obliged to use its best endeavours to develop the FDUs under the option.

Sinclair DCJ found that in fact there was no option to exercise as the taxpayer was already granted an option in consideration of the sum of $1.00 already received and acknowledged by the purchaser under clause 15.1.

The Commissioner submitted that the Agreement does not provide any provision that will apply in case of a breach of the main Agreement or the Development Option. Sinclair DCJ referred to clause 16.4 where it requires the Vendor to indemnify the Purchaser against any loss or damage as a result of any breach of any term of the Agreement. Sinclair DCJ also noted that Company Y could still sue for breach of contract even if there was no specific provision in the Agreement.

The Commissioner argued that the parties were under a contractual obligation to enter into a construction contract under clauses 3.1 and 3.2 of the Sixth Schedule and this was an indication that the Development Option was a separate agreement. The Commissioner submitted that it showed the FDUs were intended to be developed under a contract for building services (within the wider Development Option) and this was inconsistent with the taxpayer's position that the contract was one agreement.

Sinclair DCJ, after referring to Justice Richardson's judgment in _Marac Life Assurance Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue and Ors; Commissioner of Inland Revenue and Ors v Marac Life Assurance Limited and Anor_ (1986) 8 NZTC 5,086, did not consider that the parties intended to enter into a construction contract in the usual sense. It was only intended to detail the arrangement in the Development Option.

The TRA concluded that the parties entered into one agreement and therefore all payments received are of a capital nature and not assessable income under sections CB 1(1) or CB 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The Commissioner's assessments were cancelled.

Challenge to jurisdiction of Taxation Review Authority fails
============================================================

2009 case note - Assessment, validity of assessment, notice of assessment, jurisdiction of the Taxation Review Authority, procedural requirements of Revenue Acts.

Case

J D and CE Henson Partnership & Ors v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1976, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The appellants' challenge to the jurisdiction of the Taxation Review Authority was unsuccessful. The appellants' argued that the notices of assessment issued by the Commissioner were invalid, as they did not quantify the amount of tax owing. The appellants contended that the Taxation Review Authority did not have jurisdiction to determine a challenge when the notices of assessment issued were invalid.

The Court of Appeal confirmed that the jurisdiction of the Taxation Review Authority to determine tax challenges arises from section 138B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA"). A notice of assessment commences the statutory time periods to initiate a challenge to an assessment, but is a separate and ancillary step to the assessment itself.

### Impact of decision

This judgment confirms the existing case law regarding the distinction between assessments and notices of assessment. It reiterates that in accordance with section 114 of the TAA, the Commissioner's failure to comply with procedural requirements of the Revenue Acts will not invalidate an assessment.

### Facts

The appellants' partnership had business interests in farming and an electrical equipment company. Following an investigation into the partnership's tax affairs, the Commissioner issued manual notices of assessment for the 1992-1995 income tax years on 17 September 1996. The notices of assessment set out the adjustments to be made to the assessable income returned by the appellants, but did not quantify the amount of tax payable. On 15 October 1996, the Commissioner issued statements of account.

Further discussions regarding the assessments were held with the appellants and subsequent notices of assessment were issued on 20 February 1997. These notices were also manually prepared and specified the adjusted assessable income of the appellants and did not quantify the amount of tax to be paid. On 26 February 1997 statements of account were issued to reflect the re-assessments made.

Following a disagreement over the validity of the Commissioner's assessments and the appellants' dispute of the assessments, the appellants commenced Judicial Review proceedings against the Commissioner. The Judicial Review proceedings were settled by way of Deed. The Settlement Deed stated that the Commissioner agreed to accept the appellants' notices of proposed adjustment outside the statutory response period.

The appellants' challenge to the correctness and the validity of the assessments were unsuccessful before the Taxation Review Authority and the High Court. The appellants then appealed to the Court of Appeal, challenging the jurisdiction of the Taxation Review Authority to hear the challenge proceedings.

### Decision

The appeal was dismissed.

The Court of Appeal reiterated at paragraph \[19\], that it is settled law that an assessment is a decision by the Commissioner quantifying the amount of tax payable by the taxpayer; it must be definitive as to the taxpayer's liability and is subject to challenge only through the statutory disputes process.

The Court noted that the legislation contemplates that a taxpayer is to be given notice of an assessment as soon as convenient (section 111 of the TAA), but that failure to give such notice does not affect the validity of the assessment itself (section 111(6) of the TAA).

A taxpayer's liability to pay tax arises when an assessment is made, the notices of assessment gives rise to the procedural process of the disputes resolution and challenge process contained in Part IVA and VIIIA of the TAA (paragraph \[22\] of the Judgment).

The Court of Appeal stated at paragraph \[26\] of the judgment that the jurisdiction of the Taxation Review Authority arises from section 138B of the TAA, not from the notice of assessment. The notice of assessment determines the commencement of the statutory time period for the challenge proceedings to be commenced.

[All GST dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[GST (goods and services tax)])

You may need to adjust the GST claimed if the business, exempt or private use of a good or service changes.

You may need to make a change in use adjustment when the actual taxable use varies from the intended taxable use.

See Ben's example below.

When adjustments are not required
---------------------------------

You will not need to make an adjustment if:

*   the GST exclusive cost of the good or service is $10,000 or less.
*   the value of the adjustment is less than $1,000 and the change in taxable use is less than 10%
*   you make taxable and exempt supplies, when the total value of the exempt supplies in an adjustment period is less than $90,000 and 5% of the total consideration for all taxable and exempt supplies in the adjustment period.

[GST adjustments for business, private and exempt use](/gst/gst-adjustments)
 

Number of GST adjustment periods
--------------------------------

From 1 April 2023, the number and the value of the adjustment periods have changed. Fewer adjustments are required for land, as well as goods and services less than $20,000.

The number of times you need to review the taxable use (referred to as the number of adjustment periods) will depend on the GST exclusive cost of the good or service.

| GST-exclusive cost | **Adjustment periods** |
| --- | --- |
| Up to $10,000 | 0   |
| $10,001 - $20,000 | 2   |
| $20,001 - $500,000 | 5   |
| Over $500,000 or land (of any value) | 10  |

You can choose your first adjustment period. It will be from the date of acquisition of the good or service, until the end of one of the following:

*   your current income year
*   the income year at least 12 months after the date of acquisition.

Each adjustment period after this is the same as your tax year.

### Other methods

You can also choose to use the estimated useful life of an asset for the maximum number of adjustment periods.

[Claiming depreciation](https://www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-expenses/depreciation/claiming-depreciation)

Wash-up adjustment when the percentage use of goods or services permanently changes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A wash-up adjustment is used when the business, exempt or private use of a good or service changes and you do not expect it to change again. Work out the adjustment using this calculation:

(Full GST amount x new percentage) – actual deduction = wash-up adjustment

*   The full GST amount of the good or service. For a zero-rated land transaction, this would be 15% of the purchase price.
*   New percentage is the percentage of intended use.
*   Actual deduction is the GST previously claimed, including adjustments.

If you make a wash-up adjustment, you'll no longer have to make annual adjustments.

If your good or service changes in use later, you’ll need to make another adjustment.

This adjustment needs to be made when the use changes and remains unchanged for a full adjustment period, even if the change is within the 10% or $1,000 threshold.

Final adjustment on disposal of an asset used in a taxable activity
-------------------------------------------------------------------

You need to make a final adjustment when you dispose of the asset to allow for any GST which has not been claimed.

Use the following calculation to work out the final adjustment:

Tax fraction x Consideration x (1 – Previous use)

*   Tax fraction is 15% of the GST exclusive amount or 3/23rds of the GST inclusive amount
*   Consideration is the amount received, or treated as received, for the supply.
*   Previous use is the percentage intended use (if owned less than an adjustment period) or the previous actual use in the last adjustment period before disposal.

Maximum adjustment for property developers
------------------------------------------

If you're a property developer, your final adjustment cannot exceed the tax fraction of the purchase price when you first acquired the asset.

Example: Ben buys a car

Ben operates a GST registered business. He bought a car to use in his business. Ben claimed the vehicle purchase based on an estimated business use of 80%. Ben ends up using the vehicle 100% for his business. Ben can claim the remaining 20% of the vehicle cost in the first GST return after his balance date.

Ben needs to monitor his business use. If his business use changes, he may need to make another change in use adjustment, after his next balance date.

To determine whether a change in use adjustment is required, you need to review the taxable use of goods or services.

Example: Number of GST adjustment periods

Sally bought a vehicle for her GST registered business on 1 June 2020 for $15,000 (GST exclusive). As the vehicle was used 100% for her business, Sally claimed the full amount of GST.

Before 1 April 2023, Sally had to monitor her business use over 5 adjustment periods.

After 1 April 2023, Sally can stop monitoring her vehicle use (for GST purposes), as the required number of adjustment periods has been reduced.

Example: Final adjustment on disposal

Melissa buys a car for $46,000 (inclusive of $6,000 GST). She claims 70% input tax of $4,200. The car is later sold for $30,000 (GST inclusive). As Melissa did not claim the full GST on the car, she needs to make a final adjustment, calculated as follows:

3/23 x $30,000 x (1 - 0.7) = $1,174

Example: Maximum adjustment for property developers

Emily, a property developer bought an apartment to renovate and rent. The input tax on the cost of the property, plus renovations was $60,000. Emily claimed 64.8% of the input tax - $38,880, because the property had a mix of taxable and exempt use.

Emily sold the apartment for $640,000.

As Emily has not claimed the full input for the purchase and renovation cost she makes a final adjustment of the input tax:

3/23 x $640,000 x (1- 0.648) = $29,384

When Emily adds $29,384 to the deduction already claimed ($38,880), this is more than the total amount of the input on the supply ($60,000). As Emily is a property developer selling land, her adjustment is limited to $21,120.

Change management - Delivery
============================

Effective change management was a critical success factor in our transformation. While our foundations were solid and tools effective, we learned a lot across the different releases.

As with other programme disciplines from design, through testing and stakeholder management, Stage 1 gave us a much better understanding of the impact of change on both our people and customers.  We used what we learnt to tweak our approach to better support our people and customers through the change.  

Change management methodology 
------------------------------

Our change management methodology was underpinned by a change management framework which provided a well-tested structured approach to managing change throughout the transformation. 

We used a set of tools to understand what the change impacts were for our people and customers across the dimensions of the framework. These tools included a change impact assessment and change management plan covering communications, training, user support requirements and transition approach. 

This approach enabled leaders, our people and customers to understand what the change meant for them, what action they needed to take and how they would be supported through the change. 

[Change Management frameworks overview (PDF 4MB) Download document](/-/media/project/ir/home/documents/about-us/bt-guide/delivering-the-transformation/delivery-learning-and-improving/change-management/change-management-frameworks-overview.pdf?modified=20220805034100&modified=20220805034100)

Steps in the change process
---------------------------

Assessing the impacts on stakeholders
-------------------------------------

When assessing change impacts, we considered 3 things: 

*   What is the change, and the scope of change? 
*   Which associated business processes may change 
*   Who will be impacted by the change (teams, groups or roles), and to what extent (internal and external)? 

With this information we were able to compile a high-level change impact assessment.

Creating a Change Management Plan
---------------------------------

The Change Management plan set out the overall approach to implementing the change. It outlined how we would implement the change to minimise disruption for the business, customers and people, whilst mitigating risk. The impact assessment formed the core of the Change Management Plan and served as a guiding principle as to how stakeholders would be supported through the change. In addition, the Change Management Plan encompassed the Stakeholder and Communications Plan, learning (training) and early life support plans.

From a delivery perspective, the plan included a timeline (phases) showing a detailed view of change management activities at each phase. It also provided detail around the support to be provided once the implementation was complete, and how the change would be transitioned into BAU (business as usual) once implemented.

Communication and engagement
----------------------------

Communication and engagement are fundamental drivers of change. Our plans included:  

*   communication and engagement principles 
*   a summary of target audiences  
*   channels to be used to reach specific audiences 
*   key messaging
*   a schedule of tactical communication and engagement activities. 

[Communications and stakeholder management](/about-us/business-transformation/delivering-our-transformation/delivery-learning-and-improving/communications-and-stakeholder-management)

Developing a training plan
--------------------------

We developed comprehensive training programmes ahead of each release, to provide opportunities for hands-on experience with new systems and processes. On average, our front-line people had around 3 days of mandatory training for each release, equating to 18 days of training overall per person.

Our training approach was based on the ADDIE model to plan and deliver training for Business Transformation (ADDIE = Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation.) 

The first step (Analysis) was to gain an understanding of the current versus future situation, and what gap needed to be filled. We developed a training and user support approach and training needs analysis which helped us understand the audience and what problem we were trying to solve. Other details like the training delivery mechanism, current (user) knowledge base, and the desired behavioural outcomes were also documented in the training needs analysis.  

The next step was to 'design' the learning curriculum and training implementation plan.

Our design approach was 70:20:10 which meant: 

*   70% learning through experience 
*   20% learning through other’s experience 
*   10% learning through training events with a defined learning objective.  

This is another area in which we adapted our approach as we went, based on feedback from our people about what was working for them and what was not. For example, after the first release in February 2017 we refined our approach and included more time for informal and on-the-job learning, more tailored practice prior to go-live, and smaller groups for classroom-based training

Once the design had been completed, we moved on to 'developing' training solutions which included the learning content development, resourcing and logistics.  

The 'implementation' step included delivery of training based on all the previous steps.  

Finally, 'evaluation' formed an integral part of each step. It included post training evaluation in the ‘classroom’ to measure the learner’s confidence to apply their learnings. We also conducted post-implementation review and lessons learnt sessions.

Supporting people through organisational change
-----------------------------------------------

The executive leadership team led the top-down design for the new organisation, focusing on what we expected to be doing in future, rather than what we were doing at the time. The design team was made up of a mix of people with deep knowledge of Inland Revenue, supported by change managers.

Moving to a new organisation design, with fewer management layers, capability-based roles, and devolved decision-making was a critical part of our transformation. Although we were open and honest with our people from a very early stage about the changes that could be made, including being a smaller organisation at the end of the programme, the change process was still hard for people.

We worked closely with unions, investing time in consultation and engagement. We also brought our union colleagues into the design process, specifically around task-based and broader roles

Transformative changes are disruptive and at times emotionally traumatic for people – the soft stuff is the hard stuff. We expected that it would be hard, and at times, it was. We were careful to value the past but focus on the future.

Information is easy to access and knowledge is easy to obtain. Knowledge is easy to share. All of our people will be impacted by the change, with a Low-Medium impact for most. Change considerations take into account user behaviour, trust and confidence. Change Considerations: •Important to build trust and confidence in new tool(s) as a fast, authoritative, accurate source of information. •Encourage view of IKM as an ‘ecosystem’ that everyone is part of. Need to provide a closed feedback loop with consumers. •Visible support will be required by leaders to assist with adoption/embedding. •Focus on required behaviour and culture change to embed and realise benefits. •Utilise specialist users to support behaviour change for new search functionality •Give consideration to implementation plan, taking into account other changes underway that impact on our people. •Put in place clear process and expectations for resolving errors and gaps in content. •Consider how to build trust in content creators – show they understand needs of consumers. •Need to establish accessibility of content and implementation support for people with a disability. •Need to give further consideration to how IRKB team in C&O/START Help in BT are impacted •Transition to BAU and ongoing content management, support, embedding. •Consider potential for change challenges: - On top of other recent new information systems this is another change, which could be beneficial or seen another thing to learn. - Could return too much information/make it harder for people - Too many different tools to choose from. 14 IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The Organisation Change Management Plan •Sets out the overall approach to implementing the change and supports decision making about the project implementation •Considers how to best implement the change so as to minimise disruption for our business, customers and people and mitigate any change considerations or risks identified. •Builds on the impact assessment to consider the best way to support our people through the change, enable to them to feel capable of working in the new environment or with new systems/tools and consider accessibility. •May include or link to sub-plans – stakeholder & communications, learning, early life support •Will likely include a timeline or phases aligned to the project delivery, and look at what change management activities are needed at each phase •Also considers what support is needed after implementation and how this will be managed in BAU. 15 IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Developing the Change Management Plan Using the impact assessment and what you know about each impacted area of the business to consider: •A rule of thumb is the more highly impacted, the more care and effort will be required to provide change support •Also think about how critical the area is for change takeup, and how well they are likely to adapt to the change •Use this information to form the 'change groups’ or to segment users according to criteria such as ‘Complex user’, ‘standard user’, ‘occasional user’. Then consider: •How many people are in each group and where are they located? •Are there any significant changes to roles/duties identified – contact HR to confirm. •What support is this group likely to need to be able take up the change and minimise disruption? What will their managers/leaders need? What will specialists/key users need? •What is the best channel(s) for communications for this group? It may be through leaders, through formal channels, through change champions – what will they need to be able to communicate effectively? How specific/targeted do the communications needs to be? •Is there a requirement for learning/training? What is the best approach for learning (a training needs analysis will support this) – e.g. classroom training, on-line modules, written instructions, on-the-job learning supported by knowledge articles? Consider how many people require learning/training, geographic spread, delivery method, complexity of the learning required, accessibilityand cost. •How will we know people are ready for the change? Could be assessed using survey's, interviews, check-ins with key people/change champions. •What support will be needed after go-live? Consider how intensive this support should be, who is best placed to provide it and for how long. Will the Support Portal be used? How will issues be triaged and managed? 16 IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Change Group Definitions Change Group Group A Assessedashighlyto very highly impacted. These teams are critical for change up-take and need to be ready for go-live so they can continue to do their work. They need close change management, communicationsand a high level of training and user support, including time, coaching and support from their leaders so they can apply their learning on the job. Group B Assessed as moderately to highly impacted. These teams are important for change up-take and need to be ready for go-live. Their work would be disrupted if they are not informed and trained.They need change management, communications and a medium to high level of training and user support, including time, coaching and support from their leaders so they can apply their learning on the job. Group C Assessed as low to moderately impacted. These teams are important for change up-take and their work could be disrupted if they are not informed and trained. They need some change management, communications and a low to medium level of training and user support, including time, coaching and support from their leaders so they can apply their learning on the job. Group D Need awareness and communications but not critical to enable them to continue their work or for change up-take. No training or user support required. Change groups put together those teams which are similarly impacted by the change. Support activities will be tailored by change group - and even within each change group - so that the right type and amount of support is given. 17 IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Change Management Approach 18 IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example: Change Plan START Release 3 The 6 part change plan has been adapted to a 6 + 1 change plan for START release 3.0.

Internal stakeholder management principles •Start fromthe top.We know that the more engaged and informed our leaders are, the more engaged and informed their people will be. •Focus on ourend-goal.We will always come back to the core of our transformation, why we’re doing this—we’re making tax simpler for New Zealanders. •Give our people a voice.We will offer interactive communication formats to give groups most impacted by change a chance to share their opinions, ask questions and raise concerns, at specific times through the communications and change process. •Be mindful of the volume and impact of our communications.We will have a view across all streams of BT communications to minimise the risk of overwhelming people with information on the changes taking place. 20 IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Stakeholder Engagement & Communications Plan 21 IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Training Needs Analysis and Training Plan ●Consider what people need to know to continue to do their role with the new tool/process etc. Is there a learning need or is it communications that are required? ●If the change is being delivered by an external vendor (usually technology related) what training/learning do they provide, and does it need to be adapted to suit IR? What training environments are provided? ●Consider who needs what level of training – usually according to role or user categories – and how many people, in what businessgroup(s) and where they are based (the impact assessment will help with this) ●Break learning/training into components. These may be based around a topic, product, process or system functionality. ●Consider the best mechanism for delivery– On the job, classroom, on-line modules or self study guides, supporting material e.g. FAQ’s, guides. Think about how users will best access learning, particularly in the contact centres, and for those with accessibility requirements. ●The training plan may also estimate costs e.g. trainer time/travel/ time required/any special equipment or learning environmentsrequired. Is instructional design capability required to develop materials? ●Also consider logistics e.g. if classroom training, what equipment/set up is needed, does everyone have access to a laptop, roomavailability etc, on-line booking, recording completion etc. Note: ●The approach for learning/training for change management differs from that used to address a performance issue –our focus is onwhat people need to learn as a result of a change being delivered to continue do their job and feel capable. It is usually aimed at groups of peopleand assumes competence in their current role. Individual performance is the responsibility of the people manager/HR, not the project. 22 IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Training & Learning Delivery Plan –STAX example 23 IN CONFIDENCE -

The Readiness Framework has been developed to provide a singular approach and framework for stakeholders contributing to readiness assessment and release decision making. TheReadiness Framework is a decision support tool designed to provide status & visibility that the release is “where we planned to be” at a particular Checkpoint. Checkpoints 37 IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 3 •The Readiness Framework provides the structure and purpose for the readiness checklists, assessments and reports used at key checkpoints leading up to and during deployment for the main/major releases of the BT Programme •The Framework enables the release to assess progress and readiness to move from one stage of the deployment lifecycle to the next. •Re adiness is assessed at each of the checkpoints against a specific set of criteria, with residual risk visible throughout.The size , reach, functional spread and complexityof a releaseinfluences thebreadth and coverage of thecriteria assessed. •These criteria (or questions) are specific to a checkpoint and release,collectively reflecting the readiness of our Customers,Service Providers, People, Business Units and the Release Delivery team. •The cumulative impact of prior Releases, other business activity and environmental conditions is assessed. •The assessment allows for the exception reporting to be tailored for Business Unit, Programme and Customer. •An Executive Summary is prepared which reports on an exception basis only.Criteri a rated red, light red or amber are included, providing information to decision makers on the potential business and/or implementation risk, with visibility of the “go to green” plans and residual risk these hold for the business. Light Amber rated criteria may also be included should these be assessed as required, discretion will be applied. •There will be an agreed checkpoint timeline and additional checkpoints will be added as required to provide both additional assessme nt and certainty for decision makers. •The Enterprise Risk Framework and RAG status definitions are used to provide a consistent, familiar and standard reference. •Checkpoint dates are aligned with delivery phase gates,schedule d governance meetings, channel shutdown requirements, etc and the method will allow for additional decision meetings to be scheduled as required based on the programme status at the time. •Note: Readiness for smaller / shorter running initiatives will complete an initiative readiness assessmentas par t of theirgo-l ive preparation which will not include a separate Business, Customer and People readiness component. These assessments will be covered by specific criteria within the Initiative checklist. START Delivery – Main Releases Readiness Framework Overview 38 IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 4 •The framework provides the structure and purpose for the readiness assessment and reports used at checkpoints during the delivery lifecycle. •Readiness is assessed against a specific set of criteria (contained in a “master” initiatives readiness checklist), at agreeddates or che ckpoints, with both plans to green if applicable and residual risk captured throughout. •The size, complexity and functional spread of an initiative influencesthecriteria assessed and the number of checks completed.The checklist is adapted to suit. Criteria are never deleted, rather a column is provided for initiative specific positioning of the criteria – how it applies or does not apply, to the specific initiative. •Criteria (or questions) are specific to a checkpoint and initiative, collectively reflecting the readiness of the initiative to either commence the deployment (the go/no-go) or proceed from a key stage/control gate to the next. •The number of checks may vary from the minimum of one (1) check immediately preceding the go-live (th e go/no-go) as part of the deployment preparation, to multiple checks leading up to the go-live (the go/no-go) check. The initiative charter will define the approach to be used. •The cumulative impact of business-as-usual a ctivity, other initiatives, prior initiatives andenvironmental conditions (e.g., an election, holidays, etc) is also assessed. •The initiative readiness checklist does not include a separate Business, Customer and People readiness component.These asses sments are be covered by specific criteria within the initiative readiness checklist. •There will be an agreed checkpoint timeline, checkpoint dates will be aligned with delivery phase gates,schedu led governance meetings, channel shutdown requirements, etc and the method will allow for additional decision meetings to be scheduled as required based on the initiative status at the time and to provide certainty for decision makers. •An Executive Summary is prepared which reports on an exception basis only.Criteri a rated red, light red or amber are included, providing information to decision makers on the potential business and/or implementation risk, with visibility of the “go to green” plans and residual risk these hold for the business.Light Amber (LA) rated criteria may also be included should these be assessed as required, discretion will be applied. •The Enterprise Risk Framework and RAG status definitions are used to provide a consistent, familiar and standard reference.

Readiness will vary by product and customer segment to recognise when the change needs to land with the customer, i.e., some readiness criteria extend beyond go-live. •Members of the External Stakeholder Engagement working group will review and endorse the assessment for each checkpoint, including go to green plans where required. Customer segment leads will also review and provide feedback of the high-level assessment against criteria based on “where we expect to be” for each checkpoint. What’s different this release? Given the targeted customer groups impacted and smaller scale of the releases and initiatives in Stage 4: •No customer insight research is being conducted to inform the readiness assessment or marketing effectiveness, although this will be conductedfor S4-1-R2 (child support and upgrading myIRto version 12). •Customer interaction testing of myIRwill be reviewed and considered. •Customer readiness will be assessed against agreed criteria as reported by Community Compliance, Account Managers, Product Owners, Digital Ecosystem Team and others based on their interactions with customers and stakeholders using the risk RAG ratings detailed overleaf. Components of the Customer Readiness Assessment •Utilise metrics and data already collected including those relating to marketing & communications activities, for example, reach of direct mail, social media and advertising. •Reports via Account Managers (Account Managers, External Relationship Managers, Community Compliance and Significant Enterprises) against specific criteria on the readiness status of the customers, intermediaries and service partners they engage with. •Insights from Customer Design Validation into customers’ expectations of e-Services, including ease of use. •Assessment of known risks and issues. 55 IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 21 Customer Readiness Reporting At checkpoint 2 and 3, customer readiness reporting provides the information required to satisfy the needs of the target audience to enable decision making e.g., customer readiness will be assessed by product and defined customer sub-segment.

Components of the People Readiness Assessment Approach •“Close up” team interviews which are 30 minute discussions with the highly impacted teams using open ended questions to tease out themes and insights. Utilised mainly for those in Change Group A. •Team Surveys which are 6-7 minute surveys completed by the Team Lead following a team discussion based on a set of provided questions to assess the team's current level of awareness, understanding and readiness. Utilised for those in Change Group A and B). •Pulse Check Surveys which takes 1-2 minutes completed by a random sample of people from across the organisation to assess levels of awareness and understanding before go-live.

Consistent and sustainable leadership 7. Change take up inside Inland Revenue External 8. a)Customer and community take up b) Intermediaries and third party take up c) Government agency take up and support 9. Unknown external environment impacts are managed Challenges Impacts Architecture Delivery Model WHAT HOW The BT Change Management Strategy v2.0 sets out the approach and architecture by which Inland Revenue will manage and implement Business Transformation changes. The strategy recognises that: a)that BT is a long term complex programme that through stages of development and implementation will fundamentally change Inland Revenue’s business operations, customer services, processes, policies, technology, structure and capabilities. b)that Inland Revenue will need to manage significant change over an extended period of time to almost every aspect of IR’s business while continuing to deliver today’s business. With this backdrop, the BT Change Management Strategy V2.0 covers wide reaching and necessary ground starting with a strong foundational base required to manage the scale, complexity and extended timeframe of Business Transformation. The BT’s Change Management strategy will ensure: •On-going focus will be required with regard to the nine key change challenges that we must manage with precision and endurance and some through a stringent risk based approach. •The establishment of an industrial strength change management architecture with four multifaceted and dynamic layers across the enterprise, across all stakeholders and inside each of the delivery work packages. •BT continues to invest in a delivery model that ‘pushes’ change from the centre and is ‘pulled’ and led by the business. •BT continues to undertake organisation impact assessments to ensure that the scale and size of change is well understood and the change narrative is active for our customers, external groups and stakeholder. Change Foundations The challenges and impact assessments tell us what needs to be managed and what is changing, such as: •Responding to and mitigating the nine BT change challenges and risks •Identifying and understanding the scale, magnitude, complexity of the impact of BT changes. The architecture and delivery model are how we will be managing the transformation change, by: •Establishing a robust and industrial strength architecture and delivery model to manage the high risk profile of the change for internal and external stakeholders. Change Foundations BT Change Management Strategy 2.0 WHY IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 2 The BT’s Change Management Strategy uses the change architecture as a framework and comprises 4 layers and 16 components. Each layer is a specific aspect of change that needs to be considered, managed and delivered in BTs Change Management strategy to ensure that Inland Revenue has a structured and comprehensive change response to BT. The activities and key deliverables in each component are focussed primarily on the Design phase in 2015/16 and will endure through build and deploy. Moving forward, a detailed roadmap of deliverables and activities has been designed to deliver the change management strategy and the integrated components of the architecture BT Change Management Strategy 2.0 Measurement A form of measurement will be reported on quarterly and applied to help us adjust and fine tune BT’s change management strategy over time. In Summary: The BT Change Management strategy addresses the top of mind question of ‘how’ Inland Revenue will manage the scale and size of the change being delivered by Business Transformation. This will be through strategies, specialists, initiatives and investment to: •Retain and grow our leaders who are committed to transforming, leading and supporting our people, customers and external groups through the change. •Communicate consistently and regularly to our people and all of our stakeholders. •Preserve the best of our current culture while shifting to new ways of working that support the transformation changes and new operating models. •Establish change thresholds to safeguard our organisational capacity and to provide an early warning system to manage key risks around business disruption, change absorption and take up. •Firmly stand up a change management strategy that is anchored by an industrial strength architecture that consistently addresses and responds to the nine (9) BT change challenges. •Invest in up-skilling and retraining our people for positive and quality results but also recognise the need to balance long term employment sustainability with business needs. •Commence dedicated change management work in the highly impacted areas of TS&O and Service Delivery in 2014.

Ngā panoni ki te Common Reporting Standard for 2021 Changes to the Common Reporting Standard for 2021
=====================================================================================================

There are some new technical changes happening to the CRS for 2021. These may have an impact on reporting New Zealand financial institutions (NZFIs).

Important

These changes relate to the technical requirements of the data, as prescribed by the CRS XML schema. They do not impact the reporting or due diligence requirements for NZFIs.

The OECD has published an updated ‘Common Reporting Standard XML Schema User Guide for Tax Administrators – Version 3.0’ that provides guidance on the new XML schema (XML schema 2.0) which reflects the new reporting standard.  The new XML schema files have also been published online by the OECD.

Timeline for implementing changes
---------------------------------

From 1 February 2021, all reporting for CRS will need to conform with the new schema, including any corrections to prior reporting periods.

Important

For NZFIs, this means that CRS reporting for the 31 March 2021 year, due to be filed with Inland Revenue by 30 June 2021, will need to comply with the new standard.

Impact for NZFIs
----------------

NZFIs that file using XML will need to ensure that their XML files conform with the new XML schema for the 31 March 2021 reporting year.

NZFIs that use Excel will need to ensure that they are using an up-to-date Excel template. This will be available in myIR from 1 February 2021.

NZFIs that use the online form can continue to do so.

### Changes for all NZFI filers

The following changes apply to all filing methods.

| Change | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Update to country and currency lists | The latest schema has been aligned to the latest updates to the standards set by the International Organization for Standardization. This includes the country code 'XK' for Kosovo. |
| Maximum and minimum length for all string elements | All string (text) elements now have a minimum length of 1 character and a maximum of 200 characters.<br><br>Where the element is required data, a value must be provided for the report to be complete.<br><br>For optional elements, where there is no value, these elements must be omitted. |

### Additional changes for XML filers

In addition to the changes above, NZFIs that file using XML will need to ensure their files comply with the following changes and be aware of the new validation errors.

| Change | Details |
| --- | --- |
| 'Message Type Indicator' now mandatory | The element 'MessageTypeIndic' which indicates if an XML file is new data or corrected/deleted data will now be required to pass validation under the new schema. This was previously an optional element. |
| Schema 'version' attribute now mandatory | The attribute ‘version’ for the root element CRS\_OECD will now be mandatory. This attribute will need to be set to “2.0” for the new schema. The new root element for the XML should be similar (but may differ in namespaces) to the following:<br><br><crs:CRS\_OECD xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:iso="urn:oecd:ties:isocrstypes:v1" xmlns:cfc="urn:oecd:ties:commontypesfatcacrs:v2" xmlns:crs="urn:oecd:ties:crs:v2" xmlns:ftc="urn:oecd:ties:fatca:v1" xmlns:stf="urn:oecd:ties:crsstf:v5" version="2.0"> |

Changes in GST taxable periods
==============================

2006 amendment corrects legislation that aligns provisional tax payments with GST payment dates and enables taxpayers to change their GST taxable periods.

##### Sections 15C and 15D of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985

Two amendments have been made to correct legislation already enacted to align provisional tax payments with GST payment dates.

These changes enable taxpayers to change from accounting for GST on a six-monthly or two-monthly basis to a monthly basis or from accounting for GST on a monthly basis to a two-monthly basis. The amending legislation also provides for when changes in taxable periods take effect from.

### Background

The recently enacted changes in the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act to align provisional tax payments with GST due dates did not replicate the current policy of allowing GST-registered taxpayers to change their taxable periods.

### Application date

These amendments apply from the 2008-09 income year, if the taxpayer derives assessable income in that year, or in all other situations the changes apply to taxable periods beginning on or after 1 April 2008.

### Key features

Two amendments have been made to the GST Act 1985. The first amends section 15C to enable taxpayers who account for GST on a six-monthly or two-monthly basis to change to accounting for GST on a monthly basis. The amendment also enables taxpayers who account for GST on a monthly basis to change to a two-monthly basis.

The second amends section 15D(1)(a) to ensure that the provisions determining when a change in GST taxable period takes effect from (section 15C) apply when a taxpayer changes from a six-monthly to two-monthly basis or where a taxpayer is required to change to a monthly basis because their taxable supplies exceeded the $4 million threshold.

[Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2010](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-budget-measures-act-2010 "Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2010")

Changes to building depreciation
================================

2010 legislation changes the depreciation rate of buildings with long estimated useful lives and provides provisional depreciation rates for categories of buildings.

**_Sections EE 31, EE 35(2), EE 48(1), EE 61, EE 64(2), EE 37, EZ 13(2), EZ 14(1) and schedule 39 of the Income Tax Act 2007_**

Budget 2010 introduced changes to the depreciation rate of buildings. The changes were intended to make New Zealand's tax rules more neutral by recognising that allowing depreciation on long-lived buildings and the application of depreciation loading on certain assets provides tax depreciation rates in excess of true economic deprecation rates.

The depreciation rate of buildings with long estimated useful lives has been changed to 0%. This new rate applies to all such buildings regardless of when they were purchased. This change is intended to make New Zealand's tax rules more neutral and non-distortionary.

### Background

Buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years have been able to be depreciated for tax purposes at a rate of 2% per annum. However, analysis of New Zealand building price data between 1993 and 2009 shows that, on average, buildings have actually been increasing in value. This suggests that the 2% depreciation rate is not appropriate.

### Key features

*   The annual depreciation rate for buildings has been set to 0% if they have estimated useful lives of 50 years or more, as determined by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue.
*   The annual depreciation rate has also been set to 0% for certain buildings that are excluded depreciable property and that are similar to the types of buildings with estimated useful lives of 50 years, as these do not have estimated useful lives.
*   This new rate applies regardless of when a building was acquired.
*   Building owners that have previously claimed a depreciation deduction on their buildings are still required to pay depreciation recovery if they sell a building for more than its tax book value.
*   To ensure that the policy works as intended, special depreciation rates are no longer allowed for buildings. The definition of "temporary building" has also been amended.

### Detailed analysis

#### _Annual rate for buildings with long estimated useful lives_

Sections EE 31, EZ 13 and EZ 14 have been amended to provide that buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more will have an annual depreciation rate of 0% for tax purposes. This 0% rate is a statutory rate and overrides the rates set by determination issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue.

The changes to section EE 31 apply to buildings acquired during or after the 1995-96 income year, while the changes to section EZ 13 and EZ 14 apply to buildings acquired after 1 April 1993 but before the end of the 1994-95 income year.

These buildings are still depreciable property, but have a 0% annual depreciation rate. This means that the other depreciation provisions, such as those providing for depreciation recovery, still apply.

While the depreciation rate for these buildings is 0%, the depreciation rate for items used in, but not part of, these buildings remains unchanged, and they can continue to be depreciated separately from the building itself.

For residential rental properties, the interpretation statement, _Residential rental properties - depreciation of depreciable assets_ (IS 10/01), sets out how to determine whether an item is part of a building or separately depreciable.

For non-residential properties, the Government has indicated that it will be reviewing which items can be depreciated separately from a building. If necessary, the tax rules will be amended before 1 April 2011 to clarify the law on this point.

#### _Repairs and maintenance_

These changes do not affect the deductibility of repairs and maintenance. While this can be a complicated matter, with the correct treatment often being a question of both fact and degree, some general guidance is set out below.

There is a two-stage approach to determine whether certain expenditure is deductible:

1.  Identify the relevant asset - that is, is the item being repaired/replaced part of a larger asset (such as the roof of a house), or is it a single asset (for example, a television).
2.  Ascertain the nature, extent and cost of the work undertaken. This will involve determining whether the work remedied wear and tear (generally deductible), or whether the asset has been improved or otherwise substantially changed (generally non-deductible).

In relation to step 2, some relevant factors are:

*   If the expenditure does no more than restore an asset to its condition on purchase, it is likely to be deductible. This can hold even if the work is carried out over several years.
*   This applies even if what is being replaced or repaired is improved, for example, because of new technology or better design, provided the work does not alter a substantial part of the asset.
*   Expenditure on the renewal, replacement or reconstruction of a substantial portion of the asset goes beyond repair, and is generally not deductible repairs and maintenance.
*   Work that results in a significant increase in an asset's value, or is unusually expensive, is more likely to be considered capital in nature.

As discussed above, a building can have many different parts. Repairing or replacing something that forms part of a building, provided it does not substantially improve or alter the value or function of the building, is likely to be deductible. If, on the other hand, a substantial amount of work is involved, or the building is improved in some way, it is likely that this will be non-deductible capital expenditure. For example, the replacement of a toilet that has fallen into disrepair in a residential house (which is part of the building as per IS 10/01) is likely to be deductible as repairs and maintenance. On the other hand, if the entire bathroom were to be re-designed and completely re-fitted, this is more likely to be a non-deductible capital improvement.

#### _Definition of "building"_

These amendments only affect the depreciation rate of buildings - there are no changes to the depreciation rates for structures. What a "building" is, for the purposes of the depreciation provisions, therefore becomes important. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue's view on this is set out in the recently released interpretation statement _Meaning of "building" in the depreciation provisions_ (IS 10/02).

In essence, a building is a structure that has walls and a roof, is of considerable size, is meant to last a considerable period of time and is generally fixed to the land where it stands. For example, a house has the above features and so would be considered a building. However, a dam does not (it lacks walls and a roof), so would not be considered a building.

For more guidance on this issue, the [interpretation statement IS 10/02](/interpretation-statements/is1002-meaning-of-building-in-the-depreciation-provisions)
 is available on Inland Revenue's website.

#### _Interpretation of "estimated useful life"_

An item's estimated useful life is the estimated useful life for that type of item, as set out in a determination issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Additionally, when interpreting an item's estimated useful life, the "whole of life" approach should be taken. For example, if a person purchases a second-hand item with an estimated useful life of 50 years, its estimated useful life will still be 50 years, regardless of how old the item actually is.

#### _No special rate for buildings_

Amendments to section EE 35(2) mean that special depreciation rates can no longer be set for buildings, regardless of their estimated useful lives. Special depreciation rates are granted in situations where a specific item's economic depreciation rate is either faster or slower than the rate set by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. This change has effect from 20 May 2010.

The ability to apply for special rates for buildings is being removed as allowing these is inconsistent with the general view that buildings, do not on average, decline in value.

However, provisional depreciation rates can still be set for classes of buildings. If the Commissioner of Inland Revenue issues a provisional rate for a class of building stating that it has an estimated useful life of less than 50 years, owners of affected buildings will be able to claim depreciation deductions.

Provisional depreciation rates are granted when there is no applicable rate for the type of item owned, excluding the default class. To have a provisional rate granted, an owner must satisfy the Commissioner that the building does not come within an existing asset category.

Applications for provisional rates can be made using the form [IR260A](https://www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides/keyword/businessincometax/ir260a-form-provisional-depreciation.html)
, available from Inland Revenue's website.

#### _Special excluded depreciable property_

Section EE 67 has been amended to provide a definition for "special excluded depreciable property". Special excluded depreciable property means all buildings not listed in new schedule 39.

In practice, special excluded depreciable property means buildings that were excluded depreciable property, and are similar to the current categories of building that have estimated useful lives of 50 years or more.

The asset classes listed in this schedule are from the depreciation rates issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue before 1 April 1993. In some cases, the names of these classes differ from those currently used in the depreciation determinations.

This definition of "special excluded depreciable property" is necessary because items of excluded depreciable property do not have estimated useful lives. It is therefore not possible to refer to these buildings using "estimated useful lives".

#### _0% annual depreciation rate for special excluded depreciable property_

Section EE 61 has been amended with new subsection 7B. This subsection provides that the annual depreciation rate for items of special excluded depreciable property that are excluded depreciable property is 0%.

This statutory rate overrides any depreciation rate issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue.

Buildings that are excluded depreciable property but not special excluded depreciable property will continue to be depreciated using the appropriate depreciation rates.

#### _Change to the meaning of "temporary building"_

Paragraph (a) in the definition of "temporary building" in section YA 1 has been repealed. This paragraph provided that a "temporary building" includes buildings issued under a permit by a local or public authority that stipulates that the building be removed or demolished at their request.

This change ensures that the proposed changes work as intended, as otherwise building owners could claim that their building was a temporary building under this paragraph of the definition.

##### Example

Jack owns two buildings that he is currently allowed to claim depreciation deductions for. One building is a residential rental house and the other is a glasshouse.

For the 2010-11 income year, the applicable depreciation rates are 2% straight-line for the rental house and 5% straight-line for the glasshouse. This means Jack can claim depreciation deductions of 2% and 5% of the respective building's cost.

Depreciation determination DEP1 provides that the rental house currently has a useful life of 50 years and that the glasshouse has a useful life of 20 years. Therefore, for the 2011-12 income year, the applicable depreciation rates are 0% for the rental house and 5% straight-line for the glasshouse. This means Jack cannot claim depreciation deductions for his rental house, but can continue to claim them for the glasshouse at a rate of 5%.

### Application dates

The amendments largely apply from the beginning of the 2011-12 income year. For most people this is 1 April 2011, but if taxpayers have had a different income year approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, they would apply from that date. For taxpayers with an early balance date, this may be as soon as 2 October 2010.

### Provisional depreciation rates for categories of buildings

#### _Question_

We have been asked to clarify what buildings we consider will be able to be the subject of an application for a provisional depreciation rate.

#### _Answer_

A taxpayer will be able to apply for a provisional depreciation rate for a class of building if the class of building is sufficiently different from the existing building classes in the Commissioner's table of depreciation rates so that the existing depreciation rates or building class descriptions do not seem accurate for the particular class of building under consideration.

#### _Discussion_

From 1 April 2011, the economic rate for buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more is 0%. However, provisional depreciation rates will still be able to be set for classes of buildings. If the Commissioner issues a provisional rate for a class of building stating that it has an estimated useful life of less than 50 years, owners of affected buildings will be able to claim depreciation deductions.

A person may apply for a provisional depreciation rate for an item when there is no applicable economic rate for the item (other than a default rate) in the Commissioner's table of depreciation rates: section 91AAG(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The Commissioner may decline to issue a provisional rate if there is an applicable economic rate for the item (other than a default rate) in the Commissioner's table of depreciation rates: section 91AAH(3)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

The Commissioner's table of depreciation rates includes economic rates for several classes of buildings based on the materials used in their construction. Examples of this are the asset classes "buildings with timber framing" and "buildings with reinforced concrete framing". To have a provisional rate granted, the building owner must satisfy the Commissioner that the class of building does not fall within one of the existing building asset classes. This will be based on the characteristics of the class of building itself, not the way that a particular building is used.

##### Example 1

A purpose-built building has features that mean that none of the existing asset classes such as "building with reinforced concrete framing" apply to the building. These features may include a mixture of structural framing, including insulation panels for parts of the building requiring specialised temperature-controlled conditions and the use of other specialised building components. These features may mean the building has an estimated useful life of less than 50 years. In this case, a taxpayer may apply to the Commissioner for a provisional rate for the building.

##### Example 2

A house used as a doctor's surgery, where the alterations do not fundamentally change the nature of the building in such a way as to affect its estimated useful life, would not meet the threshold for a provisional depreciation rate. In this case, a taxpayer would not receive a provisional rate for the doctor's surgery.

#### _How to apply for a provisional rate_

Applications for provisional rates can be made using the form [IR260A](https://www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides/keyword/businessincometax/ir260a-form-provisional-depreciation.html)
, available from Inland Revenue's website.

If a provisional rate is issued it may apply to all taxpayers, to a group of specified taxpayers, or to a specific taxpayer

[Taxation (Business Tax Measures) Act 2009](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-business-tax-measures-act-2009 "Taxation (Business Tax Measures) Act 2009")

Changes to help small and medium enterprises
============================================

2009 rules introduced to relieve small and medium enterprises during the economic downturn by helping cash flow and reducing time spent on tax obligations.

_Sections DB 62, EB 23(1)(b), EW 13(2), EW 17(1)(a), EW 25(2) and (3), EW 54, EW 56, EW 57(1),(2),(3) and (9), EW 58(1),(3),(4) and (5), EW 59, EW 60(2) and (3), RD 22(3) and (4), RD 45 (2)(a), (2)(b), (3)(a), (3)(b), (4)(a), (4)(b), RD 46(2) to (6), RD 50(5), RD 52(3)(b), RD 53(4)(a), RD 60(1),(2)(b), RD 61(1)(a), RZ 3, RZ 5 and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

_Sections 120KE(1)(b) and 3(1)(e)(ii) of the Tax Administration Act 1994_

_Sections 15(2)(a), 19A(1)(b)(i) and 51(1)(a) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985_

The main purpose of the new rules is to help smaller businesses deal with the economic pressures currently being faced as a result of the economic downturn. The measures introduced were part of a wider package of relief measures aimed at helping businesses' cash flows and reducing the amount of time that small and medium enterprises (SMEs) must spend on their tax obligations.

As SMEs account for over 95% of New Zealand's businesses it is important that the people who operate them can concentrate on the things that will help their businesses. Improving cash flows and reducing the number of tax returns, payments and calculations SMEs have to deal with will help to ease the tax burden they currently face, and free up time and money to focus on strengthening their businesses.

### Key features

The new rules introduce the following changes:

*   a new threshold of $10,000, below which all business-related legal expenditure is fully deductible
*   a rise in the low-value trading stock threshold, from $5,000 to $10,000
*   extending the methods for businesses to account for financial arrangements
*   a rise in the pay as you earn (PAYE) once-a-month filing and payment threshold, from $100,000 to $500,000
*   a rise in fringe benefit tax (FBT) thresholds, under which accounting for FBT is not required for minor benefits provided to employees. The new thresholds rise from $15,000 a year per employer and from $200 each quarter per employee, to $22,500 and $300 respectively
*   extending FBT annual filing to include closely held businesses whose FBT liabilities are restricted to one or two vehicles used by owner-employees (regardless of their annual PAYE deductions)
*   a rise in the FBT annual filing threshold, from $100,000 to $500,000
*   a reduction in the provisional tax uplift rate from 105%/110% to 100%/105%, to apply from 1 April 2009 to provisional tax payments for the 2008-09 and 2009-10 income years made after these dates. Where certain companies are currently allowed to use uplift ratios of 95%/100% (as a result of the reduction in the company tax rate to 30%), lower uplift ratios of 90%/95% will instead apply
*   a rise in the provisional tax use-of-money interest (UOMI) safe harbour threshold, from $35,000 to $50,000
*   a rise in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) six-monthly return filing threshold, from $250,000 to $500,000
*   a rise in the GST payments basis threshold, from $1.3 million to $2 million
*   a rise in the GST registration threshold, from $40,000 to $60,000
*   minor remedial matters relating to changes made by the Taxation (Urgent Measures and Annual Rates) Act 2008.

### Application dates

The new rules generally either apply to the 2009-10 or later income years, or from 1 April 2009.

### Detailed analysis

#### Introduction of a new threshold of $10,000 below which all business-related legal expenditure is fully deductible (application from the 2009-10 income year)

New section DB 62 simplifies the rules for deducting legal expenditure.

This change allows businesses an immediate tax deduction for business-related legal expenditure, up to $10,000 a year, without having to distinguish between revenue and capital. This is intended to reduce tax compliance costs and tax liabilities.

For example, if a business's total bill for all legal fees in a given income year is $10,000, the entire amount will be deductible without requiring analysis of which amounts relate to non-deductible capital expenditure and deductible revenue expenditure. However, when a business's total bill for all legal fees in a given income year is $20,000, normal tax rules will apply and capital and revenue amounts must be separately identified for the full $20,000.

The new rules also introduce a definition of "legal expenses" in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act for this purpose. "Legal expenses" for this purpose means fees for legal services (as defined in the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006) provided by members of the New Zealand Law Society or an Australian equivalent.

#### Higher low-value trading stock threshold (application from the 2009-10 income year)

Section EB 23 of the Income Tax Act has been amended to raise the threshold for low-value trading stock from $5,000 to $10,000 (based on the value of the trading stock).

This change will reduce record-keeping and the amount of time some businesses must spend each year counting and valuing stock.

#### Accounting for financial arrangements (application from the 2009-10 income year)

Sections EW 13, 17 and 25 of the Income Tax Act have been amended to:

*   allow non-individuals, subject to existing thresholds, to return income tax in relation to financial arrangements on a cash accounting basis; and
*   allow more taxpayers to use the straight-line basis for accounting for financial arrangements, by increasing the existing threshold for this from $1.5 million to $1.85 million (based on the total level of financial arrangements).

The definition of "cash-basis" person has been amended in section EW 54 and sections 56 to 60 of the Income Tax Act.

#### Higher PAYE once-a-month filing and payment threshold (application from 1 April 2009)

Section RD 22 of the Income Tax Act has been amended to raise the PAYE once-a-month filing and payment threshold from $100,000 to $500,000.

When prior year total PAYE deducted for all employees is $500,000 or more, an employer must pay PAYE to Inland Revenue twice a month. When total PAYE deducted is less than $500,000, the employer can account for PAYE once a month.

This change significantly increases the number of businesses that can benefit from the increased cash flows that arise from paying PAYE only once a month. Employers that are above the current threshold but below the new threshold can still pay twice-monthly if that better suits their business needs.

#### Higher thresholds under which FBT is not required to be accounted for in respect of minor unclassified benefits provided to employees (application from 1 April 2009)

Sections RD 45 and 46 of the Income Tax Act have been amended to raise the thresholds for exempting minor benefits from FBT from $15,000 a year per employer and $200 each quarter per employee to $22,500 and $300 respectively.

This change means fewer employers will be required to return FBT on minor unclassified benefits (such as flowers or other small gifts) provided to employees.

#### Extension for FBT annual filing (application from 1 April 2009)

Section RD 60 of the Income Tax Act has been amended to further broaden annual filing for FBT to include closely held businesses whose FBT liabilities are restricted to one or two vehicles used by owner-employees, regardless of their annual PAYE deductions.

The change is intended to ease cash flow and reduce compliance costs for qualifying businesses.

#### Higher FBT annual filing threshold (application from 1 April 2009)

Section 61 of the Income Tax Act has been amended to raise the FBT annual filing threshold from $100,000 to $500,000.

When prior year total PAYE deducted for all employees is $500,000 or more, an employer providing fringe benefits to employees must account and pay for FBT to Inland Revenue quarterly. When total PAYE deducted is less than $500,000, the employer can pay and file annually instead.

This increase will mean fewer FBT returns and payments will need to be filed by small businesses, thereby easing cash flows and reducing compliance costs for eligible employers.

#### Reduction in the provisional tax uplift rate (application from 1 April 2009 to provisional tax payments for the 2008-09 and 2009-10 income years payable after this date)

Sections RZ 3 and RZ 5 of the Income Tax Act have been amended to reduce the standard method uplift for the calculation of provisional tax liability for the 2008-09 and 2009-10 income years.

Provisional tax is based on payments of tax being made during the income year. One of the standard methods of calculating provisional tax is by basing it on taxpayers' residual income tax (RIT) from prior years, specifically by assuming that it is either:

*   105% of the previous year's RIT; or
*   110% of the next preceding year's RIT (for taxpayers that have not yet furnished their previous year's income tax return).

The new rules reduce the "uplift" rate to reflect the likelihood of reduced profits in the 2008-09 and 2009-10 income years as a result of the economic downturn. Accordingly, for remaining provisional tax payments due for the 2008-09 and 2009-10 income years, the 105% and 110% uplift rates have been temporarily reduced to 100% and 105% respectively.

It should be noted that changes made to provisional tax for individuals in respect of the 2008-09 and 2009-10 income years (as a result of the reduction in the top income tax rate for individuals) must also be taken into account. See Table 1 below.

In addition, 30% tax-rate taxpayers (eg, companies) were previously allowed to use uplift ratios of 95% or 100% (as a result of relief provided following the lowering of the company tax rate from 33% to 30%). The rules now allow such entities to use new uplift ratios of 90% or 95% (instead of 95% or 100%) for remaining provisional tax payments due for the 2008-09 and 2009-10 income years when the higher 33% rate is used as the base year. See Table 2 below.

These changes will reduce the size of taxpayers' provisional tax payments, giving them greater cash flows over the next two years (as a result of lower provisional tax payments). The standard uplift rates of 105% and 110% will apply again in the 2010-11 and future income years.

### Table 1: Changes for individuals

| Year for provisional tax being calculated | Year of RIT amount used | Adjustment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **2009 (instalments payable on or after 1 April 2009)** | 2007 | RIT - $730 + 5% |
| 2008 | RIT - $730 |
| **2010** | 2008 | RIT - $1,460 + 5% |
| 2009 | RIT - $730 |
| **2011** | 2009 (back to original calculation) | RIT + 10% |
| 2010 (back to original calculation) | RIT + 5% |

Further information on provisional tax, including practical examples that include the above changes, can be found in the Inland Revenue guide IR289 _Provisional tax: A guide to understanding your provisional tax._ This guide was updated in May 2009 to incorporate the changes included in the new legislation.

#### Higher provisional tax use-of-money interest safe harbour threshold (application from the 2009-10 income year)

Section 120KE of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended to increase the provisional tax use-of-money interest (UOMI) safe harbour threshold from $35,000 to $50,000.

This makes it easier for more individual taxpayers to use the standard uplift method of calculating provisional tax rather than estimating, thus reducing compliance costs for those taxpayers and reducing their exposure to UOMI interest.

#### Higher goods and services tax six-monthly return filing threshold (application from 1 April 2009)

Section 15 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 has been amended to increase the threshold below which GST returns can be made six-monthly from $250,000 to $500,000 of taxable supplies in a 12-month period. Taxpayers with more than $500,000 of taxable supplies are required to make two-monthly GST returns.

Taxpayers with highly seasonal activities and small businesses may find this change helpful.

#### Higher GST payments basis threshold (application from 1 April 2009)

Section 19A of the Goods and Services Tax Act has been amended to raise the threshold below which GST may be accounted for on a payments basis from $1.3 million to $2 million of taxable supplies in a 12-month period.

This change will allow more taxpayers to account for GST on a payments basis and may assist cash flows as GST will generally only need to be accounted for on the receipt of funds rather than upon issue of an invoice. Using the GST invoice basis is still optional for all taxpayers.

#### Higher GST registration threshold (application from 1 April 2009)

Section 51 of the Goods and Services Act has been amended to raise the GST registration threshold from $40,000 to $60,000 of taxable supplies in a 12-month period.

This change means those under the threshold can opt out of the GST system, resulting in lower GST compliance costs and fewer cash-management problems associated with making GST payments. Taxpayers who meet the criterion of a taxable activity will still be able to register for GST on a voluntary basis if they fall under the revised threshold.

#### Minor remedial matters (various application dates)

A number of minor remedial matters relating to changes made by the Taxation (Urgent Measures and Annual Rates) Act 2008 have also been introduced. They amend sections RD 50, 52 and 53 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Changes to Imputation Credit Rules
==================================

2005 amendment to the dividend and imputation rules means when a company is sold prepaid tax benefits stays with the group that paid the tax and cannot be refunded.

_Sections CD 7, GC 22, MB 6, ME 4, 5, 9B, 9C, 14, OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004; sections GC 22, MB 6, ME 4, 5, 9B, 9C, 14, OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004; sections 101B, 140(B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994_

The dividend and imputation rules have been amended to ensure that, in certain circumstances, when a company is sold the benefits of any prepaid tax will stay with the original group that paid the tax and cannot be refunded.  The changes were designed as a revenue protection measure.  

The amendments ensure that imputation credits earned by one group of companies cannot effectively be paid to a different group's shareholders. 

Companies that leave wholly owned groups that have available net losses in excess of $1 million may elect that a debit balance in their imputation credit account or an amount of prepaid tax in excess of their imputation credit account's credit balance be transferred to another New Zealand group company immediately before leaving the group.

If such an election is not made and the company then joins another wholly owned group with different ultimate shareholders, a final tax  - additional income tax - that cannot be credited against other tax liabilities of the company or group will be payable.  

Other amendments:

*   modify the imputation credit anti-streaming rule;
*   ensure that within wholly owned groups, a taxable bonus issue election can only arise when there is an issue of shares fully paid from reserves; and
*   as a remedial measure, clarify that all payments of income tax can create imputation credits.

### Background

Under the classical dividend system that applied in New Zealand until 1988, two amounts of tax were levied on company profits: first, as they were earned, by way of company tax, and again when they were distributed as dividends to shareholders.  The imputation rules have the effect of relieving this double taxation.  A New Zealand company can attach imputation credits to dividends paid to shareholders representing the tax paid by it.  Shareholders can use these imputation credits to alleviate the taxation obligations in respect of the dividend.

Detailed provisions within the imputation rules ensure that, among other things, the shareholders at the time the tax was paid are the same shareholders who receive the imputation credits.  Obviously, this is in general terms only, since it is not always practicable to track individual shareholders, particularly of widely held companies.  Companies are required to maintain a record of the payments of tax and the tax passed on to shareholders through an imputation credit account. 

There are also specific provisions within the imputation rules that govern tax refunds.  Essentially, a refund may not be claimed unless the company concerned has an equivalent level of imputation credits.  This is to ensure the tax paid by a company is not refunded when the imputation credits created by the original payment have already been attached to dividends paid to shareholders and used by them as tax credits.

The imputation rules do not prevent a company prepaying its income tax in order to create imputation credits that it can attach to its dividends.  Typically, this happens when the company is in a loss situation. 

Several companies have done this in the past, presumably in order to enhance the value of their shares, as dividends with imputation credits are worth more than dividends with no credits.  They have also done it, presumably, in circumstances where they anticipate paying income tax in the reasonable future. 

When tax has been prepaid in this fashion, use-of-money interest is not payable, on the basis that the shareholders have actually used the imputation credits to reduce their tax liability.  There is no policy objection to these prepayments.

##### Transactions that are contrary to the policy intent 

It was always the intention that a tax overpayment not matched by an equivalent credit balance in the imputation credit account would not be refunded but used to offset a tax liability of the company owned by the shareholders who had received the imputation credits.

The changes were aimed at two types of transactions that were contrary to the underlying policy intent of the imputation rules.

The first type involves a special-purpose subsidiary with a prepaid tax amount and imputation credit account with no imputation credits. It is sold to a consolidated group with surplus imputation credits.[2](#01)
 The special-purpose subsidiary then joins the consolidated group and, as the group has imputation credits in excess of the prepaid tax amount, a refund of the tax is made.

For example, Company A, owned by Company X, has prepaid tax of $300 and no imputation credits in its imputation credit account.  Company A is sold to Company Y, which is part of a consolidated group with a credit balance of $500.  Company A joins Company Y's consolidated group.

![Diagram of Company X and Company Y illustrating preceding text](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/f/f/ff7e17804ba376f78fe5bf9ef8e4b077/company-x-and-y.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214558&hash=0865F0D75EAEEC33AB43C115B7634B49)

A comparison is made between the amount of prepaid tax in Company A, $300, with the credit balance of the imputation credit account of the consolidated group - $500.  As the credit balance exceeds the prepaid tax, a refund is released and the consolidated group's imputation credit account debited by the amount of the refund.

![Diagram of a more complicated transaction illustrating the text following.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/9/9/9945c4804ba376f88fffbf9ef8e4b077/a-tax-and-consolidated-group.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214555&hash=12A14294D9BC3A55624B86091232091C)

The second type of transaction is more complicated.  Here a special purpose subsidiary of the company with a prepaid tax amount and an empty imputation credit account is created.  The special purpose subsidiary pays a fully imputed taxable bonus issue, in a form other than by way of a fully paid issue of shares from reserves, to its parent company.  The parent company's imputation credit account now has sufficient imputation credits so that its prepayment of tax can be refunded.  While the special purpose subsidiary has an equivalent debit balance in its imputation credit account, the final step is that the company is sold to and amalgamated with a company with surplus imputation credits.

For example, Company A, with prepaid tax of $300, no imputation credits and owned by Company X, now incorporates a special purpose subsidiary z.

![Diagram illustrating special purpose subsidary and imputation credits.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/e/4/e4f86e004ba376f8900cbd9ef8e4b077/company-x-and-company-x.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214556&hash=8E815580D9A8269C2DA4FB1B7D15E35A)

Special purpose subsidiary Z makes a subdivision of shares, electing that the subdivision be a taxable bonus issue, with a value of $609 and so attaching imputation credits of $300.  This causes a debit to Z's imputation credit account of $300 with a corresponding credit to A's imputation credit account.

Now that A has a credit balance of $300 in its imputation credit account, it can receive a refund of its prepaid tax.

Z, with a debit balance in its imputation credit account of $300, is sold to Company Y, which, as before, has a credit balance of $500 in its imputation credit account.

![Diagram of Company X and Company Y illustrating preceding text](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/3/0/301281004ba376f99019bd9ef8e4b077/company-a-and-company-y.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214557&hash=617C9B5DC960327D642407E75CC36CBF)

  
Company Y and Company Z then amalgamate, and Company Y, as the amalgamated company, puts its debit balance into its imputation credit account.

### Key features

New section ME 9B of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 1994 applies to companies leaving wholly owned groups that have available net losses in excess of $1 million at the end of the previous tax year.  Immediately before leaving the group, a company may elect that a debit balance in its imputation credit account or an amount of prepaid tax, for the amount exceeding the credit balance in its imputation credit account, may be transferred to another company in its original group.  Alternatively, the company that leaves may elect to pay additional income tax of an amount equal to the debit balance or excess amount of prepaid tax.  This additional income tax will be a final tax and cannot be credited against other tax liabilities.  This is because the additional income tax is to offset the tax benefit that has already been received by the leaving group's shareholders in the form of imputation credits.

New section ME 9C generally applies to the companies that did not elect to transfer the debit balance or excess prepaid tax and did not make a payment of additional income tax.  It can also, in some limited circumstances, apply to other companies whose ownership changes.

If such a company then joins a new wholly owned group with different ultimate shareholders it will be required to make a payment of additional income tax equal to the debit balance in its imputation credit account, or the amount of prepaid tax to the extent it exceeds its credit balance in its imputation credit account.  Again, as in section ME 9B, additional income tax cannot be credited against other tax liabilities because this additional income tax is to offset the tax benefit received by the leaving group's shareholders in the form of imputation credits.

Section ME 14(3B) has been added to ensure that new sections ME 9B and ME 9C also apply to consolidated groups.

Section CD 7 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section OB 1 - taxable bonus issues of the Income Tax Act 1994 - have been amended to ensure that, within a wholly owned group, only issues of shares that are fully paid up from reserves can become a taxable bonus issue.  Outside a wholly owned group the existing law remains.

Section GC 22(4)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 1994 have been amended to ensure that the anti-imputation credit streaming rules apply when there is an account advantage that may not also be accompanied by a tax credit advantage.

As a remedial measure, section MB 6 has been amended to include tax in excess of the taxpayer's income tax liability within the scope of voluntary payments of provisional tax.  This means that a voluntary payment of tax includes situations when a taxpayer has no income tax or provisional tax liability.  The effect of this inclusion is that, as such payments are now treated as a payment of provisional tax, an imputation credit will arise when such a payment is made.

### Application date

The revenue base protection amendments apply from the date of introduction of the original bill - 16 November 2004.  The remedial measure applies from 1 April 1995.

### Detailed analysis

The amendments are aimed primarily at companies that have no immediate expectation of being liable to income tax but who prepay tax to impute dividends to shareholders and then engage in transactions to have the prepaid tax refunded to them in some way.

The mechanisms, to date, have involved the sale of a company, that has either a debit balance in its imputation credit account or an amount of prepaid tax that exceeds the credit balance in its imputation credit account, to another company that has imputation credits surplus to its immediate needs.

The end result is that, in effect, imputation credits are transferred from the shareholders of the imputation-rich company to the shareholders of the imputation-poor company.  This is contrary to the intent of the imputation rules that imputation credits should be of benefit only to the shareholders of the company who paid the tax in the first place.  It is for this reason that, under present law, breaches in excess of 66% in shareholder continuity trigger losses in imputation credits. 

Because of the need for an explicit buttress for the shareholder continuity rules, but balanced by the concern that non-tax driven transactions should not be disturbed, the amendments are targeted at wholly owned groups that have group losses in excess of $1 million.

Loss-making groups are the most likely to be at risk of entering into such transactions because they are more likely to impute dividends without an expectation of having taxable income.

Therefore section ME 9B has been added to give companies that leave wholly owned groups with accumulated losses in excess of $1 million in the last tax year the ability to transfer immediately, before sale, any debit balance in their imputation credit account or an amount of prepaid tax in excess of their imputation credit account's credit balance to another company within the original wholly owned group.

This is to allow the original group's shareholders to retain the benefit of the amount of prepaid tax that enabled their dividends to be imputed.  Similarly, with any debit balance, they retain the obligation to pay tax by 31 March, since this obligation arose because the group utilised the imputation credits.

The election procedure is set out in section ME 9B(8B).  This must be:

*   in a form acceptable to the Commissioner;
*   made by the leaving company and accompanied by a notice of agreement from the company that either receives the imputation debit or the prepayment of tax; and
*   made before the company leaves the group or such further period as the Commissioner may allow.

A "leaving company" may instead choose to pay additional income tax equal to the amount of the debit balance or the excess prepaid tax.  It is not expected this will be the preferred option as additional income tax is a final tax and cannot be credited against other tax liabilities. 

Section ME 4(1)(cb), (cc) and (cd) has been added to allow the transfer of the debit balance, or the payment of additional income tax to create an imputation credit.  Section ME 4(2)(bb) has also been added to make the creation of the imputation credit effective from the date the leaving company ceases to be a member of a wholly owned group in the case of a transfer or the date the payment of additional income tax is made, as applicable.

To buttress section ME 9B, section ME 9C provides that imputation credit companies that leave wholly owned groups, and certain other companies, that have available net losses in excess of $1 million and join another wholly owned group with different ultimate shareholders will be required to make a payment of additional income tax equal to any debit balance in the joining company's imputation credit account or any amount of prepaid tax that exceeds the credit balance in its imputation credit account.  The additional income tax cannot be credited to other tax liabilities.

It is expected that a liability to additional income tax will arise only in unusual cases.   

Sections 101B have been added and 140B has been amended to include additional income tax that arises under section ME 9C within the scope of the Tax Administration Act 1994.  Additional income tax under section ME 9B is not included as that is effectively a voluntary tax.

##### Tax pooling accounts

Entitlements to funds in a tax pooling account are included in the quantification of an "excess entitlement" in ME 9B (3) and ME 9C (4).  This is because deposits to a tax pooling account create imputation credits in the same way as voluntary or prepayments of tax.

To prevent the imposition of additional income tax, if any amounts of excess entitlement are held by a company that leaves a wholly owned group with $1 million available net losses in a previous tax year and then joins a wholly owned group with different ultimate owners, a transfer in the tax pool by the leaving company will be necessary.

As the operation of tax pooling accounts are outside the direct control of Inland Revenue, this transfer will need to be initiated by the leaving company to ensure there is no liability to additional income tax when joining a wholly owned group with different ultimate owners.

##### Subdivisions of shares

In the transactions discussed in the background section, a common feature is the use of a subdivision or share split, for which it was argued that it was a bonus issue, and so when an election is made for it to be a taxable bonus issue, can have imputation credits attached.  This is because taxable bonus issues are treated as dividends for income tax purposes.

The change as originally proposed in the bill clarifies that subdivisions or share splits could not be taxable bonus issues.  However, the Finance and Expenditure Committee recommended that the restriction apply only to wholly owned groups, with the existing law remaining for non-wholly owned groups.  The committee's reasoning was that within these transactions the shareholding company was not subject to tax because of the intercompany dividend exemption on the taxable bonus issue.  Therefore the usual constraint on excessive taxable bonus issues that the shareholder is subject to tax on the dividend did not apply.

Because a share split or subdivision was possible under sections other than 48(b) and (c) of the Companies Act 1993, the committee further recommended that, for wholly owned groups, it was preferable to specify the type of issue of shares for no consideration that was acceptable from a policy perspective - that is, an issue of shares fully paid up from reserves.

##### Strengthening the anti-imputation credit streaming rule

Earlier anti-imputation credit streaming rules appeared not to envisage a situation where an arrangement could create an advantage to an imputation credit account - an "account advantage" - without also creating a credit for use against an income tax liability - a "tax credit advantage".

In the transactions discussed in the background section, the taxable bonus issue to which imputation credits were attached was paid to a wholly owned group member and was therefore exempt from income tax.  As there was no tax credit advantage, the anti-streaming rules appeared not to apply, even though there was an account advantage.

To buttress the other amendments, section GC 22(4)(b) has been amended to apply when there is an account advantage, regardless of whether there is also a tax credit advantage.

##### Clarification that all payments of income tax create imputation credits

A subsidiary issue that arose when these transactions were reviewed by Inland Revenue is that the previous legislation may not have allowed all payments of income tax to create imputation credits.  In particular, according to the previous provisional tax rules, tax payments made by companies that were not provisional taxpayers were not considered payments of provisional tax.  Therefore no equivalent imputation credit could arise.

The companies most likely affected would be those that have no tax liability because of accumulated losses, but impute dividends to shareholders.  The voluntary prepayments of tax were made with the expectation that this would square up the imputation credit account after attaching imputation credits to dividends.  In other words, the prepaid tax amount was intended to pay for the tax benefit the shareholders received.

It appeared, however, that this was not the case and that voluntary payments of tax did not create imputation credits, which was contrary to the original policy intent.

Section MB 6, relating to voluntary payments of provisional tax, has been amended to include voluntary payments of tax that exceed a taxpayer's income tax liability for the year.  This has the effect of ensuring that all voluntary payments of income tax can create imputation credits.  The amendment is retrospective in application to 1 April 1995, to ensure that no imputation credits can be disallowed which would have been contrary to the original policy intent.

* * *

**2** As there is prepaid tax and no imputation credits in the imputation credit account, this would indicate that tax prepayment was made to square up an imputation credit account. The square-up would have been necessary because imputation credits had been attached to dividends and yet no underlying tax had previously been paid.

Changes to the depreciation rules
=================================

2009 technical changes to the tax depreciation provisions deal with administrative concerns and clarify the law.

_**Sections EE 30, EE 31 and schedule 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections 91AAF, 91AAG, 91AAG, 91AAH, 91AAH, 91AAK and 91AAM of the Tax Administration Act 1994; sections EE 25E, EE 26 and schedule 16 of the Income Tax Act 2004; sections EG 10 and schedule 16 of the Income Tax Act 1994; schedule 21 of the Income Tax Act 1976 and regulations 2, 3, 6 and 9 of the Income Tax (Depreciation Determinations) Regulations 1993**_

A number of technical changes to the tax depreciation provisions have been made to deal with administrative concerns and to clarify the law. The changes are consistent with the original policy intent of the tax depreciation rules.

### Application dates

The new depreciation rules generally apply for the 2008-09 and later income years. However, a number of the changes apply from earlier income years, to address previous technical uncertainties or inconsistencies with the legislation.

### _Key features_

##### _Depreciation loading for assets with provisional or special rates_

Section EE 31 of the Income Tax Act 2007 has been amended to clarify that depreciation loading is allowable, subject to the normal criteria, for assets if the depreciation rate is set by a provisional or a special rate determination. There had been a technical concern that the 20% depreciation loading may not have applied to assets that had a depreciation rate set under these types of determinations. This was because section EE 31 referred only to an "economic rate", which excludes "special rate" or "provisional rate". The same analysis also suggested that the rates set by provisional and special rate determinations are not economic rates. As such, taxpayers relying on such determinations may not have been entitled to depreciation deductions. Neither outcome was consistent with the original policy intent of the depreciation rules. For this reason, section EE 26 of the Income Tax Act 2004 has also been amended, with effect from the 2005-06 and later income years. 

Section EE 30 has been amended by adding the words "of cost" to subsection (1) paragraph (b). Without the addition of these words, it was not clear what met the definition of a high residual value asset. The amendment removes any possible inconsistency or ambiguity and applies from the 2005-06 and later income years.

##### _Revoking outdated determinations_

Subsections 91AAF(6) and section 91AAG(7) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 have been amended to give the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the ability to revoke outdated provisional rate determinations and economic rate determinations. This will allow the Commissioner to regularly update the list of depreciable items to ensure that it does not include items that no longer exist. Subsections 91AAK and 91AAM have been amended to include revoking a determination as part of the notification process. A revocation of a determination takes effect the day after the date of publication of the Gazette that contains the notification of the revocation.

##### _Provisional and special rate determinations based upon statutory formulas_

Changes to sections 91AAG(3) and 91AAG(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 clarify that provisional rate determinations and special rate determinations must be based upon the statutory formulas. Previously, there was no reference to the formulas that the Commissioner must use to set the rate under either a provisional rate determination or a special rate determination. The new rules make it clear that provisional rate and special rate determinations will be based upon the appropriate statutory formulas.

##### _Applying for provisional rate determination_

Subsection 91AAG(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended to ensure that taxpayers can apply for a provisional rate determination - even when there is an applicable rate available. This ensures that the Commissioner can issue a provisional determination when the default rate is not broadly correct.

Changes to subsection 91AAH(3)(a) allow the Commissioner to decline to issue a provisional rate when the most appropriate default rate is "about right" for that type of asset. This is designed to reduce compliance and administration costs. The Commissioner can also decline to issue a provisional rate determination when the most appropriate default rate is clearly not broadly correct for that type of asset. That is to say, the Commissioner can decline to issue a provisional depreciation rate where the depreciation rate is less than 50% of the amount that is the difference between the default rate and the next highest or lowest rate, as applicable, in schedule 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

##### _Assets acquired before 1 April 2005_

A reference to section EZ 23 has been added to section 91AAG(3) to ensure that a special rate determination for assets acquired before 1 April 2005 are calculated under the depreciation rules that existed before the changes of 2005. As a matter of principle, special rate applications for assets held before 1 April 2005 ought to be determined using the earlier rules.

##### _Reliance on previous economic rate determinations_

Section 91AAF(3) has been amended to ensure that taxpayers can rely on previous economic rate determinations. Under the previous rules, section 91AAF(3) is intended to provide taxpayers with certainty that the Commissioner could not retrospectively change depreciation rates for assets already owned or under contract to purchase. However, section 91AAF(4) overrode section 91AAF(3), resulting in a technical argument that the Commissioner had the power to issue a determination that had retrospective application. This result was inconsistent with the original policy intent. The amendment clarifies the rule so that taxpayers can rely on previous economic rate determinations.

##### _Depreciable land improvements_

The following categories of depreciable land improvements have been added to schedule 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and, where appropriate, to earlier Income Tax Acts:

*   pipes; and
*   purpose-built surfaces for outdoor sports facilities.

The changes apply to the 2008-09 and later income years.

##### _Updating Income Tax (Depreciation Determination) Regulations 1993_

As a result of the Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004, some of the legislative references in the Income Tax (Depreciation Determination) Regulations 1993 were no longer correct. The regulations have been updated and references to sections 91AE and 91AJ have been amended to refer to sections 91AAG and 91AAL respectively.

[Research & development](/new-legislation/act-articles/research-development "Research & development")

Changes to the disputes and reassessment rules
==============================================

2007 changes to the disputes reassessment rules in relation to the research and development tax credit.

#### Time limit for notice of proposed adjustment (section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 - definition of response period)

Because claimants and their agents will require time to prepare and check their claims for tax credits, the time for reassessing the amount claimed has been extended from the standard four months.

In the case of a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) relating solely to an amount of R&D tax credit, the time limits within which the claimant can issue the NOPA are:

*   for a business that is neither a member of an internal software development group nor a partner in a partnership electing to apply section 68E of the Tax Administration Act 1994, one year following the date the income tax return is received by Inland Revenue; and
*   for a business that is a member of an internal software development group or a partner in a partnership electing to apply section 68E of the Tax Administration Act 1994, from the date the business's income tax return is received by Inland Revenue, up until one year after the due date for the group's detailed statement of R&D activities.

##### Example: Claimant issues NOPA within the new response period

Company A is in the process of internally auditing its R&D expenditure. On 15 March 2020, A's agent files A's 2018-19 income tax return and files a detailed statement of R&D activities, claiming a $50,000 tax credit. Inland Revenue receives the tax return on 17March. When A completes its audit, A discovers that it was actually entitled to a tax credit of $60,000 and issues a notice of proposed adjustment relating solely to the R&D tax credit.

As long as Inland Revenue receives the notice of proposed adjustment by 16 March 2021, the disputes process will begin and, subject to the outcome of the process, A could receive the additional $10,000 credit. If the notice of proposed adjustment is received after 16 March 2021, the notice will not be effective

Issuing a NOPA solely for an amount of R&D tax credit does not allow the business to reopen any other aspect of the income tax return.

**Special rules for 2008-09 and 2009-10 years**

In parallel with the extension of time to file a detailed statement, in some cases during the early years of the credit the time periods for issuing a NOPA relating solely to an R&D tax credit are also extended.

For the 2008-09 and 2009-10 income years, the time periods within which a NOPA relating solely to an amount of R&D tax credit may be issued are:

*   for a business that is neither a member of an internal software development group nor a partner in a partnership electing to apply section 68E of the Tax Administration Act 1994, two years following the date the income tax return is received by Inland Revenue; and
*   for a business that is a member of an internal software development group or a partner in a partnership electing to apply section 68E of the Tax Administration Act 1994, from the date the business's income tax return is received by Inland Revenue, up until two years after the due date for the group's detailed statement of R&D activities.

#### Time limit for Commissioner's reassessment (sections 108(1B) and 113D of the Tax Administration Act 1994)

Overseas experience suggests that when businesses are given long periods to reconsider their original claims, practitioners have incentives to trawl through past years' accounts and identify R&D expenditure that the business was unaware was R&D. This practice of "grave-digging" is at odds with the intent of the R&D tax credit policy, which is that the credit should provide an incentive to undertake R&D. If credits are being given for R&D which the business was unaware it was undertaking, it is clear that the credit has not provided any incentive.

To prevent "grave-digging", the Commissioner cannot reassess an amount of R&D credit upwards if one year has passed since the end of the tax year in which the original income tax return was filed.

##### Example: Claimant requests amendment after more than a year

Company A claims a $50,000 credit for R&D undertaken in the 2018-19 year, by filing an income tax return on 6June 2019. The return is filed in the 2019-20 tax year, which ends on 31 March 2020.

On 1 June 2021, A discovers that it was actually entitled to a $60,000 credit for R&D and asks the Commissioner to amend the amount originally self-assessed. However, Inland Revenue cannot amend the amount to $60,000 after 31 March 2021

There is an exception to the new rule. When the claimant has issued a NOPA on its claim for an R&D credit within the response period for doing so, the Commissioner has the normal period to reassess the amount of credit, allowing time for disputes procedures to be completed. In no case, however, may the Commissioner increase the amount of the R&D tax credit by more than the adjustment proposed in the NOPA which arrived within the original response period.

##### Example: Claimant requests amendment after more than a year, having issued a NOPA

Company A claims a $50,000 credit for R&D undertaken in the 2018-19 year, by filing an income tax return on 6June 2019. The return is filed in the 2019-20 tax year, which ends on 31 March 2020.

On 1 June 2020, A discovers that it was actually entitled to a $60,000 credit for R&D and issues a notice of proposed adjustment. The notice is issued within the response period (one year following the date the tax return was received), so the disputes process begins. The disputes process is concluded on 30 August 2021, and Inland Revenue agrees the credit should be $60,000. Normally, Inland Revenue would be unable to reassess the amount of the credit, since the date for doing so (31 March 2021) has passed. However, because the claimant had issued a NOPA relating to the amount of the R&D tax credit, Inland Revenue will reassess the amount to $60,000.

**Example: Claimant requests amendment after more than a year, having issued multiple NOPAs**

Company A claims a $50,000 credit for R&D undertaken in the 2018-19 year, by filing an income tax return on 6June 2019. The return is filed in the 2019-20 tax year, which ends on 31 March 2020.

On 1 June 2020, A discovers that it was actually entitled to a $60,000 credit for R&D and issues a notice of proposed adjustment. The notice is issued within the response period (one year following the date the tax return was received), so the disputes process begins.

On 20 August 2020, A issues another NOPA, revising up the credit again to $70,000.

The disputes process relating to the first NOPA is concluded on 30 August 2021, and Inland Revenue agrees the credit should be $60,000. Because the claimant issued a NOPA relating to the amount of the R&D tax credit within the response period, Inland Revenue will reassess the amount to $60,000.

The second NOPA is ineffective because it was issued outside the relevant response period, being the first year after the income tax return was originally filed. Inland Revenue is unable to reassess the tax credit amount above $60,000

**Special rules for 2008-09 and 2009-10 years**

For R&D tax credits arising in the 2008-09 and 2009-10 years, the Commissioner cannot reassess an amount of R&D credit upwards if two years have passed since the end of the tax year in which the original income tax return was filed. This is in line with the extensions, in some circumstances, for filing detailed statements or issuing a NOPA relating solely to an amount of R&D tax credit.

Changes to the disputes resolution process
==========================================

Administrative changes to the disputes resolution process applying from 1 Apr 2010 improve the timeliness of the process and provide certainty for disputants.

We have been working with the New Zealand Law Society and New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants to improve the disputes resolution process and tailor it more to the needs of our customers.

From 1 April 2010, we have implemented a number of administrative enhancements to the disputes resolution process to improve the timeliness of the process and provide certainty for disputants. Below are some of the main changes you will see.

#### Better prepared notices of proposed adjustments (NOPAs)

From now on, you can expect to see more focused notices of proposed adjustments (NOPAs) issued by Inland Revenue that are much easier to read. Notices will have a short outline of key relevant facts presented in a logical order to inform the recipient of the proposed adjustments and the reasons for them. Our legal staff will provide input earlier, and we'll strengthen our quality reviews. We'll also ensure that a NOPA is issued only once the investigation is substantially complete.

#### Conferences with a clearer purpose

From 1 April, taxpayers whose dispute remains unresolved after the notice of response (NOR) phase will be invited to attend a conference meeting, and offered the opportunity to have any meetings facilitated by an Inland Revenue facilitator. A number of our people have already been trained as conference facilitators, and they can attend a conference on request.

A facilitator won't have the authority to resolve issues. However, they do have the ability to determine that the conference phase is at an end, if the parties are unable to agree on this point.

#### Clarifying our position in the opt-out process

We now have guidelines setting out the circumstances in which we will agree with a taxpayer's request to opt out after the conference phase. For most cases these are when one of the following applies:

*   the total amount of tax in dispute is $75,000 or less, except where the dispute is part of a wider dispute. The $75,000 excludes shortfall penalties, use of money interest, and late payment penalties if applicable
*   the dispute turns purely on issues of fact
*   the dispute concerns facts and issues already waiting to be resolved by a Court
*   the dispute concerns facts and issues similar to those already considered by the Adjudication Unit of the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel in a past dispute, and
*   the taxpayer has participated meaningfully in discussions during the conference phase.

#### Improvements in timeliness

We have set tighter internal deadlines for our staff, and these will be closely monitored. Should the dispute continue beyond the conference phase, we'll also advise the taxpayer how long it will take to issue a statement of position (SOP). In most cases this will be within three months of the conference phase closing, and internal approval will be required for cases that may take longer than three months, such as those involving complex or precedential matters.

#### Next steps

Revenue Minister Peter Dunne and Inland Revenue Commissioner invite feedback on the revised Standard Practice Statements, which reflect the administrative changes to the disputes process:

*   SPS 08/01 Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, and
*   SPS 08/02 Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer

Submissions are also sought on possible legislative changes set out in an officials’ policy paper.

[Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-gst-and-remedial-matters-act-2010 "Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010")

Changes to the qualifying company rules and introduction of look-through company rules
======================================================================================

2010 changes to the qualifying company rules and introduction of look-through company rules.

_Subparts HA and HB, and sections CB 32B, 32C, CX 63, DV 21 to DV 24, GB 25B, GB 29, HZ 4B to HZ 4D and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

Changes to the qualifying company rules and the introduction of look-through company rules were added to the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Bill by Supplementary Order Paper No. 187. The changes are part of Government announcements made in Budget 2010 aimed at improving the integrity of the tax system by preventing people from claiming losses against their personal income.

Specifically, the changes:

*   provide transparent income tax treatment for electing closely held companies, which will be known as look-through companies (LTCs);
*   allow existing qualifying companies (QCs) and loss-attributing qualifying companies (LAQCs) to continue to use the current QC rules without the ability to attribute losses, pending a review of the dividend rules for closely held companies; and
*   allow existing QCs and LAQCs to transition into the new LTC rules or change to another business vehicle such as a partnership, without a tax cost during the period 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2013.

### Background

As part of tax integrity measures introduced in Budget 2010, the Government announced reforms to the tax rules for qualifying companies. Feedback on the proposals was sought in the officials' issues paper, _Qualifying companies: implementation of flow-through tax treatment_ published the day after the Budget announcement.

Based on this feedback, new rules providing an elective look-through income tax treatment for closely held companies apply from 1 April 2011.

Under the look-through rules, the company's tax treatment is integrated with the tax treatment of the owners, on the basis that entities are agents for their owners. It ensures that shareholders who use a company's losses also pay tax on any company profit at their marginal tax rate. This removes the tax disincentive faced by the owners of closely held businesses who wish to operate through a company. They can attain the benefits of limited liability afforded by a familiar corporate form, as well as the ability to be taxed at the level of the owner.

In addition, in response to feedback from small businesses, the Government decided to allow existing QCs and LAQCs to continue to use the current qualifying company rules, but without the ability to attribute losses, while a review of the tax rules for dividends from closely held companies is carried out.

As a result of the changes to the qualifying company rules, a special set of transitional rules have been developed, to allow existing QCs and LAQCs to transition into the new LTC rules or change to another business vehicle such as a partnership or sole trader, without a tax cost.

An early draft of this legislation was made available for public comment on 15 October 2010, accompanied by an explanatory note. The final legislation is different from the earlier draft, reflecting feedback received during consultation. Some of these changes are fairly substantial while others are more technical in nature. The earlier draft legislation and explanatory note have therefore been superseded by the enacted rules and should not be relied upon.

### Key features

#### _Look-through company rules_

The new LTC rules are available for income years starting on or after 1 April 2011. The rules apply only to companies which are resident in New Zealand.

The main features of the new LTC rules are:

*   An LTC must have five or fewer owners (the ownership interests of relatives are combined).
*   All owners must elect for the LTC rules to apply initially. LTC elections are to be made prospectively.
*   Once a company becomes an LTC it will remain so unless one of the owners decides to revoke the LTC election, or the company ceases to be eligible.
*   Only a natural person, trustee or another LTC may hold shares in an LTC. All the company's shares must be of the same class and provide the same rights and obligations to each shareholder.
*   An LTC's income, expenses, tax credits, rebates, gains and losses are passed on to its owners. These items will generally be allocated to owners in proportion to the number of shares they have in the LTC. Owners are also able to deduct expenditure incurred by the LTC before they became a member, subject to the other deductibility tests in the Act.
*   Any profit is taxed at the owner's marginal tax rate. The owner can use any losses against their other income, subject to the loss limitation rule.
*   The loss limitation rule ensures that the losses claimed reflect the level of an owner's economic loss in the LTC. An anti-avoidance rule also prevents an artificially high basis around the year-end being used to increase any loss flow-through. Owners' excess losses are carried forward to future income years, subject to the application of the loss limitation rule in those years. There are certain rules about the use of these losses if the LTC ceases to be an LTC, or if the owner sells their shares.
*   When owners sell their shares they are treated as disposing of their share of the underlying LTC property. Owners may have to pay any tax associated with the deemed disposal of this property. Exiting owners are generally required to account for tax on disposing of their shares in the LTC only if the amount of the disposal proceeds derived from their LTC interest exceeds the total net tax book value of their share of LTC property by more than $50,000.
*   Even if this $50,000 threshold is exceeded, exiting owners will not have to account for tax on things such as trading stock in certain circumstances. When exiting owners account for tax on their share, incoming owners must take on a cost basis in the LTC's assets and liabilities that is equal to the deemed disposal under the disposal provisions.
*   The disposal thresholds do not apply if the company is liquidated, or ceases to use the LTC rules but otherwise continues in business. In these situations, the owner is deemed to have disposed of their shares at market value on the date of exit.
*   Look-through treatment applies for income tax purposes only. An LTC retains its corporate obligations and benefits, such as limited liability, under general company law.
*   An LTC is still recognised separately from its shareholders for certain other tax purposes, including GST, PAYE and certain administrative or other withholding tax purposes under the Income Tax Act 2007.

#### _Qualifying company rules_

The changes effectively "grandparent" the QC rules for existing QCs and LAQCs only. The revised QC rules will continue to apply to existing QCs and LAQCs unless they choose to revoke their QC election, and/or use one of the transition options.

The main effect of the changes is to:

*   remove the ability of an LAQC to attribute losses. This means that existing LAQCs will effectively be taxed in the same way as ordinary QCs; and
*   prevent companies that are not already QCs from entering the QC rules for income years starting on or after 1 April 2011.

#### _Transitional rules for existing QCs and LAQCs_

Special transitional rules allow existing QCs and LAQCs to transition into the new LTC rules or change to another business vehicle, without a tax cost.

If an existing QC or LAQC chooses not to transition they will remain in the QC rules, but cannot attribute losses to shareholders.

The transitional rules provide for the following:

*   Transition can take place in either one of the first two income years starting on or after 1 April 2011; the year chosen for transition is called the "transitional year".
*   QCs and LAQCs have six months from the start of their transitional year to advise Inland Revenue of their transition.
*   If transitioning to a new business structure, the partnership or sole tradership must consist of the same person(s) who owned the QC or LAQC. The transition into the new business form must be completed by the end of the transitional year.
*   The appropriate tax treatment (LTC, partnership or sole trader) will apply from the start of the transitional year.
*   All of the QCs assets, liabilities, tax balances and other obligations will automatically transfer to the new LTC, partnership or sole trader with no tax cost.
*   Any carried forward loss balances of a QC or an LAQC can be used in future but are effectively ring-fenced for owners of the LTC, or partners in the partnership, to use against future income from that LTC or that partnership.

### Application dates

The application date for both the new LTC rules and the qualifying company reforms is the income year starting on or after 1 April 2011. The LTC election filing rules apply from 21 December 2010.

Companies with an early balance date, for example, a company with a balance date of 31 December, can start using the LTC rules from their income year from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2012.

LAQCs with an early balance date of, for example, 31 December 2011, choosing not to transition but to use the QC rules will have loss attribution for their income year ended 31 December 2011 but will no longer be able to attribute losses for their income year starting on 1 January 2012.

Companies with a late balance date, for example, a company with a balance date of 31 May, can start using the LTC rules from their income year from 1 June 2011 to 31 May 2012.

To use the grandparented QC regime, QCs and LAQCs must have used the QC regime for their income year immediately before the income year starting on or after 1 April 2011. If transitioning in the second of the possible transitional years, they must also have met the QC criteria for the whole of the first possible transitional year.

### Detailed analysis

#### _Look-through company rules_

New subpart HB of the Income Tax Act 2007 contains the main LTC rules. It introduces the principle that LTCs are transparent for income tax purposes, and contains the LTC election requirements and rules on the tax treatment following an owner's disposal of interests in an LTC.

Section YA 1 introduces several defined terms, including "LTC", "owner's interest", "look-through interest" and "working owner".

Amendments have been made to income and deduction provisions and, in particular, to sections CB 32B and 32C, CX 63, DV 22 and GB 25B, as well consequential changes to the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the KiwiSaver Act 2006.

_Definition of "look-through company"_

_Sections HB 1(1), HB 13(4) and YA 1_

A company that elects to use the LTC rules must be a company (that is a body corporate or entity with a legal existence separate from that of its members) that is resident in New Zealand under domestic law and under any relevant double tax agreement. The company residence rules in section YD 2 apply for these purposes; in other words, it is the residence of the company and not its shareholders that is determinative.

A company using the LTC rules must have only one class of shares. All the shares must have the same rights to vote concerning company distributions, the company constitution, capital variation and director appointments, and to receive distributions of profits and net assets. This requirement prevents streaming of income or deductions under the LTC rules.

The shareholders of a company using the LTC rules must be either natural persons or trustees (including corporate trustees). An ordinary company cannot hold shares in an LTC. An LTC may be the "parent" of another LTC. The sub-LTC's income and expenses will ultimately be attributed to the owners of the parent LTC, and it is these owners who are included in the look-through counted owner test.

An LTC must have five or fewer "look-through counted owners".

To become an LTC, a company must meet all the eligibility criteria and must continue to meet it for the whole of the income year. If an LTC breaches the eligibility criteria its LTC status is lost from the first day of the income year in which the breach occurs. It cannot then use the LTC rules in the year in which the breach occurs or either of the following two income years.

A company that has elected to use the LTC rules is thereafter excluded from the definition of "company" in the Income Tax Act. This means that most of the rules that apply to companies, such as the requirement to keep memorandum accounts and the rules governing payments of dividends, do not apply to LTCs. However, for the following provisions there is no look-through treatment and the company, rather than its owners, is the relevant entity:

*   PAYE
*   FBT
*   RWT
*   NRWT
*   ESCT
*   RSCT
*   Subpart FO (Amalgamation of companies).

_The "look-through counted owners" test_

_Section YA 1_

An LTC must have five or fewer "look-through counted owners". This term applies for this count test only, and although related to shareholdings it is not always transposable with the term "owner" or "shareholder", such as when an LTC is the parent company of another LTC.

For many LTCs it will be clear that they meet the count test, for example, if the company has only three individual shareholders it clearly has fewer than five shareholders and so fewer than five "look-through counted owners". However, for companies that have more than five individual shareholders, or shareholders that include trustees, the look-through counted owner test needs to be considered.

The look-through counted owner test determines the number of look-through owners the company has for the purposes of the LTC rules by identifying the relationships between individual shareholders. Shareholders related by blood relationships (second degree), marriage, civil union or de facto relationship, or adoption are counted as a single "owner" for the purposes of this test.

The relationship between a step-parent and a step-child is a second-degree relationship.

Death or dissolution of marriage between the shareholders does not break the two-degree test, provided the company was an LTC and the shareholders were counted as "one" before the event.

**Example 1: Natural person shareholders**

![Example 1: Natural person shareholders. Zeb married Esther, and their son John married Olivia. They have two children - Benjamin, and Mary, who married Jones. Jones is the stepfather of Curtis, Mary's son.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/8/2/828e4a004632cb828452bf7747109566/leg-2010-company-example1.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203147&hash=30870E345314F1EA794B7933FB55FA48)

In the example above, if Zeb, Esther, Benjamin, Mary, Jones and Curtis all held shares in a company they would be counted as a single look-through counted owner because they are related to each other (via Mary) within two degrees.

If only Jones, Esther and Curtis held shares they would be counted as two look-through counted owners because although Jones, as his stepfather, is related to Curtis within two degrees, neither of them are related to Esther within two degrees, as she is Curtis's great grandmother and Jones's grandmother-in-law.

The look-through counted owner test must also be applied if a trustee holds shares in an LTC. Here the test will "look through" to the natural person beneficiaries of the trust (which includes looking through any corporate beneficiaries to its natural person shareholders), if those beneficiaries are allocated income from the LTC as beneficiary income in that income year, or in any of the three preceding income years.

The trustees of a trust are counted as one look-through counted owner for an income year if any income the trust was allocated from the LTC in that income year, and in each of the preceding three income years, was retained by the trust and not paid out as beneficiary income.

**Example 2: Trustee shareholder**

All the shares in Mountain Design Ltd, an LTC, are held by Walton Trust.

Walton Trust is managed by a corporate trustee. It distributes all of the income from Mountain Design Ltd to the following beneficiaries:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 20X1, 20X2 and 20X3 | Cora and Emily |
| 20X4 | Elizabeth, Emily and Mamie  <br>(Emily's sister) |
| 20X5 | Rosemary, Erin and Aimee  <br>(Cora's daughter) |

In 20X1, 20X2 and 20X3 there are two look through counted owners as between them Cora and Emily derived all of the LTC's income as beneficiary income.

In 20X4 there are three look-through counted owners, Cora, Elizabeth and Emily/Mamie. Because Mamie is Emily's sister (a two-degree blood relative) they are counted as one owner.

In 20X5 there are five look-through counted owners, because the test considers who received beneficiary income in the current income year (20X5), and any of the three preceding income years (20X2, 20X3 and 20X4). The look-through counted owners are:

*   Cora/Aimee (counted as one)
*   Elizabeth
*   Mamie/Emily (counted as one)
*   Rosemary
*   Erin.

If a company (including a qualifying company) is the beneficiary of a trust and has received income from the LTC as beneficiary income in that income year, or in any of the three preceding income years, then the company itself is not regarded as a look-through counted owner. Instead the test counts all natural persons who have a voting interest in relation to that company, whether directly or otherwise.

_Look-through company elections_

_Sections HB 1 and HB 13_

The LTC regime is elective. A company can only use the LTC rules if it continuously meets all the eligibility criteria, and has filed a valid election with Inland Revenue.

##### Making an election

All owners must sign an LTC election in order for a company to first become an LTC. A guardian or legal representative must sign for owners aged under 18, or any other owner without legal capacity. The director or other authorised company agent should send the election form to Inland Revenue, and confirm that all the owners have signed it.

An LTC election may also be signed by a person holding shares as a nominee or as a bare trustee for the beneficial owner, acting on instructions and on behalf of the beneficial owner under section YB 21.

The LTC election must be received by Inland Revenue before the start of the income year in which the company wishes to be an LTC. Elections relate to the income year of the company electing to become an LTC; so the due date for the election depends upon its balance date.

Newly incorporated or non-active companies must file the LTC election by the date for filing their first income tax return.

If an LTC election is received after the start of the year to which it was intended to apply, or if it is discovered to be invalid because, for example, not all the shareholders signed the election, it may still be accepted as a valid election. However, the Commissioner's discretion will be exercised only if exceptional circumstances, such as a severe illness, caused the omission or lateness, and if any omission in the election is rectified in that income year.

A company will remain an LTC without any further LTC election. It will cease to be an LTC only if it breaches the eligibility criteria, or the LTC election is revoked.

##### Revoking an election

Any owner may revoke the LTC election. It does not matter whether they were one of the initial owners who signed the election or not. The revocation notice must be received by Inland Revenue before the start of the income year to which it applies. A copy should be sent to the director of the LTC, to ensure that all owners are aware of the change in status.

If a revocation notice is received after the start of the income year to which it relates, the Commissioner may still accept it, if it was late due to exceptional circumstances.

A revocation may be ignored if the owner issuing the revocation notice disposes of all their interests in the LTC, and the person(s) who acquire these interests advise Inland Revenue before the start of the relevant income year that the previous owner's revocation notice is to be reversed.

To protect the integrity of the new rules, if an owner revokes the LTC election the company cannot use the LTC rules in the year for which the revocation is made, or in either of the following two income years.

_Becoming a look-through company_

_Sections CB 32C and HB 3_

Any loss balance of a company from income years before becoming an LTC is cancelled when it becomes an LTC.

If a company becomes an LTC after its first year of trading, its reserves are regarded as held by the owners in proportion to their look-through interest. So when a company first becomes an LTC, each owner will be deemed to have an amount of income arising on the first day of the income year the company becomes an LTC. This is necessary because under the LTC rules these reserves may be distributed or drawn down upon without the owners being subject to tax upon distribution; this treatment is not intended to apply to previously accumulated company reserves.

Similar rules apply if a company that is not an LTC amalgamates with an LTC.

The amount of each owner's income is equal to their proportion (based on look-through counted interests) of the amount of the company's reserves that would be taxable if the company was liquidated and assets distributed to shareholders. The formula to determine the amount of these reserves, which applied to the company immediately before it became an LTC, is:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (   | a   | +   | c   | −   | b   | −   | c   | )   | −   | e   |
| d   |

Where:

**a** is the amount that would be taxable dividends of the company on distribution following a deemed winding up.

**b** is the assessable income, less allowable deductions, that would be derived by the company on a deemed winding up. This includes items such as depreciation recovered, bad debts and loss on sale of assets.

**c** is balances on the company's ICA and FDP account immediately before becoming an LTC, plus any unpaid income tax for earlier years, less any income tax refunds due from these earlier years.

**d** is the company tax rate in the income year before the income year in which the company becomes an LTC.

**e** is the exit dividends that, if the company had previously been an LTC and is now re-entering the LTC rules, would be attributed to any retained reserves from the previous LTC period that have not since been distributed.

Each owner is subject to tax on their proportion of these reserves, which are regarded as an income amount to them. This income amount is deemed to arise to owners in the income year the company becomes an LTC, and each owner pays income tax on the amount at their personal tax rate.

Slightly different rules apply to existing QCs or LAQCs who choose to transition to the LTC rules in either the first or second income year that starts on or after 1 April 2011.

_Ceasing to be a look-through company_

_Sections CD 43 and CX 63_

If a company ceases to be an LTC but continues in existence, it will be taxed as an ordinary company. Any retained revenue profits held by the company would have been previously allocated to owners who would have been subject to tax on this income in the year the income was derived.

To prevent any double taxation of this income, dividends paid by the company in income years after it ceases to be an LTC will be regarded as paid firstly from this retained revenue profit until an amount of dividends equal to the amount of retained profit has been paid. This applies whether the dividends are paid to the same shareholders that held shares while the company was an LTC or to new shareholders.

Dividends regarded as paid from this retained revenue profit are excluded income in the hands of the shareholder recipients.

The available subscribed capital formula is adjusted to reflect capital distributions made while the company is an LTC, taking into account both equity subscriptions and returns on that equity.

_A look-through company is transparent_

_Sections CB 32B, DV 22, GB 23(2), GB 25B, GB 29, HB 1(4) to (5) and HB 2_

With some exceptions, for the purposes of the Income Tax Act, owners are generally treated as carrying on activities and having the status, intention and purpose of the LTC. While the LTC is treated as not carrying on these activities or having such an intention or purpose. The exceptions to look-through are for the purposes of the PAYE rules, the FBT rules, the RWT and NRWT rules, the ESCT rules, the RSCT rules and subpart FO (which deals with the amalgamation of companies).

Generally though, LTCs are transparent for income tax purposes. Owners are treated as holding property in proportion to their effective look-through interest, and as parties to an arrangement, and doing or being entitled to a thing, through their capacity as owner, unless the context requires otherwise.

An owner's effective look-through interest in an LTC is measured by the percentage of decision-making rights carried by their shares in the company in relation to dividends or other distributions, the company constitution, variation of the company's capital and director appointments or elections.

##### Methods for allocation of income and deductions

Income, expenses, tax credits, rebates, gains and losses are passed through to owners. These items are generally allocated in accordance with an owner's effective look-through interest in the company, and will usually be allocated according to their average yearly interests, as if each item occurred uniformly throughout the year.

If the voting interest or market value interest varies during the year, owners may use the weighted average basis to determine their effective look-through interest, as shown in Example 3a.

If the company has a market value circumstance in the year, the owner's effective look-through interest is calculated as the average of their voting interest and the market value interest in the company for the income year.

**Example 3a: Income and deduction allocation - average yearly interests**

Walnut Ltd is an LTC with a standard balance date.

For the first nine months of the year Charles holds 60% of the shares, and his wife Caroline holds 40%. On 31 December Caroline sells all her shares to Laura.

Caroline and Laura have been shareholders for nine months (275 days) and three months (90 days) respectively.

Walnut Ltd's income statement for the year shows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|     | $   |
| Trading income | 500,000 |
| Allowable expenses | (300,000) |
|     | 200,000 |
| Gross interest | 10,000 |
| RWT (28%) | (2,800) |

The income and deductions are regarded as accruing evenly throughout the year, and are allocated to each shareholder based on their yearly average as follows:

**Charles's** allocation is determined as:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
|     |     | $   |
| Trading income | 0.6 × 500,000 | 300,000 |
| Allowable expenses | 0.6 × 300,000 | (180,000) |
|     |     | 120,000 |
| Gross interest | 0.6 × 10,000 | 6,000 |
| RWT (28%) |     | (1,680) |

**Caroline's** allocation is determined as:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
|     |     | $   |
| Trading income | (275/365) × 0.4 × 500,000 | 150,000 |
| Allowable expenses | (275/365) × 0.4 × 300,000 | (90,000) |
|     |     | 60,000 |
| Gross interest | (275/365) × 0.4 × 10,000 | 3,000 |
| RWT (28%) |     | (840) |

**Laura's** allocation is determined as:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
|     |     | $   |
| Trading income | (90/365) × 0.4 × 500,000 | 50,000 |
| Allowable expenses | (90/365) × 0.4 × 300,000 | (30,000) |
|     |     | 20,000 |
| Gross interest | (90/365) × 0.4 × 10,000 | 1,000 |
| RWT (28%) |     | (280) |

Alternatively, if the voting interest or market value interest varies during the year owners can use their actual look-through interest in each period during the income year. This is applied to the income, expenses and other flow-through items from each period, and then added together. This requires accurate accrual accounts to be prepared for each period of ownership within the income year.

**Example 3b: Income and deduction allocation - accounts method**

If, in Example 3a, Walnut Ltd had drawn up a full accounts and a profit and loss statement for the period before and after Caroline disposed of her shares it would have shown:

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     | **1 Apr to  <br>31 Dec** | **1 Jan to  <br>31 Mar** | **Annual** |
|     | $   | $   | $   |
| Trading income | 100,000 | 400,000 | 500,000 |
| Allowable expenses | (100,000) | (200,000) | (300,000) |
|     | Nil | 200,000 | 200,000 |
| Gross interest | 7,500 | 2,500 | 10,000 |

**Charles's** allocation for the year is the same as in Example 3a.

**Caroline's** allocation for the 1 April to 31 December period is determined as:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
|     |     | $   |
| Trading income | 0.4 × 100,000 | 40,000 |
| Allowable expenses | 0.4 × 100,000 | (40,000) |
|     |     | Nil |
| Gross interest | 0.4 × 7,500 | 3,000 |
| RWT (28%) |     | (840) |

**Laura's** allocation for the 1 January to 31 March period is determined as:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
|     |     | $   |
| Trading income | 0.4 × 400,000 | 160,000 |
| Allowable expenses | 0.4 × 200,000 | (80,000) |
|     |     | 80,000 |
| Gross interest | 0.4 × 2,500 | 1,000 |
| RWT (28%) |     | (280) |

The Commissioner may require the LTC to use this accounts method if its taxable income in a 12-month period is $3 million or more, and if the Commissioner considers that the accounts method would result in a more equitable and reasonable measure of effective look-through interest in an income year.

_Excessive effective look-through interests_

The Commissioner may adjust the effective look-through interests of owners and consequently the income and deduction allocation if he considers that the current application provides excessive income allocations to an owner aged under 20.

This is an anti-avoidance provision, and aims to prevent income being unduly diverted to owners under the age of 20. It applies when two or more owners of an LTC are relatives, and one of them is under 20 years. In reallocating income and deductions for an income year, the Commissioner will consider the value of the contributions by way of service or capital rendered by the owner aged under 20, together with any other relevant matters.

_Excessive remuneration to relatives_

_Section GB 25B_

The Commissioner may adjust the allocation of income and deductions from the LTC to its owners if the LTC employs a relative of the owner, and the Commissioner considers that the remuneration paid to the relative for their services is excessive.

This is an anti-avoidance provision, to prevent income being unduly diverted to an owner's relatives. In reallocating income and deductions for an income year, the Commissioner will consider the nature and extent of services rendered by the relative, and any other relevant matters.

This provision does not apply if the relative is aged over 20 at the date of entering into a written contact of employment with the LTC, providing they have real control over the income paid to them under the contract.

_Income from personal services_

_Section GB 29_

For the purposes of applying the attribution rule for income from personal services (section GB 27), an LTC is treated as the associated entity, and is not treated as transparent.

_ACC levies_

For the purposes of ACC levies for natural person owners, a working owner is regarded as an employee and will pay the employee's levy while the LTC will pay the employer's levy. Other owners may receive a deduction for that expense.

An owner who is not a "working owner" but who personally exerts themselves in the LTCs income generating activities will be regarded as self-employed for ACC purposes and will pay the ACC levies as a self-employed person.

An owner who plays no active part in the LTC's business is regarded as a passive investor for ACC purposes, and is not subject to ACC levies on income attributed to them from the LTC. This includes any LTC income attributed to a natural person as beneficiary income via a trustee owner.

Each owner is responsible for assessing if their income from the LTC's business activities is of an active or passive nature, and declaring it accordingly in their individual income tax return.

_Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 13, No 3 (March 2001) has detailed information on the classification of ACC levies in partnerships. The same principles apply to LTCs and owners. For further details, please refer to that article, taking references to partners and partnerships as references to owners and LTCs as necessary.

_Loss limitation_

_Sections HB 11 and HB 12_

New section HB 11 ensures that owners' deductions are restricted if the amount of their deductions exceeds the adjusted tax book value of their investment in the LTC (the "owner's basis"). In that event, the deductions an owner can claim are limited to an amount equal to their owner's basis.

This is an anti-avoidance provision and will generally only apply if a company's tax losses are not matched by the owner's contributions. The rule aims to ensure that owners can offset tax losses only to the extent these reflect their economic losses. This reflects the fact that owners of a company enjoy limited liability under the corporate veil.

The owner's basis is calculated for each owner using the following formula:

*   investments − distributions + income − deductions − disallowed amounts

Where:

_investments_ is the sum of the equity, goods or assets introduced or services provided to the LTC, or any amounts paid by the owner on behalf of the LTC. This includes any loans, including shareholder current account credit balances, made by the owner to the LTC and their share of any LTC debt which they, or their associate, have guaranteed (or provided indemnities for).

_distributions_ is anything paid out to the owner by the LTC, including dividends and loans, including shareholder current account debit balances. It does not include any salary or wages received by a working owner.

_income_ is the owner's share of the LTC's income (including exempt and excluded income) and capital gains from the current and any preceding tax years (in which the company was an LTC).

_deductions_ is the owner's share of the LTC's deductions and capital losses in the preceding tax years (in which the company was an LTC).

_disallowed_ amount is the amount of investments made by an owner within 60 days of the last day of the LTC's income year if these are distributed or reduced within 60 days after the last day of the income year. This is to prevent the creation of an artificially high basis around the end of the year. To allow for normal operational cashflow, if the reduction of investments within 60 days of the balance sheet date is less than $10,000, it may be ignored.

**Example 4: Loss limitation**

Oleson Ltd, an LTC, starts to operate a plant hire business in 20X1. It has three owners, Eleanor, William and Harriet, with shareholdings of 20%, 30% and 50% respectively.

Oleson Ltd is given a non-repayable business grant by a local entrepreneurial fund of $50,000. Its owners contribute a further $100,000, each contributing in proportion to their shareholding. Oleson Ltd also has a $100,000 interest-only loan from the bank, which Harriet has personally secured by guarantee against her residential property.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|     | $   |
| Plant | 250,000 |
| Shareholder capital | 100,000 |
| Entrepreneur grant | 50,000 |
| Bank loan | 100,000 |

The plant is depreciable at 20% pa = $50,000  
Repair and maintenance costs = $20,000 pa  
Interest costs = $10,000 pa (10% interest rate pa)

The plant produces hire income of $60,000 a year. Oleson Ltd pays total dividends of $30,000 each year. For the first five years of trading Oleson Ltd's accounts will show:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|     | $   |
| Income | 60,000 |
| Repairs | (20,000) |
| Interest | (10,000) |
| Depreciation | (50,000) |
| Net loss | (20,000) |

The owner's basis (there are no disallowed amounts in this example) determines the amount of their share of the $80,000 deductions that each owner can claim as follows:

| $   | Investment | Distribution | Income | Prior year deductions | Owner's basis | Current year deductions allowed | Restricted deductions c/f |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **20X1** |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

| Harriet | 150,000 | 75,000 | 150,000 | 160,000 | 65,000 | 40,000 | 0   |

Any deductions that an owner does not claim in an income year due to the operation of the loss limitation rule are carried forward and may be claimed in future years, subject to the application of the loss limitation rule in those years.

If the company ceases to be an LTC but continues in business as an ordinary company, the owner may use any "restricted deductions" against any future dividends he or she receives from the company.

If the owner ceases to hold shares in the company and so ceases to have an effective look-through interest in the LTC, the "restricted deductions" cannot be used unless the owner later reacquires shares in the same company.

_Disposal of look-through interests_

_Sections FB 1(3), FB 10B, FC 1(2) and HB 4 to HB 10_

##### Disposal of shares is disposal of underlying LTC property

The owners of an LTC are treated as holding LTC property directly, in proportion to their effective look-through interest. When owners sell their shares in the LTC they are treated as disposing of their share in the underlying LTC property, and will bear any tax consequences associated with the disposal.

However, sections HB 5 to HB 10 remove the requirement for the owner selling the shares (the exiting owner) to account for tax on this disposal of underlying property when the tax adjustment that would otherwise be required is below certain thresholds.

When a look-through interest is transferred as part of a settlement of relationship property, and the rules in subpart FB apply, there is no disposal of shares under the LTC rules. Instead, the transferee is treated as having acquired the look-through interests on the date they were acquired by the transferor, and will take on the transferor's cost basis. This only applies in relation to the disposal provisions. For the purposes of allocating an LTC's income or deductions in the year of transfer, the weighted average basis or the accounts method will apply to the transferor and transferee's periods of actual ownership in the year.

##### Deemed disposal of underlying LTC property

If the company ceases to use the LTC rules, but otherwise continues, the owner is deemed to have disposed of the underlying property at market value on the date of exit. The company is deemed to have immediately reacquired the property at the same market value.

For the purposes of the land provisions in subpart CB, the associated person rule in section CB 15 applies. This means that the "date" on which the company is regarded as acquiring land is the same date on which the "owners" (via the LTC) acquired the land. The owners are effectively regarded collectively as the transferor, and the company as the transferee.

If an owner ceases to hold interests in the LTC because it permanently ceases to exist as a company, for example, through liquidation or Court order, there is a deemed disposal of the shares, at market value.

An owner's interest may also be reduced by cancellation or repurchase of their shares by the LTC. This is a deemed disposal of the shares for their market value, unless it is part of a pro-rata cancellation applied to all owners, and so does not actually alter each owner's effective look-through interest.

In the case of permanent cessation or share repurchase, any actual consideration received by the owner is ignored and the disposal is deemed to occur at market value.

The disposal threshold provisions in sections HB 5 to HB 10 do not apply in these deemed disposal circumstances.

##### Disposals thresholds

Sections HB 5 to HB 10 remove the requirement for the owner selling the shares (the "exiting owner") to account for tax on the disposal of underlying property when the tax adjustment that would otherwise be required is below certain thresholds.

When these provisions apply, the new owner (the "entering owner") is treated as acquiring their interests in the LTC's underlying property for the same cost that the exiting owner had acquired them.

The thresholds are:

*   $50,000 threshold -  
      
    Exiting owners are required to account for tax on sale of shares only if the amount of the disposal proceeds exceeds the total net tax book value of the owner's share of the LTC property (less any liabilities under generally accepted accounting practice) by more than $50,000. When shares in the same LTC have been sold within a 12-month period, all sales are taken into account for the purposes of the threshold.  
      
    
*   Trading stock -  
      
    Exiting owners do not have to perform a revenue account adjustment for trading stock if the LTC's total annual turnover is $3 million or less.  
      
    
*   Depreciable tangible property -  
      
    Exiting owners do not have to account for depreciation recovery or loss on their share of any depreciable tangible asset if the historical cost of the asset is $200,000 or less.  
      
    
*   Financial arrangements -  
      
    Exiting owners are not required to perform a base price adjustment for their interest in a financial arrangement if:
    
    *   the LTC is not in the business of deriving income from financial arrangements; and
    *   the financial arrangement has been entered into as a necessary and incidental purpose of the LTC's business.
    
    Exiting owners do not have to account for tax on financial arrangements and excepted financial arrangements described in section EW 5(10).  
      
    
*   Short-term sale and purchase agreements -  
      
    When exiting owners dispose of some or all of their look-through interests in a short term sale and purchase agreement, the consideration received is excluded income.  
      
    
*   Livestock -  
      
    If the LTC property consists of livestock that includes female breeding livestock that is valued using the national standard cost scheme (section EC 22) or the cost price method (section EC 25), the entering owner may furnish a return of income choosing to apply section EC 26B. The entering owner is treated as if they had originally purchased and held the livestock, not the exiting owner. This is designed to reduce compliance costs for the LTC.

_Working owners_

_Sections DC 3B, HB 11(6), RD 5(3) and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007; section 14(1) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006_

A working owner is an owner who is employed by the LTC under a written contract of employment and who personally and actively performs the duties of their employment for the LTC under that contract. This does not apply if the LTC is wholly or mainly engaged in investing money or in holding or dealing in shares, securities, investments, estates or interests in land.

An LTC's payments to a working owner are included in that owner's salary or wages, and the PAYE rules will apply. When computing their owner's basis, these wages or salaries are excluded from the distributions element of the formula.

An expense deduction is available to all owners of an LTC for wage and salary payments made to working owners.

The rules for automatic enrolment of employees into KiwiSaver do not apply to an owner in receipt of salary or wages only because they are a working owner in an LTC.

_Interests in livestock_

_Section EC 12(4)_

For the purposes of making a valuation election for specified livestock, a person's interests in an LTC that owns livestock is treated separately from any other interest that person may have in livestock. Separate elections are needed for each set of livestock, and different valuation methods may be applied to each.

_Excepted financial arrangements_

_Section EW 5(11B)_

A look-through interest for an LTC is an excepted financial arrangement.

_Associated persons_

_Section YB 13_

The LTC and an owner who is an employee or a director of the LTC are associated.

The LTC and an owner who has effective look-through interests of 25% or more are associated.

The look-through interests of owners associated under sections YB 2 to YB 11 and YB 14 are aggregated. A slightly modified aggregation rule applies for the purposes of land provisions.

_Tax administration_

_Sections 42B, 89C(ka), 89D(1), 89DA, 138B and 141B(8) of the Tax Administration Act 1994_

An LTC must file a return of income, ignoring the look-through requirements. The return must specify the amount of income and deductions allocated to each owner.

Only the LTC may propose adjustments to the tax position taken in its return, which the Commissioner may reject by written notice. The LTC may also reject any adjustments proposed by the Commissioner. An owner is entitled to challenge any assessment in relation to their interests in the look-through company by commencing proceedings in a hearing authority only after the disputes process in Part 4A is completed.

The Commissioner may issue an assessment to an owner on their tax position in relation to their look-through interests without issuing a notice of proposed adjustment if the LTC and the Commissioner have completed the disputes process for the return of income and that tax position.

For the purposes of applying shortfall penalties, and for determining a tax shortfall amount, the amounts returned on the tax return of the LTC are treated as if they were the amounts returned by each owner.

#### _Changes to the qualifying company rules_

_Grandparented qualifying company rules_

_Section HA 5, HA 7B_

Existing QCs and LAQCs may continue to use the qualifying company rules in subpart HA, without the ability to attribute losses. This will be the default option for all existing QCs and LAQCs for income years starting on or after 1 April 2011.

The definition of an LAQC and the various provisions in subpart HA which provided for an LAQC to attribute losses to its shareholders have been repealed.

The grandparenting rules apply only to companies that are QCs or LAQCs in the income year immediately before the income year starting on or after 1 April 2011; this is called the "grandparenting income year".

Existing QCs and LAQCs include companies already registered with Inland Revenue as QCs or LAQCs, and companies such as newly incorporated companies, for whom the grandparenting income year is the first year for which they are required to submit a return of income, and who send their valid election to Inland Revenue within the timeframe allowed in section HA 30(3).

_Transitional rules for existing QCs and LAQCs_

_Section HZ 4B to section HZ 4D_

The transitional rules apply only to companies that are QCs or LAQCs in the income year immediately before the income year starting on or after 1 April 2011. If they are transitioning in the second of the possible "transitional" years they must also have met the QC criteria for the whole of the first possible transitional year.

Transition can take place in either one of the first two income years starting on or after 1 April 2011. The year chosen for transition is called the "transitional year".

The transitional rules are designed to provide a smooth transition for existing QCs and LAQCs to leave the QC rules and start using the LTC rules if they wish to do so.

They also provide an option for existing QCs and LAQCs to transition their business structure into a partnership, limited partnership or sole trader, with no tax cost. This transition will require the setting up of the alternative business structure, and the transfer of assets, liabilities, legal titles and so forth from the QC to the chosen structure. These changes will be completed under the relevant general law. They are not dealt with in the transitional rules, which are concerned solely with tax matters arising from, during or after the transfer.

The transitional rules are deliberately outcome focused. The exact process each QC will need to complete in order to transition will vary according to its existing structures and governance. Any interim measures necessary to transition will generally be ignored for tax purposes, as long as the new business structure is in place by the end of the chosen transitional year.

All of the necessary transfers of assets and liabilities, plus all other legal documentation necessary in the new business structure must be completed by that date. However the tax treatment of the new business structure (that is a partnership or sole tradership) will be applied from the start of the transitional year. This effectively provides a QC or LAQC with up to 12 months to reconstitute its business structure.

##### Transitioning to the LTC rules

All the shareholders of the existing QC or LAQC must complete the LTC election within six months of the start of the transitional income year. Making the LTC election revokes the previous QC and LAQC elections with effect for, and from the beginning of, that transitional income year.

When an existing company becomes an LTC its owners are usually treated as having an amount of taxable income equal to their proportion of the amount of the company's reserves that would be taxable if the company were to be liquidated and its assets distributed. However, under the transitional provision no income amount will arise, and so no tax will be paid by owners when an existing QC or LAQC transitions to become an LTC.

The carried forward loss balance of a QC, and any controlled foreign company (CFC) or foreign investment fund (FIF) losses carried forward by an LAQC, may be used by the owners of the LTC in future years against their share of net income from that LTC. For CFC or FIF losses carried forward, the normal country ring-fencing rules in subpart IQ will apply too.

The LTC loss limitation rules do not affect an owner's claim to these brought-forward losses.

For the purposes of the LTC loss limitation rules, there are two options for determining an owner's basis:

*   the market value or the accounting book value of the amounts used to determine a owner's basis for the loss limitation rules. These values should be taken at the last day of the transitional year; and
*   the historic basis, as if the LTC rules had always applied and the LTC had always existed.

If the application of the loss limitation rules calculates an owner's basis at less than zero, the owner's basis is treated as zero.

##### Transition to a partnership or limited partnership

Existing QCs and LAQCs may transition to become a partnership or a limited partnership during their transitional year under the "QCP transitional process".

This means that during the transitional year, the QC or LAQC must notify Inland Revenue that it intends to become a partnership or limited partnership under the QCP transitional process. Notification should be made within six months of the start of the transitional year. This notification will revoke its QC status from the start of that transitional year.

The partners of the partnership that emerges following the transition should be the same as the shareholders of the QC. One exception to this is a limited partnership, when a company may be used as the general partner with the shareholders of the QC being the limited partners.

Each partner should have the same relative interests in the partnership as in the QC. If several QCs transition into one partnership it is the net position of the partners following transition that should be compared.

**Example: Transition into partnership**

Mr A and Mr B each own 50% of AB Ltd, an LAQC with net assets of $3,000.

Mr X and Mr Y each own 50% of XY Ltd, a QC with net assets of $12,000.

They form a new limited partnership which has partnership net assets of $15,000. Each individual is a limited partner and Alphabet Ltd is incorporated to become the general partner.

Mr A and Mr B will each hold a 10% partnership share ($1,500 of the partnership's assets).

Mr X and Mr Y will each hold a 40% partnership share ($6,000 of the partnership's assets).

Alphabet Ltd is the general partner, but holds no partnership share.

The carried forward loss balance of a QC, and any CFC or FIF losses carried forward by a LAQC, may be used by the partners of the partnership in future years, against their share of net income from that partnership. In the case of CFC or FIF losses carried forward, the normal country ring-fencing rules in subpart IQ will also apply.

The limited partnership loss limitation rules do not affect a limited partner's claim to these brought-forward losses.

For the purposes of the limited partnership loss limitation rules, there are two options for determining the partners' basis of a limited partnership:

*   the market value or the accounting book value of the amounts used to determine a member's basis for the loss limitation rules. The values are taken at the last day of the transitional year; and
*   the historic basis, as if the limited partnership rules had always applied and the limited partnership had always existed.

If the application of the loss limitation rules calculates a partner's basis as less than zero, the partner's basis is treated as zero.

##### Transition to sole trader

Existing QCs and LAQCs with only one natural person shareholder may transition to become a sole tradership during their transitional year under the "QCST transitional process".

This means that during the transitional year, the owner of the QC or LAQC must notify the Commissioner that he or she intends to operate as a sole trader, and transition the business under the QCST transitional process. Notification should be made within six months of the start of the transitional year. This notification will also revoke the company's QC status from the start of that transitional year.

The carried forward loss balance of a QC, and any CFC or FIF losses carried forward by an LAQC, may be used by the sole trader in future years. In the case of CFC or FIF losses carried forward, the normal country ring-fencing rules in subpart IQ will apply.

##### Tax outcomes of completing the QCP or QCST transitional process

As long as the QCP or QCST transitional process is completed by the end of the chosen transitional year any income and expenses during the transitional year will be treated as arising to the partnership or the sole trader from the start of the transitional year, even if, as a matter of fact, they actually arose during a part of the transitional year when the business was still in a corporate form. For example, a written contract of service for a working partner may be "deemed" to be in place from the start of the transitional year, and the partnership and working partner taxed accordingly, even though in reality that contract will not have been in place until mid-way through the year, after the partnership had been established.

Other adjustments to accommodate tax paid by the QC or LAQC during the early part of a transitional year may also be necessary, and any reallocations or repayments should be discussed with Inland Revenue when the transition has been completed. Partners or sole traders will also need to consider any implications for their own tax position, including the need to complete personal tax returns or make provisional tax payments on their own account.

If the QCP or QCST transitional process is not completed by the end of the transitional year the company will be taxed as an ordinary company for that year, as its QC status will have been revoked. There may also be tax consequences from the parts of the incomplete transition that have already been carried out.

Under the QCP and QCST transitional process there is no tax cost arising from the transfer of assets, liabilities and any relevant rights and obligations from the QC to the partnership or sole trader. The historical tax position of the QC instead transfers to the partnership or sole trader. This means any future adjustments to income or deductions relating to the QC period will be dealt with through the partnership or the sole trader.

The memorandum account balances and other related tax accounts (such as ASC) for a company that was a QC or LAQC before the transition are extinguished. The company effectively becomes a "shell" company, and may be liquidated or removed from the New Zealand Companies Office Register.

Changes to the secrecy and information sharing rules
====================================================

2011 changes to the secrecy and information sharing rules facilitate the sharing of tax information between IR and other government agencies.

**_Section 81(1) and new section 81BA of the Tax Administration Act 1994_** 

Amendments have been made to the Tax Administration Act 1994 to:

*   relax the taxpayer secrecy rules for tax administration purposes; and
*   facilitate the sharing of tax information between Inland Revenue and other government agencies.

#### Background

In June 2010, the discussion document _Making Tax Easier_, was released for consultation, alongside an online forum seeking feedback on a range of proposals aimed at making the tax system easier and more efficient for taxpayers to interact with. Included were proposals concerning the operation of Inland Revenue's tax secrecy rules.

Inland Revenue is subject to a strict obligation of secrecy in relation to the information it collects and holds. The general rule, contained in section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, requires all employees of Inland Revenue to keep secret all matters that come to their knowledge relating to the Acts administered by Inland Revenue. This is subject to a number of exceptions, for purposes both related, and unrelated, to the administration of the tax system.

The operation of the New Zealand tax system is heavily reliant on taxpayers voluntarily complying with their obligations. For taxpayers to be willing to comply with their obligations, it is critical that they trust Inland Revenue. Appropriate treatment of taxpayer information is an important aspect of building and maintaining this trust.

However, Inland Revenue also needs to be able to disclose information to taxpayers and third parties in certain circumstances, in order to efficiently operate the tax system. There are also certain situations when disclosure, while not directly related to the operation of the tax system, has been considered important enough by Government that a specific exception to the secrecy rule has had to be enacted.

Therefore changes have been made to Inland Revenue's information disclosure rules. First, to relax the taxpayer secrecy rules, to extend the ability of the Commissioner to release taxpayer specific information for the purposes of administering the tax system, subject to certain criteria (section 81(1)) and secondly, in relation to Inland Revenue's ability to share information with other government agencies (new section 81BA).

### Key features

**_Section 81(1) of the Tax Administration Act - Disclosures for tax administration purposes_**

The Act amends the secrecy rule contained in section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to give the Commissioner of Inland Revenue greater discretion to release taxpayer information for the purpose of administering the tax system more efficiently. The new rule only permits disclosures that are made in the course of the Commissioner's duties - that is, the disclosure must be for the purpose of executing or supporting the execution of a duty of the Commissioner.

In deciding whether to exercise the discretion to release information, the Commissioner must consider his obligation to use best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system, the importance of promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, the resources available to him, any personal or commercial impact of the communication, and the public availability of the information. Following consideration of these factors, the Commissioner may release information if the communication is considered reasonable, having regard to the purpose of the disclosure and these factors.

A draft standard practice statement has been released for comments, setting out how the new rules will be administered in different situations. (See inside front cover of the _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 23, No 8 (October 2011) for the notice.) The statement outlines the process for disclosure and the level at which different types of disclosure are signed off. It also provides examples of situations where disclosure will and will not be permitted under the new rules.

Inland Revenue will in future include information regarding the use of the new secrecy rules in its annual report. This will constitute a brief summary of the use of the provision over the previous year in particular noting any issues or areas of complaints that have arisen.

#### _New section 81BA of the Tax Administration Act - Sharing information with other Government agencies_

The Act also introduces changes to facilitate the sharing of tax information between Inland Revenue and other government agencies. This will allow more efficient use of information collected by Inland Revenue and reduce the need for individuals to provide duplicated information to multiple government agencies. The Act allows an Order in Council to be made, authorising the sharing of Inland Revenue information with another government agency.

Inland Revenue can communicate the information if it is already available to Inland Revenue, it is reasonable and practicable for the Commissioner to do so and certain criteria are satisfied. The criteria are:

*   the government agency seeking access to the information must have the ability and authority to collect the information in its own right;
*   it is either inefficient for the agency seeking access to collect and/or verify the information itself, or there must be compliance benefits to individuals for the information to be shared rather than collected separately;
*   an Order in Council is made to specify and authorise the nature, type or class of the information to be shared with another government agency; and
*   the Commissioner and the government agency have entered into a memorandum that states the purpose of the communication of the information, the use that may be made of the information, and the arrangements that may be made of the information, and the arrangements for the control, security, subsequent disclosure, and accuracy of the information, including access to it by taxpayers, as well as providing for monitoring arrangements.

The final decision on whether information should be shared with another agency will be made by Cabinet. Before recommending a sharing arrangement to Cabinet the Minister must consult with the Privacy Commissioner, the agencies that may be affected by the proposed order, and any organisations considered by the Minister to represent the interests of those likely to be substantially affected by the proposed information sharing arrangement. Further, the Minister must determine that the information to be shared is not so sensitive that it will unduly inhibit individuals from providing accurate information in the future.

The changes seek to strike an appropriate balance between individuals' privacy rights and a more efficient and effective government service. Several privacy safeguards are built into the legislative framework, such as the requirement that information shared must be information that the requesting agency is authorised and able to collect in its own right. In addition, Inland Revenue and the agency seeking access to the information must enter into a memorandum of understanding, covering a range of specified matters, including safeguards for the information being shared.

The first information sharing arrangement is likely to be with the Ministry of Social Development. Inland Revenue currently has eight information-matching agreements with the Ministry under the current Privacy Act 1993. In several of these matches Inland Revenue is unable to provide information until the Ministry has sent information to Inland Revenue on selected individuals and a match has been found. Inland Revenue is currently unable to, for example, advise the Ministry of cases of benefit overpayment it becomes aware of, unless an information matching request has been generated by the Ministry in respect of the individual concerned.

The Act includes provision for a review of the information sharing framework after five years of operation to consider any impact on the privacy of individuals, the impact on the tax system, and whether any further amendments to the law are necessary.

#### Application date

Section 81(1) and new section 81BA came into force on 29 August 2011.

Changes to the Tax Depreciation Rules
=====================================

2005 changes to the tax depreciation rules including treatment of patents, additions to depreciable intangible property, and deductibility for losses on buildings.

The tax depreciation rules have been changed to improve their operation. They include changes to the tax depreciation treatment of patents, additions to the list of depreciable intangible property, extending deductibility for losses on buildings and the special tax depreciation rate rules.

### Patents

_**Sections CB 26, DB 31, EE 27, EE 27B, EE 27C, EE 27D, EE 52(4), FF 8, OB 1 and Schedule 17 of the Income Tax Act 2004**_

Tax depreciation of patent costs will be allowed to begin from the date a patent application is lodged with a complete specification, for applications lodged on or after 1 April 2005.

For patent applications lodged before 1 April 2005 that are granted in the 2005-06 or a subsequent income year depreciation will be allowed from the date of grant. Depreciation for the period the patent is pending will be allowed as a "catch-up" deduction in the year of grant.

#### Background

Depreciation of patents was previously allowed only from the date a patent was granted. However, the legal life of a patent - 20 years (or 240 months) - applies from the date the application for a patent was lodged with a complete specification, once a patent is granted. The change originally proposed was to recognise depreciation for the period a patent application was pending as a "catch-up" deduction in the year a patent application was granted.

Submissions put forward the view, however, that the economic life of a patent effectively begins when an application is lodged as this is when the underlying invention is typically commercialised. Also, the date of filing an application is important as it has implications for the legal priority given to competing patents.

The application first filed has legal priority and enables its owner to both generate revenue from commercialisation of the invention and prevents others from operating in the same field.

Therefore, on the recommendation of the Finance and Expenditure Committee, tax depreciation for patent costs will begin from the date a patent application with a complete specification is lodged. This change will apply to patent applications with a complete specification lodged on or after 1 April 2005. As a patent application is now being treated as a depreciable item, on the recommendation of the committee, any gain on the sale of a patent application will be taxable (as is currently the case with the sale of a patent).

As a transitional measure, the committee recommended that patent applications lodged before 1 April 2005 that are granted in the 2005-06 or a subsequent income year be allowed a depreciation "catch-up" (for the period the patent application was pending) in the year of grant. The changes that were originally proposed have therefore been retained for patent applications lodged before 1 April 2005.

#### Key features

Section EE 27B applies to patent applications lodged before 1 April 2005, that are granted in the 2005-06 or a subsequent income year. This section allows depreciation for the period a patent is pending to be allowed as a "catch-up" when the patent is granted (for the first income year of use). The formula for the first income year of use comprises the catch-up deduction plus the annual rate for the year. In each subsequent year, the annual rate applies. An adjustment to the formula is required where a patent is granted to a person other than the person who originally filed the patent application.

Section EE 27C applies to patent applications lodged on or after 1 April 2005 and allows depreciation from the income year of application with a complete specification. Section EE 27C applies for the period between when a patent application is lodged and when it is granted (or refused or withdrawn). The section provides an annual rate to be applied in each income year in the relevant period. To allow for these items to be depreciable intangible property, patent applications with complete specifications that are lodged on or after 1 April 2005 have been included as depreciable intangible property in Schedule 17 of the Income Tax Act 2004.

Section EE 27D applies to patent applications lodged on or after 1 April 2005, once those applications have been granted (when a patent exists). This section provides an annual rate to be applied in the income year a patent is granted, and in every subsequent year until the patent expires.

In both sections EE 27C and EE 27D, an adjustment to the respective formulas is required where the person holding the patent application (in the case of section EE 27C) and the person to whom the patent is granted (in the case of section EE 27D) are not the same as the person who originally filed the patent application.

Section CB 26 has been amended to deem any gain on the sale of a patent application (with a complete specification) to be taxable. On the recommendation of the Finance and Expenditure Committee, this change will apply only to the sale of a patent application with a complete specification where the patent application was lodged for the first time (with a provisional specification) on or after the date of enactment.

A number of consequential amendments have also been made to sections DB 31, EE 27, EE 52(4), and FF 8. In addition, a definition of "patent application date" has been included in section OB 1.

#### Application date

The changes to allow depreciation of patent costs, from the date a patent application is lodged with a complete specification, applies to patent applications with complete specifications lodged on or after 1 April 2005. The changes to allow a depreciation "catch-up" when a patent is granted will apply to patent applications with complete specifications lodged prior to 1 April 2005 that are granted in the 2005-06, or subsequent income years. The changes to tax gains on the sale of patent applications will apply to patent applications that were lodged for the first time on or after the date of enactment, 21 June 2005.

The above changes will apply to patent applications lodged with the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand or a similar office in another jurisdiction.

##### Example 1: Patent application lodged after 1 April 2005

A Co files for a patent on a new type of printing press. It lodges an application in New Zealand with a complete specification of the invention on 1 June 2005. The patent is granted on 15 February 2008. The depreciation rate for the patent application and the patent (once granted) would be calculated as follows:

| Depreciation rate for the patent application (for the period the application is pending) under section EE 27C |     |
| --- | --- |
| 2005-06 income year (1 April 2005 to 31 March 2006) = 10 months divided by 240 months = 0.04 \[June 2005 to March 2006\] |     |
| 2006-07 income year (1 April 2006 to 31 March 2007) = 12 months divided by 240 months = 0.05 |     |
| 2007-08 income year (1 April 2007 to 31 March 2008 = 10 months divided by 240 months = 0.04[**\***](#1) | \[period up to grant date - April 2007 to January 2008\] |
| Depreciation rate for the patent (for the period after the patent application is granted) under section EE 27D |     |
| 2007-08 income year (1 April 2007 to 31 March 2008) = 2 months divided by 240 months = 0.01[**\***](#2) | \[period from date of grant - February 2008 to March 2008\] |
| 2008-09 income year (1 April 2008 to 31 March 2009) and subsequent years = 12 months divided by 240 months = 0.05 |     |
| **\*** the total depreciation rate for the 2007-08 income year would be 0.05 (0.04 + 0.01) |     |

##### Example 2: Patent application lodged prior to 1 April 2005

Z Co filed for a patent with a complete specification on a new type of cutting device on 15 January 2003. The patent is granted on 9 June 2006. The depreciation rate for this patent would be calculated as follows, under section EE 27B:

| First income year of use (2006-07) |     |
| --- | --- |
| Depreciation "catch-up": 41 months divided by 240 months = 0.17 | \[January 2003 to May 2006\] |
| Annual rate for the year: 10 months divided by 240 months = 0.04 | \[June 2006 to March 2007\] |
| Subsequent income years (2007-08 +) |     |
| Annual rate for the year: 12 months divided by 240 months = 0.05 |     |

### Plant variety rights

**Sections CC 9(2)(a), EE 27, EE 27E, EE 52(4), OB 1 and Schedule 17 of the Income Tax Act 2004**

Plant variety rights granted and rights to use plant variety rights acquired in the 2005-06 or a subsequent income year have been made depreciable intangible property.

#### Background

A grant of plant variety rights gives the holder the exclusive right to produce for sale and to sell propagated material of the plant variety for a period of 20 or 23 years, depending on the plant material (under New Zealand legislation). Legal life begins from the date of grant.

Under the previous rules, plant variety rights and the right to use plant variety rights were not depreciable intangible property. Plant variety rights have now been listed in Schedule 17 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and will be fixed-life intangible property with depreciation over the property's legal life. The right to use plant variety rights has also been included on Schedule 17.

On the recommendation of the Finance and Expenditure Committee, a number of improvements were made to the provisions as originally introduced. They include:

*   allowing a "catch-up" of depreciation for the period an application of plant variety rights is pending (the provisional protection phase) in the income year of grant; and
*   clarifying that intellectual property protection granted in foreign jurisdictions that effectively provides protection over plant varieties (but are not explicitly called plant variety rights) falls within the scope of the change.

The legislation also clarifies that royalties from the use of plant variety rights and rights to use plant variety rights are taxable.

#### Key features

Schedule 17 of the Income Tax Act 2004 has been amended by inserting plant variety rights (or similar protection offshore) and the right to use plant variety rights as paragraphs 11 and 12. A definition of "plant variety rights" has also been included in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004.

New section EE 27E of the Income Tax Act 2004 allows a depreciation "catch-up" for plant variety rights that have been given provisional protection that are granted in the 2005-06 or a subsequent income year. The "catch-up" relates to the period the plant variety right has been given provisional protection. Consequential amendments have been made to sections EE 27 and EE 52(4).

The "royalty" definition in section CC 9(2)(a) has been amended to include a reference to "plant variety rights".

#### Application date

The changes to allow depreciation in respect of plant variety rights and the right to use plant variety rights will apply to plant variety rights granted, and rights to use plant variety rights acquired, in the 2005-06 and subsequent income years.

##### Example

Fruit Co files for a plant variety on a new type of apple on 1 April 2006. The plant variety right is granted on 1 January 2008. The plant variety right has a legal life of 20 years (240 months) beginning from the date of grant. During the consideration of the application the new variety of apple has provisional protection.

_First income year of use (2007-08)_  
Depreciation "catch-up": 21 months / (240 months + 21 months) = 0.08

Annual rate for the year: 3 months / (240 months + 21 months) = 0.01

_Subsequent income years (2008-09 +)_  
Annual rate for the year: 12 months / (240 months + 21 months) = 0.05

### Losses on buildings

**Sections EE 32(1) and EE 41(2) of the Income Tax Act 2004**

A deduction is to be allowed for losses on buildings when a building is irreparably damaged and rendered useless for the purposes of deriving income and, the damage is not caused by the owner or a related party (or their failure to act). This new provision applies if the building is irreparably damaged in the 2005-06 or a subsequent income year.

#### Background

No deductions were previously allowed for losses on buildings (except when the building was a temporary building or when a building was destroyed as the result of a "qualifying event" - for example, the central New Zealand floods of early 2004).

The policy intent of this change is for a loss to be allowed when an unexpected event results in a taxpayer's building being irreparably damaged and rendered useless, when the damage is not caused by the actions of the person or failure to act (or the actions or inaction of the taxpayer's agents). The unexpected event could be a natural disaster such as an earthquake, or an event like a fire. It does not include changes to regulation (for example, health and safety) that make a building obsolete and require it to be knocked down. The event must have caused damage to the building. What is meant by "irreparably damaged" and "rendered useless" is that the building has no continuing economic value for the taxpayer. When a building is irreparably damaged and rendered useless, a deduction arises irrespective of whether the building is still standing and needs to be disposed of by the taxpayer or whether the taxpayer chooses not to dispose of the building.

#### Key features

Sections EE 32(1) and EE 41(2) of the Income Tax Act 2004 have been amended to allow a deduction for losses on buildings when a building is irreparably damaged and rendered useless for the purpose of deriving income and the damage occurs in the 2005-06 or a subsequent income year.

#### Application date

The changes apply to buildings that are irreparably damaged in the 2005-06 or a subsequent income year.

#### Examples

##### Example 1: Floods

Joe owns a warehouse that is used in his import/export business. On 1 July 2006 extreme climatic conditions cause flash flooding which results in significant damage to the warehouse. An independent assessor concludes that Joe's warehouse cannot be salvaged. In this circumstance, Joe would be able to claim a deduction for the remaining book value of the building (the loss) under section EE 41.

##### Example 2: Fire

Anne owns a rental property. On 7 October 2005, a fire which started on neighbouring premises spreads to her property, resulting in significant damage. The insurance company finds that Anne's premises cannot be salvaged. In this circumstance, she would be able to claim a deduction for the remaining book value of the building (the loss) under section EE 41. \[Note: any insurance proceeds would be deemed consideration.\]

##### Example 3: Fire (negligence on part of building owner)

Martin owns a workshop that is used to manufacture wooden furniture. Fire safety regulations require that the workshop be fitted with fire safety devices such as sprinklers, smoke alarms and fire extinguishers. A safety check of the premises on 30 November 2005 reveals that the sprinklers are not in working order. On 5 December 2005 a fire that is started by an electrical fault causes significant damage to the workshop. The insurance assessor concludes that the damage would not have been irreparable if the sprinklers were in working order. In this situation, Martin would not be able to claim a deduction for the loss as he has not taken reasonable care in ensuring the workshop is safe. The likelihood of the workshop being irreparably damaged is not unexpected as his inaction in not getting the sprinklers in working order had contributed to the result.

##### Example 4: Failure to maintain a building

John owns a building that for a long time has housed high-end apartments that have been let on short-term leases. However, owing to a combination of changing tastes for high-rise living and changes to the surrounding neighbourhood, John has recently struggled to let a majority of the apartments. The land on which the building is situated is, however, relatively valuable and John sees other opportunities for use of the land. However, he recognises that voluntary demolition of the building would result in the remaining tax-book value being lost (as no deduction is allowed generally on disposal of a building). Instead, he chooses to let the building fall into a state of disrepair. The City orders that the building be demolished for health and safety reasons. In this scenario, John would not be able to claim a deduction for the loss on demolition of the building because his inaction has contributed to his building requiring to be demolished for health and safety reasons.

### Special depreciation rates

_**Sections EE 12 and EE 28 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and sections 91AAG(2), 91AAG(3), 91AAG(5B) and 91AAM(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994**_

Changes to the special tax depreciation rules:

*   extend the rules to apply to fixed-life intangible property (such as patents);
*   clarify that the Commissioner may have regard to a range of factors in determining the estimated useful life of an asset;
*   allow the Commissioner to prescribe a special tax depreciation rate using a straight-line formula in addition to the diminishing value formula;
*   allow the Commissioner to prescribe a single special tax depreciation rate for items of the same kind that are subject to the same circumstances that underlie a special tax depreciation rate; and
*   allow the Commissioner to prescribe a special or provisional tax depreciation rate outside the six-month time limit if the taxpayer involved agrees to this.

#### Background

Under the special tax depreciation rules, taxpayers can apply for depreciation rates that are higher (or lower) than those prescribed by Inland Revenue if they consider the prescribed general depreciation rate is substantially different from the rate that should apply. This may arise, for example, if depreciable property is being used in a way that is different from that considered by Inland Revenue when determining a general economic depreciation rate for the property.

The changes allow the Commissioner greater flexibility in considering special tax depreciation rate applications if he is reasonably satisfied that, in the circumstances, a more accurate estimate of economic life, to the estimate of economic life used to prescribe the general tax depreciation rate (estimated useful life), is applicable.

One of the main changes is to extend the availability of special tax depreciation rates to what is currently fixed-life intangible property (that is, depreciable intangible property which must currently be depreciated over its legal life, such as patents). Taxpayers are now able to approach the Commissioner for a special tax depreciation rate for these assets.

Another change allows the Commissioner to consider a broad range of factors when determining what an accurate estimate of economic life should be. This change in particular is designed to make it easier for the Commissioner to consider the impact of events outside a taxpayer's control which may curtail an asset's useful life (and result in the asset not being able to be salvaged or used). Examples include when the regulatory environment changes so an asset can no longer be used lawfully (for example, environmental legislation which outlaws the use of a particular type of machine) or when the raw materials that are used as an input into the asset are expected to run out. Another example is when the rate of technological obsolescence for an asset is significantly higher than was originally envisaged.

It is worth noting that the Commissioner's general view (_TIB_ Vol 10, No 1 January 1998) is that the "whole of life" approach for determining the estimated useful lives of assets is the appropriate benchmark for setting tax depreciation rates. This view was supported by the Finance and Expenditure Committee and will continue to be the case under the changes to the special tax depreciation rates.

Other changes ensure that the Commissioner can prescribe a special tax depreciation rate using the straight-line method from the outset if a taxpayer requests this. Under the previous rules, the Commissioner was required to issue a special tax depreciation rate using the diminishing value formula (with a straight-line equivalent then having to be calculated).

On the recommendation of the Finance and Expenditure Committee, the legislation has been amended to allow the Commissioner to prescribe a single special tax depreciation rate for a group of identical assets that are all subject to the same special circumstances. For example, a set of five printing presses that because of special circumstances are all expected to last less than their prescribed economic life. Previously, taxpayers had to lodge a separate application for each press, even though the rate allowed would be the same for each item. Now the taxpayer needs to only lodge a single application for the group of assets.

Finally, changes have been made to allow the Commissioner to prescribe a special or provisional tax depreciation rate outside the six-month time limit for issuing such rates, if the taxpayer agrees to this. This change recognises that certain special and provisional tax depreciation rate applications are complex and may require a period longer than six months to be resolved (for example, if they require the input of expert valuers). One of the concerns raised in submissions to the Finance and Expenditure Committee with this change was the status of tax assessments where a special or provisional rate has been applied for and the taxpayer agrees to an extension of time, but such an extension results in a tax assessment being made before the issue of a rate. In these circumstances, taxpayers should use the relevant Commissioner-prescribed rate for the purposes of the assessment. Then, if the application for a special or provisional deprecation rate is granted, and it covers the income year at issue, taxpayers can make a request to the Commissioner under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for an amendment to that assessment.

#### Key features

Section EE 28 of the Income Tax Act 2004 has been amended to extend the special tax depreciation rules to apply to fixed-life intangible property such as patents. Section EE 12(1) has been amended as a result.

Section 91AAG(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended to clarify that the Commissioner may have regard to a range of factors in determining the estimated useful life of an asset.

Section 91AAG(3) has been amended to allow the Commissioner to prescribe a special tax depreciation rate using a straight-line formula in addition to the diminishing value formula.

On the recommendation of the Finance and Expenditure Committee, section 91AAG(5B) has been added to allow the Commissioner to prescribe a single special tax depreciation rate for items of the same kind that are subject to the same circumstances that underlie a special tax depreciation rate.

Section 91AAM(2) has been amended to allow the Commissioner to prescribe a special or provisional tax depreciation rate outside the six-month time limit if the taxpayer agrees to this.

#### Application date

The amendments will apply to applications for special tax depreciation rates that are made in the 2005-06 and subsequent income years. The amendment to the six-month time limit also applies to provisional tax depreciation rate applications made in the 2005-06 and subsequent income years.

### Costs associated with failed or withdrawn resource consents

On the recommendation of the Finance and Expenditure Committee, section DB 13B of the Income Tax Act 2004 has been amended to treat the costs incurred on a failed or withdrawn resource consent application as deductible if those costs would have formed part of the cost of depreciable property, or would otherwise have been allowed as a deduction, if a resource consent had been granted. Section DJ 14B in the Income Tax Act 1994 has also been amended accordingly.

Changes to the tax treatment of petroleum mining
================================================

2009 amendments covering deductions for expenditure on petroleum mining, an update to the mining rules, and a change to the mining anti-avoidance provision.

_**Sections DT 1A, DT 2, DT 5, DT 9, EJ 12, EJ 12B, EJ 13, EJ 13B, EJ 13C, EJ 19, EJ 20 of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections DT 1A, DT 2, DT 5, DT 9, EJ 11, EJ 11B, EJ 12, EJ 12B, EJ 12C, EJ 13, EJ 17 and EJ 18 of the Income Tax Act 2004**_

There have been a number of changes made to the petroleum mining tax rules. Deductions for expenditure on petroleum mining undertaken through a branch in another country will only be allowed to be allocated against income from petroleum mining operations outside of New Zealand. The petroleum mining rules have also been updated to address a number of issues that apply to investment in oil and gas exploration and development in New Zealand. Lastly, a remedial amendment ensures that a petroleum mining anti-avoidance provision does not apply more broadly than intended.

### Background

In November 2007, tax policy officials consulted on possible changes to the tax treatment of expenditure incurred on petroleum mining. The suggested changes were designed to remove the uncertainty and disincentives that currently exist with the current rules.

On 4 March 2008, the government announced that it would amend legislation to prevent New Zealand missing out on significant tax revenue from the petroleum mining industry. Tax legislation would be changed to ensure that expenditure on petroleum mining operations undertaken through a foreign branch cannot be offset against petroleum mining income from New Zealand.

### Application dates

The application dates for the three sets of amendments to the petroleum mining rules are:

*   Petroleum mining expenditure incurred through a branch in another country applies to expenditure incurred on or after 4 March 2008.
*   The changes updating the petroleum mining rules apply to expenditure incurred on or after 1 April 2008.
*   The remedial amendment to the petroleum mining anti-avoidance provision applies from 1 December 2007.

### Key features

*   Expenditure incurred on petroleum mining operations undertaken through a branch in another country cannot be deducted from income earned in New Zealand.
*   Changes to the petroleum mining tax rules remove disincentives that may affect investment in oil and gas exploration and development in New Zealand.
*   A change to the legislation ensures that the petroleum mining anti-avoidance rule does not apply more broadly than intended.

### Detailed analysis

##### _Expenditure on petroleum mining operations undertaken by a branch in another country_

Section DT 1A of the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Income Tax 2004 provides that expenditure incurred on petroleum mining operations undertaken through a branch in another country cannot be deducted from income earned in New Zealand.

Petroleum mining expenditure not allocated in a current year is carried forward and is available for allocation in future income years. The amount that can be allocated in future years is capped to the amount of income that a petroleum miner earns from petroleum mining operations outside of New Zealand.

For example, if a petroleum miner incurs exploration expenditure through its branch operation in India, section DT 1A means that this expenditure cannot be offset against income from any petroleum mining in New Zealand. However, if the petroleum miner has income from the sale of oil or gas condensate from operations in Switzerland it will be able to offset this income against the exploration expenditure incurred in India.

##### _Addressing existing impediments_

A number of changes have been made to the petroleum mining tax rules to remove disincentives that may affect investment in oil and gas exploration and development in New Zealand.

##### _Removing the onshore/offshore boundary_

Section EJ 19 has been amended to remove the distinction between onshore and offshore petroleum mining development. Section EJ 12 has been changed so that a petroleum miner can start amortising development expenditure in the year that the expenditure is incurred, rather than having to work out whether the expenditure relates to an onshore or offshore development. Development expenditure incurred on or after 1 April 2008 can begin to be amortised during the income year in which it is incurred.

##### _Reserve depletion method_

New section DT 5 provides two methods for allocating deductions to an income year. A petroleum miner can elect to amortise development expenditure under either the current straight-line method (the default allocation rule) or the reserve depletion method. Section EJ 12 contains the default allocation rule. Section EJ 12B is the new reserve depletion method. This section allows petroleum development costs to be amortised in a manner that better reflects the allocation of development costs over the life of the field. The election to amortise development expenditure under the reserve depletion method must be made in the year that commercial production first begins. Once the election has been made, it applies to future development expenditure incurred in that permit area. The reserve depletion method is available for development expenditure incurred on or after 1 April 2008. Development expenditure incurred before this date must be amortised under the seven-year straight-line method.

Changes to probable reserves are counted in the year directly following the year that the estimate occurs. The following example illustrates the process:

**Example**

In December 2007, Slick Oil Ltd incurs $35 million on petroleum expenditure on an offshore development in New Zealand. Slick Oil incurs similar amounts of development expenditure in June 2008 and in December 2008. Commercial production begins in January 2009.

The first $35 million of development expenditure (incurred in December 2007) is amortised over seven years on a straight-line basis. A deduction of $5 million is allocated to each year until the expenditure is completely amortised at the end of 2014.

The remaining $70 million is allocated on a straight-line basis until commercial production begins in January 2009. Slick Oil then elects to allocate the remaining development expenditure under the reserve depletion method. As at January 2009, the balance of unamortised development expenditure incurred on or after 1 April 2008 is $67.5 million.

Applying section EJ 12B, the balance of reserve expenditure is $67.5 million. With probable reserves estimated at 100 million barrels and first-year production totalling 40 million barrels, a $27 million deduction for development expenditure is allocated to the 2009 income year.

At the end of 2009, the amount of probable reserves is revised down by 20 million barrels to 40 million barrels. The balance of reserve expenditure less previous expenditure is $40.5 million. Total production during 2010 is 20 million barrels. The deduction for development expenditure for 2010 is therefore $20.250 million.

##### _Deduction for expenditure on a dry well_

Section EJ 13B allows a deduction for the cost of a dry production well, if the cost of the well is incurred on or after 1 April 2008. A dry production well is a well that will never produce petroleum in commercial quantities, as opposed to a well that ceases to produce petroleum in commercial quantities. A deduction for the balance of the unamortised cost of the well is allowed in the year that drilling stops and the well is abandoned.

##### _Well ceasing to produce petroleum in commercial quantities_

Section EJ 13C provides a deduction for expenditure on a well if the well ceases producing petroleum in commercial quantities and is abandoned, and the petroleum miner is amortising development expenditure on the reserve depletion basis. Subject to these requirements, a deduction for the unamortised balance of the expenditure on the well is allowed in the income year that the well is abandoned. This rule applies to expenditure incurred on or after 1 April 2008.

##### _Remedial amendment to petroleum mining anti-avoidance provision_

Section DT 2 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007 has been amended to ensure that the petroleum mining anti-avoidance rule does not apply more broadly than intended. The purpose of section DT 2 is to prevent double deductions for the same amount of expenditure. However, in some cases it could give the inappropriate result of reducing a taxpayer’s deductions from a single deduction to no deduction at all. As amended, section DT 2 prevents this result by excluding from the provision transactions involving the disposal of foreign petroleum mining assets. The amendment applies from 1 December 2007.

Changes to the taxation of leases
=================================

2007 changes mean lease arrangements involving overseas assets will be classified as finance leases or lessors will have allowable depreciation deductions reduced.

**_Sections EE 28(4), EE 46(2), EE 52(7), EX 21(30), FC8H, FC 8I and OB 1 (definitions of "finance lease" and "lease") of the Income Tax Act 2004; sections CH 6, DB 51B, EE 35(4), EE 55(2), EE 61(8), FA 11, FA 11B and YA 1 (definition of "finance lease") of the Income Tax Act 2007_**

Changes to the taxation of leases mean that certain lease arrangements involving assets used overseas will be classified as finance leases, or that lessors will have allowable depreciation deductions for lease assets reduced.

#### Background

The changes are necessary to prevent depreciation losses being claimed on overseas assets in which the New Zealand taxpayer has no real economic interest. Such schemes undermine the New Zealand tax base.

#### Key features

The definition of "finance lease" has been widened to include certain lease arrangements that satisfy three conditions:

*   they involve use of the lease asset wholly or mainly overseas; and
*   they involve income of a person other than the lessor that is not subject to New Zealand income tax; and
*   substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the lease asset lie with a person other than the lessor.

Leases entered into on or after 20 June 2007 that are covered by the changes to the definition of "finance lease", either at inception or at a specified later time will be classified as finance leases for tax purposes. If the lease was an operating lease at inception, the change to a finance lease will require an adjustment to assessable income or deductions (almost certainly income rather than deductions) in the year of change.

Operating leases entered into before 20 June 2007 but covered by the new part of the definition of "finance lease" on that date may continue as operating leases. However, allowable depreciation deductions will be reduced by one-sixth, with one-sixth of any previously claimed depreciation recognised as additional assessable income in the income year beginning after 20 June 2007.

#### Application date

The new rules apply to all leases entered into on or after 20 May 1999 (being the date the finance lease rules became effective), and for the income year including 20 June 2007 and later income years.

#### Detailed analysis

**Expanded definition of "finance lease" (section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007)**

A new paragraph (c) has been added to the definition of "finance lease" and contains three tests. The new paragraph applies to leases that were entered into on or after 20 May 1999, for income years including 20 June 2007 and later income years.

The remainder of the definition is unaffected by the change and continues to apply as normal.

**The paragraph (c) tests**

The three tests in paragraph (c) are:

*   an "overseas use" test (subparagraph (i));
*   an "income not subject to tax" test (subparagraph (ii)); and
*   an "economic substance" test (subparagraph (iii)).

**Overseas use test (subparagraph (i))**

The lease, or an arrangement of which the lease is a part, must involve use of the lease asset outside New Zealand for all or most of the term of the lease.

##### Example 1: Overseas use not for most of the term

Air Wellington has an aeroplane which is surplus to requirements and leases it to Air Napier for five years. Air Napier uses the aircraft between Napier and Auckland for the first three years of the lease. In year 4 of the lease, the terms of the lease change in such a way that the definition of "finance lease" must be checked again (see **Application of the tests** below).[**21**](#21)
 At this time, Air Napier is using the aircraft between Sydney and Melbourne, under a contract with an Australian airline. It expects it will continue to be used abroad until the end of the lease. The lease asset should not be regarded as used wholly or mainly outside New Zealand, because for 60 percent of the lease it was used inside New Zealand.

##### Example 2: Overseas use for most of the term

The facts are as in Example 1, except that Air Napier uses the aircraft between Napier and Auckland only for the first two years of the lease. For the rest of the lease, it is expected to be used overseas. The lease asset should be regarded as used mainly outside New Zealand.

**Income not subject to tax test (subparagraph (ii))**

The lease, or an arrangement that includes the lease, must involve a person other than the lessor who derives certain classes of income from the use - by any person - of the asset. The income must be excluded income, exempt income or non-residents' foreign-sourced income. The test may be satisfied by a sub-leasing arrangement, if any of the lessees in the chain of lessees derive these types of income.

The definition is not expected to be satisfied in relation to the lease when there are two parties to the lease and both are fully subject to New Zealand income tax.

##### Example 3: One party not subject to New Zealand income tax

NZ Co leases equipment to Aus Co, which derives income from use of the equipment in Australia. The income is non-residents' foreign-sourced income. The test in subparagraph (ii) is satisfied and the lease may be a finance lease if the other tests are also satisfied.

##### Example 4: Both parties subject to New Zealand income tax

Boat Co leases fishing vessels to Catch Co, which uses them for trawling. Catch Co is subject to New Zealand income tax on all its income, so the test in subparagraph (ii) is not satisfied and the lease is not a finance lease under paragraph (c) of the definition of finance lease (even if the boats are used mainly outside New Zealand).

**Economic substance test (subparagraph (iii))**

The lease, or an arrangement that includes the lease, must be:

*   an arrangement under which substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership, as if assessed at the beginning of the lease but taking account of all changes in terms which have actually occurred [**22**](#22)
    are borne by persons other than the lessor; and/or
*   a finance lease under NZ IAS 17, either for the taxpayer or for another company in the same group of companies that derives assessable income from the arrangement.

The two limbs of the economic substance test are similar. The test based on NZ IAS 17 is intended to reduce compliance costs. If a taxpayer (or group company that derives assessable income from the arrangement) is accounting for the lease as a finance lease under NZ IAS 17, there is no need to apply the other limb of the test; the lease is automatically a finance lease. It is expected that most taxpayers engaging in the leasing of assets overseas would be required to comply with NZ IAS 17.

When the lease is not treated as a finance lease under NZIAS 17, the other limb of the test must be evaluated. The assessment of risks and rewards under that limb is done as if at the time of entering the lease, but taking account of all changes in terms that are known about when the evaluation takes place.

As in NZ IAS 17, it is intended that risks include (but not be limited to) "the possibilities of losses from idle capacity or technological obsolescence and of variations in return because of changing economic conditions" and that rewards include (but not be limited to) "the expectation of profitable operation over the asset's economic life and of gain from appreciation in value or realisation of a residual value" (see paragraph 7 of that standard). Paragraphs 10 to 12 of that standard provide some further guidance.

##### Example 5: Economic substance test not satisfied

XYZ Bank leases rolling stock to an Australian company for seven years. Lease payments are fixed and the lease cannot be cancelled. There is no guaranteed minimum residual value in the lease. Assume, for the sake of the example, that the lease is an operating lease for tax purposes. After six years, XYZ Bank notes that the market price for the asset is considerably higher than the residual value it is expecting, and so buys residual value insurance to lock in the likely profits on sale of the asset following the end of the lease. The lease would probably not be a finance lease at this point. Imagining oneself at the beginning of the lease, but knowing that XYZ will buy residual value insurance in year 6, substantial risk still remains with XYZ (the residual value could change unpredictably up to year 6).

##### Example 6: Economic substance test satisfied

The facts are as in Example 5, but with the insurance purchased after only three months of the lease term. This is likely to be a finance lease because, when viewed from the outset, XYZ has only insubstantial risk (three months of market price movement out of a seven-year lease).

##### Example 7: Economic substance test not satisfied

ABC Bank leases a ship to a Norwegian company for 11 years. The lease is a non-cancellable operating lease with fixed payments, but no guaranteed minimum residual value. Assume, for the sake of the example, that the lease is an operating lease. After 10 years, ABC signs a contract to sell the ship to an unrelated third party for the current market value of the ship, with settlement deferred until after the end of the lease, thereby removing any risk due to market-value fluctuations over the last year of the lease. ABC also changes the terms of the lease to require the Norwegian company to prevent the ship's railings from rusting, and this change of terms requires the new paragraph of the finance lease definition to be checked (see **Application of the tests** below). The lease would probably not be a finance lease, even though there is (essentially) no risk remaining for ABC at the point of checking. Viewed from the outset, and knowing about the change in terms in year 10, ABC still has significant risk over the lease term as a whole.

A "group of companies" is defined in section IG 1(2) of the Income Tax Act 2004 (section IC 3(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007) essentially as "any group of companies having a 66 percent or greater common shareholding". When another company in the same group classifies the lease as a finance lease under NZ IAS 17, the economic substance test is taken to be satisfied, even if the taxpayer does not classify the lease as a finance lease under NZ IAS 17. This might occur, for example, when a company enters into the lease and a parent company contemporaneously enters into a transaction with the lessee to make a residual value payment (it is likely that in such cases the other limb of the economic substance test will be satisfied anyway).

Group companies that do not derive assessable income from the lease (or an arrangement of which the lease is a part) are excluded from the test. However, existing transfer pricing rules in the Income Tax Act may apply when these companies are involved in the lease arrangement, if there are non-arm's length terms. (The role of these companies may also be considered as part of a wider review of leasing rules, which was signalled in the announcement of the government's tax policy work programme on 26 October 2007.)

**Application of the tests**

The three tests in paragraph (c) are applied:

*   If the lease is entered into on or after 20 June 2007, when the lease is entered into and again whenever the terms of the lease (or of an arrangement of which the lease is a part) change in a way which changes the allocation or size of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the lease asset.
*   If the lease is an operating lease entered into before 20 June 2007, on 20 June 2007 (in this case the three tests are invoked by section FC 8I(1) in the Income Tax Act 2004 or section FA 11B(1) in the Income Tax Act 2007, and the text before subparagraph (i) in the definition is ignored)

##### Example 8: Applying the three tests - lease entered after 20 June 2007

A Co leases equipment to B Co. The lease was entered into on 1 August 2007. A Co must check if the lease meets the new paragraph (c) of the definition of "finance lease" on 1 August 2007. Assume it does not. A change in the terms of the lease, which requires B Co to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease for a fixed price, is made on 1 April 2008. A Co must again check if the lease meets the three tests.

##### Example 9: Applying the three tests - lease entered into before 20 June 2007

The facts are as in Example 8, except that the lease was entered into on 1 April 2006 and was an operating lease at that time. Once the new legislation applies, A Co must check if the lease met the tests in the new paragraph (c) of the definition of "finance lease" on 20 June 2007.

**Leases entered into on or after 20 June 2007 (section FC 8H of the Income Tax Act 2004 and sections CH 6, DB 51B and FA 11 of the Income Tax Act 2007)**

Most leases entered into on or after 20 June 2007:

*   will be classified as finance leases from the outset if the three tests in paragraph (c) of the definition of "finance lease" are satisfied at the outset; or
*   will have to be reclassified as finance leases from a date the three tests are satisfied, if they are not satisfied at the outset.

In the case of reclassification, there will be a consequential adjustment to income or deductions (almost certainly income rather than deductions).

##### Example 10: Finance lease at the outset of the lease - lease entered into after 20 June 2007

NZ Co leases equipment with an estimated useful life of 10 years to Aus Co for 7 years, to be used entirely in Australia. Aus Co is not subject to New Zealand income tax. Aus Co is responsible for all costs associated with the operation, maintenance and insurance of the equipment, and guarantees to pay $1 million to NZ Co at the conclusion of the lease, at which time NZ Co will regain possession.

At inception, the lease meets all three tests of the new paragraph (c) of the definition of "finance lease". The lease is a finance lease.

##### Example 11: Finance lease after the outset of the lease - lease entered into after 20 June 2007

NZ Co leases equipment to Aus Co, which is not subject to New Zealand income tax, to be used entirely in Australia. The lease is an operating lease because NZ Co bears (substantial) residual value risk in relation to the lease asset, because NZ Co will regain possession of the asset at the end of the lease, and because the lease period is less than 75 percent of the asset's estimated useful life. After six months, NZ Co and Aus Co change the terms of the lease so that Aus Co guarantees to purchase the equipment for $1 million at the conclusion of the lease, being the expected residual value when the lease was entered into.

The lease becomes a finance lease because of the change of terms. If the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset were assessed on entry to the lease, taking into account the guaranteed residual value to be paid by Aus Co, it would be concluded that Aus Co faced substantially all the risks and rewards.

The consequential adjustment to income or deductions, in the case of reclassification, is determined according to section FC 8H of the Income Tax Act 2004 (formerly section FC 8H/8I) or section FA 11 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The adjustment is assessable income or a deduction in the income year in which the reclassification occurs. In the Income Tax Act 2007, sections CH 6 and DB 51B deem the income or deduction to exist, consistent with the structure of the new Act.

##### Example 12: Consequential adjustment to income - lease entered into after 20 June 2007

The facts are as in Example 11. Suppose that net income for the first six months under the operating lease was $500,000, and $750,000 for the second six months under the finance lease, and that the total of $1,250,000 was included in the return of income for the relevant year. Under a finance lease, net income for the whole of that year would have been $1,500,000. Under sections FC 8H of the Income Tax Act 2004 or FA 11 of the Income Tax Act 2007, NZ Co must include further income of $250,000 in its return of income. In total, NZ Co recognises $1,500,000 of net income in the return.

Section FC 8H of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section FA 11 of the Income Tax Act 2007 are intended to have the same practical consequences for leases not affected by paragraph (c) of the definition of "finance lease" as sections FC 8H/8I and FA 11 (respectively) had before the rule change.

##### Example 13: Consequential adjustment to income where new part of definition does not apply

A car, used entirely within New Zealand, is leased by A Co to B Co under an operating lease for two years. At the end of the two-year period, the lease term is extended to eight years. The net income of A Co under the operating lease in the first two years is calculated as $10,000. The net income under a finance lease would have been $15,000

Paragraph (c) of the definition does not apply - the asset is not used outside New Zealand. Section FC 8H of the Income Tax Act 2004 (or section FA 11 of the Income Tax 2007) still applies, however, because of paragraph (b) of the definition of finance lease and the extended term of the lease (section FC 8H(1)(a) or FA 11(1)(a) respectively). Net income of $5,000 will be recognised by A Co in the year of the change, as would have occurred in the absence of the new legislation.

A lease which becomes a finance lease remains a finance lease until the end of the lease term (which may include the term of consecutive or successive leases).

**Leases entered into before 20 June 2007 (sections EE 28(4), EE 46(2), EE 52(7) and FC8I of the Income Tax Act 2004, and sectionsEE35(4), EE 55(2), EE 61(8) and FC 11B of the Income Tax Act 2007)**

For most operating leases entered into before June 2007:

*   the leases will continue to be operating leases (unless they become finance leases at a later date other than under paragraph (c) of the definition of "finance lease");
*   the New Zealand lessor will have to reduce the depreciation deductions that would normally be allowed for the lease asset by one-sixth; and
*   the New Zealand lessor will have to recognise, as income, one-sixth of depreciation deductions already allowed for the lease asset over the lease term.

If the three tests in paragraph (c) of the definition of "finance lease" are satisfied by the lease on 20 June 2007 (ignoring the requirements that the lease be entered into on or after 20 June and that the lease is being entered into or the terms of the lease are changing) then the lessor must make an adjustment to income and to future depreciation deductions.

##### Example 14: Tests satisfied on 20 June 2007- lease entered into before 20 June 2007

NZ Co leases equipment to Aus Co under a lease which did not meet the definition of "finance lease" before new paragraph (c) was added. The lease was entered into on 1 April 2000, and the terms of the lease have not changed since. On 20 June 2007, the lease satisfied the three tests in paragraph (c) of the definition - the asset was used wholly overseas by a company which was not subject to New Zealand income tax, and Aus Co had substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the lease asset.

NZ Co must make the adjustments in sections FC 8I(3) and (7) of the Income Tax Act 2004 or sections FA 11B(3) and (6) of the Income Tax 2007, and reduce depreciation in subsequent income years according to section FC 8I(8) of the Income Tax Act 2004 or section FA 11B(7) of the Income Tax Act 2007.

**No effect on some leases (section FC 8I(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section FA 11B(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007)**

Section FC 8I of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section FA 11B of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply only to leases entered into on or after 20 May 1999. It has no effect on leases entered into before 20 May 1999.

The new rules will also have no effect on leases that are entered into before 20 June 2007 that either end before the beginning of the income year following 20 June 2007, or become finance leases before the end of the income year following 20 June 2007. In the former case, the existing depreciation rules will ensure that any excess depreciation is recovered (provided there is disposal of the asset). In the latter case, section FC 8H of the Income Tax Act 2004 or section FC 11 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will apply.

**Adjustment relating to past deductions**

In the income year following 20 June 2007, the lessor must recognise an adjustment to income equal to one-sixth of depreciation deductions previously allowed for the lease asset. Deductions allowed for depreciation losses for periods before the start of the lease are not included. The adjusted tax value (ATV) of the lease asset, at the beginning of the income year following 20 June 2007, is increased by the amount of the adjustment to income.

##### Example 15: Consequential adjustment to income - lease entered into before 20 June 2007

The facts are as in Example 14. NZ Co was allowed deductions for depreciation losses in relation to the leased equipment of $29,127,974 over the period 1April 2000 to 31 March 2008 (the end of the income year including 20 June 2007). The adjusted tax value of the equipment is $5,872,026 after subtracting all depreciation allowed up to 31 March 2008.

NZ Co recognises additional income in the 2008-09 income year of $29,127,974 ÷ 6 = $4,854,662. The adjusted tax value of the equipment on 1 April 2008 is $5,872,026 + $4,854,662 = $10,726,688

**Subsequent depreciation deductions reduced**

In income years following 20 June 2007, and while the lease remains an operating lease, the depreciation losses which would otherwise be allowed are reduced by one-sixth. The losses which would otherwise be allowed are taken to be the deductions which would have been allowed in the absence of section FC 8I of the Income Tax Act 2004 (section FA 11B of the Income Tax Act 2007), except that the adjusted tax value calculated under that section should apply.

##### Example 16: Reduction of depreciation deductions - lease entered into before 20 June 2007

The facts are as in Examples 14 and 15. The economic rate used by NZ Co for the equipment would be 20 percent (DV) in the absence of section FC 8I (or FA 11B). In the 2008-09 year, using the ATV determined under section FC 8I (or FA 11B) but otherwise ignoring section FC 8I (or FA 11B), NZ Co would be allowed a depreciation deduction of $10,726,688 x 20% = $2,145,338. This is reduced by one-sixth under section FC 8I (or FA 11B), so that a deduction of $1,787,782 is actually allowed. The ATV is then adjusted down in the normal way to $10,726,688 - $1,787,782 = $8,938,906. In the 2009-10 year, the deduction allowed is $8,938,906 x 20% x 5 divided by 6 = $1,489,818 and the ATV is adjusted down to $7,449,088.

There are consequential amendments to sections EE 28(4), EE 46(2) and EE 52(7) of the Income Tax Act 2004, and to sections EE 35(4), EE 55(2) and EE 61(8) of the Income Tax Act 2007. These are effectively prompts to readers of the depreciation rules that the lease provisions may affect the allowable deduction.

Depreciation recovery income under section EE 41(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004 or section EE 48(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007, and deductions allowed for loss on sale under section EE 41(2) of the Income Tax Act 2004 or section EE 48(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007, are not reduced by one-sixth by the new rules.

##### Example 17: Depreciation recovery income or loss on sale - lease entered into before 20 June 2007

The facts are as in Examples 14, 15 and 16. If the equipment is sold in the 2010-11 year, for $10,000,000, NZ Co will have depreciation recovery income under section EE 41(1) of $10,000,000 - $7,449,088 = $2,550,912. If, instead, the sale price is $5,000,000, the taxpayer will be allowed a deduction for depreciation losses under section EE 41(2) of $2,449,088.

When section FC 8I of the Income Tax Act 2004 or section FA 11B of the Income Tax Act 2007 applies to a lease, it will continue to apply until the end of the lease term unless the lease becomes a finance lease. Such a lease may become a finance lease, for example, because an extension of the lease term means paragraph (b) of the definition of "finance lease" is satisfied. In this case, section FC 8H of the Income Tax Act 2004 or section FA 11 of the Income Tax Act 2007 would apply.

**Other consequential amendments**

In the Income Tax Act 2004, there is a consequential amendment to the definition of "lease", because the former sections FC 8H and FC 8I have now been consolidated into section FC 8H. A similar change has been made in section EX 21(30) of that Act. These changes are not required in the Income Tax Act 2007.

**21** When the terms of the lease change, the examples assume, for simplicity, that the same lease continues with the changed terms. In reality, taxpayers will need to assess whether for tax purposes the existing lease continues (including as a consecutive or successive lease) or a new lease is created. The examples should not be taken as providing any guidance for this assessment.
