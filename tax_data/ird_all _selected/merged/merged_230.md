The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet Adjudication & Rulings, a guide to Binding Rulings (IR 715) or the article on page 1 of Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 12 (May 1995) or Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995). You can download these publications from our website at www.ird.govt.nz TERTIARY STUDENT ASSOCIATION FEES PUBLIC RULING ñ BR PUB 03/02 Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is a modified version of public ruling BR Pub 99/1 which was published in TIB Vol 11, No 1 (January 1999). Its period of application is from 1 April 2002 to 31 March 2005. BR Pub 99/1 applied up until 31 March 2002. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section KC 5 of the Act. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the payment by a student at a tertiary institution, of a tertiary student association fee as a membership fee to that tertiary student association. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: ïThe payment of a tertiary student association membership fee is not a gift for the purposes of section KC 5(4) where any rights arising from membership are conferred by the payment, and/or where the payment is compulsory. Accordingly, a rebate will not be available under section KC 5. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 April 2002 to 31 March 2005. This Ruling is signed by me on the 14th day of April 2003. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 4 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 03/02 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in public ruling BR Pub 03/02 (ìthe Rulingî). For the purposes of this commentary, reference to ìassociationsî includes reference to societies, institutions, associations, organisations, trusts or funds. Background Section KC 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (ìthe Actî) provides a rebate to a donor of a gift of money in certain circumstances, where the recipient of the gift is a non-profit body whose funds are applied wholly or principally to any charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purpose(s) within New Zealand. The issue dealt with in the Ruling is whether a tertiary student association membership fee is a ìgiftî within the meaning of section KC 5 of the Act. The subject matter was previously dealt with in public ruling BR Pub 99/1, which expired on 31 March 2002. This public ruling replaces BR Pub 99/1, effective 1 April 2002. The previous ruling concluded that if a student pays a single fee to the student association to become a member of the student association, and the fee as a whole confers some rights on members, the payment is not a gift for the purposes of section KC 5(4). As the payment of the fee is not a gift, the student is not entitled to a rebate under section KC 5. Legislation Section KC 5 provides: (1) A taxpayer, other than an absentee or a company or a public authority or a M‰ori Authority or an unincorporated body, or a trustee liable for income tax under sections HH 3 to HH 6, HK 14, and HZ 2, is allowed as a rebate of income tax the amount of any gift (not being a testamentary gift) of money of $5 or more made by the taxpayer in the income year to any of the following societies, institutions, associations, organisations, trusts, or funds (being in each case a society, an institution, an association, an organisation, a trust, or a fund in New Zealand), namely: (aa) A society, institution, association, organisation, or trust which is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual and the funds of which are, in the opinion of the Commissioner, applied wholly or principally to any charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand: (ab) A public institution maintained exclusively for any one or more of the purposes within New Zealand specified in paragraph (aa): (ac) A fund established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing money for any one or more of the purposes within New Zealand specified in paragraph (aa), by a society, institution, association, organisation, or trust which is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual: (ad) A public fund established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing money for any one or more of the purposes within New Zealand specified in paragraph (aa): (ae) - (bw) \[provide a list of organisations.\] (2) The rebates provided for in this section shall not, in the case of any taxpayer, in any income year exceed in the aggregate the smaller ofó (a)33 1 / 3 % of the aggregate of all gifts described in subsection (1): (b)$500. (3) No rebate shall be allowed under this section in respect of any gift unless the taxpayer furnishes to the Commissioner in support of the taxpayerís claim for the rebate a receipt evidencing to the satisfaction of the Commissioner the making of the gift by the taxpayer. (3A) A refund may be made under this section only if section 41A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is complied with. (3AA) Despite subsection (3), a rebate is allowed under this section if a tax agent makes an application for a refund under section 41A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 on behalf of a person andó (a)The tax agent sights the receipt evidencing the making of the gift for which a claim is being made; and (b)The person retains the receipt for 4 income years after the income year to which the claim relates. (4) In this section, ìgiftî includes a subscription paid to a society, institution, association, organisation, trust, or fund, only if the Commissioner is satisfied that the subscription does not confer any rights arising from membership in that or any other society, institution, association, organisation, trust, or fund. Application of the Legislation Under section KC 5, a taxpayer other than an absentee, company, public authority, M‰ori authority, unincorporated body, or trustee liable for income tax (sections HH 3 to HH 6, HK 14, HZ 2), can claim a rebate if: ïthat person makes a gift (not being a testamentary gift) of money of $5 or more; 5 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) ïthe gift is made to any of the associations listed in section KC 5(1); ïthe recipient, in the opinion of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (ìthe Commissionerî), applies its funds wholly or principally for charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes, or is maintained (subparagraphs (ab) and (ac)) or established and maintained exclusively for one or more of those purposes (subparagraph (ad)); ïthe taxpayer furnishes to the Commissioner a receipt evidencing the making of the gift by the taxpayer to the recipient, or a tax agent makes the refund application on behalf of the taxpayer and the requirements of section KC 5(3AA) are satisfied; and ïsection 41A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is complied with. Furthermore, if the gift is a subscription paid to any association specified in section KC 5(4), the Commissioner must be satisfied that the subscription does not confer any rights arising from membership in that or any other association. Tertiary student association fees are considered ìsubscriptionsî for the purposes of section KC 5(4), as students receive the services provided by the student association, and the rights attaching to membership of that association in return for the fee, or can be said to be applying to participate in the association. As such, any rights arising from membership, which are conferred by the payment of a tertiary student association fee, will preclude such fee from the definition of ìgiftî in section KC 5(4), and accordingly no rebate will be available under section KC 5. The definition of ìgiftî in section KC 5(4) Section KC 5(4) operates as an exhaustive provision with respect to when subscriptions will constitute ìgiftsî for the purposes of section KC 5, and includes only subscriptions paid to an association if the Commissioner is satisfied that the subscription does not confer any rights arising from membership in that or any other association. In Case M128 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,825, the Taxation Review Authority (ìthe Authorityî) noted that the Commissioner had allowed the general school activity fee paid to state schools as a deduction, because such fees came within the expanded definition of ìgiftî. However, the Authority held that payments to a school for camp fees, a school trip, stationery, and a manual were not gifts, as they conferred particular rights on the pupil. Tertiary student association fees will only be a ìgiftî for the purposes of section KC 5(4), and will only qualify for a rebate, if the Commissioner is satisfied that the payment does not confer any rights arising from membership. Such rights may include things such as rights to do anything, receive anything, or have access to anything in return for the payment. If no rights are received, the payment of a subscription is considered to be in the nature of a donation, because the payer does not get any direct rights in return for the payment. The requirement that a subscription confer no rights does not contain words of apportionment (ie ìto the extent to whichî), but is absolute in its terms. Accordingly, if any rights are conferred by any part of the subscription, section KC 5 does not apply, and no rebate is available. It should be noted that section KC 5(4) refers only to rights being conferred: the rights do not have to be exercised or enjoyed by the taxpayer. Students attending tertiary institutions may pay a sum for membership of a student association or union. Tertiary student association fees will commonly give rise to the following types of rights or benefits: ïAccess to advice, welfare, and counselling services. ïAccess to liaison services between students and teaching staff. ïAccess to newsletters and other information. ïAccess to facilities on campus, such as library, health, or sport and recreation facilities. ïDiscounts on various goods and services. ïVoting rights in respect of the election of association executives, and also at general meetings. In addition, it may also be that the payment of a student association fee (or a substitute payment to a charity of the studentís choice) 1 is one of a number of payments a student must make, or things a student must do, in order to qualify for enrolment at the particular tertiary institution. The payment of a student association fee may, therefore, confer a further right on studentsóthe right to enrolment if the other conditions of enrolment are met. Any of the above, or any other rights arising from membership, which are conferred by the payment of a tertiary student association fee will preclude such a fee from the definition of ìgiftî in section KC 5(4), and accordingly no rebate will be available under section KC 5. 1 The Education Act 1989 provides that a student association may exempt any student from membership of the association on the grounds of conscientious objection; and, if exempted, the association must pay the studentís membership fee to a charity of its choice. 6 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) The Education (Tertiary Students Association Voluntary Membership) Amendment Act 1998 (ìthe 1998 EAAî), which came into force on 11 August 1998, abolished compulsory student association membership, except where a referendum of students at an institution determined that membership of the association at that institution would be compulsory. The 1998 EAA was subsequently repealed, from 8 July 2000, by the Education Amendment Act 2000 (ìthe 2000 EAAî). The 2000 EAA also inserted new provisions into the Education Act 1989, to the effect that tertiary student association membership is now prima facie compulsory, with the ability for a vote of all students at a particular institution to make membership of that association voluntary. Where tertiary student association fees are voluntary, it may well be that some or all of the services listed earlier are available to all students, whether paying association members or not. However, students who pay association fees may also be accorded the right to vote to elect association executives, and at general meetings. Further, students who pay association fees may have access to discounts not available to non-paying students. As stated earlier, any rights arising from association membership, which are conferred by the payment of a tertiary student association fee will preclude such a fee from the definition of ìgiftî in section KC 5(4), and accordingly no rebate will be available under section KC 5. Where tertiary student association fees are voluntary, it may be that there are in fact no rights arising from membership in that or any other association, conferred upon students who elect to pay association fees. It is only in this circumstance that the payment of such fees will constitute a gift within the meaning in section KC 5(4), and a rebate will be allowable accordingly, provided the other criteria of section KC 5 are satisfied. Any right conferred by the payment of student association fees will be sufficient to prevent the rebate from being available. It should be emphasised that it will only be in the very limited circumstances detailed above that a rebate will be available. In the event that there are in fact no rights arising from membership in a tertiary student association with compulsory fees, the payment of such fees will also not be considered a gift for the purposes of section KC 5(4), as it would fail to meet the fundamental precept that a gift must be something transferred voluntarily, and not as a result of a contractual or other obligation to transfer it 2 . Given that section KC 5(4) operates to extend the definition of the term ìgiftî to include certain subscriptions, the general common law requirement for a gift to be voluntary remains applicable, and it is only the common law consideration of whether any advantage or benefit of material character is received in return, which is modified by section KC 5(4). Example 1 A student enrols at a university, the student association of which has compulsory membership. The student pays the association fees, and is able to use the gym facilities, counselling services, and the subsidised health care programme. The student association has charitable status. As the payment of the student association fees confers certain rights upon the student, the payment does not qualify for a rebate as a donation to the student association. However, if a person who is not a student makes a donation to the student association at the university and no rights are conferred because of the payment, a gift is made and a rebate is allowed. Example 2 A student enrols at a polytechnic, the student association of which has voluntary membership. The student believes in and wishes to support the work of the association, and so elects to pay the association fees. The services provided by the association are available to all students at the polytechnic, regardless of whether they are paying members or not. No discounts are available to students who have contributed association fees. The associationís Constitution deems all students at the polytechnic to be ìmembersî, and accordingly able to exercise all membership rights, for instance the right to vote at general meetings. The student association has charitable status. As the payment of the student association fee does not confer any rights upon the student, a rebate will be available, provided the other criteria set out in section KC 5 are satisfied (these criteria are listed under the heading ìApplication of the Legislationî, on page 5). 2 In this regard, see for instance Mills v Dowdall \[1983\] NZLR 154, Federal Commissioner of Taxation v McPhail (1968) 117 CLR 111, Lawson Klopper & Anor v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 97 ATC 4179, Hodges v FC of T (1997) 97 ATC 2158, Australian Dairy Corporation v FC of T (1998) 98 ATC 2059, and Case J76 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,451. 7 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) ADVERTISING SPACE AND ADVERTISING TIME SUPPLIED TO NON-RESIDENTSó GST TREATMENT PUBLIC RULING ñ BR PUB 03/03 Note (not part of ruling): This ruling replaces public ruling BR Pub 00/06, published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 8 (August 2000) due to amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. BR Pub 00/06 applied up until 30 November 2004. This ruling is essentially the same as BR Pub 00/06; however it addresses section renumbering and an amendment to the wording of the new section. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section 11A(1)(k). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the contractual supply of advertising space in a publication, or the supply of advertising time on radio or television (or other broadcasting service), by a GST-registered person to a non-resident person who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. For the purposes of this Ruling the supply of advertising space or advertising time means the service of communicating an advertising message, and includes all steps involved in providing this service by the supplier of the advertising space or time. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: ïThe contractually supplied service of providing advertising space in a publication or advertising time on radio or television (or other broadcasting service), to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand at the time the service is performed, is not supplied ìdirectly in connection withî any land (or improvement thereto) or moveable personal property situated in New Zealand. Section 11A(1)(k) will apply to zero-rate the supply of services, provided that all the other requirements of section 11A(1)(k) are satisfied. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply from 10 October 2000 for an indefinite period. This Ruling is signed by me on the 28 th day of April 2003. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 8 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 03/03 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 03/03 (ìthis Rulingî). The majority of the subject matter covered in this Ruling was previously dealt with by BR Pub 00/06 that appeared in TIB Vol 12, No 8 (August 2000), at page 13. This Ruling applies from 10 October 2000 for an indefinite period. Background This public ruling considers the application of section 11A(1)(k) to advertising supplied to non-residents. New section 11A(1)(k) was introduced to replace the previous section 11(2)(e) regarding the zero-rating of services supplied to non-residents. Section 11A(1)(k) is almost identical to the previous provision except the words ìfor andî have been omitted from the phrase ìservices are supplied for and to a person who is not resident in New Zealandî. Section 11A(2) replaces section 11(2A) with identical wording regarding the receipt of those services in New Zealand. Section 11A(3) replaces section 11(2B) with identical wording regarding the meaning of ìoutside New Zealandî. The amended legislation came into force on 10 October 2000, the date from which this ruling applies. This commentary is designed to clarify the impact of the altered legislation in the context of cases decided under the previous legislation. Legislation Section 11A of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is as follows: (1) A supply of services that is chargeable with tax under section 8 must be charged at the rate of 0% in the following situations: ÖÖ (k) subject to subsection (2), the services are supplied to a person who is not resident in New Zealand and who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed, not being services which areó (i) supplied directly in connection withó (A) land situated in New Zealand or any improvement to the land; or (B) moveable personal property, other than choses in action or goods to which paragraph (h) or (i) applies, situated in New Zealand at the time the services are performed; or (ii) the acceptance of an obligation to refrain from carrying on a taxable activity, to the extent that the activity would have occurred within New Zealand; or ÖÖ (2) Subsection (1)(k) and (1)(l) do not apply to a supply of services under an agreement that is entered into, whether directly or indirectly, with a person (person A) who is not resident in New Zealand ifó (a) the performance of the services is, or it is reasonably foreseeable at the time the agreement is entered into that the performance of the services will be, received in New Zealand by another person (person B), includingó (i) an employee of person A; or (ii) if person A is a company, a director of the company; and (b) it is reasonably foreseeable, at the time the agreement is entered into, that person B will not receive the performance of the services in the course of making taxable or exempt supplies. (3)For the purpose of subsection (1)(k), (1)(l) and (1)(ma) and subsection (1)(n) as modified by subsection (4)(b), outside New Zealand, for a company or an unincorporated body that is not resident, includes a minor presence in New Zealand, or a presence that is not effectively connected with the supply. Ö Section 60 sets out the GST agency provisions. Section 60(2) states: Subject to this section, for the purposes of this Act, where any registered person makes a taxable supply of goods and services to an agent who is acting on behalf of another person who is the principal for the purposes of that supply, that supply shall be deemed to be made to that principal and not to that agent:Ö Application of the Legislation The key features of section 11A(1)(k) are the phrases ìservices are supplied to a person who is not resident in New Zealandî and ìdirectly in connection withî. ìServices are supplied to a person who is not resident in New Zealandî Section 11A(1)(k) omitted the words ìfor andî from the legislation which now reads ìservices are supplied to a person who is not resident in New Zealandî. In Wilson & Horton v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325 the Court of Appeal held that the word ìforî did not mean ìbeneficially forî and was only used to emphasise the word ìtoî as being ìcontractually toî. Section 11A(1)(k) omitted the word ìforî from the legislation as it was not required to interpret or emphasise ìtoî as being ìcontractually toî. The purpose of this amendment was not to change the established meaning of the word ìtoî in this context nor was it to override the existing law. ìToî continues to mean ìcontractually toî. An important factor supporting this conclusion is the enactment of section 11A(2). The purpose of section 11A(2) is to protect the integrity of the tax base by ensuring that domestic consumption of services is subject to GST, even though a non-resident may have purchased the services. An example is where New Zealand educational 9 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) institutions contract with non-residents to provide education for the non-residentís children in New Zealand. The section operates to ensure supplies of this type are standard rated for GST purposes. If a third party benefiting from these types of services was intended to be caught under section 11A(1)(k) then the enactment of section 11A(2) would have been unnecessary. The following is an analysis of the cases considering the interpretation of section 11(2)(e) which is now section 11A(1)(k). As explained earlier the interpretation of section 11A(1)(k) is identical to that of the previous section 11(2)(e) as the removal of the words ìfor andî do not impact on the previous interpretation as set out below. ìFor and toî The Court of Appeal in Wilson & Horton rejected the High Courtís interpretation of ìforî in section 11(2)(e), as meaning ìbeneficially forî and held that the supply of the publication of advertisements by Wilson & Horton to non-resident clients qualified for zero-rating under the former section 11(2)(e), irrespective of whether a New Zealand resident obtains a benefit from the supply. The Court noted that many parties may potentially benefit from an advertisement placed by a non-resident, and that it was unlikely that the legislature would have intended a wide group of possible beneficiaries of a service to determine the GST treatment of the service. In discussing the ìfor and toî wording in section 11(2)(e), the Court of Appeal examined the possible meanings of ìforî and concluded that ìforî in section 11(2)(e) was used for emphasis only. Justice Richardson noted that legislative drafters often convey emphasis through the use of a combination of words and said that (at 12,330): I am inclined to think that the framers of section 11(2)(e) employed both expressions to convey emphasis and perhaps to bring out the intent that the contract must be genuine and so the services must be supplied under that contract to and for the other contracting party. As a matter of statutory interpretation, the Court said that section 11(2)(e) would have been worded quite differently if the intent had been to preclude zero-rating, unless a non-resident recipient of a supply was the only person who could benefit from the services supplied. Penlington J considered that this result was consistent with one of the underlying themes of zero-ratingóthe preservation of New Zealandís competitiveness in world trade. It was also recognised that if advertised merchandise is sold in New Zealand, GST will be imposed on the sale at that time. The Commissioner accepted the Court of Appealís interpretation of ìfor and toî in Wilson & Horton for the purposes of section 11(2)(e). In that context, ìfor and toî was a composite phrase. ìForî simply emphasised ìtoî and does not connote any requirement that services must be provided for the exclusive benefit of the recipient of the supply. If services are supplied pursuant to a contract with a non-resident and are for that non-resident, section 11(2)(e) would have applied to zero-rate the supply regardless of any other benefits also arising to a New Zealand resident (provided that the other requirements of the section are satisfied). The Court of Appealís interpretation of ìfor and toî is not restricted to the supply of advertising space in a newspaper. It also applies to the supply of advertising space in all forms of publication and to the supply of advertising time on radio or television (or other broadcasting service). This Ruling deals with the application of section 11A(1)(k) to the supply of advertising space in publications, such as newspapers and magazines. The Ruling also covers the supply of advertising time on radio and television, or by way of any other broadcasting service, eg the internet. For the purposes of the Ruling, the supply of advertising space or advertising time means the service of communicating an advertising message, and includes all steps involved in providing this service by the supplier of the advertising space or time. ìDirectly in connection withî Previously the publishing industry had asked the Commissioner to clarify the application of the ìdirectly in connection withî exclusion in section 11(2)(e) (now section 11A(1)(k)) in this context. This ruling brings up to date that clarification by taking into account recent legislative amendments. A supply of services to a non-resident will not be zero-rated under section 11A(1)(k) if the services are supplied ìdirectly in connection withî any land (or improvement to the land) or moveable personal property (other than choses in action and goods which are referred to in section 11A(1)(h) or (i)) situated in New Zealand at the time the services are performed. There have not been any cases on the meaning of ìdirectly in connection withî under the new provision (section 11A(1)(k)). However, given that the identical phrase has been used in the new provision the following case law that considered the earlier provision (section 11(2)(e)) is still relevant to the interpretation of the phrase. Case law The Court of Appeal in Wilson & Horton did not discuss the meaning of ìdirectly in connection withî in section 11(2)(e), nor resolve whether advertising space is supplied directly in connection with the newspapers in which advertisements are placed. The High Court had accepted that the supply of advertising space in a newspaper was not ìdirectly in connection withî the subject matter of the advertising. During the Court of Appeal hearing, the potential argument that the services are supplied directly in connection with the newspapers themselves was also raised. However, the Court of 10 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) Appeal did not allow the Commissioner to introduce this new line of reasoning, as it would have changed the basis upon which the assessment was made and objected to. The determination of whether or not services are supplied ìdirectly in connection withî land or moveable personal property depends on the circumstances in which the services are supplied. In Case E84 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,441, Bathgate DJ considered the meaning of the phrase ìin connection withî (it is to be noted that the word ìdirectlyî was not used) in the context of section 165 of the Income Tax Act 1976 (now section DJ 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994) and noted (at 59,444 and 59,446): It may be that only an empirical and common sense approach to the interpretation of the words can be applied in each particular case to determine where, if at all, the line should be drawn to allow or not allow expenditure ëin connection withí an assessment. However I believe that a narrow interpretation of the words ëÖ any expenditure Ö in connection with Ö the assessment Öí is the correct interpretation Ö Ö It is a matter of degree whether, on the interpretation of a particular statute, there is a sufficient relationship between subject and object to come within the words ìin connection withî or not. It is clear that no hard and fast rule can be or should be applied to the interpretation of the words ìin connection withî. Each case depends on its own facts and the particular statute under consideration. In the context of GST, the meaning of ìdirectly in connection withî for the purposes of section 11(2)(a) \[now section 11A(1)(a)\], prior to its amendment in 1988 when the words ìdirectly in connection withî were removed, has been judicially considered by the High Court in Auckland Regional Authority v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,080 and the Taxation Review Authority (TRA) in Case P78 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,532. Before amendment, section 11(2)(a) provided for zero-rating of services supplied ìdirectly in connection withî transportation. The High Court and TRA cases concerned the application of section 11(2)(a) to various charges (landing dues, international terminal charges, and rubbish disposal charges) levied on overseas airlines. The High Court and the TRA adopted similar interpretations of the words ìdirectly in connection withî under section 11(2)(a). The Auckland Regional Authority case summarises the reasoning of the TRA in Case P78 (at 11,084): There, the Taxation Review Authority, Judge Barber, held that ìairport duesî were zero-rated for GST because passengers cannot realistically be transported to New Zealand by air unless a plane lands and parks on the tarmac; that charges for those services can be regarded as provided for international passengers who are in a sense ìoutside New Zealandî until they pass through customs. The services are fundamental to and directly connected with the transportation of passengers; The High Court and the TRA focus on whether a supply of services is fundamental or integral to transportation to determine whether the ìdirectly in connection withî test in section 11(2)(a) is satisfied. This reasoning is not strictly relevant for the purposes of interpreting ìdirectly in connection withî in section 11A(1)(k). This is because the focus of section 11(2)(a) was on services directly connected with transportation services, and the identification of a direct connection between a service and another service, and a service and an item of property, involves different considerations. In Case S88 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,551 the TRA applied the proviso to section 11(2)(e) and considered the words ìdirectly in connection withî. The objector in Case S88 purchased motor vehicles from its non-resident parent company and then sold the vehicles to independent dealers, who on-sold them to the public. The parent company provided a contractual warranty to the objector. The objector agreed with the dealers that if a vehicle was repaired under warranty the objector would reimburse the dealer. The objector would then register a claim with the parent company under the warranty and receive payment pursuant to that claim. The TRA was required to consider whether the repair services provided by the objector pursuant to its contract with the non-resident parent were zero-rated under section 11(2)(e). The TRA concluded that section 11(2)(e) could not apply to zero-rate this supply as the services were supplied ìdirectly in connection withî moveable personal property (the vehicles) situated in New Zealand at the time the services were provided. Although, the TRA did not examine the meaning of ìdirectly in connection withî in great detail, it did state (at 7,558): The moveable personal property in question is the repaired vehicle. There is a direct relationship or connection between the service of the repairs and the vehicle. Accordingly, the said ìprovisoî to section 11(2)(e) must apply to the facts of this case and prevent the objectors from relying on the zero-rating provisions of section 11(2)(e). The repair service could not be performed but for the existence of the vehicle. The TRA decision was appealed to the High Court in CIR v Suzuki New Zealand Ltd (2000) 19 NZTC 15,819. In dismissing the appeal Justice McGechan found that repairs to vehicles were ìdirectly in connection withî the cars in New Zealand, at page 15,830: I have held S\[uzuki\]NZ provided a repair service to SMC. SMC was not resident in New Zealand. I have no doubt that repair services were carried out directly in connection with moveable personal property situated in New Zealand at the time the services were performed. Quite simply, they were repairs carried out on cars within New Zealand. The situation equates \[to\] ìpainting the shipî. The nexus could not be closerÖ..I conclude that SNZís supply of repair services to SMC was not zero-rated. 11 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) The High Court decision was appealed in Suzuki New Zealand v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,096. The Court of Appeal agreed that the repairs were directly in connection with the motor vehicles and upheld the High Courtís decision and dismissed the appeal. The High Court in Malololailai Interval Holidays New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,137 also considered the words ìdirectly in connection withî but in the context of section 11(2)(b) \[now section 11A(1)(e)\]. In Case T54 (1998) 18 NZTC 8,410, the TRA considered whether the supply of video services for Japanese honeymoon couples to a Japanese company was zero-rated under section 11(2)(e). The decisions in both of these cases are consistent with the cases mentioned above. There have been no further cases relating to the interpretation of the phrase ìdirectly in connection withî. Therefore, the case law discussing ìin connection withî and ìdirectly in connection withî indicates that the interpretation of the test will be dictated by the particular context involved. The Commissioner considers that the ìdirectly in connection withî proviso in section 11A(1)(k) should be interpreted narrowly (Judge Bathgateís words from Case E84 quoted above support this), and that there must be a clear and direct relationship with moveable personal property or land in New Zealand before a supply will be standard-rated. This is consistent with the approach of the TRA in Case S88 in identifying on the facts of that particular case a ìdirect relationship or connectionî between the repair services and the vehicles under repair. This was supported by the Court of Appeal in Suzuki which held that: The repair services were obviously supplied in relation to goods, namely motor vehicles, which were situated in New Zealand. The supply of repairs could hardly be more directly connected with the motor vehicles. Advertising space and advertising time The supply of advertising space in a publication is the supply of the service of communicating an advertising message, involving all the steps required to achieve communication of the advertisement. This service is not supplied directly in connection with the subject matter of the advertisement. In the words of the High Court in Wilson & Horton v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,221 (at 11,224): The supply of space and services rendered by Wilson & Horton are directly connected with the advertising but not with the goods advertised. The goods are, as it were, at least one step removed from the services supplied by the newspaper proprietor. The Commissioner agrees with this view. There is no direct relationship or connection between the provision of advertising space and the subject matter of the advertisement. The same reasoning also applies to the supply of advertising space in all types of publication as well as advertising time on radio or television (or other broadcasting service). The supply of advertising space or time in these media cannot be described as ìdirectly in connection withî the advertised commodity. Similarly, when advertising space is supplied in a publication, the services are not supplied directly in connection with the publication in which the advertisements are published. The High Court judgment in Wilson & Horton concluded that the provision of advertising space was supplied directly in connection with (if anything) the advertising itself. The advertised goods were considered to be at least one step removed from the services. The Commissioner considers the same logic applies in respect of a newspaper or other publication. The service of communicating an advertising message is directly connected with that message and not the publication. The publication is at least one step removed from the service and is merely the medium in which the advertising message is publicised. Accordingly, the service is not supplied directly in connection with the publication produced by the publishers. Consequently, the supply of advertising space in either a publication or by way of broadcast will be treated in the same way for GST purposes. The supply will qualify for zero-rating, provided that the services are supplied to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. Supplies through agents The application of section 60(2) may also need to be considered to determine whether a supply is zero-rated under section 11A(1)(k). Section 60(2) deems a taxable supply of goods and services made by a registered person to an agent who is acting on behalf of a principal to be a supply made to the principal. Therefore, if a supply of advertising space or time is made to a New Zealand resident person who is acting as an agent for a non-resident principal, section 60(2) deems the supply to be made to the non-resident principal and not the resident agent. Section 11A(1)(k) will apply to zero-rate the supply of services, provided that all the other requirements of section 11A(1)(k) are satisfied. A common example of this is where a resident advertising agency acts as an agent for a non-resident person in purchasing advertising space or time in New Zealand. Conversely, if a supply is made to a non-resident person who is acting as an agent for a New Zealand resident in relation to the supply, section 11A(1)(k) will not apply to zero-rate the supply even if the criteria in section 11A(1)(k) are otherwise satisfied. The supply will be deemed to be made to the resident principal and it will not be to a non-resident person. 12 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) Section 11A(2) Section 11A(2) (formerly section 11(2A)) was introduced to deal with situations where services are provided to non-residents and persons in New Zealand receive the performance of these services. Section 11A(2) will not affect the provision of advertising services to non-residents in the circumstances covered by the arrangement described in this Ruling. The performance of these services is not received in New Zealand by other persons. Examples For the purposes of these examples, it is assumed that: ïA person referred to as a resident is a ìresidentî as defined in section 2 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The converse applies to non-residents; and ïIf the services are supplied to a non-resident, the non-resident is outside New Zealand at the time of performance of the services. Example 1 A UK resident manufacturing company contacts a New Zealand magazine publisher and books advertising space for a newly developed product. The UK company has a GST registered subsidiary in New Zealand that sells the advertised product. The supply of advertising space by the magazine publisher to the UK manufacturer is zero-rated under section 11A(1)(k). This is because: ïThe publisher supplies the services contractually to a non-resident. The fact that the New Zealand resident subsidiary potentially may benefit from the supply through increased sales does not preclude zero-rating. ïThe services are not supplied directly in connection with either the products for sale in New Zealand or the magazines in which the advertisements are shown. Example 2 A US resident distributor of soft drinks contracts for the supply of radio time on a national radio station in New Zealand. The soft drinks are available from all chains of supermarkets throughout New Zealand. The supply of radio time by the New Zealand radio station to the US distributor is zero-rated under section 11A(1)(k). This is because: ïThe radio station supplies its services contractually to a non-resident. The fact that New Zealand resident retailers throughout New Zealand may potentially benefit from the supply through increased sales does not preclude zero-rating. ïThe services are not supplied directly in connection with the products for sale in New Zealand. Example 3 An Australian computer distributor plans to advertise its product range in New Zealand. The computers will be available through all major computer distributors in New Zealand. The Australian company contacts a New Zealand resident advertising agency to arrange an advertising campaign. The agency, acting in the capacity as agent for the Australian company, purchases air time on a New Zealand resident television channel. The supply of air time by the television station to the Australian company is zero-rated under section 11A(1)(k). This is because: ïThe television channel supplies the air time services contractually to a non-resident. Section 60(2) deems the supply to be made to the Australian company, as principal. The New Zealand resident advertising agency receives the supply as agent only. ïThe fact that New Zealand resident distributors may potentially benefit from the supply through increased sales does not preclude zero-rating. The services are not supplied directly in connection with the products for sale in New Zealand. 13 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS This section of the Tax Information Bulletin contains interpretation statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. These statements set out the Commissionerís view on how the law applies to a particular set of circumstances when it is either not possible or not appropriate to issue a binding public ruling. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following interpretation statements. However, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of the assessment we consider that the earlier advice is not consistent with the law. TAX TREATMENT OF PAYMENTS RECEIVED BY PETROL RETAILERS IN RETURN FOR TRADE TIES In Public Information Bulletin 178 (February 1989), in an item entitled ìPetrol Retailers ñ Inducement Payments Paid by Oil Companiesî the Commissioner outlined his views regarding the general position on the income tax treatment of payments received by petrol retailers in return for trade ties. In particular, the item stated that lump sum payments made in return for trade ties would not be assessable. The Court of Appeal in Birkdale Service Station v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,981 has reiterated that for income tax purposes the method of payment does not determine whether an amount received by a petrol retailer is capital or revenue. Accordingly, the Commissioner advises that the item in PIB 178 (referred to above) is withdrawn, as it is not consistent with the approach the Court of Appeal has set out for determining whether a lump sum amount is capital or income. Taxpayers and agents should refer to the commentary below for general assistance concerning the proper character of trade tie payments received by petrol retailers. Birkdale Service Station v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,981 The relevant taxpayers in the Birkdale case were five retail service station proprietors and one used vehicle dealer and the case considered whether lump sum trade tie inducement (or compensation) payments made to the taxpayers by an oil company were capital or income. While the precise nature of the commitments differed, each case involved a written contract stipulating that certain payments, called inducement or compensation payments, would be made by the oil company in consideration for the retailers entering into an exclusive supply (trade tie) agreement. The Commissioner assessed the payments as income under section 65(2)(a), section 65(2)(e) and section 65(2)(l) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (the present equivalent sections are CD 3, CD 4 and CD5 of the Income Tax Act 1994). The taxpayers indicated that while there were differences in the specific provisions contained in the different contracts between the oil company and each of them, those factual differences did not produce a requirement to distinguish between them. The broad facts of each case were that the retailers entered into a series of interrelated agreements; including a standard inducement agreement, a retail supply agreement and an equipment loan contract, in return for inducement payments. In each case there were two separate inducement payments, the first being for an initial agreement, and then a second payment for an agreement negotiated following the expiry of the first. However, in one case the trade tie was secured by a 15 year lease of the premises and land to the oil company, and a sub-lease back to the retailer. In that case, at any time during the 15 year term the oil company had the right to call upon the retailer to enter into a redevelopment of the site, and if the retailer did not within a short time negotiate satisfactory terms with the oil company, the oil company could pay the retailer the value of the site improvements and take a 20 year lease at ground rent, again with a corresponding sublease back to the retailer. There was also a restrictive covenant preventing the retailer and its shareholders from trading in competition with the outlet from other premises within a 10 kilometre radius of the premises during the lease term. The correct approach The judgment of the Court of Appeal was delivered by Blanchard J, and began by stating that the High Court (Birkdale Service Station v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,493) followed the correct approach (at p. 15,987): Laurenson J in the High Court adopted the correct approach in order to determine whether the lump sum payments were capital or income. It was that followed by the Privy Council in Wattie and to be found in the following passage from the advice of the Privy Council delivered by Lord Pearce in BP Australia v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia \[1966\] AC 224 at p 264: The solution to the problem is not to be found by any rigid test or description. It has to be derived from many aspects of the whole set of circumstances some of which may point in one direction, some in the other. One 14 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) consideration may point so clearly that it dominates other and vaguer indications in the contrary direction. It is a commonsense appreciation of all the guiding features which must provide the ultimate answer. Although the categories of capital and income expenditure are distinct and easily ascertainable in obvious cases that lie far from the boundary, the line of distinction is often hard to draw in border line cases; and conflicting considerations may produce a situation where the answer turns on questions of emphasis and degree. That answer: ìdepends on what the expenditure is calculated to effect from a practical and business point of view rather than on the juristic classification of the legal rights, if any, secured employed or exhausted in the processî: per Dixon J in Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1946) 72 CLR 634, 648. The Court of Appeal then noted that in applying the above approach, the background to the transaction was of ìconsiderable importanceî. In the context of the actual case, the Court recognised that there were no multi-brand retailers in New Zealand at the time of the relevant agreements, and that the contractual freedom of the retailers was thus in practical terms limited to their ability to make a choice between four wholesalers and to negotiate the term and amount. Further, the Court noted that the businesses of the retailers were described by one witness as ìmarginalî and that if they were minded to continue to operate their business in the deregulated environment they had in reality no choice but to tie themselves to one of the four major wholesalers (at p. 15,988). Other trade tie cases discussed in Birkdale The appellants referred the Court to three cases in particular where lump sum payments made in return for trade ties had been characterised as capital. The cases were: Commrs of IR v Coia 1959 SC 89, Dickenson v FCT (1958) 98 CLR 460 and C of IR v Dunlops (Wanganui) Ltd \[1970\] NZLR 1125. These cases were briefly discussed in the judgment of Blanchard J. In Coia the retailer gave up being a multi-brand outlet, and accepted a payment in return for a 10 year tie with an oil company. In the leading judgment Lord Clyde observed that the retailer had expended the monies on capital outlays. However, he also stated that the payment was made in return for a trade tie, the acceptance of which required the retailer to give up his unrestricted freedom to trade as he wished and required him to accept petrol at the oil companyís posted prices. Lord Patrick concurred, stating that the retailer had given up a valuable asset of a capital nature in ceasing to be a multi-brand retailer and accepting the payment in return for a trade tie of 10 years. In Dickenson the taxpayer accepted payment in return for a 10 year trade tie with an oil company, having been a multi-brand retailer prior to entering into the tie. The oil companyís rights were also secured by a 10 year lease and sub-lease (similar to the arrangement in the case of one of the retailers in Birkdale). The majority of the High Court of Australia found that the payments were of a capital nature. Dixon CJ said that: The appellantís business constituted a profit-yielding organisation of a definite structure under his control and he received the money as part of an inducement to change a feature in it. The feature to be changed was the use of a plurality of petrols and oils, and this was replaced by a restriction to the purchase and sale of the products of one company. (p. 474) The Chief Justice added that there was nothing recurrent in the nature of the payment. It was not a normal or natural incident of carrying on such a business and it did not represent a purpose for which such a business was carried on. In addition, Kitto J stated that the payment seemed to be made in return for a substantial and enduring detraction from pre-existing rights, and the restriction took a substantial piece out of the ordinary scope of business activities in which the taxpayer would otherwise have been engaged: But a lump sum payment for a restriction of a garage and its proprietor to one brand of petroleum products for a period of ten years, effectuated by means of a lease and sub-lease of the premises as well as by personal covenants, seems in the nature of a sale price for a substantial and enduring detraction from pre-existing rights. The restriction does not strike my mind as an obligation undertaken incidentally to the carrying on of the business. Rather it does take a substantial piece out of the ordinary scope of business activities to which otherwise the appellant might apply himself and for which he might use his premisesÖ.(p. 492) The Dunlops case was a decision of the New Zealand Court of Appeal. In this case the taxpayer had, until 1961, sold all available brands of petrol. In that year an oil company offered a lump sum payment if the company would sell that companyís petrol only. North P concluded that the payment had been made in consideration of the retailer giving up a part of its business and confining itself to a more limited field. The other members of the Court agreed. Following the discussion of these cases in Birkdale, Blanchard J stated that: The question of whether the payment for an asset is received as capital or income turns in our view upon the nature of the asset in the hands of the seller. Is it sold as a capital asset or is the seller disposing of it in the carrying on of the operations of a business or in pursuance of a particular venture? Are the retailers in their particular circumstances to be seen as having disposed of a part of their businesses, as the retailers did in Coia, Dickenson and Dunlops, or did they accept the sums of compensation as an incident of the carrying on of their businesses without any change of a structural nature having occurred? In other words, the question is what the retailersí acceptance of Mobilís payments effected from a practical and business point of view, to adapt Dixon Jís words in Hallstroms. (p. 15,991) 15 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) Relevant factors to consider In the Birkdale case the Court of Appeal considered the following factors to be relevant in determining what the trade tie payments effected from a practical and business point of view: 1. the fact that little was surrendered by the retailers, 2. the length of the trade ties, and 3.the proper accounting treatment. 1.Little was surrendered by the retailers In this regard the Court stated: Öthe appellantís apparent freedom to contract as they wished for purchases of motor spirits was illusory. In reality, each had no choice, if it wished to remain in business, other than to accept a tie to one of the four oil companies. It was merely a matter of choosing for which one of them the retailer would become an ìagentî and negotiating the period of the tie, the amount of the payment to be received upfront and the applicable conditions. The details of the arrangements were not likely to vary much at all as between the oil companies, for the reasons already stated. There is no doubt that Mobil imposed quite severe restrictions and controls, including the right of first refusal. But the effect of these on the pre-existing business structure had to be measured against the situation in which the retailers found themselves upon deregulation of the industry. Importantly in this case therefore, the retailers in reality had no choice but to tie themselves to one of four oil companies. This point ìreadily distinguished the present case from the three cited to us by the appellant, \[being\] Coia, Dickenson and Dunlopsî (at p. 15,992) all of which involved the retailers giving up the ability to continue as a multi-brand retailer. The Court found that in addition to not giving up any significant freedom, the structure of the business of the appellants had hardly changed, stating: Therefore, in accepting the trade tie payments, the appellants were not giving up a significant freedom. In addition, the other features of the structure of the business had hardly changed. There was no alteration in the ownership of the land or the chattels employed in the conduct of the business, nor in their nature. Ö The manner of conducting the business of the retailer may have changed because of the contractual requirements imposed by Mobil on service station operations. But that involved the way in which the revenues were to be derived rather than an alteration in the structure from which they were derived.(at p. 15,992) The degree of structural alteration the Court considered significant enough to render the transaction an affair of capital can be seen in the judgment relating to the Kenlock 2 arrangement. In this regard, the Court stated: Ö Two factors, both singly and even more powerfully in combination, convince us that Kenlock 2 is different from the other arrangements. They are, first, that Mobil obtained security for its tie by means of a 15 year lease with a sublease to Kenlock on a back-to-back basis and, secondly, that the term for which Kenlock became committed to Mobil was potentially very substantially longer than 15 yearsÖ. There was also a restrictive covenant preventing Kenlock and its shareholders from trading in competition with the outlet from other premises within a 10 kilometre radius of the premises during the lease term. Even though the choices realistically open to Kenlock Motors were no greater than for the other retailers, or for itself when it entered into Kenlock 1, on accepting such terms of Kenlock 2, particularly by the granting of a long term interest in its land and buildings, we consider that Kenlock Motors was altering its business structure in such a material way that the payment it received in exchange has to be regarded as of a capital nature. (at p. 15,995) 2.The length of the trade ties None of the initial ties in the Birkdale case were longer than five years. The Court noted the weight given to the length of the ties in the judgments in Regent Oil v Strick (Inspector of Taxes) \[1966\] AC 295, and cited a passage from BP Australia v C of T \[1966\] AC 224 (adapting the words to the position of a recipient rather than a payer): Length of time, though theoretically not a deciding factor, does in practice shed a light on the nature of the advantage \[granted\]. The longer the duration of the agreements, the greater the indication that a structural solution was being sought. Blanchard J additionally said: The length of the trade ties also distinguishes the present case from the three cited to us by counsel for the appellants. In the present case, in no instance was the initial tie for a period of more than five years and in two cases it was as short as three years. Although, in theory, at the end of that period the retailer could switch to another wholesaler, the best that could actually be hoped for was the renegotiation of a further package either with Mobil or possibly with one of the other oil companies. (p. 15,993) 3.The proper accounting treatment The Court noted that the evidence showed that proper accounting treatment showed the payments should be taken into the revenue account of the retailer. Although it was stated that such a requirement was not determinative, the Court stated it did provide a minor degree of support for the view that the payments were revenue in nature. 16 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) Conclusion In the Birkdale case, the background and commercial context of the transactions pointed towards a conclusion that the payments were received in the ordinary course of business. The lack of structural alterations to the business structure of the retailers (in all but the case where the tie was secured by a long term interest in the land and buildings of a retailer and accompanied by restrictive trading covenants) additionally supported the conclusion that the payments were revenue, and the length of the ties was insufficient to change this result. In finding the payments to be of a revenue nature, the Court stated: In the end, the decision in this case comes down to the impression created by the combination of circumstances, including the length, and thus potential for recurrence in the short and medium term, of each tie, and the insignificant nature of the supposed freedom given up by the appellants.(p. 15,994) Tax treatment of payments made to petrol retailers in return for trade ties The decision in Birkdale reinforces the point that, in considering the character of a payment or receipt a conventional capital/revenue analysis should be undertaken. As was stated by the Privy Council in Wattie (1998) 18 NZTC 13,991 (and reiterated in Birkdale), the correct characterisation of a particular transaction depends upon what the transaction was calculated to effect, from a practical and business point of view. The nature of the asset in the hands of the seller is the primary consideration. Is the asset sold as a capital asset or is it sold in the carrying on of the operations of a business or in pursuance of a particular venture? The relevant consideration is therefore the nature of the payment and what is provided in return. In considering the background to the transaction in Birkdale and the recurrent nature of the agreements, the Court of Appeal discussed the argument that the receipt of a trade tie was an ordinary incident of business: The recurrent nature of each transaction is obvious and there is much force in the Commissionerís argument that the receipt of payments in return for a trade tie ought therefore to be seen as an incident of the motor spirits retailing businessÖ It may not be going too far, on the evidence, to say that by the time the second ties were entered into by the retailers in this case ties to wholesalers were a universal experience in New Zealand. Certainly they were common. And it is worth noting that repetition of a tie involved no change at all to the business structure, other than in relation to length of term in instances where that was different from the retailerís first tie with Mobil. In short, the further tie and any longer period have to be considered in that context. (p. 15,993) A combination of circumstances, including the length of each tie and the insignificant nature of the supposed freedom given up by the appellants, led to the payments in Birkdale (in all cases except where the tie was secured by the long term interest in land and buildings) being revenue in nature as they were ordinary incidents of business in the commercial environment of one brand motor spirits retailing. In its focus upon the background of each transaction the Court of Appeal in Birkdale distinguished the Coia, Dickenson and Dunlops cases, making some general observations regarding the treatment of trade ties in the current commercial environment as it applies to petrol retailers. Of particular note in this emphasis upon the commercial reality of petrol retailing is the recognition that there is no multi-brand trading. In addition, the relative lack of competition between the four main oil companies also appears to have contributed to the Courtís view that the retailers were not giving up any significant freedoms in return for accepting a trade tie. The outcome in the Birkdale case suggests that the ability to enter into an exclusive supply contract is in fact a revenue ìassetî in the hands of the retailer. Of note in particular is that the Court of Appeal did not consider the significant restrictions placed upon the retailers to effect any ìstructuralî alterations to the retailersí businesses. Unless other factors are strongly indicative of a capital character, in particular significant structural alterations effected to the business (rather than its trading operations), the case suggests the Court will find such payments to be received in the ordinary course of business. Factors to consider in analysing whether a payment received by a petrol retailer in return for a trade tie is capital or revenue in nature In determining the tax treatment of payments received by petrol retailers in return for trade ties, each case will necessarily depend on its facts (rather than merely the nature of the payment). The relevant question in any case is what is the payment for, ie what is provided in return for the payment? Primarily, the context of commercial operations in the petrol industry means payments received in return for entering into a trade tie will be received in the ordinary course of business (and therefore will be revenue in nature), unless other factors are strongly indicative of a capital character. These factors include: ïWhether the retailers have given up anything significant in return for the tie, and in particular, whether they have made structural alterations to their overall business operations. \[Note that in Birkdale the Court considered the retailers in question had no choice but to accept a trade tie with one of the four oil companies, and this was noted by the Court in the course of its finding that the retailers (except for Kenlock 2 who entered into the lease/sub-lease agreement) had not given up anything significant in return for the tie, nor had they made any significant structural alterations to their businesses.\] 17 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) ïThe length of the trade ties, which will be relevant in considering the significance of any structural alterations (as the length of the trade tie can indicate the nature of the advantage gained). ïThe correct accounting treatment, while not decisive in itself, can provide support for a particular characterisation of a receipt where this is indicated by the other factors above. In the context of an agreement in the nature of a trade tie, it is the Commissionerís view that the presence or absence of a dedicated use to which a receipt must be put is not necessarily determinative of the character of the receipt, because it is the totality of the circumstances in which the payment is received which need to be taken into account in determining the nature of that receipt in the hands of a petrol retailer. The Birkdale case makes it clear that it is not the ìlump sumî nature of the payment that determines its tax consequences, as is stated in PIB 178. The nature of the payment in the hands of the recipient will be determined by what is provided in return, rather than the form of payment. In the current context of commercial operations, some retailers have little choice but to accept a tie to one of four oil companies. This appears to be an important point of difference between the cases heard prior to the issue of PIB 178 and the Birkdale case, as the earlier cases concerned trade ties where the industry context was such that these arrangements were not the norm. 18 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates.

Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication and Rulings) 19 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS These statements describe how the Commissioner will, in practice, exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. INCOME EQUALISATION DEPOSITS AND REFUNDS IR-SPS GNL-400 INTRODUCTION This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) sets out the Commissionerís practice in regard to the statutory powers to: ïaccept income equalisation deposits for an accounting year outside the specified period. ïaccept refund applications for an accounting year outside the specified period. Application This SPS applies to income equalisation deposits and refunds made in respect of the 2003 and subsequent income years, including deposits and refunds made under section EI 17 of the Income Tax Act 1994. It does not apply to the Adverse Event Income Equalisation Scheme nor does it apply to refunds made under sections EI 5 to EI 8 of the Income Tax Act 1994. This SPS replaces the policies in respect to income equalisation deposits and refunds as published in Public Information Bulletin nos. 108, 114 and 142 and any subsequent amendments through Inland Revenue technical rulings. Summary Deposits Beyond the specified period for an accounting year, the Commissioner will allow a taxpayer to make an income equalisation deposit for that accounting year by the date that the Commissioner sets under the discretion accorded in the legislation (hereafter referred to as ìthe required dateî). The taxpayer must elect in writing at the time of making the deposit, that it is to be deemed to be made in respect of that accounting year. The required date is the earlier of: ïone month from the date of filing the return of income for that accounting year; or ïone month from the date that the relevant return of income is due to be filed. The due date for filing a return will include any extension of time arrangements agreed to by Inland Revenue. The Commissioner will consider, on a case by case basis, requests to make a deposit for an accounting year after the required date. The merits of the taxpayerís particular situation will be considered and a decision made on whether to accept the deposit after taking full account of the taxpayerís particular circumstances. Deposits made after the required date and not accepted by the Commissioner as applying to the requested accounting year, may still be accepted by the Commissioner and applied to the accounting year in which the deposit is made. The Commissioner will first contact the taxpayer to give them the option of continuing with the deposit or having it refunded to them. A deduction will be allowed for the accounting year in which the deposit is deemed to have been made and once the deposit is physically received by Inland Revenue. Refunds Beyond the specified period for an accounting year, an application for a refund from the Income Equalisation Scheme for that accounting year will be accepted by the Commissioner if that application is made by the required date. The taxpayer must elect in the application that the refund be deemed to be made in respect of that accounting year. The required date is the earlier of: ïone month from the date the return of income for the accounting year is filed; or ïone month from the date the return is due to be filed. The Commissioner will consider, on a case by case basis, applications for a refund for an elected accounting year after the required date. The merits of the taxpayerís particular situation will be considered and a decision made on whether to accept the application for the refund after taking full account of the taxpayerís particular circumstances. A refund deemed to be made from an elected accounting year, is gross income to the taxpayer for that accounting year. Applications for refunds made after the required date and not accepted by the Commissioner as applying to the elected accounting year, may still be accepted by the Commissioner and applied to the accounting year in which the application is made. The Commissioner will 20 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) first contact the taxpayer to give them the option of continuing with or withdrawing the application for a refund. A refund in this instance is gross income to the taxpayer in the accounting year that the application for the refund is received. Background The income equalisation scheme was introduced in 1965. At the time of introduction of the scheme it was stated that it would: ïenable farmers to iron out rates of tax due to rises and falls in income; ïencourage farmers to put aside part of their income in good years and to use this money for farm development in years when farm income falls; ïhelp to remove a cause of inflation and therefore help to maintain a steadier rate of economic growth. The scheme enables an eligible taxpayer to make income equalisation deposits with the Commissioner and claim a deduction against their gross income in the year the deposit is made or deemed to be made. When a refund is made from the scheme, the amount is included as part of the taxpayerís gross income in the accounting year the application for refund is received or in the accounting year that the taxpayer elects that the refund is deemed to be made and this election is accepted by the Commissioner. If a taxpayer makes a deposit or applies for a refund in relation to an accounting year within the specified period (as defined by the legislation) or within such later time as the Commissioner may allow, then the taxpayer may elect in writing that the deposit or the refund be deemed to be made in respect of that accounting year. Since the implementation of the scheme, Use of Money Interest (UOMI) has been introduced. Farmers are usually not in a position to know their final financial position until after liability for UOMI applies. Also many farmers do not receive the bulk of their income until near the end of their accounting year meaning that they have not had the use of that money throughout the year. The income equalisation scheme provides an avenue for farmers to limit their exposure to UOMI. Legislation The relevant sections of Part EI of the Income Tax Act 1994 are set out below: EI 1 Income Equalisation Deposits (1) Subject to this section, any taxpayer engaged in any farming or agricultural business on any land in New Zealand or in any business of fishing or any taxpayer (not being a company, or a public authority, or a M‰ori authority, or an unincorporated body) who derives gross income from forestry in New Zealand may during any accounting year make payments to the Commissioner by way of income equalisation deposits in respect of that accounting year: Provided that where a taxpayer makes any payment by way of deposit under this section during the specified period in relation to an accounting year, or within such later time as the Commissioner may allow in any case or class of cases, that payment shall, if the taxpayer so elects by notice in writing given to the Commissioner at the time of making the payment, be deemed to have been made in respect of that accounting year: Provided also that where a refund has been made to a taxpayer in respect of an accounting year in accordance with section EI 4, no payment by way of deposit shall subsequently be made under this section by the taxpayer in respect of that accounting year except where the Commissioner is satisfied that the amount of the refund has, before the making of the subsequent payment by way of deposit, been wholly applied for the purposes of the development or expansion of the business. (2) Every amount received by the Commissioner from any taxpayer under this section shall be deemed to be public money and shall be paid into a Crown Bank Account in accordance with the Public Finance Act 1989, such account to be known as the Income Equalisation Reserve Account, and shall be entered in an income equalisation account to be kept by the Commissioner in the name of the taxpayer. No other amounts, except interest payable under section EI 2, shall be entered in the taxpayerís income equalisation account. No amount entered in such account shall be paid to any person except by way of refund as provided in this Act. (3) No taxpayer shall be entitled to make any payment by way of deposit under this section in respect of any accounting year which ñ (a) Is less than $200 or the amount that will increase the aggregate amount of all payments by way of deposits previously made by the taxpayer under this section in respect of that accounting year to the taxpayerís maximum deposit in respect of that year, whichever amount is the smaller; or (b) Is greater than the amount that will increase the aggregate amount of all payments by way of deposits previously made by the taxpayer under this section in respect of that accounting year to the taxpayerís maximum deposit in respect of that year. 21 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) (4) Subject to sections EI 7 and EI 8, where the amount, or the aggregate of all amounts, received by the Commissioner from any taxpayer under this section in respect of any accounting year exceeds the taxpayerís maximum deposit in respect of that accounting year, the Commissioner shall, as soon as possible after ascertaining the amount of that excess, refund the amount of the excess to the taxpayer. Nothing in sections EI 3 to El 6 or section EI 9 or section EI 10 shall apply to any amount refunded under this subsection. (5) No amounts entered in any taxpayerís main income equalisation account shall be in any way assigned or charged or (except by reason of the bankruptcy of the taxpayer) pass to any other person by operation of law, or (except by reason of the bankruptcy of the taxpayer) be assets for the payment of the taxpayerís debts or liabilities or (in the event of the taxpayerís death) of the debts or liabilities of the taxpayerís estate, at any time before they have been duly refunded in accordance with this Act. EI 3 Deposits to be allowed as deduction Where any taxpayer makes any payments by way of deposits under section EI 1 in respect of any accounting year in respect of the taxpayerís farming, agriculture, or fishing business or in respect of the taxpayerís gross income from forestry, the taxpayer is allowed as a deduction in that year the aggregate amount of those payments or the amount of the taxpayerís maximum deposit in respect of that accounting year, whichever amount is the smaller. EI 4 Refunds from main Income Equalisation accounts (1) Subject to this section, any taxpayer may at any time apply in writing to the Commissioner for a refund of the whole or any part of any amounts deposited under section EI 1. (2) Subject to this section and to sections EI 5 to EI 10, no refunds shall be made of any amount that has been deposited under section EI 1 less than 12 months before the date of the application for the refund. (3) Notwithstanding subsection (2), a refund shall be made of any amount deposited under section EI 1 for 6 months or more before the date of the application for a refund in any case where the Commissioner is satisfied that the refund is required - (a) To enable the taxpayer to undertake, immediately after the refund is made, planned development or maintenance work in relation to the taxpayerís farming, agricultural, or fishing business or forestry operations; or (b) To enable the taxpayer to purchase, immediately after the refund is made, livestock for use in the taxpayerís farming business; or (c) To avoid the suffering by the taxpayer of serious hardship; or (d) For any other purpose or purposes for which the Commissioner may at any time determine in a case or class of cases the refund should so be made. (4) Notwithstanding subsection (2), a refund shall be made of any amount deposited under section EI 1, whether or not so deposited for 6 months or more before the date of the application for a refund, in any case where the Commissioner is satisfied that the refund is required - (a) To enable the taxpayer to purchase, immediately after the refund is made, livestock for use in the taxpayerís farming business, that livestock being in replacement of livestock sold or otherwise disposed of or lost as a result of the occurrence of a self-assessed adverse event; or (b) To avoid the suffering by the taxpayer of serious hardship; or (c) For any other purpose or purposes for which the Commissioner may at any time determine in any case or class of cases the refund should so be made. (5) Subject to sections EI 5 to EI 10, every refund of the whole or any part of any amount deposited under section EI 1 shall be deemed to have been made in respect of the accounting year in which the application for the refund is received by the Commissioner, and the amount of the refund shall be deemed to be gross income derived by the taxpayer in that accounting year: Provided that where an application is received by the Commissioner in the specified period in relation to an accounting year or within such later time as the Commissioner may allow in any case or class of cases, any refund made under that application shall, if the taxpayer so elects in that application, be deemed to have been made in respect of that accounting year, and the amount of the refund shall be deemed to be gross income derived by the taxpayer in that accounting year. EI 17 Deposits by forestry companies in respect of gross receipts from thinning operationsó (1) Where a company carrying on a forestry business on any land in New Zealand derives during any accounting year gross income from carrying out thinning operations on the land, the company may make payments to the Commissioner by way of deposits in respect of that year in accordance with this section. 22 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) Sections EI 1 to EI 4, EI 8, and EI 10, as far as they are applicable and with any necessary modifications, shall apply to any deposits made by a company under this section in respect of any accounting year, as ifó (a) The company, in carrying out the thinning operations, carried on a farming or agricultural business on land in New Zealand during that accounting year; and (b) The deposits made under this section in respect of that accounting year were made under section EI 1; and (c) The companyís maximum deposit in respect of that accounting year were an amount equal to the gross receipts from carrying out thinning operations on the land derived by the company during that accounting year. (3) Where a company makes payments by way of deposits under this section and also makes payments by way of deposits under section EI 1, separate reserve accounts shall be kept in respect of deposits under this section and deposits under section EI 1. (4) In this sectionó ìGross receipts from carrying out thinning operationsî, in relation to an accounting year and to a company carrying on a forestry business on any land in New Zealand, means the gross income that was derived by the company during that accounting year from carrying out thinning operations on the land. ìThinning operationsî means operations by means of which a felling is made in an immature stand of trees for the purpose of improving the growth and form of the trees remaining, without permanently breaking the canopy. Section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 provides: OB 1 Specified Period (a) In sections EI 1 to EI 10, in relation to an accounting year of a taxpayer, means the shorter of the following 2 periods ñ (i) The period of 6 months immediately following the end of that accounting year: (ii) The period from the end of that accounting year to the date one month after the date by which the taxpayer is required, in accordance with section 37 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, to furnish the taxpayerís return of income for that accounting year: (b) In paragraph (a) of the definition of ìspecified incomeî, in the definition of ìnet specified incomeî, and in Part KD and section OB 4, means any unbroken period in any income year, whether that period consists of some or all of the days in the income year: Discussion All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994. The following is a discussion of the issues surrounding income equalisation deposits and refunds. Section EI 1(1) allows an eligible taxpayer to spread their gross income for any accounting year by making an income equalisation deposit. Eligible taxpayers are: ïtaxpayers engaged in any farming or agricultural business on land in New Zealand; ïtaxpayers engaged in any business of fishing; ïtaxpayers (not a company, or a public authority, or a M‰ori authority, or an unincorporated body) who derive gross income from forestry in New Zealand. An eligible taxpayer may make a payment to the income equalisation scheme at any time during the accounting year. The first proviso to section EI 1(1) also allows a taxpayer to make a deposit during the specified period in relation to an accounting year, or within such later time as the Commissioner may allow and that deposit shall, if the taxpayer so elects in writing at the time of making the deposit, be deemed to have been made in respect of that accounting year. Section EI 3 allows the taxpayer a deduction for any deposits to the income equalisation scheme for the applicable accounting year. Section EI 4 allows a taxpayer at any time, subject to certain restrictions, to request in writing a refund from sums deposited in the scheme. Section EI 4(5) deems the refund to have been made in respect of the accounting year that the application for refund is received by the Commissioner. The proviso to section EI 4(5) states where an application for a refund is received in the specified period in relation to an accounting year, or within such later time as the Commissioner permits, any refund made, if the taxpayer so elects, is deemed to have been made in respect of that accounting year and the amount of that refund is deemed to be gross income for that accounting year. On a case by case basis, a taxpayer can still request the Commissioner to accept a deposit of income equalisation or make an application for a refund, in respect of an accounting year, outside the specified period or beyond the required date. Where such a request or application 23 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) had not been accepted by the Commissioner, the deposit or refund may, with consultation with the taxpayer, be applied to the accounting year in which the deposit or application for refund is made and any allowable deduction or deemed gross income similarly applied. Specified Period ìSpecified periodî is defined in section OB1. It is the shorter of 6 months immediately following the end of the accounting year and the period from the end of that accounting year to the date one month after the date by which a taxpayer is required to file their return. This is demonstrated by the following examples: Example 1 30 June 2003 balance date (with extension of time arrangement to 31 March 2004). The specified period is the earlier of: ï6 months from balance dateó31 December 2003 ï1 month after return is dueó30 April 2004 Example 2 30 June 2003 balance date (without extension of time arrangement). The specified period is the earlier of: ï6 months from balance dateó31 December 2003 ï1 month after the return is dueó7 November 2003 (being 1 month after return filing date of 7 October 2003) In the first example the specified period ends on 31 December 2003, whereas in the second example the specified period ends on 7 November 2003. Commissionerís Discretion The discretion given to the Commissioner to accept a deposit or an application for refund for a particular accounting year outside the specified period is broad; up to ìsuch later time as the Commissioner may allowî in any case or class of cases. What needs to be considered is how the Commissioner should exercise that discretion. Case law has determined that a statutory power conferred to a public authority (eg a discretion) cannot be unfettered or arbitrary. Also, a discretion must be used reasonably. In Roberts v. Hopwood \[1925\] AC 578, Lord Wrenbury stated: ìA person in whom is vested a discretion must exercise his discretion upon reasonable grounds. A discretion does not empower a man to do what he likes merely because he is minded to do so ñ he must in the exercise of his discretion do not what he likes but what he ought. In other words, he must, by the use of his reason, ascertain and follow the course which reason directs. He must act reasonably.î An authority can fail to exercise its discretion lawfully by failing to give its mind to each case; each case needs to be considered on its own merits. Blindly dismissing cases as being not within policy is an abuse of power. Making policies is permitted but they cannot be over-rigid. This is highlighted in Gisborne Mills Ltd v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,194; (1989) 13 TRNZ 405 in which Robertson J found that the Commissioner had failed to exercise a discretion which Parliament had given him. By failing to discharge a statutory responsibility, an abuse has arisen and subject to review by the Court. In a recent case, Lawton v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (2003) 21 NZTC 18042, the Court of Appeal held that the Commissioner had not properly exercised the discretion in section 30(2) of the Income Tax Act 1976, which deals with acceptance of a late objection. This decision has implications on how the Commissioner should consider requests for deposits and refunds outside the dates that are set. Glazebrook J, delivering the unanimous judgment of the Court, reiterated the dicta of the Court in CIR v Wilson (1996) 17 NZTC, 12,512, in which it was held that ìthe merits of a proposed \[late\] objection must be considered unless the explanation for the lateness of the objection is so inadequate that this is unnecessary.î In Lawton it was held that the taxpayer had given a full and credible explanation for the lateness of the objection. ìIn such a caseî, the Court held, ìunless \[the\] explanation was palpably untrue or quite unjustified, it would be rare for the explanation to be deemed so inadequate that the merits need not be examined.î The Lawton case is the most recent comment of the Court of Appeal on the manner in which the Commissioner should exercise discretions of this kind. In considering whether to accept a request for a deposit or refund outside the specified dates, the Commissioner is obliged to consider the merits of the explanation given for the lateness of the request. The request cannot simply be dismissed. The Commissioner, after considering the merits of the explanation, may or may not accept the deposit or refund for the elected accounting year. What is reasonable? Section EI 1(1) allows an eligible taxpayer to make payments, during any accounting year, to the income equalisation scheme in respect of that accounting year. The effect of the first proviso to EI 1(1) is to allow the taxpayer a specified time into the next accounting year to make a deposit of income equalisation. It also grants the Commissioner discretion to extend this time. Commonly, it will not be until the taxpayerís set of accounts and tax return are completed before the taxpayerís financial situation for an accounting year will be known. From this, the decision on whether to make a deposit, and of how much, would be made. 24 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) Taking this into consideration, it would be reasonable to expect a taxpayer to make a deposit to the scheme (for that particular accounting year) at the time of filing their return, provided the return is filed by the return filing due date. This date could potentially be 31 March of the following income year if the taxpayer has an extension of time arrangement. However it may not be possible or practicable for the deposit to be sent in with the return. An example is E-filed returns and it may also take a tax agent sometime to arrange the sending in of the deposit. Therefore a reasonable period of time should be allowed passed the return filing date to enable the deposit to be forwarded to Inland Revenue. The legislation allows one month after the due date for filing a return in the definition of a specified period and this seems a reasonable amount of time in these cases. No deduction will be allowed until the deposit is physically received by Inland Revenue. The return will be reassessed to allow the deduction when the deposit is received. The two following examples illustrate the effect of this practice: Example 3 A taxpayer has a tax agent. For the 2003 income year, the tax agent has an extension of time arrangement till 31 March 2004. The tax return for the taxpayer is filed 31 October 2003. For an income equalisation deposit to be accepted for the 2003 income year, the deposit should be made by 30 November 2003. In the same scenario except for the fact that the return is filed on 1 May 2004, a deposit would need to be paid by 30 April 2004. For taxpayers without extension of time arrangements, deposits in respect of an accounting year will generally be accepted up to the end of the specified period, which is the shorter of 6 months immediately following the end of the accounting year and 1 month after the return is required to be filed. This is illustrated by the following examples: Example 4 A taxpayer with a 30 June 2003 balance date will be required to file their return by 7 October 2003. Any deposit made in respect of that accounting year must be paid by 7 November 2003, which is the shorter of: ï1 month after the return is dueó7 November 2003; and ï6 months from balance dateó31 December 2003. Example 5 A taxpayer with a 30 November 2003 balance date will be required to file their return by, 7 July 2004. Any deposit made in respect of that accounting year must be paid by 31 May 2004, which is the shorter of: ï1 month after the return is dueó7 August 2004; and ï6 months from balance dateó31 May 2004. For taxpayers who do not have a tax agent and require an extension of time to file their income tax return, please refer to Standard Practice Statement RDC-1, Extension of time applications from taxpayers without tax agents. Beyond this, and in line with the principles of the use of a discretion, the Commissioner will consider, on a case by case basis, requests for a deposit for an accounting year after the filing due date, taking into account the merits of the taxpayerís situation and the reasons why the deposit was not made before the required date. Reasons could include but are not limited to incorrect advice from the taxpayerís tax agent or a sudden or unexpected change in circumstances. However these examples are not indicative of situations when a request for a late deposit will automatically be accepted. All factors must be considered and each case will be decided on its own merits. The same principles discussed earlier, as to what is reasonable in relation to when a deposit of income equalisation should be made, equally apply to when an application for refund should be made. Standard Practice The following standard practice has been developed from the same principles. Deposits Taxpayers may make a deposit to the income equalisation scheme for any accounting year at any time during that respective accounting year. A deposit made during the specified period in relation to any accounting year (as defined above) will be deemed to be made in respect of that accounting year. Outside the specified period, the Commissioner will allow a taxpayer to make a deposit for that accounting year by the required date. The required date is the earlier of: ïone month from the date of filing the return of income for that accounting year; or ïone month from the date that the relevant return of income is due to be filed. 25 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) The due date for filing a return includes all extension of time arrangements agreed to by Inland Revenue A taxpayer must elect in writing at the time of making the deposit that the deposit is to be deemed as belonging to the applicable accounting year. A deduction will be allowed for the accounting year in which the deposit is deemed to have been made and once the deposit is physically received by Inland Revenue. Generally, the Commissioner will not accept a deposit for an accounting year after the required date. However, the Commissioner will consider, on a case by case basis, requests after the required date, taking into account the merits of the taxpayerís particular situation and the taxpayerís circumstances and make a decision whether to accept the deposit for the elected accounting year. Deposits made after the required date and not accepted by the Commissioner as applying to the requested accounting year, may still be accepted by the Commissioner and applied to the accounting year in which the deposit is made. The Commissioner will first contact the taxpayer to give them the option of continuing with the deposit or having it refunded back to them. Refunds Generally a refund is deemed to be made in the accounting year in which the application for the refund is received by the Commissioner and the amount of the refund is deemed to be gross income derived in that accounting year. Where an application for a refund is received in the specified period in relation to any accounting year or by the required date any refund made, if the taxpayer so elects, is deemed to have been made in respect of that accounting year and the amount of that refund is deemed to be gross income for that accounting year. The required date is the earlier of: ïone month from the date the return of income for the accounting year is filed; or ïone month from the date the return is due to be filed. The due date for filing a return includes all extension of time arrangements agreed to by Inland Revenue. Generally, the Commissioner will not accept an application for a refund for an elected accounting year after the required date. However, the Commissioner will consider, on a case by case basis, applications made after the required date, taking into account the merits of the taxpayerís particular situation and the taxpayerís circumstances and make a decision whether to accept the application for the refund. Applications for refunds made after the required date and not accepted by the Commissioner as applying to the requested accounting year, may still be accepted by the Commissioner and applied to the accounting year in which the application is made and shall be deemed to be gross income for that accounting year. The Commissioner will first contact the taxpayer to give them the option of continuing with or withdrawing the application for a refund.

DEPRECIATION OF INTANGIBLE PROPERTY CaseTrustees of the CB Simkin Trust and the Trustees in the NC Simkin Trust v CIR Decision date5 March 2003 ActIncome Tax Act 1994 Keywordsdepreciation, trademark, right to use, ownership, intangible property Summary The taxpayersí claims for depreciation of trademarks, while the rights to use were exclusively licensed out, was disallowed on the basis they were not entitled to do so as they did not own the rights to use the trademarks. Facts This was an appeal by the taxpayer from the decision of Young J of the High Court, reported at (2002) 20 NZTC 17,611, wherein the High Court upheld the Commissionerís disallowance of claims by the two trusts for depreciation of intangible property. The issues are the same for both trusts. Each purchased trademark(s) from companies engaged in businesses which used the trademark(s). While the purchases did not include goodwill, they did expressly include ìthe absolute right of useî of the trademarks. Simultaneously, the Trusts licensed the trademark(s) back to the respective vendor companies, granting exclusive rights to use the trademarks for seven years. The Trusts then sold what the Court has termed their ìresidualî rights in the trademarks, with those sales to take effect at the expiration of the seven year licence term. The Trusts then claimed depreciation in the 1996 and 1997 years, in relation to the trademarks, on the basis they were the owners of the trademarks, and inherent in that was the right to use the marks, whereas the licensees had a purely contractual right of use and were not owners. The Commissioner disallowed the claims, on the basis the Trusts were not entitled to claim depreciation as they did not own the right to use the trademarks. Decision In a judgment delivered by Gault P, the Court of Appeal agreed with Young J (High Court decision) and the Commissioner, that it is the owner of depreciable property who is entitled to deduct depreciation, and finding the ownership rights the Trusts sought to depreciate were not the rights to use referred to in item 7 of Schedule 17 of the ITA 94. This was held to be a matter of construction. The Court of Appeal found the specific inclusion (in items 3 (patents) and 6 (copyright in software) of Schedule 17) of the property that may be used as well as the right of use, compared with the other items listed in that Schedule being limited to the right of use, was representative of clear drafting intent and reflected deliberate policy: The right of use, if separate from the patent or copyright, must be a right of someone other than the patent or copyright owneróclearly a licensee. If the right to use were merely that inherent in the ownership of the patent or software copyright there would be no need to specify it separately. The policy behind including the property in some items (such as patent and copyright) and not in others (such as trademarks) is consistent with the view patents and copyright in software have finite useful lives that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty from the date of creation or acquisition (as per the definition of ìdepreciable intangible propertyî in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994). 27 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) The Court dealt with the argument that a licensee cannot own the right of use by considering the right to use land: while the owner of the land has a right of use (subject to the lease), it is not incorrect to describe the lessee as owning the lease. This analogy was extended to intellectual property rights, where a licensee acquires, under a licence, the right of use. The Court held the right to use a trademark in Schedule 17 is the right in fact to use. In this case, the right to use is enjoyed by the licensees, not the licensors (the Trusts), because the rights to use have been granted exclusively to the licensees during the term of the licenses. The Court also upheld the view that trademarks are not property which might reasonably be expected to decline in value (contrary to the definition of ìdepreciable propertyî in section OB 1), being of potentially indefinite duration and tending to increase in value when used. And therefore, would not otherwise be depreciable intangible property. SUPPLY BY UNINCORPORATED BODY Case:TRA 003/02 and TRA 004/02 Decision date:4 April 2003 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1986 Keywords:taxable supply; value of supply, sections 10(3) and 76; deemed supply by unincorporated body, section 57; input tax deductions; section 20(3)(b)(i), requirement to hold tax invoice, section 24. Summary The TRA found Inland Revenue had incorrectly assessed output tax, and wrongly denied an input tax deduction. Facts On 5 February 1986, JCM completed an acknowledgment recording he held the legal title of a commercial building in Auckland (ìProperty 1î) as agent for CI, a syndicate, the members of which were himself as to a 50% share, his wife as to a 33 1/3% share and the family trust as to a 16.67% share. Property 1 was sold in 1991. In 1992 and 1993 respectively, JCM became registered proprietor of two more commercial buildings in Auckland (ìProperty 2î and ìProperty 3î). No further acknowledgments were completed, but it was common ground that JCM, his wife and the family trust owned Property 2 and Property 3 in the same stated shares. For GST purposes, CI was registered as an unincorporated body pursuant to section 57 of the Act, and accounted for GST on rents as required. The case is concerned with the correct GST treatment of a transaction by which the interests of JCM and his wife in Property 2 and Property 3 were transferred to the family trust. The transaction took place in two stages. First Stage ñ Transfer 5 October 1997 The first stage of the transaction was evidenced by a transfer dated 5 October 1997, by which JCM transferred a 33.33% share to his wife and a 16.67% share to PJM and JM, the trustees of the family trust, for a consideration of one peppercorn. Second Stage ñ Agreements and Transfers dated 22 May 1998 The second stage involved two parallel transactions. Under the first, JCM entered an agreement for sale and purchase with the trustees of the family trust. The agreement is dated 22 May 1998. 28 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) Under the agreement, JCM sold his 50% share in Property 2 and Property 3 for $615,000. The agreed settlement date was 30 January 1998, ie a date four months before the agreement was entered into. The purchase price was to be satisfied by an executed first mortgage over the one half share in Property 2 and Property 3. JCM also executed a transfer by which he transferred his 50% share to the trustees for a consideration of $615,000. The mortgage was dated 30 July 1998. Under the second transaction, JCMís wife entered an agreement with the trustees for sale and purchase of her 33.33% share in Property 2 and Property 3 for $410,000. In all other respects this transaction was identical. Both JCM and his wife executed a transfer dated 22 May 1998 transferring their respective interests to the family trust. The transactions were not documented so as to comply with the old section 11(1)(c) of the Act. If they had been, the parties could have agreed to treat the second stage of the transactions as zero-rated. Taxpayerís GST Treatment JCM and his wife were unregistered persons, and treated the transactions as supplies of secondhand goods. CI did not account for output tax. The family trust claimed an input tax credit in its taxable period ended 31 January 1998. The Assessments Inland Revenue assessed CI with output tax, and applied a shortfall penalty of 100% for taking an abusive tax position. Inland Revenue declined to reopen the family trust GST return for the period ended 31 January 1998 to allow the input tax credit. It did this on two grounds. The first was that under section 20(3)(b)(i), a deduction can only be made by payments-based taxpayers to the extent a payment has been made during that taxable period. In this case, no payment was made until 30 July 1998 at the earliest, being the date of the mortgage. The second ground was that no tax invoice was held at the time the claim was made. It was not disputed by Inland Revenue that an input tax credit would be allowable in a subsequent taxable period, once these two requirements were complied with. Decision AAP Willy (ìthe TRAî) heard a challenge to the output tax assessment and shortfall penalties assessment by CI, and a challenge by the family trust to the denial of its input tax credit. Both proceedings were heard together. The TRA found the output tax assessment was wrong. He also found at paragraph 65 of the decision that the sale of the vendorís interest was a supply of secondhand goods, so an input tax credit cannot be denied on the grounds a tax invoice was not held. The TRA also found against the Commissionerís alleged argument that there was no payment for the GST period under review: paragraph 97. The actual argument was that there was no payment in the taxable period in which the input was claimed, and therefore section 20(3)(b)(i) prohibits the deduction. It followed from the finding that the supply was a supply of secondhand goods that the TRA also found that JCM and his wife as unregistered persons were not required to supply a tax invoice under section 24. Accordingly, the TRA found the family trust is entitled to receive the input tax credit, and in his view, no question of a shortfall penalty to CI arises. Inland Revenue Comment on Decision Inland Revenue considers the decision fails to determine a number of key issues. Firstly, there is no finding as to whether the transfer dated 5 October 1997 constitutes a supply for goods and services tax purposes. This was a crucial step in resolving the problem. Inland Revenue considers the transfer does not make a supply for goods and services tax purposes, because the transferees already owned the stated shares in the land in equity. If the TRA had found a supply was made, then Inland Revenue raised two alternative provisions, section 10(3) and section 76 of the Act which Inland Revenue considers independently require the conclusion that any such supply must be valued at open market value. On one view, it is possible to conclude the TRA did find a supply was made pursuant to the 5 October transfer, because paragraph 72 of the decision refers to that transfer as evidencing a sale. In that case, it was essential to determine whether or not section 10(3) of the Act applied, but the TRA did not consider this issue at all. It is also noted there are problems with the view that the TRA did make a finding that the transfer amounts to a supply. For instance, paragraph 72 refers to the transfer of 5 October 1997 being a transfer from JCM and his wife when it was only a transfer from JCM, thus raising the possibility that the TRA really intended to refer to the two transfers dated 22 May 1998, which were from JCM and his wife as stated. If this latter view is correct, the position remains that the TRA has made no finding on whether the 5 October transfer amounts to a supply. 29 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) The TRA did make a finding that section 76 of the Act does not apply. The TRA found the setting-up of the family trust in 1965, which purchased the two properties in 1998, and the execution of the acknowledgment dated 5 February 1986 was not part of an arrangement to avoid tax. Unfortunately, this was not the basis on which Inland Revenue asserts section 76 of the Act applied. The omission of the TRA to determine whether or not a supply was made for goods and services tax purposes pursuant to the transfer dated 5 October 1997 leaves it unclear whether section 76 of the Act was even relevant, as Inland Revenue only relied on section 10(3) and section 76 of the Act as alternative arguments. If the TRA had found the transfer dated 5 October 1997 does not create or evidence a supply for goods and services tax purposes, Inland Revenue contended the sale of the interests in the two buildings by JCM and his wife is a deemed supply by CI, the unincorporated body, pursuant to section 57(2)(b) of the Act. The TRA decision fails to determine whether or not section 57 of the Act applied. Under section 57(2)(b), any supply made in the course of carrying on the taxable activity of a body is deemed made by the body, in this case the syndicate. Under section 6(2), anything done in connection with the commencement or termination of a taxable activity is deemed to be carried out in the course of that taxable activity. On this basis, Inland Revenue contends that the supply of the interests of JCM and his wife to the family trust, was a taxable supply by the body. It is not a supply of second hand goods by JCM and his wife, both unregistered persons. Accordingly, it was submitted CI must return output tax on the transaction. The TRA finds at paragraph 87 that the syndicate CI made no taxable supplies to the trustees of the family trust, but the TRA does not address the deemed supply provision (section 57(2)(b)). The omission to address section 57(2)(b) led to a further finding, this time in respect of the challenge by the family trust, which Inland Revenue considers to be incorrect. The finding was that the supply was made by JCM and his wife, and as unregistered persons they are not required to supply a tax invoice under section 24. The TRA also failed to consider and determine the Inland Revenue argument that section 20(3)(b)(i) of the Act applied to prevent the input tax deduction. Inland Revenue has filed an appeal against the decision to the High Court. ASSESSMENTS ISSUED UNLAWFULLY? TIME BAR ISSUE CaseVela Fishing Limited v CIR Decision date14 April 2003 ActIncome Tax Act 1976 Tax Administration Act 1994 KeywordsTime bar, transitional provisions, repealed provisions Summary The CIR was successful: this judgment confirms the Court of Appeal decision (CIR v Vela Fishing Limited \[2002\] 1 NZLR 49) which allowed the CIRís appeal from the adverse High Court decision of Penlington J (Vela Fishing Limited v CIR \[2001\] 1 NZLR 437). Facts The taxpayer was subject to an audit. In February 1998 the 31 March time bar was approaching for the 1991 year. The taxpayer signed a waiver, extending time to 30 September 1998. Inland Revenue reassessed on 30 September 1998. The taxpayer then contended that the waiver was ineffective and so the assessment was out of time. Decision There was only one judgment, delivered by Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe. The Board held that section 227(4) TAA required the reference to the 1994 time bar provision (section 108 TAA) in section 108B TAA (the provision authorising waivers) to be read as also a reference to the 1976 time bar provision (section 25 ITA 76). Therefore the waiver extended the period for the CIR to assess in this case. Their Lordships found this for two different reasons: ïFirst, at paragraphs 16 and 17, the new version of section 108 TAA (as substituted for the original in 1996) was a ìcorresponding provisionî (as that term is employed in section 227(4) TAA) to section 25 ITA 76. The Court of Appeal was right to follow Winter v Ministry of Transport \[1972\] NZLR 539 in so deciding. ïSecond, at paragraph 18, that section 108B (the provision authorising waivers) applied in terms to both old and new versions of section 108 TAA. Old section 108 TAA was certainly a ìcorresponding provisionî to section 25 ITA 76 (it is virtually identical, apart from some modest ìplain Englishî changes). 30 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) Their Lordships also dealt shortly with two of the Appellantís arguments. Vela had argued that the CIRís case raised the status of section 277(4) TAA from a transitional provision to an amending provision. At paragraph 18 the Board consider that is an incomplete analysis. Section 227(4) remains a classic transitional provision. But its function is to extend the scope of current legislation to include past (and not dissimilar) provisions dealing with the same subject matter. The relevant amendment was section 108B TAA, and section 227(4) TAA simply extended its operation to the ITA 76. Vela had also argued that even while the four-year pre-time bar period was running, it had a contingent right to a time bar, and should not be deprived of that right without clear words. At paragraph 19 the Board said that Vela could not sensibly be described as having any sort of right to a time bar while the four-year period was running. Moreover, it was not the amending provision that prevented Vela from obtaining the benefit of the time bar on 31 March 1998; it was Velaís own decision to sign a waiver. ìSection 108B is a benefit and not a burden to taxpayersî. Costs (now to be agreed, or failing agreement, set by the Board) to the CIR. 31 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) ìÖ obviously there is a debate at the moment about the import or otherwise of the Treaty into statute law, but there is no reference to the Treaty or room for its implication in the taxation statutes, and since it has not been incorporated by statute, therefore the submission is not validî As far as sovereignty was concerned, his Honour noted that the argument had been raised many times before and referred to the decision of Penlington J in Warren v Police 9 February 2000, High Court Hamilton AP 133/99, as setting out the relevant principles: ïParliament is empowered to make legislation. ïActs of Parliament do not derive authority from the Treaty or the earlier Declaration of Independence. ïActs of Parliament are binding on both M‰ori and Pakeha. ïCourts are subservient to Parliament. ïCourts have no authority to go behind such Acts and enquire as to how they were made. Berkett v Tauranga District Court \[1992\] 3 NZLR 206. The Court then clearly had jurisdiction, and a duty to deal with the present application. Mr Rupe referred to a number of scriptural quotations purporting to exempt Christians from the ìlaw of the landî. The Commissioner (having noted that several of Christís followers were tax collectors), referred to Luke 20:22 where certain provocateurs asked Christ whether they ought pay taxes to Caesar. Judge Thomas repeated Christís answer: ìRender therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesarís and to God the things that are Godís.î The Commissioner has indicated to the Court that he will receive an application for relief from Mr Rupe if he is able to demonstrate ìhardshipî in terms of sections 176,177 TAA 94. SOVEREIGNTY ARGUMENTS CaseCIR v P W Rupe Decision date15 April 2003 ActGoods and Services Tax Act, Tax Administration Act. KeywordsSovereignty, tax, Parliament, taxpayer, resident, name, M‰ori. Summary The taxpayer opposed the Commissionerís action to recover a GST debt. He claimed immunity from the operation of the taxing statutes (and all other laws of New Zealand). The District Court held that the taxpayer was a New Zealand resident and referred to established authority regarding similar sovereignty arguments. Facts The Commissioner commenced proceedings for the recovery of GST amounts owing by the defendant Mr Rupe. The assessments in question were based on GST returns submitted by Mr Rupe. The original sum for which judgment was sought was $17,986. Since proceedings were commenced in February 2000, the addition of penalties and interest has increased the claim to $33,007.83. Mr Rupe originally filed a statement of defence and counterclaim. The counterclaim was dismissed by the Court. Mr Rupe also sought to strike out the CIRís claim and that was also dismissed. The basis of both applications and the defendantís defence in the present hearing was that of jurisdiction; Mr Rupe claimed not to be subject to New Zealandís taxing statutes by virtue of the Treaty of Waitangi, M‰ori sovereignty, the Bill of Rights (unspecified), and his status as a Christian. Various other arguments such as whether the CIR addressed him by his proper name, were also canvassed. Decision His Honour Judge IB Thomas dispensed with most of the defendantís arguments by reference to the precedents of New Zealand Courts set out in CIRís submissions. The ìnot a taxpayerî argument had been raised and dismissed by the High Court in Boyton v CIR \[2002\] 20 NZTC 17,615. ìI adopt the reasoning in that decision. It is clear that Ö the defendant is resident in New Zealand, and he has derived income in New Zealand, and he is a taxpayerî Regarding the impact of the Treaty of Waitangi on the tax acts, his Honour noted that: 32 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) NEW LEGISLATION TAXATION (MƒORI ORGANISATIONS, TAXPAYER COMPLIANCE AND MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) ACT TAXATION (ANNUAL RATES OF INCOME TAX 2002-03) ACT 2003 STUDENT LOAN SCHEME AMENDMENT ACT 2003 CHILD SUPPORT AMENDMENT ACT 2003 The Taxation (Annual Rates, M‰ori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill was introduced into Parliament on 14 May 2002, receiving its first reading on 22 May 2002 and its second reading on 4 March 2003. The bill was split into four at the Committee stage of proceedings, and the resulting bills passed their final stages on 25 March 2003. They received Royal assent on 26 March 2003. The four new Acts amend the Income Tax Act 1994, Tax Administration Act 1994, Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, Income Tax Act 1976, Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2001, Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002, Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 and Child Support Act 1991. the Board of M‰ori Affairs, the M‰ori Trustee, the M‰ori land boards, special statutory trusts (such as the East Coast Commissioner) and various land trusts under the M‰ori land legislation. Although the rules were largely concerned with the taxation of income from M‰ori land, they also applied to any income earned by an organisation that administered property, income or reserves in trust for the benefit of M‰ori. Thus the essential character of all the organisations covered by the term ìM‰ori authorityî was that of trustee for the individual members. The 1939 rules were replaced in 1952 as a result of the recommendations of a Commission of Inquiry. The Commission had been established to ascertain whether certain M‰ori farming operations were fully complying with their tax obligations and whether the law on this could be made clearer. Before the review that led to the recent changes, this was the last time the M‰ori authority rules were reviewed. Over time the 1952 rules became outdated. They did not mesh well with current tax law, involved considerable complexity and cost for contemporary M‰ori authorities and their members, and in some cases double taxed M‰ori authority income. There were claims that the M‰ori authority rules hindered M‰ori economic and social development, and over the years there were repeated calls from various M‰ori groups for them to be reviewed. In August 2001 the government released the discussion document Taxation of M‰ori Organisations, which contained policy options for modernising the M‰ori authority tax rules and simplifying the personal income tax requirements for individuals who derive benefits from these organisations. Public submissions generally supported replacing the previous rules (which were based NEW RULES FOR MƒORI AUTHORITIES New Parts HI and MK and other sections of the Income Tax Act 1994, and various sections of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction Amendments to the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 modernise the specific tax rules that apply to M‰ori authorities and to individuals who derive distributions from them. These changes represent the most significant reform of tax law affecting M‰ori organisations since 1952. The new rules share many features of the company imputation rules. They will relieve much of the unnecessary complexity and restrictions that the previous M‰ori authority rules imposed, and will remove the potential for M‰ori authority income to be double taxed. They will apply only to eligible entities that elect to be M‰ori authorities. Twelve types of eligible entities are listed in the Act on the basis that they manage communally owned assets whose ownership and administration are subject to certain statutory restrictions or government processes. Background The first specific tax rules for M‰ori authorities appeared in 1939. These rules were intended to apply to the various ìworkingî organisations that administered large blocks of farmland owned in common by M‰ori (and not in private ownership). These organisations were the first to become known as M‰ori authorities. They included 33 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) on a dividend deduction model) with an imputation model similar to company imputation. A possible final tax model was rejected because of its potential for under-taxation and over-taxation and inability to correct these discrepancies. Once it was established that there was a continued need for specific rules for M‰ori authorities, the issue of the appropriate tax rate to apply to the income of M‰ori authorities arose. The tax rate issue was not canvassed in the discussion document. Instead, when the bill giving effect to the current legislation was introduced it proposed that M‰ori authorities should be subject to a tax rate of 19.5% (reduced from 25%), matching the statutory tax rate of the vast majority of M‰ori authority members. The government review that led to these changes involved consultation through the generic tax policy process, which in this case required a significant level of consultation with the M‰ori community. Key features The main provisions giving effect to the new M‰ori authority rules are contained in new Parts HI and MK. The new rules incorporate and mirror many of the provisions relating to company imputation and provide that: ïThe income of M‰ori authorities will be taxed in the year the authority earns it, at an income tax rate of 19.5%. (Schedule 1, Part A, clause 2). ïThe tax paid by or on behalf of M‰ori authorities will be credited to an account known as the ìM‰ori authority credit accountî and this tax will give rise to M‰ori authority credits. (New Part MK). ïM‰ori authorities will be able to attach these credits to ìtaxable distributionsî they pay to their members. (New sections HI 4 and HI 5). ïM‰ori authority members can then use these credits to offset their own individual tax liabilities (new section HI 7). Any unused credits will be refunded to the recipient members who are New Zealand resident for tax purposes (new section LD 3B). Definition of ìM‰ori authorityî The definition of ìM‰ori authorityî is provided for in new sections HI 2 and HI 3, and section OB 1. The definition gives certain entities the choice of applying the M‰ori authority rules or the general tax rules, depending on their entity type. Section HI 2 contains a list of persons who are eligible to make an effective election to apply the new M‰ori authority provisions. The list of ìeligible personsî is limited to trustees of trusts and companies that manage communally owned assets whose ownership and administration are subject to certain statutory restrictions or government processes. Thus an eligible person cannot be an individual, an unincorporated body (other than a trustee of a trust), or a corporate body that is not subject to the specified restrictions or processes. Section HI 3 sets out the requirements that an eligible person must satisfy in order to make an effective election. An eligible person that does not elect to apply the M‰ori authority rules will be required to apply the general tax rules that are applicable to its entity type. Entities that are currently taxed as M‰ori authorities will need to make an election to be a M‰ori authority from the 2004-05 income year if they are eligible and wish to apply the new rules. Taxation of M‰ori authority distributions Under new sections HI 4 and HI 5, M‰ori authorities can make taxable distributions and non-taxable distributions. Taxable distributions can have M‰ori authority credits attached (new section MK 6), or can have resident withholding tax deducted from them if they are not fully credited (new section NF 8B). Non-taxable distributions cannot have credits attached, nor will they be subject to resident withholding tax. Maintaining a ìM‰ori authority credit accountî M‰ori authorities will be required to establish and maintain a ìM‰ori authority credit accountî in accordance with the rules set out in new Part MK. This account will operate in a similar way to the imputation credit account that companies are required to operate and will be subject to similar rules. Like the imputation credit account, the balance in the M‰ori authority credit account determines the level of credits that M‰ori authorities may attach to taxable distributions they pay to their members. Anti-streaming rules for distributions and credits M‰ori authorities will be subject to anti-streaming rules similar to those that apply to companies that operate imputation credit accounts. These rules are necessary to deal with potential problems relating to ìstreamingî of M‰ori authority distributions or tax credits to members. (New sections GC 27B, HI 6 and MK 7). Transitional rules for movements in and out of the M‰ori authority rules New sections HI 8 and HI 9 provide transitional rules for trusts and companies electing to be or ceasing to be M‰ori authorities. They ensure that when companies or trusts enter or exit the M‰ori authority rules no additional tax consequences will arise. 34 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) Removing the ìM‰ori authority exclusionî from the definition of ìcompanyî The definition of ìcompanyî in section OB 1 has been amended to remove the M‰ori authority exclusion. Effectively, this amendment allows M‰ori authorities whose legal form is that of a company to be taxed as M‰ori authorities under new Part HI and also to apply certain income tax provisions that relate to companies. New section HI 1(2) limits the circumstances in which corporate M‰ori authorities can avail themselves of the company provisions that relate to loss grouping, amalgamations, consolidation and co-operative companies. The general rule is that unless otherwise stated, the company provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 apply to corporate M‰ori authorities. The definition of ìcontinuity provisionsî in section OB 1 has been amended so that corporate M‰ori authorities (not trusts) will be required to satisfy the shareholder continuity tests in situations that require the measuring of a shareholderís economic interests in M‰ori authorities. For example, this test will need to be satisfied in relation to maintaining the M‰ori authority credit account. Specific agent rules of the M‰ori Trustee The specific agent tax rules applying to the M‰ori Trustee, which were contained in section HK 14, have been repealed. New section HI 2 includes in the list of eligible persons, the M‰ori Trustee in its capacity as agent for owners of land subject to the Te Ture Whenua M‰ori Act 1993 (M‰ori Land Act 1993). Donations deduction for M‰ori authorities Section DI 2 has been amended to allow M‰ori authorities to take deductions for gifts of money to organisations with ìapproved donee statusî or to M‰ori associations. Previously, the deduction was permitted only for gifts of money to M‰ori associations. To qualify for ìapproved donee statusî an organisation must be established for charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand or must be specifically listed in section KC 5. Application date The new M‰ori authority rules generally apply from the 2004-05 income year. The extension to the specific donations deduction for M‰ori authorities applies from the 2003-04 income year. Detailed analysis Clarifying the operation of the M‰ori authority rules ñ section HI 1(1) Section HI 1(1) states that all provisions relating to M‰ori authorities in the Income Tax Act are subject to new Part HI. Section HI 1(2) clarifies the circumstances in which corporate M‰ori authorities may use the loss grouping, amalgamation, consolidation and co-operative company rules. (See discussion on Removal of the M‰ori authority exclusion in the definition of ìcompanyî.) New definition of ìM‰ori authorityî ñ sections HI 2, HI 3 and OB 1 Section OB 1 defines a ìM‰ori authorityî to mean a person who has made an effective election under section HI 3. 1 List of ìeligible personsî Section HI 2 contains a list of persons that are eligible to make an effective election under section HI 3: M‰ori incorporations 2 are included in the eligibility criteria under paragraph (a), and ahuwhenua trusts, kai tiaki trusts, putea trusts, whanau trusts and whenua topu trusts are included in the eligibility criteria under paragraph (b). These organisations are constituted by orders made by the M‰ori Land Court under Te Ture Whenua M‰ori Act 1993 (also known as the M‰ori Land Act 1993). Companies or trusts that own land subject to Te Ture Whenua M‰ori Act 1993 may also be eligible entities. The other eligible entities are established under specific legislation or as part of Treaty of Waitangi settlement processes. The list identifies those organisations that are eligible to apply the new M‰ori authority rules. It provides greater certainty for organisations seeking M‰ori authority tax status and also removes the ambiguity caused by archaic and confusing terminology that was used in the language of the previous definition of ìM‰ori authorityî. The list approach also ensures that the specific tax rules are confined to those organisations that encounter the constraints and restrictions that justify the continuation of the specific tax framework. 1 The legislation as enacted refers to a non-existent reference to section HI IC but it should refer to section HI 3. The error is expected to be corrected in a future bill. 2 Some M‰ori incorporations were established by Order in Council under the M‰ori Reserved Lands Act 1955. Their status has been preserved under Te Ture Whenua M‰ori Act 1993. 35 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) HI 2 Eligibility to be M‰ori authority The following persons are eligible to be a M‰ori authority: (a) a company that is established by an order made under Te Ture Whenua M‰ori Act 1993 (M‰ori Land Act 1993): (b) the trustees of a trust that is established by an order made under Te Ture Whenua M‰ori Act 1993 (M‰ori Land Act 1993): (c) a company that owns land that is subject to Te Ture Whenua M‰ori Act 1993 (M‰ori Land Act 1993): (d) the trustees of a trust who own land that is subject to Te Ture Whenua M‰ori Act 1993 (M‰ori Land Act 1993): (e) the M‰ori Trustee in the M‰ori Trusteeí capacity as an agent for an owner of land that is subject to Te Ture Whenua M‰ori Act 1993 (M‰ori Land Act 1993): (f)a M‰ori Trust Board, as defined in section 2 of the M‰ori Trust Boards Act 1955: (g) the Crown Forestry Rental Trust, established by deed in accordance with section 34 of the Crown Forest Assets Act 1989: (h) the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission, established under the M‰ori Fisheries Act 1989: (i)a company that, on behalf of beneficiaries under the Deed of Settlement between the Crown and M‰ori dated the 23 rd day of September 1992, receives and manages assets that are distributed to the company by the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission: (j)the trustees of a trust who, on behalf of beneficiaries under the Deed of Settlement between the Crown and M‰ori dated the 23 rd day of September 1992, receive and manage assets that are distributed to the trustees by the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission: (k) a company tható (i) on behalf of M‰ori claimants, receives and manages assets that are transferred by the Crown as part of the settlement of a claim under the Treaty of Waitangi; and (ii) is contemplated by the deed of settlement of the claim as performing the functions referred to in subparagraph (i): (l)the trustees of a trust whoó (i) on behalf of M‰ori claimants, receive and manage assets that are transferred by the Crown as part of the settlement of a claim under the Treaty of Waitangi; and (ii) are contemplated by the deed of settlement of the claim as performing the functions referred to in subparagraph (i). Entities that are excluded from the list but which may be eligible to apply the M‰ori authority rules will need to approach the government and seek to be added to the list. This will allow the government to assess whether a person satisfies the policy criteria to be taxed as a M‰ori authority. The process for seeking to be added to the list of eligible persons is still being finalised. Election requirements to be a M‰ori authority ïSection HI 3(1) to (4) set out the rules that an eligible person must comply with in order to elect to be a M‰ori authority: ïAn eligible person must give an election notice to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue stating that it wishes to make an election to be a M‰ori authority. ïIf the Commissioner accepts the election notice, the Commissioner must give to the eligible person a notice accepting the election. ïAn election will take effect from the date advised in the notice from the Commissioner accepting the election. ïAn election will cease when the eligible person either gives notice to the Commissioner that the election is cancelled or no longer meets the criteria set out in section HI 2, whichever occurs earlier. ïAn election is required to be made only by those eligible persons that wish to be a M‰ori authority. If an eligible person chooses not to make an election its tax treatment will be determined under the general tax rules according to its entity type. 36 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) Section HI 3(5) provides that a person will cease to be a M‰ori authority at the end of the 2003-04 income year unless that person: ïis an eligible person at the beginning of the 2004-05 income year; and ïgives to the Commissioner a notice of an election to become a M‰ori authority, which the Commissioner accepts at or before the end of the 2004-05 income year. This election process should provide sufficient time for M‰ori authorities to properly consider whether or not they wish to enter the new rules in the 2004-05 income year. It is also flexible enough to deal with cases when an organisation becomes eligible to be a M‰ori authority part-way through an income year but did not exist before the beginning of the income year. In this case, provided the Commissioner agrees, the election may take place in respect of the income year in which the person becomes eligible to be a M‰ori authority. This will avoid the problem of taxpayers being taxed according to two sets of tax rules in respect of the same income year. Taxation of M‰ori authority distributions ñ sections HI 4, HI 5 and OB 1 Definition of ìdistributionî Section HI 4(1) defines the term ìdistributionî for the purposes of the M‰ori authority rules. ìDistributionî means all sums in money that are paid, credited or advanced by a M‰ori authority for the benefit of one of its members. The term also includes property transfers between M‰ori authorities and their members to the extent that the consideration paid does not equal the true value of the property. The definition should accommodate the wide range of financial and non-financial benefits that M‰ori authorities provide to their members. Because of the wide nature of the definition of ìdistributionî, it will be possible for M‰ori authority members to receive both a dividend payment (if the authority is a M‰ori incorporation) and an education scholarship or some other assistance grant. Even so, section HI 4(2) clarifies that if a distribution would otherwise be a ìdividendî in the hands of a member it must be regarded as a ìdistributionî to the member instead, unless it is an exempt dividend under section CB 10. Definition of a ìmemberî of a M‰ori authority The definition of a ìmemberî in section OB 1 has been amended for the purposes of the M‰ori authority rules to mean a person or a group of persons who are shareholders of a M‰ori authority (if the authority is a company); or beneficiaries of a M‰ori authority (if the authority is a trust). Taxable distributions and non-taxable distributions M‰ori authorities will be able to make two types of distributions: taxable distributions and non-taxable distributions. A ìtaxable M‰ori authority distributionî is a distribution that is made from: ïgross income of the authority derived in the 2004-05 or subsequent income year, and ïgross income of the authority that is not exempt from tax. Section HI 5 deems a taxable M‰ori authority distribution to be gross income of the M‰ori authority member. This means that M‰ori authority members that meet the return filing requirements must include this income in their tax returns or personal tax summaries at the end of the year. It follows from the definition of ìtaxable M‰ori authority distributionî that a non-taxable distribution is a distribution of: ïincome earned under the previous rules (before the 2004-05 income year); ïincome that is exempt from tax in the hands of the authority irrespective of when it arose, or ïtax-paid income sources to which section HI 8 applies. Section HI 8 provides that when companies elect to be M‰ori authorities, subsequent distributions of retained earnings (which represent the companyís accumulated tax paid income) will constitute non-taxable distributions. Similarly, when trusts elect to be M‰ori authorities, any distributions of trustee income (which the trust derived before becoming a M‰ori authority) will be treated as non-taxable distributions. Non-taxable distributions are exempt from tax in the hands of M‰ori authority members. Table 1 summarises the tax consequences of distributions made from various income sources derived in the pre-reform and post reform periods. 37 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) Table 1: Tax consequences of M‰ori authority distributions Distributions made from:Derived in the 2003-04 or earlierDerived in the 2004-05 or subsequent income year - Pre-reformincome year - Post-reform Tax exempt income of the authorityNon-taxable distribution to memberNon-taxable distribution to member Taxable income of the authorityNon-taxable distribution to memberTaxable M‰ori authority distribution M‰ori authority credits ñ sections KC 1(4), HI 7, LB 1(1), LD 3B and OB 1 Section HI 7 provides that the gross income of M‰ori authority members includes the value of a M‰ori authority credit attached to a taxable M‰ori authority distribution. Section OB 1 defines ìM‰ori authority creditî to mean the amount attached to a distribution by a M‰ori authority in accordance with section MK 6 or treated as being attached to the distribution under section NF 8B. Section NF 8F deems the resident withholding tax deductions made from taxable M‰ori authority distributions to be M‰ori authority credits. For discussion on the resident withholding tax implications of taxable M‰ori authority distributions see ìApplication of the resident withholding tax rules ñ Part NFî, later in this article. Determining M‰ori authority credits in certain circumstances Amendments to section LB 1 provide for the determination of an amount of M‰ori authority credit in certain circumstances: ïSection LB 1(1)(eb) determines the level of credit when the M‰ori authority credit attached to a distribution has a base ratio greater than the maximum base ratio. In this case, the credit is equal to the maximum base ratio computed under section MK 7. ïSection LB 1(1)(m) determines the level of credit when the M‰ori authority credit has been determined to be part of an arrangement to obtain a tax advantage under section GC 27B. In this case, the credit is equal to the amount of the credit which remains after it is reduced by the amount referred to in section GC 27B(6)(b). ïSection LB 1(3) determines the level of credit in relation to a beneficiary of a trust who derives a dividend with a M‰ori authority credit attached. In this case the credit is equal to the amount calculated in accordance with the formula in section LB 1(1)(a) 3 . M‰ori authority credits refundable New section LD 3B ensures that M‰ori authority members are able to claim a credit of tax of an amount equal to the M‰ori authority credits attached to taxable M‰ori authority distributions. This is so even if a member derives income that is exempt under section CB 4(1). If the credit more than satisfies the memberís income tax obligations, that member is entitled to a refund of any surplus credits under section MD 1 and under the Tax Administration Act 1994. Low-income rebate An amendment to section KC 1(4) ensures that taxable M‰ori authority distributions received by M‰ori authority members are taken into account in the calculation of income for the purposes of determining the low-income rebate. Anti-streaming rules for distributions ñ sections GC 27B, HI 6 and MK 7 M‰ori authorities will be able to make distributions from either taxable or non-taxable sources. Therefore it is possible that, since most members may benefit more from a non-taxable distribution, a M‰ori authority might wish to direct its income from non-taxable sources to those members best able to use them. This is known as ìstreamingî. The risk here is that, for tax purposes, some members might be treated more favourably than others unless safeguards are in place to mitigate this risk. For example, a M‰ori authority proposes to grant two scholarships as part of its education scholarship programme. The funding for this initiative comes from both taxable and non-taxable sources. A member on a 33% tax rate will pay no further tax if he or she receives a non-taxable distribution. However, if the member receives a taxable distribution, there will be further tax to pay. To address this potential streaming issue, section HI 6 provides that when a distribution is made to members, all recipients will be treated as having received a proportionate share of the taxable or tax-exempt amounts distributed. This rule aims to ensure parity among recipient members while allowing M‰ori authorities to continue to make distributions from different sources. For example, if a M‰ori authority distributes education scholarship money, the successful recipients must receive a proportionate share of any taxable or tax-exempt amounts available for distribution. 3 A consequential amendment to section LB 1(1)(a) has not been made to reflect the fact that it now applies to M‰ori authority credits. The error is expected to be corrected in a future bill. 38 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) Section GC 27B provides an anti-avoidance rule to deal with streaming that forms part of an arrangement to obtain a tax advantage. This is similar to the rule for imputation streaming. The definitions of ìtax advantageî, ìtax credit advantageî and ìaccount advantageî in section OB 1 have been consequentially amended to reflect the insertion of new section GC 27B. Section MK 7 will require that every taxable M‰ori authority distribution is attributed with M‰ori authority credits at the same level, unless the authority advises the Commissioner that the distribution is not being credited at a different level as part of an arrangement to obtain a tax advantage. Transitional rules for companies and trusts electing to be or ceasing to be a M‰ori authority ñ sections HI 8 and HI 9 and Table HI 8 As previously mentioned, companies and trusts may choose to apply the general tax rules, if they meet the requirements of those rules, at any time from the beginning of the 2004-05 income year. Accordingly, they will need to consider what rules will regulate their exit or entry from the M‰ori authority rules. These transitional rules are set out in section HI 8 and Table HI 8. They are designed to ensure that eligible persons moving into or out of the M‰ori authority rules will not be subject to any additional tax consequences. For example, if a company becomes a M‰ori authority, the company must apply row 1 of Table HI 8. The tax consequence of this change means that the company must cease to be an imputation credit account company and the rules relating to a company ceasing to be an imputation credit account company will apply. When the company makes any subsequent distributions from its retained earnings, accumulated profits or capital reserves such distributions will not be treated as taxable M‰ori authority distributions. Companies or trusts re-entering the M‰ori authority rules Section HI 9 deals with situations where a company or a trust re-enters the M‰ori authority rules. The purpose of this provision is to treat the trust or company as realising its assets at market value and subsequently re-acquiring them at market value. This measure ensures that before a company or trust re-enters the M‰ori authority rules, any tax liability on property such as trading stock is incurred at the company or the trust tax rate. For depreciation purposes, however, the cost of the property is the lower of the market value of the property on the deemed acquisition date or the original cost of the property to the company or the trust. This rule ensures that the M‰ori authority does not receive an uplift in the base price of the property for depreciation purposes. For example, if a trust ceases to be M‰ori authority and then subsequently elects to become a M‰ori authority again, the trust must apply row 6 of Table 8. The tax consequence of this change is that market value calculations must be made in accordance with section HI 9 and the trust must also apply row 2 of Table 8. If a M‰ori authority company has elected out of the M‰ori authority rules to amalgamate and then the amalgamated company elects to be a M‰ori authority again, it is treated as re-entering the M‰ori authority rules and must apply section HI 9. The tax consequence of this change is prescribed by row 5 of Table 8. Allowing M‰ori authorities to re-enter the M‰ori authority tax rules provides flexibility for governing boards and trusts to cope with changes in the nature of a M‰ori authorityís operations over time. This measure also means that M‰ori authorities can avoid the costs associated with winding up the authority and reconstituting a new entity. M‰ori authority credit account ñ new Part MK New Part MK governs the operation of the M‰ori authority credit account and is largely modelled on the existing imputation credit account provisions. M‰ori authorities required to maintain a ìM‰ori authority credit accountî ñ section MK 1 Unless otherwise excluded, M‰ori authorities are required to establish and maintain a M‰ori authority credit account for each imputation year or specified period. ìImputation yearî is defined in section OB 1 as the period from 1 April to the following 31 March. M‰ori authorities with non-standard balance dates are required to operate the account on a 1 April to 31 March basis. Under section MK 1(2), some M‰ori authorities will not be required to operate a M‰ori authority credit account. They are: ïa M‰ori authority whose constitution prohibits distributions of any kind being made to any shareholder or beneficiary of the authority, and ïa M‰ori authority that solely derives exempt income (other than exempt dividend income under sections CB 10 and CZ 4). Account balances ñ sections MK 2 and MK 3 All M‰ori authorities that operate a M‰ori authority credit account must record as their opening balance on 1 April in each year the amount of the closing balance as at the previous 31 March. The opening balance as at 1 April 2004 will be nil. 39 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) Table HI 8 Row Ifbecomesthen 1a companya M‰ori authority(a) the company ceases to be an imputation credit account company and the rules relating to a company ceasing to be an imputation credit account company apply; and (b) retained earnings, accumulated profits and capital reserves are treated as an amount from which may be made a distribution that is not a taxable M‰ori authority distribution. 2a trusta M‰ori authoritytrustee income is treated as an amount from which may be made a distribution that is not a taxable M‰ori authority distribution. 3a M‰ori authoritya company that(a) the M‰ori authority may transfer a credit balance in the M‰ori is not a M‰oriauthority credit account to the companyís imputation credit Authorityaccount, and section MK 8 applies in respect of a debit balance in the M‰ori authority credit account; and (b) taxable income derived by the M‰ori authority in the 2003-04 or an earlier income year is available subscribed capital. 4a M‰ori authoritya trust that is nottaxable income derived by the M‰ori authority in the 2003-04 or a M‰ori authorityan earlier income year is treated as being trustee income.

How to use this table. Read columns from left to right according to the row that fits your situation 4 In Table HI 8 there are two incorrect references to HI 7, these should refer to section HI 9. The errors are expected to be corrected in a future bill. Credits to the M‰ori authority credit account ñ section MK 4 Section MK 4 sets out the circumstances in which credits arise to the M‰ori authority credit account in an imputation year and the timing of those credit entries for that year. The following amounts arise as credits to the M‰ori authority credit account: ïNew Zealand income tax paid during the imputation year to meet a provisional tax obligation or to satisfy an income tax liability under section BC 9. The credit arises on the date the tax is paid. However, a credit does not arise in relation to: −income tax payable for the 2003-04 or an earlier income year, −income tax paid on income derived before the company or trust made an effective election to be a M‰ori authority part-way through the imputation year, −income tax paid by way of crediting under section LB 2(2), or −income tax paid by way of crediting of further income tax under section MK 8(5). ïProvisional tax offsets within a wholly-owned group under section MB 9(5). ïFurther income tax under section MK 8. A credit of further income tax is equal to the debit balance in the M‰ori authority credit account at 31 March and arises on the date the tax is paid. ïM‰ori authority credits attached to distributions received by M‰ori authorities. The credit arises on a date the distribution is made. 40 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) ïImputation credits attached to a dividend received by M‰ori authorities. The credit arises on a date the dividend is paid. ïDividend withholding payment credits attached to dividends received by M‰ori authorities that do not operate a dividend withholding payment account. A corporate M‰ori authority has the option of operating a dividend withholding payment account under Part MG. If it chooses not to do so any withholding payment credits attached to dividends which it receives give rise to a credit at the time the dividend is paid. ïA credit to offset a previous debit for an arrangement to obtain a tax advantage. If the Commissioner determines that M‰ori authorities have entered into an arrangement to obtain a tax advantage and determines the amount of the credit which is subject to the arrangement, a debit arises to the account of that amount. If the matter is subsequently resolved in favour of the authority, a credit arises of the amount previously debited on a date that the debit arose. ïThe amount of any resident withholding tax deduction deemed to have been derived by the M‰ori authority in terms of section NF 12(b). The credit arises on the date that the resident withholding tax is deducted. These credits increase the amount available for allocation to taxable M‰ori authority distributions paid to M‰ori authority members, while credits allocated to those distributions are debited to the M‰ori authority credit account. The timing of when these credits arise is prescribed in section MK 4(2). Inability to transfer dividend withholding payment ñ credit balances to the M‰ori authority credit account Under the imputation rules, companies can transfer all or part of the end-of-year credit balances in their dividend withholding payment account to their imputation credit account. However, no such provision exists for corporate M‰ori authorities to transfer the credit balance in a dividend withholding payment account to their M‰ori authority credit account. The reason is that if a corporate M‰ori authority should cease to be a M‰ori authority any credit balance in the M‰ori authority credit account must be transferred to the imputation credit account (in accordance with section HI 8(3)). Because excess imputation credits are not refundable, whereas excess dividend withholding payment credits are, the conversion of dividend withholding payment credits to imputation credits would penalise companies ceasing to be M‰ori authorities. The ability of a corporate M‰ori authority to continue to maintain a dividend withholding payment account avoids the compliance costs associated with tracing dividend withholding payment credits and debits in a M‰ori authority credit account, to allow for the crediting and debiting of the dividend withholding account when M‰ori authorities become companies. Debits to the M‰ori authority credit account ñ section MK 5 Section MK 4 sets out the circumstances in which debits arise to the M‰ori authority credit account in an imputation year and the timing of those debit entries for that year. Debits arise to the M‰ori authority credit account in the following circumstances: ïM‰ori authority credits attached to distributions paid by the M‰ori authority. If a M‰ori authority attaches a M‰ori authority credit to a distribution to one of its members, a debit equal to the amount of the credit arises on the date the distribution is made. ïThe amount of any provisional tax allocated by the M‰ori authority to an underpaid company under section MB 9(5). This debit arises on the date the tax is paid. ïIf a M‰ori authority receives a refund of income tax, a debit arises on the date of payment of the refund. However, there are exceptions to this ruleóno debit arises for refunds of tax paid: −In relation to the 2003-04 or earlier income year. −In relation to an income year or part of an income year during which the M‰ori authority did not maintain a M‰ori authority credit account. In respect of part of the income year, the debit to the account is apportioned to the number of days in which the authority was a M‰ori authority. ïAn allocation debit under section MK 7(4). Section MK 7(4) requires M‰ori authorities to attach credits at the same ratio to all distributions made during an imputation year. If there has been a breach of this rule, an allocation debit must be entered into the account on 31 March of the year in which the authority was in breach of the rule. ïRefunds of dividend withholding payments paid to the M‰ori authority. If a M‰ori authority does not operate a dividend withholding payment account and receives a dividend withholding payment refund, a debit arises equal to the amount of the refund on the date the refund is paid. ïA debit arises if there is a loss of continuity of shareholding beyond the specified level. This debit arises on the date there is the loss of continuity. (See following discussion, ìLoss of continuity ñ section MK 5(3) and 5(4)î.) ïA debit arises for any refund of income tax paid if the refund is less than the debit that is created as a result of a loss of continuity. 41 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) ïIf the Commissioner has determined that there has been a tax advantage in terms of section GC 27B and has determined the amount which is the subject of the arrangement, a debit of that amount arises at the end of the year in which the arrangement commenced. ïIf a company ceases to be a M‰ori authority, a debit arises to the account of an amount of the credit balance in the account immediately before the company ceased to be a M‰ori authority. ïAny overpaid income tax applied by the Commissioner in satisfaction of tax liabilities, other than income tax or provisional tax instalments, except to the extent that the amount applied: −relates to income tax paid for the 2003-04 or earlier income year, or −relates to income tax paid before the date that a debit arose owing to a breach in continuity of shareholding and is no more than the debit that arose on that date. The timing of when the debits arise is prescribed in section MK 5(2). Loss of continuity ñ section MK 5(3) and 5(4) Section MK 5(3) provides that corporate M‰ori authorities cannot carry forward M‰ori authority credits unless a continuity of shareholding test is satisfied. As with companies, this test limits the carry-forward of M‰ori authority credits for subsequent use to situations where at least 66% of those persons who will benefit from such use bore the tax liability that gave rise to the credit. In order to achieve this result, section MK 5(3) ensures that if the continuity of shareholding test is not satisfied, credits in the M‰ori authority credit account are cancelled by a debit entry in the account. The debit entry arises on the day there is a loss of continuity. Any debit can only be taken into account once for the purpose of determining whether a credit balance has been cancelled out. A credit cancelled out before the loss of continuity by a debit (irrespective of whether the debit arises before or after the credit) is not affected. Section MK 5(4) provides that for the purpose of section MK 5(1)(f) the minimum voting interest or market value interest that a person holds in a M‰ori authority will be equal to the lowest voting interest or market value interest held by that person during the period. These measures are designed to support the allocation rules contained in section MK 7. Effectively, they ensure that M‰ori authority credits cannot be retained in a M‰ori authority company that is sold. Attaching a M‰ori authority credit to a distribution ñ section MK 6 Section MK 6 allows a M‰ori authority that is required to operate a M‰ori authority credit account to attach a M‰ori authority credit to taxable distributions. This is done at the time of the payment of the distribution. Allocation rules ñ section MK 7 Section MK 7 provides that a M‰ori authority may not attach M‰ori authority credits to a taxable M‰ori authority distribution at a ìbase ratioî which exceeds: Tax rate/1-Tax rate Where: ìTax rateî is the M‰ori authority tax rate (expressed as a percentage) for the income year that is concurrent with the imputation year in which the distribution is made. This formula computes the ìmaximum base ratioî at which distributions may have credits attached. The term ìbase ratioî means an amount calculated according to the formula: M‰ori authority credit/distribution Where: ìM‰ori authority creditî is the amount of the credit attached to the distribution and, if no credit is attached that amount is zero. ìdistributionî is the amount of the distribution by the M‰ori authority excluding any credit attached. Therefore the maximum base ratio allowed for the 2004-05 income year is $19.50/$80.50. If the authority makes a distribution with a base ratio in excess of the maximum base ratio that distribution is treated as having a base ratio equal to the maximum base ratio (section LB 1(1)(eb)). Allocating credits at different ratios during the year ñ section MK 7(2) Section MK 7(2) requires that every distribution during an imputation year must carry credits at the same base ratio. This rule is aimed at preventing ìstreamingî of M‰ori authority credits to M‰ori authority members. The first taxable M‰ori authority distribution paid by an authority during the imputation year is referred to as the ìbenchmark distributionî. All subsequent distributions paid during that year must carry credits at the same base ratio as the benchmark distribution unless a ìbase ratio change declarationî is made. For example, if no credits are attached to the benchmark dividend, every subsequent dividend paid in that year should also have no credits attached. 42 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) Base ratio change declaration ñ section MK 7(4) A base ratio change may only occur if a M‰ori authority completes a statutory declaration to the effect that a subsequent distribution is not being credited at a different base ratio to the benchmark distribution as part of an arrangement to obtain a tax advantage. The base ratio change declaration must be delivered to the Commissioner before the subsequent distribution is paid. This declaration is provided for in section MK 7(4). Allocation debit ñ section MK 7(5) If an authority is in breach of section MK 7(2), a debit (known as the ìallocation debitî) arises to the M‰ori authority credit account of an amount calculated according to the formula: (distributions x ratio) ñ credits Where: ìdistributionsî is the amount of all taxable M‰ori authority distributions made by the authority during the imputation year (excluding credits attached to the distributions). ìratioî is the lesser of: highest base ratio of all the distributions made during that year the maximum base ratio allowable for that year ìcreditsî is the amount of all M‰ori authority credits attached to distributions made by the authority for that year. The effect of the debit to the M‰ori authority account is to assume that all distributions paid during the imputation year are credited at the highest base ratio. Further income tax, end of year debit balance ñ section MK 8 M‰ori authorities may, during an imputation year, attach credits to distributions in anticipation of credits subsequently arising in the M‰ori authority credit account. The account may, therefore, run into debit. Section MK 8(1) and (2) provide that if there is a debit balance at the end of 31 March, the authority is required to pay to the Commissioner, on or before 20 June following the end of the imputation year in which there was the debit balance, an amount equal to that debit balance. This is an amount of tax by way of further income tax. Section MK 8(3) and (4) provide that if there is a debit balance immediately before a M‰ori authority stops being a M‰ori authority, the authority is liable to pay to the Commissioner further income tax of an amount equal to the debit balance in the M‰ori authority credit account. This amount must be paid to the Commissioner no later than the last day on which the authority is still a M‰ori authority. Section MK 8(5) provides that payments of further income tax may be used to offset a future income tax liability or any instalment of provisional tax in accordance with section MB 10. If this amount is not paid by the due date, the usual penalty provisions for non payment of income tax apply. (See later discussion on M‰ori authority distribution penalty tax.) Credits and debits incorrectly recorded ñ section MK 9 The Commissioner can make corrections to the M‰ori authority credit account and unless the authority establishes that the Commissioner is wrong, the account must be corrected accordingly. Limits on refunds of tax to M‰ori authorities ñ section MD 2B Refunds of income tax to M‰ori authorities will be limited to the credit balance in the M‰ori authority credit account. The amount of credits attached to distributions in each imputation year should not exceed the credits in the M‰ori authority credit account (after taking into account further income tax) as at 31 March. If a M‰ori authority allocated credits in year one and in year two was entitled to a refund of income tax paid in year one, the Commissioner would, if the authority had a nil or debit balance in its M‰ori authority credit account, effectively be refunding an amount which had already been passed on by way of credits to members. Section MD 2B, therefore, imposes a limit on the amount of income tax which may be refunded to a M‰ori authority. The amount to be refunded must not exceed the credit balance in the account at the previous 31 March. Any excess which is not refunded may be offset against a future income tax liability. If a M‰ori authority has ceased being a M‰ori authority and becomes entitled to a refund of income tax in accordance with section MD 1, the refund to be paid to the authority cannot exceed the credit balance that arose as a debit under section MK 5(1)(i). M‰ori authority income tax rate of 19.5% ñ schedule 1, Part A, clause 2 The income tax rate applying to the income of M‰ori authorities has been reduced from 25% to 19.5%. One reason for the lower tax rate is that most members of M‰ori authorities will be on the statutory tax rate of 19.5%. Resident withholding tax non-declaration rate on distributions over $200 ñ schedule 14, clause 3 An amendment to schedule 14órate of resident withholding tax deductions, requires M‰ori authorities to deduct from taxable distributions over $200 resident withholding tax at the rate of 39% if they do not have a record of the tax file number of the member to whom the distribution is being made. 43 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) This treatment is consistent with the rules that apply to resident withholding tax on interest income. M‰ori authority members can claim a refund of any resident withholding tax over-deducted by filing a tax return or a personal tax summary. New information requirements for M‰ori authority members under the Tax Administration Act 1994 New section 33(1B) allows charities and other exempt entities that are members of M‰ori authorities and receive taxable distributions to file returns at the end of the year in order to claim a refund of their M‰ori authority credits. The non-return filing requirements in section 33A have been amended to specifically cover distributions from M‰ori authorities that have M‰ori authority credits attached or have had resident withholding tax deducted from them. New section 33A(1)(a)(iv) ensures that M‰ori authority members whose total income exceeds $38,000 will be required to request a personal tax summary or file a tax return if they also receive a taxable M‰ori authority distribution greater than $200. New information requirements for M‰ori authorities under the Tax Administration Act 1994 Keeping of business records Section 22(2) has been amended to require M‰ori authorities to maintain for seven years records relating to the M‰ori authority credit account. This rule is the same for companies that operate an imputation credit account. Member distribution statement Section 31 has been amended to require M‰ori authorities to provide their members with information about any distributions they receive so that their members can comply with their tax obligations. The information must be provided at the time the payment is made and must show: ïthe name of the M‰ori authority ïthe date the distribution is made ïthe name and address, and the tax file number if the number is known by the M‰ori authority, of the member to whom the distribution is made ïthe amount of the distribution made to the member, including what portion is a taxable distribution and what portion is a non-taxable distribution ïthe amount of a M‰ori authority credit attached to the distribution or treated as being attached to the distribution under NF 8B, and ïsuch other information as the Commissioner may require. Annual returns of income Section 57 has been amended to require M‰ori authorities to furnish an annual tax return showing a complete statement of their taxable income. M‰ori authority distribution statement Section 68B requires M‰ori authorities to furnish a distribution statement to Inland Revenue for an income year. The statement must show the following details: ïthe date on which the distribution is made ïthe total amount of distribution made ïthe total amount of M‰ori authority credits attached to the distribution (to be shown as a nil amount if M‰ori authority credits have not been attached) ïthe base ratio of the distribution, and ïsuch further information as the Commissioner may require. The distribution statement is to be forwarded to the Commissioner no later than the time allowed by section 37 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for furnishing a return of income for an income year. Annual M‰ori authority credit account return required to be furnished New section 69B requires M‰ori authorities to furnish a M‰ori authority credit account return that shows a record of the debits and credits to, and the opening and closing balances of, its M‰ori authority credit account for each imputation year. This annual return must be provided to the Commissioner no later than the time allowed by section 37 for furnishing a return of income for an income year that corresponds with the relevant imputation year covered by the M‰ori authority credit account return. In addition, the authority should show in the return the amount of further income tax payable (under section MK 8 of the Income Tax Act 1994) and the amount of any M‰ori authority distribution penalty tax payable. Under new section 70B the Commissioner can require M‰ori authorities to file a M‰ori authority credit account return at any time in respect of an imputation year or a specified period. For instance, the Commissioner may require a return to be furnished if there is reason to believe that entries in the account are not correct. If a M‰ori authority ceases to be a M‰ori authority (for example, if it no longer owns land that is subject to the Te Ture Whenua M‰ori Act 1993) the authority is required to furnish within two months of its ceasing to be a M‰ori authority, a M‰ori authority credit account return for the period from the beginning of the imputation year until the date it ceased to be a M‰ori authority. 44 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) M‰ori authority distribution penalty tax provisions ñ sections 97B, 140CB, 143DB and 181B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Section 97B allows the Commissioner to make an assessment of M‰ori authority distribution penalty tax. Section 140CB provides that a M‰ori authority that is liable to pay further income tax under section MK 8 of the Income Tax Act 1994 for an end-of-year debit balance is also liable to pay a special tax known as ìM‰ori authority distribution penalty taxî. The amount of this penalty tax is 10% of the amount of further income tax (in other words, 10% of the debit balance at 31 March) and is due by the following 20 June. This penalty tax is intended to be a disincentive for M‰ori authorities to be in debit at the end of the year. Section 143DB clarifies the application of the other tax provisions in relation to the M‰ori authority penalty tax. Section 181B outlines the circumstances in which the Commissioner will remit M‰ori authority penalty tax imposed under section 140CB. Consequential amendments to the imputation provisions ñ sections LB 2(3), ME 1(2)(j), ME 4(1) and ME 5(1) Credit of tax for imputation credits Section LB 2(3) has been amended so that any unused portion of an imputation credit which forms part of the gross income of a M‰ori authority is converted to a loss using the M‰ori authority tax rate of 19.5%. M‰ori authorities not required to maintain an imputation credit account Section ME 1(2)(j) ensures that corporate M‰ori authorities that are required to establish and maintain a M‰ori authority credit account under section MK 1 are prevented from also operating an imputation credit account. Credits arising to the imputation credit account Section ME 4(1)(e) applies to companies that receive taxable distributions with M‰ori authority credits attached. The amendment ensures that companies that are required to operate an imputation credit account can include M‰ori authority credits attached to such distributions as a credit in their imputation credit account. Section ME 4(2)(cb) provides that the credit arises on the date that the distribution is made. Section ME 4(1)(k) ensures that companies that stop maintaining a M‰ori authority credit account during an imputation year can include a credit in their imputation credit account equal to the credit balance that existed in the companyís M‰ori authority credit account. Section ME 4(2)(i) provides that the credit arises on the date that a debit entry is made to the M‰ori authority credit account under section MK 5. This amendment ensures that corporate M‰ori authorities can transfer credit balances in the M‰ori authority credit account to the imputation credit account as required by section HI 8 and row 3 of Table HI 8. Debits arising to the imputation credit account Section ME 5(1)(k) includes as a debit entry in the imputation credit account an amount equal to the credit balance of the imputation credit account if, during the imputation year, the company establishes a M‰ori authority credit account. Section ME 5(2)(jb) provides that the debit arises on the date immediately before the company becomes a M‰ori authority. This provision is necessary to close off an imputation credit account which is in credit balance when a company elects to be a M‰ori authority. Removal of the ìM‰ori authority exclusionî in the definition of ìcompanyî ñ sections HI (1) and OB 1 Corporate M‰ori authorities were previously prevented from using the company income tax provisions because M‰ori authorities were specifically excluded from the definition of ìcompanyî. The definition of ìcompanyî in section OB 1 has been amended to remove the M‰ori authority exclusion. Effectively, this means that the income tax provisions that relate to companies will now apply to M‰ori authorities whose legal form is that of a company. However, section HI 1(2) limits the circumstances in which corporate M‰ori authorities can use the loss grouping, amalgamation, consolidation and co-operative company rules. Other specific provisions may also limit the extent to which corporate M‰ori authorities can avail themselves of certain company provisions. Section HI 1(2) clarifies that a M‰ori authority may only: ïoffset losses (or income) against the income (or loss) of another M‰ori authority ïamalgamate with another M‰ori authority whose legal form is that of a company ïbe part of a consolidated group that comprises M‰ori authorities only, and ïbe a co-operative company if all of its shareholders are M‰ori authorities. This amendment ensures that the loss grouping, consolidation, and amalgamation rules apply to M‰ori authority companies only or ordinary companies only, and not to combinations of M‰ori authority companies and ordinary companies. This is to avoid the risk that companies not eligible to apply the M‰ori authority rules could obtain unintended tax advantages. 45 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) A number of specific amendments have been made to incorporate the new M‰ori authority rules into various provisions relating to companies. These amendments are briefly outlined below. Provisions relating to co-operative companies Section HI 4(3) allows M‰ori authorities that are cooperative companies to attach M‰ori authority credits to cash distributions or notional distributions in the same way as an imputation credit under section ME 5. Section HI 5(3) states that a cash distribution made be a M‰ori authority that is a cooperative company to its members will constitute a taxable M‰ori authority distribution if the authority: ïmakes the distribution in respect of a notional distribution, and ïhas made a determination under section ME 35 in respect of that notional distribution. The formula contained in section ME 36(1), which determines the amount of imputation credit that may be attached to a cash distribution made by a M‰ori authority that is a co-operative company, has been amended to take account of the basic rate of income tax applying to M‰ori authorities. The formula contained in section ME 38(1), which determines the amount of the notional distribution deemed to have been paid by a corporate M‰ori authority to its shareholders, has also been amended to reflect the new M‰ori authority tax rate. Dividend withholding payments provisions ñ Part NH The formula in section NH 2(1), which computes the level of deduction of dividend withholding payment, has been amended to reflect the new M‰ori authority tax rate. Branch equivalent tax accounts of companies ñ Part MF The formula contained in section MF 4(1)(b), which computes a credit to be recorded in the branch equivalent tax account of a company, has been amended to take account of the new M‰ori authority tax rate. The formula contained in section MF 8(2)(b), which computes a credit to be recorded in the branch equivalent tax account of a consolidated group, has also been amended to take account of the new M‰ori authority tax rate. Application of the resident withholding tax rules ñ Part NF A number of amendments have been made to the resident withholding tax rules to provide for the deduction of resident withholding tax from taxable M‰ori authority distributions. Section NF 1(2)(c) ensures that the resident withholding tax rules apply to ìtaxable M‰ori authority distributionsî made by M‰ori authorities to their members so that deductions of resident withholding tax can be made under new sections NF 2(1)(e) and (f). Section NF 2(1)(e) provides for the calculation of resident withholding tax in respect of cash taxable distributions. Section NF 2(1)(f) applies to the calculation of resident withholding tax in respect of non-cash taxable distributions. Section NF 2(4(b)(iv) requires M‰ori authorities to make deductions of resident withholding tax from payments of taxable M‰ori authority distributions. Section NF 2(7) has been amended to cover the payment of taxable M‰ori authority distributions. This provision exempts M‰ori authorities from the obligation to deduct resident withholding tax from distributions if the recipient member holds a valid certificate of exemption from resident withholding tax and this certificate has been sighted by the authority and is in fact valid. For details about how to apply for this exemption status see Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 5, January 1995. Section NF 2B requires a company to notify interest payers that they are a company when they become entitled to receive a payment of resident withholding income. This section has been amended to exclude corporate M‰ori authorities from this requirement. Section NF 4(4) has been amended to require M‰ori authorities who deduct resident withholding tax from distributions it makes to their members to pay all deductions of resident withholding tax to Inland Revenue on a monthly basis. The deductions made during any month must be paid to Inland Revenue no later than the 20 th of the following month. Section NF 6(2) has been amended so that resident withholding tax deductions can be varied to correct errors in previous deductions in respect of taxable M‰ori authority distributions. New section NF 8B ensures that the amount of the deduction of resident withholding tax from a taxable M‰ori authority distribution is treated as a M‰ori authority credit attached to the distribution. Schedule 14 has been amended in the 2004-2005 income year to provide that the tax rate to be used in the calculation of resident withholding tax deductions from taxable M‰ori authority distributions will be 19.5%. However, if such distributions are greater than $200 and the authority does not have a record of the tax file number of the member to whom the distribution is made, the applicable tax rate will be 39%. 46 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) 5 Inquiry into the Powers and Operations of the Inland Revenue Department: Report of the Finance and Expenditure Committee, New Zealand House of Representatives, October 1999, page 4 ñ recommendation 7 and page 27. Meaning of M‰ori authority rules There is a new meaning of ìM‰ori authority rulesî in section OZ 1(1). M‰ori authority rules mean Parts HI and MK, sections GC 27B, LD 3B and MD 2B, and Schedule 1, Part A, clause 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994. These rules also include 31, 57, 68B, 69B, 70B, 97B, 140CB, 140DB, and 181B of the Tax Administration Act. Standardising the tax rules for the M‰ori Trusts ñ section HK 14 repealed The specific agent provision that applied to the M‰ori Trustee in section HK 14 has been repealed. The M‰ori authority rules contained in new subpart HI apply to the taxation of income derived by the M‰ori Trustee in respect of all of its agencies relating to assets administered under Te Ture Whenua M‰ori Act 1993. The M‰ori Trustee also acts as trustee of a large number of trusts constituted by order of the M‰ori Land Court in accordance with Te Ture Whenua M‰ori Act 1993. These trusteeships are also covered by the M‰ori authority rules. Thus the M‰ori authority rules will apply to the M‰ori Trustee in all situations where the Trusteeís agencies or trusteeships involve land subject to the provisions of the Te Ture Whenua M‰ori Act 1993. Each trust or agency of the M‰ori Trustee will be taxed separately under the M‰ori authority rules. A number of consequential amendments have also been made to remove references to section HK 14 throughout the Income Tax Acts. Donations deduction for M‰ori Authorities ñ section DI 2 Until now, M‰ori authorities have been entitled to claim a deduction for donations made to any M‰ori association (within the meaning of the M‰ori Community Development Act 1962). Any donation to a M‰ori association was able to be deducted up to a maximum of 5% of the net income of the M‰ori authority claiming the deduction. Net income is calculated after taking into account all deductions except the donations deduction. Section DI 2 has been amended to extend the donations deduction to include donations to organisations with ìapproved donee statusî. The maximum level of deduction remains at 5% of the authorityís net income. To qualify for approved donee status, an organisation must be established for charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand or must be specifically listed in section KC 5. As only organisations can qualify for donee status, M‰ori authorities would not be able to claim this deduction for distributions to individuals. This deduction is similar to the deduction for donations paid by companies in section DJ 4. If a corporate M‰ori authority makes a donation to an organisation with approved donee status it will only be permitted to claim a deduction for that donation under section DI 2 (and not section DJ 4). This change applies from the income year 2003-04. TAXPAYER COMPLIANCE, STANDARDS AND PENALTIES GOOD BEHAVIOUR Section 141FB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction An amendment to the Tax Administration Act 1994 gives effect to the recommendations outlined in the discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review, released in August 2001, that taxpayersí past compliance should be taken into account when imposing shortfall penalties. The amendment halves the rate of shortfall penalties if within the previous two years, in the case of GST, fringe benefit tax, PAYE and resident withholding tax, or four years, in the case of all other taxes, the taxpayer has not been liable to pay a shortfall penalty on a tax shortfall identified during an audit. There is no probation period in the case of evasion. All subsequent breaches by a taxpayer who has previously evaded tax will be penalised at the higher rate. Background In 1999 the Finance and Expenditure Committee recommended that: Öa past record of ìgood behaviourî be taken into account when deciding whether to impose a penalty 5 The Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance also considered this issue. Its report recommended that: Öthe government should specifically require the review team to report on: whether the governmentís performance expectations of taxpayers are reasonable; 47 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) whether, and to what extent, a past record of ëgood behaviourí should be taken into account in deciding to impose penalties or to escalate enforcement;Ö 6 This matter was also considered by the Ministerial Panel on Business Compliance Costs. In its report it stated: The policy of imposing tax collection obligations on employers/small businesses, and then punishing them with penalties for getting it wrong builds strong resentment from those that have good ëtrack recordsí. 7 The government addressed all of these concerns in its discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review. The discussion document noted that applying a test for good behaviour and determining whether taxpayers had met that test would incur considerable compliance and administrative costs. The government was also concerned as to how such a test could be applied consistently to all taxpayers. As a way of taking into account good behaviour at low compliance and administrative costs, the discussion document proposed that the shortfall penalty for lack of reasonable care be reduced to 10% if the breach was the taxpayerís first breach of that standard. Submissions on the discussion document recommended that ìgood behaviourî be taken into account when imposing all shortfall penalties. As a result, when the Taxation (Annual Rates, M‰ori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill was introduced the proposal was extended to apply also to unacceptable tax positions. Submissions on the bill again recommended that the amendment be extended to apply to all shortfall penalties. The amendment was therefore extended to all shortfall penalties, with the benefits of doing so expected to be as follows: ïTaxpayers would see that those taxpayers who repeatedly offend are more harshly penalised, reflecting their failure to begin complying voluntarily. ïThe change would address the concern that the shortfall penalty rates were excessive. (This was particularly the cases with voluntary disclosures, where the rules were seen as penalising taxpayers who were attempting to comply.) ïThe shortfall penalty rate for first time evasion would be aligned with the rate for evasion in Australia and Canada. The main concern was that the measure reduces the shortfall penalty applying to evasion from 150% to 75% for a ìfirst offenceî and, therefore, this measure could be seen as softening the seriousness of this offence. However, a 75% penalty is still substantial. Further, the legislation now provides that increased penalties apply to those who re-offend, the four-year good behaviour period does not apply in the case of evasion and when the penalty for evasion is halved it is equal to the penalty imposed in Australia and Canada. Submissions on the discussion document also expressed concern that the proposal could discourage voluntary disclosures for tax shortfalls. To resolve this problem, the original proposal was amended so that if a taxpayer voluntarily discloses a tax shortfall, disclosure of that shortfall does not lead to higher rates of shortfall penalties applying to subsequent breaches, whether those subsequent offences are voluntarily disclosed or not. It is only when the taxpayer has been audited and a shortfall penalty is imposed that the probation period begins. Probation period The probation period needs to be sufficiently long to indicate that the taxpayerís behaviour has changed, yet short enough to be not overly burdensome on the taxpayer. The discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review, proposed that the probation/good behaviour period be seven years. Following consideration of the submissions on the discussion document, when the bill was introduced this period was reduced to four years. The measure was further extended by providing that in the case of GST, fringe benefit tax, PAYE and resident withholding tax, a two-year period is sufficiently long for a regular taxpayer to demonstrate improved compliance behaviour. Key features Under section 141FB, the rates of all shortfall penalties have been halved, if within the previous two years, in the case of GST, fringe benefit tax, PAYE and resident withholding tax, or four years in the case of all other taxes, the taxpayer has not been liable to pay a shortfall penalty on a tax shortfall identified during an audit. An exception to this general rule has been made in relation to the shortfall penalty for evasion when there is no probation period. In other words, once tax has been evaded, the evasion shortfall penalty is imposed at the rate of 150%. Breaches of the lack of reasonable care and unacceptable tax position standards do not count as first offences for gross carelessness, abusive tax position or evasion. But a first offence for these higher penalties does count as a breach of good behaviour in relation to the lower penalties. Tax shortfalls are grouped and effectively treated as one offence. For example, if a taxpayer who has never had a 6 Tax Compliance, Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance, December 1998, paragraph 12.7. 7 Finding the Balance: Maximum Compliance at Minimum Cost, Final Report of the Ministerial Panel on Business Compliance Costs, July 2001, page 121. 48 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) shortfall penalty imposed is audited, and several breaches of the lack of reasonable care and gross carelessness standards are ascertained, all of the tax shortfalls are treated as the first offence and penalised at the appropriate reduced rates. The reason for this is to prevent disagreement as to which shortfall was the ìfirstî, and it wanted to ensure that where a taxpayer makes the same mistake in several periods, all are penalised at the same rate. The amendment applies separately for each type of tax, such as PAYE, income tax and GST. Therefore a penalty imposed in relation to one tax does not mean that the taxpayer automatically faces a higher penalty rate for another tax. For example, a breach of the lack of reasonable care standard in relation to GST does not mean that the taxpayer will be penalised at the higher rate for a breach of the same standard in relation to income tax. Voluntary disclosures do not count against good behaviour. It is only when the taxpayer has been audited and a shortfall penalty is imposed that the probation period begins. If this were not the case, taxpayers could be discouraged from voluntarily disclosing tax shortfalls, as once they have made a voluntary disclosure they face higher penalties on subsequent tax shortfalls for two or four years. Example one A taxpayer files an income tax return and omits income from a particular source. After filing the return the taxpayer voluntarily discloses that he has omitted the incomeóthe taxpayer has evaded tax and the shortfall penalty is reduced by 75% for the voluntary disclosure and 50% for good behaviour. The taxpayer is not audited. In the next two returns the taxpayer omits income and subsequently discloses the omission. On both occasions the shortfall penalty is reduced by 75% for the voluntary disclosure and 50% for good behaviour. 75% reduction for75% reduction for75% reduction for voluntary disclosurevoluntary disclosurevoluntary disclosure and 50% reductionand 50% reductionand 50% reduction for good behaviourfor good behaviourfor good behaviour Example two Inland Revenue decides to audit the period following the first voluntary disclosure, and a shortfall penalty for evasion is imposed. This shortfall penalty is reduced by 50% for good behaviour. In the subsequent period the taxpayer makes a voluntary disclosure and the shortfall penalty is reduced by 75% because of the disclosure. Again, Inland Revenue audits the period following the disclosure, and a shortfall penalty for evasion is imposed. This shortfall penalty is not reduced. In a subsequent period the taxpayer voluntarily discloses omitted income, and the shortfall penalty is reduced by 75% because of the disclosure. 75% reduction forAUDIT75% reduction forAUDIT75% reduction for voluntary disclosure50% reductiongood behaviourNo reductionvoluntary disclosure and 50% reductionfor good for good behaviourbehaviour Application date The amendment applies to tax positions taken on and after 1 April 2000, apart from those cases where a taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty before the date of Royal assent of the Act, 26 March 2003, in which case the higher penalty rate stands. This date was chosen to ensure that tax shortfall identified after the date of enactment but relating to tax periods after 1 April 2000 benefit from the ìgood behaviourî provision. It ensures that the reduced penalty rates take effect as soon as possible. All taxpayers start with a ìclean slateî. If a taxpayer has had a shortfall penalty imposed under the old rates, that penalty is not taken into account in determining the rate of penalty to be charged under these new rules. 49 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) PENALTIES FOR UNACCEPTABLE TAX POSITIONS Sections 3, 141A(4), 141B, 141C, 141D(1), 141D(4), 141D(7)(a) and 141H of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction The Tax Administration Act has been amended to provide that a shortfall penalty for not having a tax position that is ìas likely as not to be correctî can be imposed in cases where the taxpayer has not interpreted the law. The amendment prevents taxpayers choosing not to ìinterpretî the legislation to avoid possible shortfall penalties. To avoid any confusion, the name of the shortfall penalty has been changed from ìunacceptable interpretationî to ìunacceptable tax positionî. Background The shortfall penalty for unacceptable interpretation is intended as a signal to taxpayers. It indicates that they should take extra care and that, when viewed objectively, their interpretations should be as likely as not to be correct. However, the interpretation given to ìunacceptable interpretationî allowed taxpayers to avoid making reasonable efforts to determine what the law is. The concern was that taxpayers could choose not to interpret the legislation on a complex tax issue, as a means of avoiding possible shortfall penalties. The need to have an interpretation weakened the standard that larger taxpayers were required to meet, and made a penalty more difficult to impose in cases where it is fair that it be imposed. In 1999 the Finance and Expenditure Committee had recommended that: The Inland Revenue Department reinforce both publicly and internally that if a taxpayer or adviser has not interpreted legislation a penalty for unacceptable interpretation cannot apply. 8 Some submissions on the discussion document and the bill noted that the amendment was contrary to the recommendation of the Finance and Expenditure Committee following its inquiry in 1999 into the powers and operations of Inland Revenue. However, as noted in the discussion document, the current interpretation of the legislation allows taxpayers to avoid making reasonable efforts to determine the law. Some submissions also recommended that if taxpayers have not interpreted the legislation and should have done so, the shortfall penalty that should be imposed is the lack of reasonable care penalty, not the unacceptable interpretation penalty. The government agreed with submissions that in some cases if a taxpayer has not interpreted the legislation a shortfall penalty for lack of reasonable care could be imposed. However, there is concern that there could be cases where a penalty cannot be imposed. For example, a taxpayer investing in a scheme might ask the promoter if an interpretation is necessary on a particular point and the promoter says that the point is very clear and an interpretation is not necessary; the taxpayer has taken reasonable care and no shortfall penalty can be imposed. Key features Section 141B has been amended to change the name of the shortfall penalty for ìunacceptable interpretationî to ìunacceptable tax positionî. This amendment ensures that the penalty applies to tax positions that do not meet the criteria, regardless of whether the taxpayer has considered the legislation or not. The thresholds in section 141B at which the penalty may apply have been increased. The minimum threshold increases from $10,000 to $20,000 and the maximum threshold from $200,000 to $250,000. This means that before the penalty can be imposed, the total amount of the tax shortfall must exceed $20,000 and 1% of the total amount of tax the taxpayer has returned for the period. It can be imposed in all cases when a tax shortfall exceeds $250,000 and the tax shortfall is due to the position taken not being as likely as not to be correct. New sections 141A(4) and 141B(1B) clarify that a taxpayer has not taken an unacceptable tax position if a tax shortfall is the result of calculation mistake or by mis-recording numbers in a return. It was never intended that the unacceptable tax position penalty apply to calculation or processing mistakes. Rather, this penalty applies when a tax shortfall arises because a tax position is not as likely as not to be correct, whether or not the taxpayer actually interpreted the law. If a mistake is of such a magnitude that the mistake breaches the reasonable care standard that shortfall penalty applies. Application date The amendment applies to tax positions taken on and after 1 April 2003. 8 Inquiry into the Powers and Operations of the Inland Revenue Department: Report of the Finance and Expenditure Committee, New Zealand House of Representatives, October 1999, page 4 ñ recommendation 9 and page 28. 50 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) Key features A new section 141JAA provides a $50,000 cap on the shortfall penalties for lack of reasonable care and unacceptable tax position, in cases where the shortfall is identified either by the taxpayer or Inland Revenue within a certain period from the due date of the return, being the greater of: ïthree months, and ïthe lesser of one return period and six months. Application date The amendment applies to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2003. PROMOTER PENALTIES Sections 3, 141(12A), 141D(3B), 141EB, 141EC, 141G(1), 141I(1), 141K1(1) and 141L(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction The amendment gives effect to the proposal in the discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review, released in August 2001, for a new penalty on promoters of certain ìtax arrangementsî. If an arrangement is offered, sold, issued or promoted to ten or more people in an income year and it involves an abusive tax position, the promoter will be liable for a promoter penalty. The penalty will be the sum of the tax shortfalls resulting from the arrangement. The penalty is aimed at reducing the number of such investments by holding the people responsible for the design and sale of tax arrangements directly accountable for their actions. Background As noted in the discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review, if a taxpayer becomes a party to an arrangement that is considered by Inland Revenue to involve an abusive tax position, a shortfall penalty is imposed on the taxpayer. Although the compliance and penalties legislation penalised promoters in their capacity as taxpayers, it imposed no civil sanctions on promoters in their capacity as promoters of ìarrangementsî. It therefore provided no incentive for promoters to ensure that the tax effects they claim for their arrangements are correct. Furthermore, offer documents in some cases restrict taxpayers from taking legal action against the promoter. CAPPING SHORTFALL PENALTIES Section 141JAA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction The Tax Administration Act has been amended to impose a monetary cap on the shortfall penalty for lack of reasonable care and unacceptable tax position. The cap has been set at $50,000 per tax position and applies to those shortfalls identified through voluntary disclosure or Inland Revenue audit within a certain period from the due date of the return, being the greater of: ïthree months, and ïthe lesser of one return period and six months. The amendment is designed to ensure that the shortfall penalty is not out of step with the offence if identified speedily. Background The discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review, released in August 2001, recommended that a monetary cap on the shortfall penalty for lack of reasonable care be introduced. The government was concerned about the application of the lack of reasonable care penalty to very large errors that are speedily identified and corrected. In some cases, the size of the penalty may have been excessive and may, in fact, have discouraged voluntary compliance. Submissions on the discussion document recommended that the monetary level of the cap be reduced and that the period of time in which to identify the shortfall be extended. The government declined both these submissions as it considered that implementing them would greatly reduce the incentives on taxpayers to take reasonable care. Submissions on the bill recommended that the cap should apply in respect of other penalties and, in particular, to the unacceptable tax position penalty. Generally, the cap should not apply to unacceptable tax positions because when taxpayers take the position they should be aware as to whether or not the position is as likely as not to be correct. However, with the extension of the unacceptable tax position penalty, in that it will now apply in cases where no interpretation has been made, it is possible that at the time a taxpayer took the position the taxpayer was not aware that the position did not meet the standard of being as likely as not to be correct. 51 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) The discussion document stated that promoters of such arrangements should be held clearly accountable for their actions. The promoter is usually the party with the greater knowledge of the arrangementís tax effects. Often, the true tax impact of an arrangement may be determined by features that the promoter is aware of but the investor is not. These undisclosed features may place the investor at risk of significant penalties. The discussion document recommended that the introduction of a penalty on promoters as the best way to ensure that they are held clearly accountable for their actions. The penalty was to apply to arrangements that involved breaches of an anti-avoidance provision or results in an investor having a shortfall penalty for an abusive tax position. Submissions on the discussion document were concerned that it is often difficult to determine whether an arrangement has involved tax avoidance. As a result, the amendment applies only when an arrangement involves an abusive tax position. Key features New sections 141EB and 141EC provide for the imposition of a civil penalty on promoters, in cases where investment in an arrangement leads to the investor having a shortfall penalty for an abusive tax position imposed. Under section 141D(3B), taxpayers whose tax shortfalls are less than $50,000 and who have independent advice that the arrangement does not involve an abusive tax position will have the shortfall penalty imposed at 20%, rather than the normal 100%. When the bill was drafted one of the first tests for imposing the penalty on the promoter was ìif a taxpayer invests in the arrangement and a shortfall penalty for an abusive tax position is imposed on the taxpayer as a result of the investmentî. Submissions on the bill expressed concern about the meaning of ìinvestsî. As a result, the legislation now refers to investors claiming ìtax-related benefits as a result of the arrangementî. Such benefits could include tax deductions, tax losses, input tax credits, deferred output tax. For example, in relation to an arrangement involving upfront deductions, the tax-related benefit is the claiming of the deductions early. Another test relating to the imposition of the promoter penalty is that ìthe arrangement is offered, sold, issued or promoted to five or more persons in an income yearî. Submissions on the bill expressed concern that the threshold was too low. As a result, the threshold was raised to ten or more persons. The penalty on the promoter is based on the tax shortfalls resulting from the arrangement. This ensures that the promoter faces a penalty that reflects the total tax impact of the arrangement. Under section 141EB(4)(c), the penalty is based on the maximum taxation-related benefits that the arrangement would produce. This means, for example, that if the arrangement was based around income tax, the tax rate used to calculate the promoter penalty would be 39 cents in the dollar as that rate produces the maximum tax-related benefit; if the arrangement involves a GST transaction the rate used to determine the promoter penalty would be 12.5%. The definition of ìpromoterî includes: ïa person who is a party to, or is significantly involved in formulating, a plan or programme from which an arrangement is offered, or ïa person who is aware of material and relevant aspects of the arrangement and who sells, issues, or promotes the selling or issuing of the arrangement, whether or not for remuneration. The promoter penalty is imposed in tandem with the shortfall penalty, generally as one penaltyóbut if additional taxpayer shortfalls are detected, further penalties will be imposed. Application date The amendment applies to arrangements entered into on or after 26 March 2003. ONUS OF PROOF Section 138P of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction An amendment to the Tax Administration Act provides that if a taxpayer can prove on the balance of probabilities that an assessment is wrong by a specific amount, the court must reduce the assessment by that specific amount. This allows taxpayers to correct assessments they show to be wrong in part. Background The Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance noted that a taxpayer who wishes to challenge an assessment is required to prove not only that the Commissioner of Inland Revenueís assessment is wrong, but also by how much it is wrong. It recommended that the law be clarified to provide that if a taxpayer proves, on the balance of probabilities, that the assessment is excessive by a specified amount, the court should reduce Inland Revenueís assessment by that amount. 9 The proposal was included in the discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review, released in August 2001. 9 Tax Compliance, Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance, December 1998, paragraphs 10.12 and 10.13. 52 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) Key features A new subsection (1A) has been added to section 138P to provide that if a taxpayer proves on the balance of probabilities that the assessment is excessive by a specified amount, the court must reduce the assessment by that amount. Application date The amendment applies to challenges brought on or after 26 March 2003. TAX IN DISPUTE Sections 128, 128A, 138E, 138I and 138J of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction The Tax Administration Act has been amended so that it is no longer necessary for taxpayers to pay 50% of the tax in dispute at the beginning of the dispute. The rationale for requiring the payment was removed with the introduction of use-of-money interest on overpaid and underpaid tax. However, Inland Revenue has been given the power to require payment of the entire amount in dispute when it considers that there is a significant risk that the amount will not be paid if the taxpayerís dispute is not successful. Background As noted in the discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review, the Tax Administration Act requires that the taxpayer pay the non-deferrable tax relating to the amount in disputeóthat is, 50% of the amount of tax that is being disputed. The justification for requiring payment, however, was significantly reduced with the introduction of two-way use-of-money interest. To reduce the risk to the revenue, Inland Revenue has been given the power to require payment of all of the tax in dispute when there is a risk that that amount will not be paidófor example, if a taxpayer has entered a dispute merely to delay payment of tax before leaving the country. Submissions on the bill expressed concern that the provision allowing Inland Revenue to require full payment of the debt when it considered there was a ìrisk to the revenueî could be used by Inland Revenue to require payment of the entire amount being disputed when there was a large amount in dispute. This outcome was never intended. The amendment now applies where ìthere is a significant risk that the tax in dispute will not be paid should the taxpayer not succeed in objection proceedings.î Key features Sections 128(1), 128A, 138I(1) and 138J of the Tax Administration Act have been repealed, thus removing the requirement to pay 50% of the tax in dispute at the beginning of the dispute. Sections 128(2b) and 138I(2) have been amended to give Inland Revenue the power to require payment of all of the tax in dispute when there is a significant risk that the amount will not be paid if the taxpayerís dispute is not successful.Application date The amendment applies on or after 1 April 2003. SMALL BALANCE WRITE-OFF Section 174AA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction The provision allowing Inland Revenue not to collect small amounts of tax has been amended to allow Inland Revenue to write off those small balances that are not collected. Background Section 174AA of the Tax Administration Act allows Inland Revenue to refrain from collecting tax if the amount payable is less than $20. The section allowed Inland Revenue not to collect the amount but the debt remained outstanding. This amendment means that the debt is written off permanently. Key features Section 174AA of the Tax Administration Act has been amended allowing Inland Revenue to write off small amounts not collected. Application date The amendment applies from 1 April 2003. 53 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) APPLICATION DATE FOR THE TAXPAYER FINANCIAL RELIEF RULES Sections 3(1), 125(j)(iv), 138E(1)(e)(iv), 139B and 177CA of the Tax Administration Act Introduction Amendments clarify that the taxpayer financial relief rules introduced in the Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002 apply from 1 December 2002. Background The taxpayer financial relief rules were introduced in the Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill in December 2001. The billís progress was interrupted by the pre-election dissolution of Parliament in June 2002 and the convening of the new Parliament in late August. As a result of the delay, the application date of the rules had to be amended to apply from 1 December 2002 rather than 1 July 2002. Several dates were omitted in error, and this amendment clarifies that the rules apply from 1 December 2002. Key features Sections 3(1), 125(j)(iv), 138E(1)(e)(iv), 139B and 177CA of the Tax Administration Act have been clarified to reflect the 1 December 2002 application date for the taxpayer financial relief rules. Application date This amendment applies from 1 December 2002. INLAND REVENUEíS INFORMATION- GATHERING POWERS Sections 16, 16B, 17 and 87 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction Inland Revenueís information-gathering powers contained in sections 16 and 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the Act) have been extended and clarified. The amendments will improve the Commissionerís ability to access the necessary information to confirm taxpayersí correct tax positions. These amendments recognise that information is, in many cases, almost exclusively within the possession and control of taxpayers, and the value of the audit process is compromised if Inland Revenue cannot independently verify a taxpayerís tax position. The amendments themselves and Inland Revenueís administrative guidelines will also place a number of controls around the use of these new powers. Background In December 1998 the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance reported to the then government. The committee identified a number of deficiencies in Inland Revenueís information-gathering powers and made several recommendations that have formed the basis of these amendments. The amendments have also been subject to public consultation as part of the discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review, which was released in August 2001. Key features The amendments to Inland Revenueís main information- gathering powers in sections 16 and 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994: ïclarify that third parties can be required to give reasonable assistance and facilities when Inland Revenue is exercising its powers to access premises ïclarify who may be given authority to enter a personís premises ïallow warrants to enter private dwellings to be exercised by Inland Revenue officers in general ïallow Inland Revenue to remove documents from premises to copy ïallow Inland Revenue to requisition from New Zealand residents information held by offshore entities controlled by the New Zealand residents, and ïgive Inland Revenue the discretion to require documents to be sent to a particular Inland Revenue office. Application date These amendments, other than the amendments to section 16(5), apply from the date of enactment. The amendment to section 16(5), which relates to access warrants to private dwellings, applies from 15 May 2003. Detailed analysis Reasonable assistance from third parties Uncertainty previously existed over whether third parties such as bank employees were required to give reasonable assistance in an investigation or to answer questions relating to an investigation. An amendment has been made to section 16(2) to ensure that an occupier of any place must provide Inland Revenue with all reasonable 54 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) assistance and facilities and answer questions to enable the effective exercise of Inland Revenueís access powers under section 16. This amendment was recommended by the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance, which said that, in principle, third parties should be required to give reasonable assistance and answer questions because the information being sought can be requisitioned under section 17. Authority to enter a personís premises The ability to have other persons accompany Inland Revenue officers onto taxpayersí premises is necessary as those other persons may have specialist skills not possessed by Inland Revenue officers, such as computer forensic skills. The ability also to have the Police accompany officers may be necessary to discourage physical violence. Accordingly, section 16(2A) has been inserted to allow persons whom an authorised Inland Revenue officer considers necessary for the effective exercise of access powers, under section 16, to accompany Inland Revenue officers to any place. Either the consent of the occupier or a judicial warrant must be obtained before Inland Revenue officers can enter a private dwelling. Previously, judicial warrants were required to specify the individual investigator entering a private dwelling. This created practical difficulties when circumstances necessitated an Inland Revenue officer not named in the warrant to take part in the investigation. This requirement was also inconsistent with customs and fisheries legislation, which allowed officers in general to enter the premises. Section 16(3) to (5) has been amended to allow warrants to authorise Inland Revenue officers, in general, and other persons accompanying an officer under the new section 16(2A), to enter a private dwelling. The Tax Administration (Form of Warrant) Regulations 1995 have been replaced, accordingly, to give effect to changes made to section 16. The new regulationsóthe Tax Administration (Form of Warrant) Regulations 2003ó reflecting these amendments apply to warrants issued on or after 15 May 2003. Section 87 has been amended to clarify that the confidentiality obligations apply to persons accompanying Inland Revenue officers onto premises under the authority of new section 16(2A). Removing documents for copying Section 16(1) gives authorised Inland Revenue officers full and free access to all premises to inspect and copy any books, documents or anything else that Inland Revenue considered necessary or relevant for tax purposes. Previously, there was no authority to remove books or documents for copying elsewhere. The Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance was concerned that this inability to remove documents for copying could create problems in cases where it was not possible or practicable to make copies of documents on the taxpayerís premises. In particular, the Committee considered that a power to remove documents for copying is necessary to address the risk in certain cases of documents being destroyed, removed or tampered with if an ordinary section 17 requisition is made for them. Section 16B has been inserted to provide Inland Revenue with the power to remove books or documents for copying. A copy of a book or document certified by or on behalf of the Commissioner is admissible in evidence in court as if it were the original. Controls on power Section 16B(2) provides that copies of books or documents removed must be made, and the books or documents returned, as soon as practicable. Section 16B(4) gives the owners of the removed documents a right to inspect and copy the documents at the Inland Revenue office where the documents are held. This statutory right is able to be exercised at all reasonable times, including specifically at the time the documents are removed to the Inland Revenue office. This right is designed to ensure that the exercise of the power to remove documents does not unduly disrupt a taxpayerís business. Inland Revenueís administrative guidelines will place the following controls on the use of the Commissionerís new power to remove documents from premises for copying: ïDocuments will only be removed from a personís premises if the Inland Revenue officer considers that it is not practicable to make copies on the premises. ïWhen documents are removed from a personís premises for copying, the person will be given a receipt briefly outlining what documents have been removed. ïInland Revenue will provide persons from whose premises documents are removed with a copy of any removed documents that are copied (unless all the documents removed have been copied in which case the person will be told this). There is also the overriding requirement under administrative law that all public powers must be exercised in good faith. 55 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) Example Set out below is a step-by-step example of the application of the new power to remove documents from a personís premises for copying together with the various controls (contained in both legislation and the departmentís administrative guidelines) that are placed around this power. Inland Revenue is investigating whether a taxpayer company has complied with the tax laws. Inland Revenue investigators exercise their long-standing power under section 16(1) to enter the taxpayerís premises as part of the investigation. The investigators, during their review of the taxpayerís records, come across bank statements relating to an undisclosed offshore account of the taxpayer, the funds in which may be from income that has not been returned by the taxpayer. There is no photocopier on the taxpayerís premises, which means that it is not possible to copy the bank account statements on the premises. (As explained above, administrative guidelines require Inland Revenue staff to make copies of records on a taxpayerís premises, instead of removing those records, where this is reasonably practicable.) The Inland Revenue investigators consider that there is a risk that the bank account statements may be removed or destroyed if an ordinary requisition under section 17 is made to the taxpayer to provide them to the department. The Inland Revenue team leader for the investigation decides that it is necessary to remove the bank statements from the taxpayerís premises for copying at an Inland Revenue office under the power contained in new section 16B(1). The issue of legal professional privilege does not arise in this case because this privilege cannot attach to bank account statements. When the Inland Revenue investigators remove the bank account statements from the taxpayerís premises they give a receipt listing the documents they have removed. The taxpayer exercises its statutory right, under section 16B(4), to inspect and copy the removed documents at the Inland Revenue office where the documents are held. This statutory right can be exercised at all reasonable times, including specifically at the time the bank account statements are removed to the Inland Revenue office. (This statutory right should ensure that the exercise by the department of its power to remove documents does not unduly disrupt the taxpayerís business and will enable the taxpayer to prepare a defence if necessary.) Inland Revenue investigators copy the bank account statements on the following day and return the records at the end of that day to the taxpayerís premises. The investigators inform the taxpayer that all of the bank account statements removed have been copied by the department. Requisition of information held by offshore entities controlled by New Zealand residents Under section 17(1) Inland Revenue has the ability to require a person to produce for inspection any records under the control of that person. Previously, there was uncertainty over the meaning of ìcontrolî and whether documents could be regarded as being under the control of a New Zealand resident if that resident has control of an offshore company which has those documents in its possession. The Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance recommended an amendment to ensure that New Zealand residents could be required to produce such records for inspection in New Zealand. New section 17(1B) allows Inland Revenue to requisition from New Zealand residents information or documents held by offshore entities controlled by the New Zealand residents. The amendment provides that where a non- resident is controlled, directly or indirectly, by a New Zealand resident, any information or document held by the non-resident are treated as being held by the New Zealand resident. For the purpose of applying new section 17(1B), new section 17(1C) treats anything held by a person who is resident in New Zealand or a controlled foreign company, and is associated with the New Zealand resident, as being held by the New Zealand resident. The definition of associated persons for the purposes of this amendment is a combination of the definitions found in sections OD 7 and OD 8(3). The exception to this is that for the purposes of applying the associated persons test pertaining to relatives in section OD 7, two degrees instead of four degrees of relatives will be taken into account. For the purpose of allowing Inland Revenue to requisition from New Zealand residents information or documents held by offshore entities controlled by them, new section 17(1C) also provides that foreign laws relating to the secrecy of information must be ignored. This amendment recognises comments made by the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance, which noted that foreign secrecy 56 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) laws are an important reason for some companies establishing subsidiaries in certain countries in the first place so as to exploit such laws to frustrate investigations by tax authorities in their home countries. Countries such as Australia and the United States already have such provisions for ignoring foreign secrecy laws. Documents to be sent to a specified Inland Revenue office The Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance noted that section 17 required a person to produce documents for inspection only at the personís premises. The Committee considered that it could be more efficient in some cases for documents to be sent to a particular Inland Revenue office. Therefore it recommended that section 17 be amended to give Inland Revenue the discretion to require that documents be sent to a particular Inland Revenue office. Section 17(1D) has been inserted to give effect to this recommendation. Administrative guidelines will provide that if a significant amount of documentation is required, Inland Revenue will agree to a taxpayerís request to send the documents to the nearest Inland Revenue office, which will arrange the forwarding of the documents to the Inland Revenue office conducting the relevant investigation. OTHER POLICY ISSUES DOUBLE TAX AGREEMENTS AND EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction Section BH 1 has been amended to clarify that New Zealand can enter into double tax agreements with other countries that provide for the exchange of information between the two countries in relation to all taxes. Background The change enables New Zealand to follow the most recent OECD Model Tax Convention, which the OECD updated in 2000 to allow for exchanges of information in relation to all taxes, not just income tax. New Zealand double tax agreements that are based on the earlier OECD model allow exchange of information only for income tax purposes. The change will allow future double tax agreements to contain a wider exchange of information provision. Key features The amendment to section BH 1 clarifies that double tax agreements can be entered into that provide for the exchange of information in relation to taxes defined in paragraphs (a)(i)ñ(v) of the definition of ìtaxî in the Tax Administration Act 1994. Application date The amendment applies from 26 March 2003. INCOME TAX EXEMPTION FOR SUPERYACHT CREW Sections CB 2(1)(f), CB 2(3B) and CB 2(4) of the Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction New rules exempt non-resident crew members on visiting superyachts from paying New Zealand income tax on income derived from services performed in New Zealand in relation to a superyacht while it is in New Zealand. Without this change, visiting crew members would be required to pay New Zealand tax on the income they derive while in New Zealand once they had been in the country for more than 92 days, or 183 days if the crew member was from a country with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement. Background The government announced on 28 May 2002 that the legislation would be amended, effective from that date, to exempt crew members of visiting superyachts from paying New Zealand income tax. The measure was added to the bill at the select committee stage of proceedings. There has been a recent increase in the number of superyachts coming to New Zealand. They represent important economic opportunities for New Zealand, but the yachts themselves do not enter into the commerce of New Zealand during their stay. Their purpose is private, domestic and temporary. The crew aboard these yachts have a very tenuous link with New Zealand in that they are employed on a boat temporarily located in New Zealand for tourism or refit purposes. Although short visits would, in most cases have been covered by the general 92-day and 183-day exemptions, longer visits required for refits and maintenance, especially when combined with holidays, were not accommodated by the general exemptions. 57 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) Key features ïThe exemption applies to income derived by non- resident crew members from services performed in New Zealand for a non-resident in relation to a pleasure craft while it is in New Zealand. ïThe crew member must be a non-resident for tax purposes. The residence of a crew member for the purposes of this provision is determined solely by the permanent place of abode test as contained in section OE 1(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994. For the purposes of this provision a crew member cannot be deemed a resident by the time-based test in section OE 1(2) of that Act. ïThe crew-member must not be in New Zealand for more than 365 days in any 24-month period. ïThe crew member must not be in New Zealand unlawfully. This means that the crew member must have immigration authorisation to enter and be present in New Zealand. ïEligible crew members must be a crew member of a pleasure craft as defined by the Maritime Transport Act 1994. A requirement of this definition is that the vessel must not be offered or used for hire or reward. ïThe pleasure craft must be a temporary import within the meaning of the Customs and Excise Act 1996, meaning it must have received a temporary import entry from the New Zealand Customs Service on arriving in New Zealand. ïThe pleasure craft must not be owned by a New Zealand resident or a New Zealand controlled foreign company. As described above, one of the requirements of the exemption is that a crew member must not be in New Zealand for more than 365 days in any 24-month period. For example, a crew member who is in New Zealand for 365 days cannot take advantage of the exemption again until he or she has been outside New Zealand for a further 365 days. A crew member who is in New Zealand for 300 days in year one and then leaves New Zealand can return to New Zealand only for a further 65 days in year two. In year three the crew member may spend a maximum of 300 days in New Zealand. Application date The new rules apply from 28 May 2002. TAX CHANGES RELATING TO CHARITIES Sections CB 4(1)(c) and (e), DI 2, DJ 4, KC 5, and OB 3B of the Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction A variety of changes affect the income tax treatment of charities and donations to charities and similar organisations. These changes were announced in 2001-02 as part of the reviews of the tax treatment of charities and the tax treatment of organisations that manage communally owned M‰ori assets. The changes are: ïThe maximum donations rebate for individual donors has been increased, to $630, in line with inflation since 1990. ïThere is now only one threshold for deductibility of corporate donations, namely, a maximum of 5% of net income. ïM‰ori authorities are now able to claim a comparable deduction. ïThe blanket prohibition on deductions for donations made by close companies has been relaxed for those companies that are listed on a recognised exchange. ïThe legislation is now quite clear that to qualify for the income tax exemption, an entityís charitable purposes have to be carried out in each year the tax exemption is claimed. ïThe public benefit requirement inherent in the concept of charitable purpose has been liberalised with regard to blood ties, and ïIn certain circumstances a marae can have a charitable purpose which means that the body administering that marae may be exempt from income tax. Background Most of these changes were first canvassed in the government discussion document Tax and Charities, released in June 2001. That document dealt with a range of tax issues. It was the first major review of the charities tax legislation since the Working Party on Charities and Sporting Bodies report of 1989. One of the key issues was whether there should be a registration, reporting and monitoring system for charities that claim the exemption from income tax. Another significant issue discussed in the document was whether the definition of ìcharitable purposeî was still appropriate given that it had evolved out of a 1601 58 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) English statute. A number of specific tax issues were also discussed, including the provisions that enable donors a rebate or deduction for their donations to charities. There was significant public interest in the proposals, with over 1600 submissions being received. In response, the government proposed a package of changes and set up a working party comprising charitable sector representatives, to provide recommendations on a registration, reporting and monitoring system for charities. The working party provided its recommendations in early 2002, the prime recommendation being that registration, reporting and monitoring should be carried out by a new entity, a charities commission. At the time the tax bill was introduced, the government was still considering its response to those recommendations and so the bill did not contain any legislative changes relating to a registration, reporting and monitoring system for charities. Nevertheless, the government decided to proceed with the increase in the maximum rebate level and the simplification of the company deduction thresholds. It also decided to proceed with the technical clarification that to qualify for the income tax exemption, an entityís charitable purposes have to be carried out in each year the tax exemption is claimed. This change removes any argument that an entity only has to demonstrate a charitable purpose when it is established. The government has since announced that it intends to introduce separate legislation later this year establishing the charities commission. That legislation would include any consequential tax changes. On whether changes should be made to the definition of ìcharitable purposeî, the government decided to await the outcome of reviews in a number of countries with similar legal frameworks who have been considering the same question, with two exceptions: the public benefit requirement has been liberalised in relation to blood ties and certain marae are now included. Blood ties and the public benefit requirement The public benefit requirement must be satisfied before an entity qualifies as a charity, except in the case of a charity for the relief of poverty. Although the question of whether the public benefit requirement is satisfied is considered on the facts of each case, the courts have developed a number of general tests for determining whether the group benefiting constitutes the public or an appreciably significant section of the public. Through cases such as Re Compton 10 and Oppenheim v Tobacco Securities 11 it has been established that the number of beneficiaries must not be negligible. In addition, even if the number of beneficiaries is large, if those beneficiaries are determined on the basis of a personal relationship such as blood or contractual ties, the entity will not be for the public benefit. Rather it will be for the benefit of private individuals and, therefore, not charitable. 12 The House of Lords (Lord Cross) in Dingle v Turner 13 has questioned the Re Compton and Oppenheim tests, suggesting that the existence of a personal connection such as blood ties or a contract should not be determinative of whether an entity provides a public rather than a private benefit. Rather, consideration should also be given to the nature of the entity and the charitable purpose for which it was established, the number of beneficiaries and the degree of connection between the beneficiaries. Although the Re Compton and Oppenheim tests have continued to be applied in the English courts, Lord Crossís comments have been noted with approval in two recent New Zealand cases. 14 Consequently, there has been a degree of uncertainty in New Zealand as to whether trusts for the benefit of persons who are determined by either a blood or contractual relationship will satisfy the public benefit requirement. The inability of an entity to qualify for charitable status when its beneficiaries are determined on the basis of bloodlines was raised by the M‰ori community as a major concern, although it is by no means an issue limited to M‰ori. Although M‰ori organisations often provide benefits of a charitable nature to iwi and hapu, they might not qualify for an exemption because their benefit extends to a specified group of people connected by blood ties. This issue has been addressed as part of the recent legislative changes. Marae and charitable income tax exemption The tax status of marae and their ability to qualify for an income tax exemption as charities was also raised as a significant issue for M‰ori during the review of the taxation of organisations that manage communally owned M‰ori assets. Although marae are used to carry out similar functions to churches and public halls, the entities administering them were unable to gain the same charitable tax exemption as these institutions because of the public benefit requirement and the uncertainty about whether maintaining marae was a charitable purpose at common 10 \[1945\] 1 All ER 198 11 \[1951\] 1 All ER 31 12 In Oppenheimís case a gift for the education of the children of the employees and former employees of the company and its subsidiaries failed to qualify as a charity because the employees of a firm were not a public class. This was in spite of the fact that at the testatorís death the number of employees exceeded 110,000. 13 \[1972\] AC 601 14 New Zealand Society of Accountants v CIR \[1986\] 1 NZLR 147, Educational Fees Protection Society Incorporated v CIR(1991) 13 NZTC 8,203. 59 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) law. This issue became a matter of priority for marae that wished to access funding from other charitable entities such as community trusts. If marae did not have this exemption, they generally did not gain access to this funding. This issue was first raised in the discussion document Taxation of M‰ori Organisations, released in August 2001. Key features Donations rebate The maximum rebate able to be claimed by an individual donor under section KC 5(2) (b) is to be changed from $500 to $630. Since the rebate rate is 33.33 cents in the dollar, this increase means that the maximum amount of donations qualifying for the rebate increases from $1500 to $1890. The rebate applies to gifts of $5 or more to a range of organisations and funds carrying out charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes within New Zealand. Additional criteria apply to organisations carrying out such purposes overseas, and such organisations are specifically named in section KC 5(1). Donations deduction for companies Section DJ 4 has been completely rewritten. The old section DJ 4(a) limit of the greater of 1% of net income or $4000 on donations by companies to individual organisations referred to in section KC 5(1) has been removed, as has the $1000 limit in the old section DJ 4(b)(i). This just leaves one limitóthe aggregate limit of all gifts made in any one year of 5% of net income (the old section DJ 4(b)(ii)). These changes were made to simplify the limits. M‰ori authoritiesí donations M‰ori authorities are also now able to claim a comparable deduction, through an amendment to section DI 2. This point is discussed in the chapter on the tax changes in relation to M‰ori authorities. Close companies listed on recognised exchange The rewritten section DJ 4 also enables a close company to deduct its donations if its shares are quoted on the official list of a recognised exchange. Previously, all close companies were precluded from deducting their donations to protect minority shareholders, as well as provide some level of protection for the tax base. The restriction is unnecessary in the case of companies listed on the stock exchange given directorsí fiduciary duties to shareholders, and the public scrutiny and disclosure requirements to which listed companies are subject. Both ìclose companyî and ìrecognised exchangeî are defined terms in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act. A ìclose companyî is essentially a company that is controlled by five or fewer natural person shareholders through their having a combined interest in the company of more than 50%. ìRecognised exchangeî basically means any recognised exchange market anywhere in the world that is a medium for bringing willing buyers and sellers of shares or options together to determine armís length prices which are likely to prove fair and reasonable. Such factors as the number of participants and the frequency of trading are taken into account. The New Zealand Stock Exchange is an example. Charitable purposes to be maintained Amendments have also been made to sections CB 4(1)(c) and (e) to verify the continuing nature of the requirement to be carrying out a charitable purpose, by adding the words ìand maintainedî after ìestablishedî. However, it is not intended that a charity must distribute all of its income in each year to achieve a continuing purpose. Funds, for example, may be invested pending some major item of expense which may be a reasonable accumulation for (ultimate) charitable purposes. Although the intention is that charitable purposes need to be maintained by trusts as well as societies and institutions, arguably the previous wording already achieved this in the case of trusts. This is because the tax exemption applies to income derived for charitable purposesóin other words, at the time the income is derived the trust must have charitable purposes. In that sense the words ìand maintainedî do not need to specifically apply to trusts. Those words do, however, need to apply to other societies and institutions. This is because the previous legislation arguably conferred a tax exemption on a society or institution ìestablished for charitable purposesî whether or not it was still maintaining those purposes at the time the relevant income was earned. This situation has been clarified in the Income Tax Bill, which is before Parliament. Blood ties and the public benefit requirement A new section OB 3B(1) clarifies that the purpose of a trust, society or institution is a charitable purpose under the Income Tax Act if it would satisfy the public benefit requirement apart from the fact that the beneficiaries of the trust, or the members of the society or institution, are related by blood. The change applies to all New Zealand organisations, but it is especially relevant to M‰ori organisations as many define their beneficiary class by a personal relationship (through blood ties) to a named person. 60 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) In determining whether a trust, society or institution meets the public benefit requirement, other factors will still be relevant, such as the nature of the entity, the activities it undertakes, the potential beneficiary class, the relationship between the beneficiaries and the number of potential beneficiaries. These factors were enumerated in the Dingle v Turner decision. Marae with charitable purposes New section OB 3B(2) specifies that in certain circumstances marae can have a charitable purpose, which means that the entity that administers that marae may qualify for an income tax exemption under section CB 4(1)(c) and (e). Donations made to them would also qualify for rebates and deductions under, respectively, sections KC 5 and DJ 4. A trust, society or institution that administers a marae that is situated on a M‰ori reservation may qualify for an exemption provided it only uses its funds: ïfor charitable purposes, and/or ïto administer and maintain the maraeís physical structure or land. (This would include any capital improvements to the physical structure or the land.) A M‰ori reservation is an area of land that is set aside for specific purposes, such as a marae, in accordance with the process set out in section 338 of Te Ture Whenua M‰ori 1993 (M‰ori Land Act 1993). Entities administering marae that are not situated on M‰ori reservations may still qualify for an exemption from income tax under the general charitable purposes definition, in the same way as entities administering churches and public halls. Application dates ïThe changes to the donations rebate and deduction provisions take effect from the 2002-03 income year. ïM‰ori authorities can deduct their donations from the 2003-04 income year. ïThe change verifying that charitable purposes have to be continuing to qualify for the income tax exemption applies from the 2003-04 income year. ïLiberalisation of the public benefit requirement in relation to blood ties applies from the beginning of the 2003-04 income year. ïThe change in relation to certain marae having ìcharitable purposesî applies from the 2003-04 income year. ORGANISATIONS APPROVED FOR CHARITABLE DONEE STATUS Section KC 5(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 The following organisations have been granted charitable donee status from the 2002-2003 income year: ïOpen Home Foundation International Trust ïRegister of Engineers for Disaster Relief New Zealand ïThe Hillary Himalayan Foundation, and ïTogether for Uganda. Donations made to these organisation will entitle individual taxpayers to a rebate of 33 1 / 3 % of the amount donated. The maximum rebate for all donations is $630 per annum. A non-closely held company, or a closely held company which is listed on a recognised stock exchange, will be entitled to a deduction from its net income to a maximum of 5% of that income. Another organisation Save the Children New Zealand, which already has donee status, was previously known as The Save the Children Fund. A change has been made to reflect the correct name and the structure under which it now operates. PAYE BY INTERMEDIARIES Sections LD 1, NBB 1 to NBB 8, NC 2, NC 5, NC 12A, NC 15, NC 18 to NC 20, OB 1, and OZ 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 Sections 24, 36A, 48, 120OB, 120OC, 139AA, 141JB, 156A, 157, 167, 168, 169, 173MB, 185B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Sections 2, 19, 24, 25, 51, 67 and 77 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 Sections 147, 165 and 166 of the Child Support Act 1991 Sections 6, 221, 316 and schedule 4 of the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Compensation Act 2001 Introduction Amendments to the various Inland Revenue Acts allow employers the option of using accredited intermediaries to largely assume an employerís obligations under the PAYE rules. Under the changes, the intermediary would 61 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) be responsible for calculating PAYE, paying it to Inland Revenue, and filing returns. The transfer of these obligations to PAYE intermediaries will mean that employers who meet the requirements to provide basic payroll information and the gross salary or wages of their employees to intermediaries in a timely manner will not face any penalties for the incorrect application of the PAYE rules. Background The ìPAYE by intermediaries initiativeî was raised in the government discussion document More time for business, in response to two main compliance issues raised by employers: the time spent keeping up to date with PAYE requirements and the risk that PAYE deductions are not available to be paid to Inland Revenue when due. Small businesses, in particular, face a disproportionate cost in applying the PAYE rules as the compliance cost of employing the first employee is higher than the cost of employing each additional employee (with the marginal cost reducing significantly with each extra employee). Although employers are allowed to retain the tax they deduct on behalf of employees for a while, this benefit is not significant for many small businesses owing to the small size of the deductions. More importantly, small businesses without well managed budget processes run the risk that funds will not be available when PAYE is required to be paid to Inland Revenue. To resolve these problems, some employers already delegate their PAYE obligations to third parties such as payroll firms. However, in the past, the cost of transferring information created a barrier to many small businesses using these firms, and employers had statutory responsibility for applying the PAYE rules, even if they used a third party to calculate and pay tax. This effectively meant that employers carried the risk that their obligations under the PAYE rules were not met in all instances. The new legislation is intended to remove the obstacles to payroll firms (and other interested parties) acting as intermediaries between employers and Inland Revenue, and therefore the barriers that discourage employers from using specialists to do this work. Under the changes, intermediaries would be responsible for calculating PAYE, paying it and filing returns. The transfer of these obligations to PAYE intermediaries will mean that employers who meet the requirements to provide basic payroll information and the gross salary or wages of their employees to intermediaries in a timely manner will not face any penalties for the incorrect application of the PAYE rules. Equally, if an intermediary defaults on the payment of PAYE to Inland Revenue, the intermediary, not the employer, will be responsible for making up the shortfall. Key features The main change is new sub-part NBB of the Income Tax Act 1994. As well as describing the purpose of the new legislation and recognising a PAYE intermediary as an entity in the PAYE rules, it contains the rules in relation to: ïthe accreditation of PAYE intermediaries by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ïthe Commissionerís approval of employer arrangements with PAYE intermediaries and the obligations on employers who enter into such arrangements ïthe obligations on PAYE intermediaries ïhow the gross salary or wages of employees, paid over by employers, and held on trust by PAYE intermediaries are to be applied, and ïthe termination of employer arrangements with PAYE intermediaries. The PAYE rules previously focussed on the actions of employers. Under the ìPAYE by intermediariesî initiative, a number of consequential amendments have been made to the PAYE rules (in sub-part NC) to extend the scope of the rules to include intermediaries. Generally, this has involved including references to ìPAYE intermediaryî (defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994) in instances which previously referred only to ìemployerî. Changes have not been made, however, to extend the references to ìemployerî, which relate to the underlying employment relationship: employees will still receive gross salary or wages (source deduction payments) from the employer, regardless of the fact that it may actually be paid through a PAYE intermediary. The employer, and not the PAYE intermediary, will be responsible for the underlying payment to employees. Changes have also been made to the penalties and use-of- money interest rules in the Tax Administration Act 1994 to reflect the new role of PAYE intermediaries. Employers who provide gross salary or wages and the correct payroll information to the intermediary within specified or mutually agreed upon times will not be liable for penalties for any breach of the PAYE rules. Changes have been made to the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Compensation Act 2001, the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 and the Child Support Act 1991 to allow PAYE intermediaries to also make a number of other statutory deductions from employeesí gross salary or wages. These include deductions in respect of ACC levies, student loan repayments, and child support, respectively, which are typically returned with PAYE. 62 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) Application date Sub-part NBB of the Income Tax Act 1994 applies from 15 January 2004. This is to allow interested parties sufficient time to apply to the Commissioner to be accredited as a PAYE intermediary before the effective application date of the new rulesó1 April 2004. A PAYE intermediary will be able to enter into an arrangement with an employer only in respect of pay periods beginning on or after this date. Detailed analysis Accreditation of intermediaries Section NBB 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994 sets out the administrative process for applying to be accredited as a PAYE intermediary, the criteria to be used by the Commissioner to accredit, and the rules for revoking accreditation. Employers who wish to transfer their PAYE obligations to a third party will be able to transfer them only to an accredited PAYE intermediary. When applying to be accredited as a PAYE intermediary, notice will need to be given to the Commissioner that an applicant: ïhas established a trust account to hold the gross salary or wages to be paid over by employers (and providing the details of the account) ïhas administration and information technology systems that will keep employer and employee payroll and payment information safe and secure, and ïis not a discharged or undischared bankrupt, has not been convicted of an offence involving fraud, and is eligible to be a company director. These criteria will apply to any officers or principals of the applicant. The Commissioner may accredit the applicant as a PAYE intermediary if the Commissioner is satisfied that the applicant will comply with the PAYE rules and has the administration and information technology systems to make tax payments and file returns in a prescribed format (for example, electronically). Accreditation, if given, will last for a specified period. Inland Revenue will revoke the accreditation of a PAYE intermediary if the intermediary: ïfails to comply with the PAYE rules, or ïhas been made bankrupt, convicted of a fraudulent offence, put into liquidation or receivership, or (if a company) ceases to be registered in New Zealand. Once notice is given to a PAYE intermediary (and any employer who has entered into an arrangement with the intermediary) that accreditation has been revoked, arrangements entered into must end within 14 days of the notice being issued. Obligations on employers Section NBB 3 and NBB 4 outline the responsibilities of employers who wish to enter into arrangements with an accredited PAYE intermediary to transfer their PAYE obligations to the intermediary. To administer the new system and verify that a person engaged by an employer is accredited as a PAYE intermediary, Inland Revenue will need to know from the employer, in advance of an arrangement, the identity of the intermediary, the period for which the intermediary will act on the employerís behalf, and into which bank account employeesí gross salary or wages will be deposited (the intermediaryís trust account details). An arrangement will only become valid once the Commissioner approves the arrangement and gives notice to the employer of this fact. An arrangement can then begin, at the earliest, from a pay period starting 14 days after the notice approving the arrangement has been issued. Employers, for the term of an arrangement with a PAYE intermediary, will be required to pay the gross salary or wages of their employees into the intermediaryís trust account, by the date specified by the intermediary. They will also be required to provide basic employee and payroll information requested by the intermediary within the time agreed by both the employer and the intermediary. If an employer meets these obligations, the PAYE intermediary will bear responsibility for calculating PAYE, filing the appropriate returns and making tax payments on time. Employers will still be required to keep records of gross salary or wages paid so that Inland Revenue can verify that intermediaries have appropriately distributed the funds received from employers. Obligations on PAYE intermediaries Section NBB 5 sets out the main obligations on PAYE intermediaries. Before entering into an arrangement with an employer, an intermediary will be required to inform the employer that Inland Revenue does not guarantee the payment of net salary or wages to employees of the employer (if the intermediary were to default on this responsibility). The intermediary will also be required to provide the employer with a copy of the notice sent to the Commissioner, when applying to be accredited. The main obligations on PAYE intermediaries will be to calculate and pay PAYE, meet filing requirements, and keep records of these functions as though they were the employer. Intermediaries will also be able to make amended returns for an employer, relating to periods before the PAYE intermediary arrangement began. This is to address situations where an employer, before engaging a PAYE intermediary, may have struggled to comply with its PAYE obligations. Consequently, the PAYE intermediary may wish to correct any past errors made by the employer as part of taking over the 63 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) employerís PAYE obligations. Here, the intermediary will be responsible for filing a correct, amended return. Any underlying tax liability (as well as penalties) resulting from the amended return will, however, be the responsibility of the employer. Gross salary or wages to be held on trust Section NBB 6 sets out the requirements for setting up and operating the trust account into which employers must deposit gross salary or wages. Deposits to an intermediaryís trust account will be limited to: ïthe gross salary or wages of employees ïrefunds of PAYE by the Commissioner, and ïinterest earned on monies held in the account. Under section NBB 7, the Commissioner will be able to refund PAYE paid by an intermediary if the underlying payment (of gross salary or wages) by an employer into the intermediaryís trust account has been dishonoured. Interest earned on funds held on trust will accrue to the intermediary. Withdrawals from an intermediaryís trust account will be limited to: ïpayment of net salary or wages to employees ïpayment of PAYE and other statutory deductions to Inland Revenue ïnon-tax deductions on behalf of employees, and ïinterest earned on the account. In addition to their PAYE role, intermediaries will also be able to make and remit deductions required under the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Compensation Act 2001, the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 and the Child Support Act 1991. They will also be able to make non-tax deductions on behalf of employees that would otherwise be made by the employer, such as union fees, healthcare and life insurance premiums, and superannuation contributions. Interest will be available to be withdrawn by intermediaries. Terminating arrangements between employers and PAYE intermediaries Section NBB 8 sets out the rules for ceasing arrangements between employers and PAYE intermediaries. Either party to the arrangement can terminate it by giving notice to the other and the Commissioner. Equally, the Commissioner will be able to terminate an arrangement by revoking the accreditation of a PAYE intermediary. To ensure certainty in arrangements between employers and PAYE intermediaries, termination will need to be prospective, with any funds held by an intermediary at the time an arrangement ceases being dealt with as if the arrangement was still in effect (meaning the intermediary will retain responsibility for application of the PAYE rules in respect of those amounts, including filing returns and paying deductions). This is important given the possible time lag between the deposit of gross salary or wages and the dates when payment of net salary or wages and deductions occur. The penalties and interest rules for PAYE intermediaries Various changes have been made to Part IX of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to reflect the responsibility of PAYE intermediaries for applying the PAYE rules. Under section 141JB, intermediaries will be liable for late filing, late payment and shortfall penalties if employers have provided gross salary or wages and the correct payroll information to the intermediary within the time specified or agreed to by the parties. Changes to section 139AA mean that PAYE intermediaries will also be subject to the non-electronic filing penalty if they fail to file returns (such as employer monthly schedules) in the prescribed electronic format. Sections 120OB and 120OC have been added to Part VII to extend the use-of-money interest rules to PAYE intermediaries. This section will impose interest on intermediaries who fail to meet their PAYE payment obligations by the appropriate due date. Use-of-money interest will be payable to PAYE intermediaries who overpay PAYE. A number of consequential changes have also been made to the tax and penalty recovery provisions in Part X. For example, changes to sections 167 to 169 provide that if a PAYE intermediary receives gross salary or wages and the relevant information from an employer but fails to make the deductions, these amounts can be recovered from the intermediary. Similarly, changes to sections 156A and 157 allow the Commissioner to recover any penalties imposed, from intermediaries. Part XI has been amended to extend the remission criteria for late filing and late payment penalties to include PAYE intermediaries. Similarly, provisions dealing with the cancellation of interest and the payment of refunds when tax is overpaid have been amended to apply to PAYE intermediaries as well. Other statutory deductions Employers may be required by statute to make a number of non-tax deductions from employeesí gross wages and to remit them with PAYE. If an employer enters into an arrangement with a PAYE intermediary to transfer its PAYE obligations to the intermediary, the intermediary will also be responsible for making these other statutory deductions. Those deductions include the earner levy under the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Compensation Act 2001, 64 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) student loan repayment deductions under the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992, and child support under the Child Support Act 1991. A number of amendments have been made to these Acts to ensure that PAYE intermediaries are able to make the relevant deductions and are liable if these obligations are not met. TAX POOLING Part MBB, and sections NF 1(2) and OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 Sections 36BB, 120C, 120OD and 157(10) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction Amendments to the Inland Revenue Acts allow taxpayers to pool their provisional tax payments with those of other taxpayers, with the result that underpayments may be offset by overpayments within the same pool. Background The tax pooling proposal was raised in the discussion document More time for business, issued in May 2001, in response to taxpayer concerns over difficulties in calculating provisional tax and the resulting exposure to use-of-money interest. Often the amount of provisional tax due is uncertain, since taxpayers often base their payments on an estimate of expected income over the next year. Those who, as a result, underpay their provisional tax must pay use-of- money interest on the difference; those who overpay receive use-of-money interest on the difference. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that many taxpayers consider that the rate of interest the government pays on tax overpayments to be too low and the rate it charges on underpayments too high, although the rates are based on market principles. Tax pooling will allow businesses to pool provisional tax payments, offsetting underpayments by overpayments within the same pool, thereby reducing use-of-money interest exposure. The pooling arrangement will be made through a commercial intermediary, who will arrange for participating taxpayers to be charged or compensated for the offsetóparticipating taxpayers will pay or receive interest on their tax underpayments or overpayments. Intermediaries will be able to pay a higher rate of interest to taxpayers who have overpaid their tax into the pool, and charge a lower rate of interest to those who have underestimated their tax, and have therefore borrowed from the pool, than the rates of use-of-money interest. The commercial intermediaries make their money by arbitraging the interest rate differential between the governmentís rates and their own (lower) financing costs. Key features The main change is introduction of the new Part MBB in the Income Tax Act 1994. This Part sets out the rules relating to the establishment and operation of a tax pooling account, including: ïrequirements to be met by a person wishing to become a tax pooling intermediary (hereafter referred to as the ìintermediaryî) and the personís continuing responsibilities in maintaining a tax pooling account ïrules governing the making of deposits to, and transfers from, a tax pooling account, and ïrules governing the winding up of a tax pooling account. Several further, minor, amendments have also been made to the Inland Revenue Acts. These, in conjunction with Part MBB, will ensure that the correct rules apply with respect to the application of the resident withholding tax rules, the provision of information to the Commissioner by an intermediary, the application of the rules relating to use-of-money interest and the recovery of tax in default. Application date The tax pooling provisions apply from 1 April 2003. Detailed analysis Changes to Income Tax Act 1994 Purpose of proposal Section MBB 1 provides that the purpose of tax pooling is to allow taxpayers to manage their provisional tax payment risks by: ïreducing use-of-money interest on underpaid tax, and ïincreasing use of money interest on overpaid tax. Section MBB 2 provides for the mechanism by which a taxpayer may do so. It states that a taxpayer may agree with a person who holds a tax pooling account that the person will act as an intermediary between the taxpayer and the Commissioner, in using funds from the tax pooling account to meet the taxpayerís obligations to pay provisional tax. Requirements for establishing a tax pooling account Section MBB 3 sets out the requirements to be met by a person wishing to establish a tax pooling account. Subsection (1) provides that the person must firstly apply to the Commissioner for approval, providing certain information and giving the following assurances: ïthat they have administration and information technology systems capable of allowing them to meet their continuing responsibilities in maintaining a tax pooling account 65 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) ïthat they have established a trust account into which they will pay amounts that they receive from taxpayers for the purposes of tax pooling ïthat they have no history of bankruptcy or offences involving dishonesty; and that they would be eligible to be a company director ïthat, before acting as an intermediary for a taxpayer, they will: −inform the taxpayer that the Commissioner is not required to oversee or audit the operation of the tax pooling account −inform the taxpayer that the Commissioner is not liable for any loss that the taxpayer may suffer by virtue of intermediary default, and −ensure that the taxpayer is aware of all the matters concerning which they have given assurances to the Commissioner. Subsection (2) provides that, if the Commissioner is satisfied that all of the requirements have been met by the applicant, the Commissioner may give written approval for the applicant to establish a tax pooling account. Operation of a tax pooling account Section MBB 4 sets out a number of rules governing the continuing operation of a tax pooling account. Subsection (2) provides that, once established with Inland Revenue by an intermediary, a tax pooling account does not relate to a particular income year, and continues until it is wound up. (The new legislation includes rules governing winding upóthese are discussed under section MBB 8.) Importantly, subsection (3) provides that an intermediary who accepts a payment from a taxpayer for deposit in a tax pooling account must give notice to the taxpayer that the payment does not, at that stage, satisfy the taxpayerís tax obligations. The amount will not become ìtax paidî until a transfer is made from the tax pooling account to the taxpayerís individual tax account with Inland Revenue (discussed under section MBB 6). The intermediary must ensure that the taxpayer is given notice of this fact. If default on the part of an intermediary does result in a taxpayerís provisional tax payment obligations not being met, the taxpayer will have recourse to the usual legal avenues for obtaining compensation from the intermediary. Additionally, section 183A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for the remittance of late payment penalties where reasonable cause exists. Where an intermediary has failed to transfer a taxpayerís payment to the department as requested, the taxpayer would be able to obtain relief under this section. In order to ensure that the taxpayerís privacy interests are protected in the operation of the tax pooling account, subsection (4) provides that the intermediary must maintain and operate administration and information technology systems that protect the confidentiality of the taxpayerís personal information and payment details. Additionally, the systems must record the amount that has been deposited by the taxpayer to the account, at any particular time. Specific provision is made, in subsection (5), that the Commissioner is not required to oversee or audit the operation of a tax pooling account. Additionally, subsection (6) provides that the Commissioner is not liable for any loss that the taxpayer may suffer through intermediary default. Deposits to a tax pooling account Section MBB 5 sets out a number of rules governing the making of deposits to a tax pooling account. These are largely designed to protect the interests of taxpayers participating in a tax pool. Subsection (1) provides that, when a deposit is made to a tax pooling account by an intermediary, certain information must be supplied to the Commissioner, by electronic meansóthe intermediary must supply the name and tax file number of each taxpayer who has contributed to the amount deposited, and the amount contributed. This provides Inland Revenue with sufficient notice that the taxpayer will be participating in a tax pooling arrangement. It also enables taxpayers to check with the department that their payment has been deposited correctly by the intermediary. Subsection (1B) provides that, upon receiving the deposit and the accompanying information, the Commissioner will supply the intermediary with confirmation of receipt and the account into which the deposit has been paid. This will also enable taxpayers to check with their tax pooling intermediary whether their payment has been deposited correctly. If the intermediary does not supply this information to the Commissioner within five working days of the deposit, subsection (2) provides that it must be refunded to the intermediary. This combination of provisions ensures that, at any particular point in time, a taxpayerís contribution and continuing interest in a tax pool can be confirmed and identified. To provide additional security for taxpayersí deposits, subsection (3) states that a deposit to a tax pooling account is held by the intermediary in trust for the contributing taxpayer, until it has been dealt with on behalf of the taxpayer. As noted earlier, the purpose of tax pooling is to allow taxpayers to manage their provisional tax payment risks by reducing use-of-money interest on underpaid tax and increasing use-of-money interest on overpaid tax. It is important, therefore, that the legislation clearly sets out the way use-of-money interest is to apply to amounts deposited to and transferred from a tax pooling account. 66 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) Subsection (3B) provides that an amount deposited in a tax pooling account accrues use-of-money interest, to the benefit of the intermediary, from the date the deposit was made. This interest is payable to the intermediary up to either: ïthe effective date of the credit of the amount to another account with the Commissioner (being a taxpayerís individual tax account), or ïthe date that the amount is refunded by the Commissioner back to the intermediary. To further reinforce that an amount deposited to a tax pooling account will not become ìtax paidî until a transfer is made from the account to a taxpayerís individual tax account, subsection (4) specifically provides that such an amount is only treated as ìtax paidî by the intermediary for the purpose of calculating use-of- money interestóand for no other purpose. Transfers from a tax pooling account Section MBB 6 sets out a number of rules governing transfers from a tax pooling account to a taxpayerís individual tax account. Subsection (1) provides that an intermediary may, at any time, request that the Commissioner transfer an amount in the tax pooling account to a taxpayerís individual tax account. There must, however, be sufficient funds in the tax pooling account on the date to which the amount is to be transferred. Additionally, the taxpayer to whom the transfer is to be made must be a client of the intermediary óthis is to ensure that the tax pooling rules cannot be used to undermine the rules governing the transfers of overpaid tax, which were enacted in 2001. Subsection (1B) provides that transfers from a tax pooling account will be credited to a taxpayerís individual tax account as at the effective date elected by the intermediary. The only exception to this is where a taxpayerís terminal tax date has passed by 60 days, and the taxpayer to whom the transfer is to be made is exposed to penalties for failing to meet their minimum provisional tax obligations. In this case, a request for a transfer will be treated as being made at the date of the intermediaryís request, not the effective date. The purpose of the pooling rules is to enable taxpayers to better manage their provisional tax payments and to reduce their use-of-money interest costs. This purpose must, however, be balanced against the need to ensure that taxpayers maintain reasonable compliance with the provisional tax rules. When taxpayers fail to meet their minimum provisional tax obligations on a continuing basis, they should not be able to gain an unfair advantage from the proposal. For these taxpayers, at a certain point in time, the ability to offset resulting use-of-money interest and penalties should cease. This point is reached within a reasonable period beyond a taxpayerís terminal tax dateóby this stage the taxpayer should have met provisional tax payment obligations for the income year. Subsection (1B) provides, therefore, that once a period of 60 days beyond their terminal tax date has passed, if taxpayers are exposed to penalties for failing to meet their minimum provisional tax payment obligations, a request for a transfer will be treated as being made at the date of the request, not the effective payment date, for both use-of-money interest and penalty purposes. If taxpayers have complied with their minimum obligations, but beyond 60 days following terminal tax date still find themselves owing tax (that is, after a reassessment) they will be able to usee the tax pooling rules to offset any potential penalties and use-of-money interest. Subsection (2) provides that, when an intermediary requests a transfer from a tax pooling account, it must supply the Commissioner with the following details, by electronic means: ïthe details of the taxpayer to whom the transfer is to be made to ïthe amount of the transfer ïthe date the amount is to be transferred, and ïthe effective date to which the transfer is to be made. Subsection (4) provides the Commissioner cannot action a request for a transfer if these details have not been provided. Likewise, under subsection (3), the Commissioner cannot do so if the available funds in the pooling account comprise deposits concerning which the intermediary has not provided the information required by section MBB 5 (discussed earlier). Once an amount has been transferred from the tax pooling account to an individual taxpayerís account, subsection (5) provides that the Commissioner must supply a statement to the intermediary and the taxpayer confirming that the action has been taken. Subsection (6) confirms that an amount so transferred to an individual taxpayerís account is income tax paid to meet a provisional tax obligation. Subsection (7) deals with the interaction of the imputation credit account rules with tax pooling. Subsection (8) is a general anti-avoidance provision. It provides that the Commissioner may refuse to accept a request for a transfer, or may reverse a previously actioned transfer, if the Commissioner considers that the request for the transfer is or was made for the purpose or effect of tax avoidance. Refunds from a tax pooling account Section MBB 7 provides that an intermediary may request a refund of all or part of the balance in their tax pooling account, at any time. 67 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) Winding up of tax pooling account Section MBB 8 sets out a number of rules governing the winding up of a tax pooling account. Subsection (1) provides that an intermediary may wind up its tax pooling account at any time. Subsection (2) provides that the Commissioner may instigate a winding up, if the Commissioner considers that: ïthe intermediary is preventing taxpayers from managing their liability to pay provisional tax and use-of-money interest, or ïthe intermediary is, or has been, in breach of any statutory obligations, or ï the tax pooling account has gone into deficit, or ïthere is, or is likely to be, consistently fewer than 100 taxpayers contributing at any one time to the tax pool, or ïthe intermediary has been made bankrupt, or has been convicted of an offence involving dishonesty, or would not be eligible to be a company director, or ïthe intermediary has been placed into liquidation or receivership. If the Commissioner intends to instigate a winding up because that there are, or are likely to be, consistently fewer than 100 taxpayers contributing at any one time to the tax pool, subsection (3) provides that he must first give 30 daysí notice to the intermediary. This is to give the intermediary time to bring the number of taxpayers back to the required level before the winding up action is instigated. When a tax pooling account is wound up, subsection (4) provides that the Commissioner may refund the funds in the tax pooling account to the intermediary. However, the subsection also provides that, if the Commissioner has reason to believe that the tax pooling account funds may not be distributed back to the contributing taxpayers in the correct amounts, the Commissioner may apply to the court for directions as to the redistribution of the funds. Income tax treatment of payments of interest Section MBB 9 provides that, for the purposes of the Actís deductibility provisions, payments made either to an intermediary by a client taxpayer, or by an intermediary to a client taxpayer, that are in the nature of interest are deductible. Resident withholding tax treatment of payments of interest An amendment to section NF 1(2)(a) ensures that the resident withholding tax treatment of interest paid to and by an intermediary mirrors that applied to use-of-money interest generallyóthat is, intermediaries are required to withhold the tax from interest payments made to taxpayers, but taxpayers are not required to withhold the tax when making interest payments to intermediaries. Changes to Tax Administration Act 1994 Format of information to be supplied to the Commissioner A new section 36BB provides that information to be supplied by the intermediary, in relation to deposits made under section MBB 5(1) and transfers made under section MBB 6(2), must be in an electronic format approved by the Commissioner. Deduction of outstanding tax An amendment to section 157 includes amounts paid by a taxpayer to an intermediary for the purposes of tax pooling as ìincome taxî for the purposes of this section. This ensures that Inland Revenue has recourse to these funds, if necessary, to offset outstanding tax owed by the taxpayer. GST treatment of intermediaries No specific GST treatment for intermediaries is provided on the basis that the current law is sufficient. Part of the service provided by an intermediary may be subject to GST: namely, the provision of the trustee structure, the establishing and maintaining of customer accounts, and the clearing and settlement processes. Services relating to the tax deposits made to Inland Revenue may be a debt security and thereby fall within the definition of a financial service, and hence be exempt from GST. 68 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) CONFIRMATION OF ANNUAL INCOME TAX RATES FOR 2002ñ2003 Schedule 1, Income Tax Act 1994 The income tax rates for the 2002-2003 income year have been confirmed as follows: Policyholder income33 cents for every $1 of schedular taxable income M‰ori authorities25 cents for every $1 of taxable income Undistributed rents, royalties and interest of the M‰ori Trustee income25 cents for every $1 of taxable Companies, public authorities and local authorities income33 cents for every $1 of taxable Trustee income (including that of trustees of superannuation funds) income33 cents for every $1 of taxable Trustees of group investment funds33 cents for every $1 of schedular taxable income in respect of category A income Taxable distributions from non-qualifying trusts distribution45 cents for every $1 of taxable Other taxpayers (including individuals) −Income not exceeding $38,00019.5 cents for every $1 of taxable income −Income exceeding $38,000 but not exceeding $60,00033 cents for every $1 of taxable income −Income exceeding $60,00039 cents for every $1 of taxable income Specified superannuation contribution39 cents for every $1 of the withholding tax contribution where the employee has made an election under section NE 2AA 33 cents for every $1 of contribution where no such election is made. arrangement may have been entered into to obtain a tax advantage. However, the information required to calculate the relevant ratios is already provided to Inland Revenue in the company income tax and imputation return. It is, therefore, possible for the Commissioner to calculate the ratios and to determine whether there has been a change of more than 20% between years. If the Commissioner determines that there has been a variation that warrants further investigation, the company can then be required to provide an explanation for the change. This change was recommended by the Finance and Expenditure Committee, in its consideration of the bill. Key features Sections 69(2), 69(3) and 69(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 have been repealed. Section 69(2) required a company to disclose in its annual imputation account if the ratio of imputation and dividend withholding payment credits to total dividends paid, and the ratio of debits to credits in the imputation credit account changed by more than 20% over the preceding year. Section 69(2) also required an explanation for the change to be furnished. The income tax rates confirmed are the same rates that applied for the 2001-02 income year. The rates apply for the 2002-2003 income year. REQUIREMENT TO DISCLOSE CHANGES IN IMPUTATION RATIOS Former sections 69(2), 69(3) and 69(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction The requirement to disclose changes to imputation ratios if the ratios have increased or decreased by more than 20% from the previous year, and to furnish an explanation for the change, has been removed. Background The reason for requiring companies to disclose significant variation in these ratios was to identify cases where an 69 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) Section 69(3) contained the formulae for the ratios, and section 69(4) described the impact of conduit tax relief on the ratios. Application date The change applies from the 2002-03 imputation year. GST AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES Sections 2, 8(3)ñ(4), 8A, 11A(5), 11AB and 51(1)(e) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Introduction The GST treatment of cross-border supplies of telecommunications services has been clarified by inserting a new place of supply rule, zero-rating provisions and definitions. Although in policy terms it is clear that supplies of telecommunications services should be subject to GST in New Zealand when they are consumed in New Zealand, the general place of supply rule and zero-rating provisions in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 were not easily applied to cross-border supplies of telecommunications services. This led to uncertainty as to when supplies of telecommunications services were subject to GST in New Zealand, and when they were not. The amendments reduce this uncertainty by inserting provisions dealing specifically with cross-border supplies of telecommunications services. Background The nature of telecommunications services means that it can be difficult to state with certainty where the services are performed. Determining where services are performed is important as in many instances the GST Act (for instance, former section 8(2)(a) and section 11A(1)(j)) looks to where a service is physically performed to determine its treatment. The concept of physical performance does not fit well with the nature of telecommunications services. Overseas case law suggests that the physical performance of telecommunications services takes place where the telecommunications equipment (such as satellite dishes and exchanges) used to provide the service is situated. 15 The physical performance test can be particularly difficult to apply in cases where cross-border telecommunications services are supplied, as in many instances the supplier of the services will have equipment located in both countries (such as a satellite station) to complete the ìcircuitî needed for a telephone call. There can also be uncertainty as to who is receiving the supply of telecommunications services. For example, in an international call between two consumers, either fixed line or mobile, there will be component supplies of telecommunications (ìconnectionî services) between telecommunications companies to link the two consumers in different jurisdictions combining to make the ìwholeî of the call between the consumers. Certain provisions of the GST Act were, therefore, difficult to apply to cross-border supplies of telecommunications services, including: ïformer section 8(2)(a)(ii): the taxation of services physically performed in New Zealand ïsection 11A(1)(j): the zero-rating of services physically performed outside New Zealand, and ïsection 11A(1)(k): the exclusion from zero-rating where services are provided directly in connection with movable personal property in New Zealand. The provisions in this bill reduce these uncertainties by enacting specific provisions in relation to cross-border telecommunications services. Key features The new provisions determine to whom a supply of telecommunications services is made and the circumstances in which it is subject to GST in New Zealand. These rules are in addition to the general place of supply rule in section 8(2), which is based on the residence of the supplier. New place of supply rule New section 8(6) deems there to be a supply of services in New Zealand when a person physically in New Zealand (other than a telecommunications supplier) initiates (including on behalf of another person) a supply of telecommunications services from a telecommunications supplier outside New Zealand (the ìphysical locationî test). This will require an offshore telecommunications supplier who makes more than $40,000 of supplies to persons in New Zealand, in a 12- month period, to register for GST here. New section 8(7) provides that section 8(6) does not apply to supplies between telecommunications suppliers. When use of the physical location test is impractical for a class of customer or service, new section 8A deems there to be a supply of services in New Zealand when a person with a billing address in New Zealand initiates (including 15 British Sky Broadcasting \[1996\] BVC 1107 70 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) on behalf of another person) a supply of telecommunications services from a telecommunications supplier outside New Zealand (the ìbilling addressî test). New section 8A(3) requires the billing address test, if used for a member of a class of customer or service, to be used consistently for all members of that class of customer or service. New sections 8(3) and 8(4) are re-enactments of sections 8(2)(a) and 8(2)(b) respectively, and new section 8(5) ensures that sections 8(3) and (4) do not apply to supplies of telecommunications services. New section 8(8) inserts an equivalent to section 8(4) for telecommunications services to ensure that unless the supplier and the recipient agree otherwise, a supply of telecommunications services from a non-resident to a registered person in New Zealand for which the New Zealand recipient would be entitled to an input tax credit are not subject to GST The initiator test Determining which party has initiated a supply is fundamental to the operation of both the physical location test and the billing address test for the place of supply of telecommunications services. New section 8(9) sets out factors to help determine which party to a supply of telecommunications services has initiated the supply. The initiator test lists the following factors: ïwho pays for the services ïwho begins the supply ïwho terminates the supply, and ïwho contracts for the supply. Registration New section 51(1)(e) provides that non-resident telecommunications suppliers do not have to register for GST solely as a result of making supplies that section 8(6) or 8A treats as being made in New Zealand to persons who are not resident, but who are physically in New Zealand. This ensures that non-resident cellular phone companies do not have to register for GST in New Zealand solely because they make supplies of telecommunications services to non-resident customers ìroamingî in New Zealand. Zero-rating The amendments introduce a code for zero-rating cross-border supplies of telecommunications services. New section 11AB zero-rates supplies of telecommunications services made: ïby New Zealand telecommunications suppliers to non-resident telecommunications suppliers when a telecommunications service is initiated outside New Zealand (section 11AB(a)), and ïto non-resident persons, other than telecommunications suppliers, when a telecommunications service is initiated outside New Zealand (section 11AB(b)). New section 11A(5) ensures that supplies of telecommunications services can be zero-rated only under section 11AB. Definitions For purposes of clarification, definitions of ìtelecommunications servicesî, ìcontentî and ìtelecommunications supplierî are inserted into the Act. These terms are defined as: Telecommunications services: ìmeans the transmission, emission or reception, and the transfer or assignment of the right to use capacity for the transmission, emission or reception, of signals, writing, images, sounds or information of any kind by wire, cable, radio, optical or other electromagnetic system, or by a similar technical system, and includes access to global information networks but does not include the content of the telecommunication.î Content: ìmeans the signals, writing, images, sounds or information of any kind that are transmitted, emitted or received by a telecommunications service.î Telecommunications supplier: ìmeans a person whose principal activity is the supply of telecommunications services.î Application date The amendments apply from 1 July 2003. Note A more detailed explanation of the operation of the new rules, in particular the initiator test, will be included in a forthcoming Tax Information Bulletin article. GST ON DOMESTIC LEGS OF INTERNATIONAL PASSENGER CRUISES Section 11A of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Introduction A new provision zero-rates the domestic leg of international passenger cruises if either the first place of departure or the final place of destination of the cruise is outside New Zealand. An international voyage therefore includes one that involves stops at one or more New Zealand ports. 71 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) Background Before this amendment, the legislation was not clear as to whether an international cruise that visits a number of New Zealand ports should be considered as one supply, or as a series of individual supplies between ports. To make a distinction between the international and domestic aspects of the one sea voyage would be impractical, regardless of how many New Zealand ports were visited. This is because this would require an apportionment of the fee charged for the cruise to determine the portion of the cruise that is consumed in New Zealand which would be extremely difficult. Because of the compliance and administrative costs associated with apportioning the domestic and international legs of an international cruise, the legislation has been amended to zero-rate the domestic portion of an international journey. This recognises that the supply of the voyage is likely to be predominantly international and therefore consumed overseas. Key feature Section 11A(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act (GST Act) has been amended to provide that an international cruise that visits a number of New Zealand ports, and in respect of which the first place of departure or the final place of destination is outside New Zealand, is zero-rated for the purposes of GST. Example Two types of voyages that may be zero-rated under the new provision ROME ATHENS LUXOR/KARNAK JERUSALEM/NAZARETH SALALAH BOMBAY SINGAPORE HO CHI MIN CITY HONG KONG MANILA CAIRNS SYDNEY BAY OF ISLANDS SUVA PAGO PAGO PAPEETE EASTER ISLAND LIMA MANTA CARTAGENA FORT LAUDERDALE PANAMA CANAL AUCKLAND BITUNG COCHIN KUALA LUMPUR CAIRO/GAZA NAPLES/CAPRI Other types of cruises not illustrated in figures 1 or 2 which may visit a number of New Zealand ports but which, say, either leave from or depart to a single destination offshore require similar clarification in the legislation. The effect of this amendment is that since these types of cruises are not easily distinguished from other international cruises, they will be zero-rated in the same manner Application date The amendment applies from 26 March 2003. Figure 1 72 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) Background Tax rules governing the amalgamation of companies were introduced following reforms to company law in 1993. The interaction of these rules with the depreciation provisions has given rise to two problems. The first relates to the associated persons rule in section EG 17, the second to the basic depreciation rule in section EG 1. Associated persons rule and non-qualifying amalgamations The amalgamation provisions provide concessionary tax treatment for the transfer of property on a qualifying amalgamation (essentially one between resident companies). Property is deemed to be acquired by the amalgamated company at tax book value, rather than at market value. Because the provisions are concessionary, taxpayers can elect that they do not apply. The amalgamation is then non-qualifying, and property is deemed to be acquired by the amalgamated company at market value, following section FE 5. Section EG 17 prevents taxpayers who are associated from increasing depreciation deductions by transferring a depreciable asset between them at a price above its original cost. The base value of the asset to the new owner is limited to the cost of the asset to the old owner. The restriction in section EG 17 should apply to property transfers between associated companies in an amalgamation. Otherwise, a company which holds depreciable assets with a market value above their original cost could obtain increased depreciation SYDNEY MELBOURNE HOBART DUNEDIN CHRISTCHURCH WELLINGTON TAURANGA BAY OF ISLANDS AUCKLAND FIORDLAND NATIONAL PARK REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS DEPRECIATION RULES ON AMALGAMATION Section EG 17, section FE 5 and new section FE6B of the Income Tax Act 1994, and new section 191WF of the Income Tax Act 1976. Introduction The application of rules dealing with transactions between associated persons has been clarified in respect of the transfer of depreciable property on a non- qualifying amalgamation. When depreciable property is transferred between companies in a non-qualifying amalgamation, the cost of the property to the new owner, for depreciation purposes, is generally deemed to be market value. However, when the old owner and the new owner are associated, then the depreciation base cost is the lower of the cost to the old owner and the cost to the new owner. This ìassociated persons ruleî takes precedence over the market value rule. An oversight in the rules that govern depreciation on a qualifying association has also been corrected. Companies that amalgamate in a qualifying amalgamation will be able to claim depreciation deductions in the year of amalgamation, for the period up to the date of amalgamation. Figure 2 73 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) deductions simply by amalgamating with another company without changing the substantial ownership of the asset, and electing for the amalgamation to be non-qualifying so that the assets are treated as transferred at market value. It was never the intention of the amalgamation provisions that associated companies should be able to avoid section EG 17 in this way. It was not entirely clear that the rule in section EG 17 took priority over the rule in section FE 5. Section EG 17 has now been amended to put this beyond doubt. Section FE 5 has also been amended to counter an argument that section EG 17 could not apply on a non-qualifying amalgamation because there is no acquisition from an associate, the amalgamating company having ceased to exist at the time the acquisition is deemed to occur under section FE 5. Basic depreciation rule Under section EG 1(2), no depreciation deduction is allowed for most classes of depreciable property in the year in which the property is disposed of. In the year of disposal there is a square-up of depreciation deductions, so that in total, over the period of ownership, the taxpayer deducts only the difference between the purchase and the sale price. When depreciable property passes between companies on a qualifying amalgamation, however, it passes at tax book value. In effect, this means that there is no square-up. Because of section EG 1(2), the old owner cannot claim a depreciation deduction for the period up to the amalgamation. The new owner can claim only in respect of the period following amalgamation. The effect is that depreciation for the period of the year up until the date of amalgamation remains locked away until the asset is finally disposed of. The amalgamation rules have been amended so that depreciation can be deducted for the period up to amalgamation. Key features Primacy of the associated persons rule New subsection EG 17(3B) says that the associated persons rule in EG 17(1) applies in the case of a non-qualifying amalgamation. The market value determined under section FE 5 is an ingredient in the associated persons test in EG 17(1), and not necessarily the final cost for depreciation purposes. The two companies are treated as associated, as the 100% owner of Company A (Alice) owns 67% of the new Company B. Assets transferred from Company A are subject to the associated persons rule. Measuring association New subsection FE5(2) applies the test of association by comparing the old owner with the new owner, as if the old owner existed at the time the amalgamating company acquires the property. This means that the associated person test may apply not only when two associated companies amalgamate, but also in some cases when two previously unassociated companies amalgamate. This ensures that there is no uplift in the cost base of depreciable property without a real change in the propertyís ownership. The associated persons rule will not apply if the ownership of the asset changes by more than 50%. The two companies are not treated as associated, as the 100% owner of Company B (Bill) owns only 33% of the new Company A. Assets transferred from Company B are not subject to the associated persons rule. Depreciation in the year of amalgamation New section FE 6B allows a depreciation deduction to be claimed in the year of disposal when the disposal occurs on a qualifying amalgamation. The deduction covers the part-year up to amalgamation. (A parallel amendment to the Income Tax Act 1976 is made by new section 191WF.. Application date The amendments relating to non-qualifying amalgamations and the associated persons rule apply to property transferred on and after 14 May 2002. The new rule relating to qualifying amalgamations and deductions in the year of disposal is retrospective to 1 July 1994, except where a deduction has already not been claimed in a return filed before 14 May 2002. 74 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) Example 2 - Amalgamation of Companies A and B, Company B continuing Company B $50,000 100% owned by Bill Company A $100,000 100% owned by Alice Company B $150,000 67% owned by Alice 33% owned by Bill Asset transfer The two companies are treated as associated, as the 100% owner of Company A (Alice) owns 67% of the new Company B. Assets transferred from Company A are subject to the associated persons rule.

It makes clear that the reimbursement of interest expense can qualify as film production expenditure. Background In 2001 the Income Tax Act was amended to allow certain types of companies to deduct interest expenses more simply. The amendments included verification that the timing of interest deductions is determined by the accrual rules rather than other timing rules in that Act. Transitional exceptions were provided for taxpayers that had been applying the other timing rules. Under section EO 4(1) when a person reimburses another party for film production expenditure, that person can deduct that reimbursement as if it were film production expenditure they had incurred themselves. Conceivably, the amount reimbursed could cover interest as well as other, more direct film production expenses. An inadvertent result of clarifying that interest deductions have to be timed under the accrual rules was that, arguably, section EO 4(1) could not apply to any reimbursement of interest expenses. Consequently, while the rest of the reimbursement would be deductible in the later of the year it was incurred or the year the film was completed under the timing rule applying to the costs of producing a film, the reimbursement of interest expenses would likely not be deductible until the film was sold, under another timing rule. Key features The new section EO 4(2B) indicates that if a taxpayer reimburses another person for any expenditure on interest incurred by that other person in producing a film, the taxpayer may treat the reimbursement as film production expenditure. The purpose of this amendment is purely to remove the anomaly and thereby clarify what most taxpayers will have already been doing since 1997-98. It does not require the reimbursed interest expenses to be treated as film production expenditure as the change is permissive (it refers to ìmay treatî). Accordingly, taxpayers that have not treated reimbursed interest expenses as film production expenditure will not be required to make any change as a result of the amendment. Application date Because the amendment verifying that the timing of interest deductions is determined by the accrual rules applied from the 1997-98 income year, the new section EO 4(2B) has been backdated to apply also from the 1997-98 income year INTERNATIONAL TAX ñ REMEDIAL ISSUES Sections FH 3(3), MF 4(1B), MF 8(2)(a), MF 8(2A), MF 8(2B),MF 8(4)(a), MF 10(2)(a), MF 10(5)(c) and OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction Amendments have been made to the conduit, branch equivalent tax account and provisional tax rules to clarify that: ïthe non-resident shareholding percentage used when receiving conduit relief is the same percentage used in the conduit excess interest allocation rules ïonly one branch equivalent tax account credit can be created when a company offsets losses against its net income and also pays income tax, and ïthe definition of ìresidual income taxî excludes debit offsets from a branch equivalent tax account. The consolidated group provisions for branch equivalent tax accounts have also been aligned with the equivalent provisions for individual companies, by ensuring that branch equivalent tax account credits and debits are calculated before any conduit relief is given. Background Conduit rules The conduit rules aim to relieve New Zealand tax on foreign sourced income of New Zealand resident companies to the extent they have non-resident shareholders. These rules are buttressed by interest allocation rules to prevent excessive interest deductions being taken against New Zealand-sourced income, while the foreign income has tax relieved from it. The conduit excess interest allocation rules initially compare the companyís group debt to asset ratio with a 76 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) safe harbour threshold of 66%. Before making this comparison, the foreign assets of the company that receive conduit relief are reduced by the non-resident shareholding percentage in order to measure the debt that generates New Zealand tax deductions against the assets that generate taxable income. To ease compliance costs, there are a number of dates that a company receiving conduit relief may choose to calculate its non-resident shareholding percentage in a year. Additionally, a listed company may choose any date in a year, if for commercial reasons it would normally calculate its non-resident shareholding percentage on that date. It was always the governmentís policy intent that the non- resident shareholding percentage that applied to the calculation of conduit relief would be the same one that applied to reducing the assets when calculating whether the conduit excess interest allocation rules applied. An amendment has been made to clarify this intent. Branch equivalent tax accounts The branch equivalent tax account rules aim to prevent double taxation of foreign income that is subject to income tax under the controlled foreign company or foreign investment fund rules, as well as subject to dividend withholding payment when the underlying income is received as a foreign dividend. The intention is that regardless of which income stream occurs first, tax will only be paid once. The branch equivalent tax account mechanism provides that if income tax has been paid first, a branch equivalent tax account credit arises which offsets the liability to dividend withholding payment. Alternatively, if a dividend had been paid in advance of the income being earned in the controlled foreign company with dividend withholding payment being paid first, a branch equivalent tax account debit arises which can offset the liability to income tax. A branch equivalent tax account credit can also be created when losses from New Zealand sources have been offset against attributed foreign income and so no liability to income tax arises. It was never the intention that when a company paid income tax and also used losses from New Zealand sources that the credits created would exceed the value of the tax rate multiplied by the attributed foreign income for the year, adjusted for foreign tax credits and branch equivalent tax account debit offsets. An amendment has been made to limit the credits accordingly. Residual income tax The provisional tax rules aim to tax income that has not had tax deducted from or credited to it in any form in the year it is earned. Its calculation is based around ìresidual income taxî which is the tax liability on income in the previous year that did not have tax paid or deducted from it. As noted in the discussion of branch equivalent tax accounts, the payment of dividend withholding payment generates a branch equivalent tax account debit that can be used to offset a liability to income tax. Although a company may use a branch equivalent tax account debit to meet its income tax liability on attributed foreign income, the previous definition of residual income tax did not take into account branch equivalent tax account debit offsets. This meant the previous law required a company to pay provisional tax on income from which dividend withholding payment had already been deducted, contrary to the aim of the provisional tax rules. The amendment clarifies that branch equivalent tax account debit offsets by a company are excluded from the definition of ìresidual income taxî within the provisional tax rules. Key features ïSection FH 3(3), within the conduit excess interest allocation rules, has been amended to ensure that the non-resident shareholding percentage is the same as either the one used to calculate conduit relief under KH 1 or the average of the percentages used to receive conduit relief under NH 7. ïSections MF 4(1B) and MF 8(2B) have been added to limit the branch equivalent tax account credits that arise under MF 4(1)(a) and (b) and MF 8(2)(a) and (b) respectively. When a company pays income tax as well as uses losses from New Zealand operations to reduce its taxable income, the credits will be limited to attributed foreign income multiplied by the company tax rate, adjusted for foreign tax credits and branch equivalent tax account debit offsets. ïSections MF 8(2)(a), MF 8(4)(a), MF 10(2)(a) and MF 10(5)(c), have been amended to ensure that consolidated group branch equivalent tax account debits and credits are calculated before any conduit relief is calculated. This aligns the branch equivalent tax account provisions for consolidated groups with those for individual companies. ïParagraph (kb) has been added to the definition of ìresidual income taxî, in section OB1 to clarify that the definition excludes debit offsets from the branch equivalent tax account made under sections MF 5(4) or MF 10(3). Application dates The amendments to: ïthe conduit rules apply from the 1998-99 income year except when a taxpayer has a filed an income tax return based on the previous law before 14 May 2002, when it applies from the next income year or 2002-03 whichever is earlier 77 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) ïthe branch equivalent tax account credit rules applies from 1 April 1995 except when a taxpayer has filed an income tax return for an income year based on the previous law before 14 May 2002, when it applies from the next income year ïthe definition of ìresidual income taxî applies from the 1995-96 income year except when a taxpayer has a filed an income tax return based on the previous law before 14 May 2002, when it applies from the next income year or 2002-03 whichever is earlier ïthe alignment of the branch equivalent tax account provisions for consolidated groups with those for individual companies applies to the 1998-99 and subsequent imputation years. RATIONALISATION OF TERMINAL TAX PAYMENT DATE PROVISIONS Sections HG 12, MC 1, OB 1 and Schedule 13 of the Income Tax Act 1994; sections 102, 103, 104, 105, 125, 138E, 142 of the Tax Administration Act 1994; section 193 and Schedule 4 of the Injury, Prevention, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2001 Introduction The terminal tax payment date provisions for income tax have been rationalised by reducing the three former such provisions to a single provision. A number of consequential amendments have also been made to the tax Acts and other legislation. These amendments do not result in a policy change to terminal tax payment dates. Background Terminal tax is the difference between a taxpayerís tax credits (such as provisional tax, PAYE and imputation credits) and the taxpayerís income tax liability for an income year. There were previously three separate provisions in the Income Tax Act 1994 covering the payment dates for terminal tax: section NC 17, applying to employees (other than non-filing taxpayers); section MC 1, applying to provisional taxpayers; and section MC 2, applying to persons generally. The previous existence of separate terminal tax payment date provisions for employees and provisional taxpayers in sections NC 17 and MC 1 was for historical reasons only. PAYE and provisional tax were implemented in 1958 as self-contained legislative codes with their own recovery, penalty, assessment and payment date provisions. Many of these separate provisions have been replaced by more generic provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Income Tax Act 1994 (for example, the penalty provisions). The separate terminal tax payment date provisions for employees and provisional taxpayers were, therefore, an unnecessary residue of the original separate legislative codes for PAYE and provisional tax. Key features The previous three separate terminal tax payment date provisions in the Income Tax Act 1994 have been combined into one provision. This will make it easier for taxpayers to determine their terminal tax payment dates. It also allows the drafting of other provisions that refer to terminal tax payment dates to be significantly simplified. The rationalisation of the terminal tax payment date provisions has been mainly achieved by repealing the specific payment date provisions in sections NC 17 and MC 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, applying to employees and provisional taxpayers. The following related amendments have also been made: Minor amendments have been made to the general terminal tax payment date provision in section MC 2 (re-enacted as new section MC 1) so that it can apply to all persons. ïThe definition of ìterminal tax dateî in section OB 1 has been amended so that it refers to the date determined under new section MC 1 for payment of terminal tax for an income year by a person. If a person does not have to pay terminal tax for an income year, new section MC 1 will apply as if the person does have terminal tax for the year. This ensures that all persons can be treated as having a terminal tax dateófor example, persons whose tax credits equal or exceed their income tax liability. This amendment allows the definition to be used more widely in other provisions, thereby making them more concise. ïPart A of Schedule 13, which specifies the months for payment of provisional tax and terminal tax, has been amended to clarify that persons (such as employees) who do not have the Commissionerís permission to use a non-standard balance date have a March balance date. A non-resident company that does not have a fixed establishment in New Zealand is also treated as having a March balance date for the purpose of determining its provisional tax or terminal tax payment dates. (This continues the treatment of such companies under former section MC 2(1).) ïSection MC 3, which authorised regulations to be made to allow taxpayers with outstanding tax liabilities to make instalment payments, has been repealed because it was redundant. There are no such regulations in existence and the function of allowing taxpayers in arrears to make instalment payments is covered by the taxpayer relief provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994. 78 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) ïA number of consequential amendments have been made to the tax Acts and other legislation to cater for the combining of the three former terminal tax date payment provisions into one provision. The following provisions in former sections MC 1 and NC 17 have not been re-enacted as part of the single terminal tax payment date provision in new section MC 1 because they were unnecessary: ïFormer sections MC 1(3) and NC 17(2)(c), which allowed the Commissioner to specify an earlier terminal tax date for a particular taxpayer. Although these provisions had a revenue protection purpose, they were unnecessary because there are other provisions with a similar function that are more effective, in particular, section 44 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which allows tax to be assessed and payable on demand in high-risk situations such as when a person is about to leave New Zealand. ïFormer section NC 17(1), which contained a separate assessment provision for employees. The general income tax assessment provision in section 92 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 can apply to all taxpayers, and there is no reason for having a separate assessment provision for employees. (The separate assessment provision for provisional taxpayers was repealed in 1996.) ïFormer section NC 17(3), which provided that income tax payable under an income statement that is treated as an assessment, under section 92 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, was due on the dates specified in section NC 17(2). This provision was originally enacted because section NC 17(2) applied only to income tax payable under an assessment made under section NC 17(1). Because the separate assessment provision in section NC 17(1) has not been retained, section NC 17(3) also become unnecessary. Application date The amendments rationalising the terminal tax payment date provisions apply from the 2002-03 income year. FRINGE BENEFIT TAX AMENDMENT Section ND 1(4) and (5) of the Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction Section ND 1(4) and (5) has been amended to correct a number of section references. Background Legislation enacted by section 59 of the Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002, which allowed employers to change the basis of calculating their fringe benefit tax liability under the multi-rate fringe benefit tax rules contained a number of incorrect section references. Key features Section references in section ND 1(4) and (5) of the Income Tax Act 1994 have been corrected so that they refer to subsection (2) instead of subsection (1). Application date The amendment applies with effect from 17 October 2002, the date of enactment of the Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002. INCLUSION OF MATERIAL FACTS IN PRIVATE AND PRODUCT RULINGS Section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction The definition of ìarrangementî in the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been altered to clarify that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue can include in private and product rulings facts that the Commissioner considers to be material, or relevant as background or context, to any of the matters on which the private or product ruling is sought. Such facts will form part of the ìarrangementî that is the subject of a ruling. Consequently, they will become subject to the provisions that determine that a ruling ceases to apply if the arrangement is materially different from the arrangement identified in the ruling. The amendment reduces the extent to which private and product rulings may have a wider application than intended. Background Private and product binding rulings are made in respect of an ìarrangementî. The word ìarrangementî has been defined as ìany contract, agreement, plan, or understanding (whether enforceable or unenforceable), including all steps by which it is carried into effectî. The legislation prescribes that when a private or product ruling is issued, the particular arrangement to which the ruling applies must be specified as part of the ruling. It also provides that if the actual arrangement subsequently proves to be materially different from that specified in the ruling, then the ruling will not apply. 79 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) Inland Revenue often includes in a ruling numerous facts describing an arrangement that are considered to be relevant as background or as context to the transaction proposed. However, it was possible that, on a strict interpretation, while the facts were highly relevant, they did not form part of the ìarrangementî as such. Excluding these facts potentially made the ruling of more general application than intended. It is therefore important that Inland Revenue can set out these facts in rulings without giving rise to the technical issue of whether the facts are part of the ìarrangementî identified in the ruling. Key features The definition of ìarrangementî in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended to duplicate the definition of ìarrangementî contained in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, and to include, for the purposes of the private and product rulings legislation, facts that are material, or relevant as background or context, to any of the matters on which a private or product ruling is sought. This allows the Commissioner to include facts that may not technically be part of the ìarrangementî (as currently defined in section OB 1) that is the subject of a ruling, but nevertheless are important as background or as context to the transaction proposed. Such facts will become subject to the ruling non- application tests contained in sections 91EB(2)(a) and 91FB(2)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The tests provide that if the arrangement is, in reality, materially different from the arrangement identified in the ruling, then the ruling does not apply. The amendment does not affect the Commissionerís existing ability to include facts in private and product rulings that are, under the existing definition of ìarrangementî, unambiguously part of the arrangement that is the subject of the ruling. Application date The amendment applies from 26 March 2003. MINOR TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS A number of minor technical amendments have been made to the tax Acts, none of which results in a policy change. Most of these amendments relate to income tax self-assessment, the main provisions for which were enacted by the Taxation (Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001. Unless otherwise stated, these amendments apply from the 2002-2003 income year, which is the same application date as the main self-assessment provisions. Definition of ìassessmentî Section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 An amendment relocates the previous definition of ìassessmentî in section OB 1 of the Income Tax 1994 to section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The Income Tax Act 1994 now cross-refers to the new assessment definition in the Tax Administration Act. The previous definition of ìassessmentî in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 was enacted by the Taxation (Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001. There were several problems with this definition that arose because of its location in the Income Tax Act instead of the Tax Administration Act. For example, the opening reference to ìtaxî in the former Income Tax Act definition was meant to refer to all types of tax, not just income tax. However, ìtaxî is defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act as meaning only income tax, whereas ìtaxî is defined in the Tax Administration Act to mean all types of tax. It was intended that the latter, wider meaning was to apply in the assessment definition. Removal of redundant term Section 39 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Section 39(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, relating to adjustments on a change in a return date, has been amended to replace the reference to ìyear or years of assessmentî with a reference to an ìincome yearî. This amendment is consequential to the main self- assessment amendments made in 2001, which removed the year of assessment concept because for many years a year of assessment had been the same as an income year. New date for payment of tax Section 142A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Section 142A of the Tax Administration Act 1994, relating to new dates for payment of tax following increases by the Commissioner, has been amended to cater for withholding tax cases where there may not be an original assessment. The Taxation (Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001 amended section 142A of the Tax Administration Act with the intention of making this section consistent with self-assessment. Part of this 2001 amendment included repealing former section 142A(1)(b), which required the Commissioner to set a new due date where the liability to pay tax was increased from that calculated by taxpayers in their returns. This 2001 amendment went further than intended because it meant that section 142A applied only if an assessment was already in existence, whereas this may not be the case with withholding taxes such as non-resident withholding tax where the Commissioner makes an assessment in limited cases only (for example, following an audit). 80 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) Section 142A has therefore been amended to ensure that it can apply in withholding tax cases where there may not be an original assessment by requiring the Commissioner to set a new due date where the liability to pay tax is increased from that calculated by the taxpayer in their return. Recovery of excess tax credits allowed Section 165A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 An amendment has been made to re-enact the effect of former section 165A of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which allowed the Commissioner to recover an excess tax credit previously allowed as if it were income tax payable under the Income Tax Act 1994. Former section 165A of the Tax Administration Act was repealed as a consequential amendment to the main self-assessment amendments made in 2001. Former section 165A of the Tax Administration Act was repealed in 2001 because the only explicit reference to that section in the tax credit provisions (section LC 3) had been removed by an earlier amendment and, therefore, it was assumed that section 165A was redundant. However, this assumption was not correct. Although not explicitly referred to in other tax credit provisions in Part L of the Income Tax Act, section 165A allowed the recovery of certain excess tax credits previously allowed, such as resident withholding tax credits and imputation credits. These provisions previously contained their own excess tax credit recovery provisions which were repealed in 1996 when section 165A was originally enacted. Section 165A has now been re-enacted to give the Commissioner a general power to recover any excess tax credit previously allowed. This provision is subject to the specific excess credit recovery provisions in sections LC 3, LC 4(11) and LD 1(6) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Income equalisation accounts Section EI 14 of the Income Tax Act 1994 Section EI 14(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994, which relates to refunds from adverse event income equalisation accounts, has been amended to replace the reference to ìone calendar yearî with ìtwelve monthsî. This minor clarifying amendment has been made to ensure that the provision works as intended. This amendment applies from 26 March 2003. Removal of redundant lost determination references Sections IE 2, IE 3, IE 4 and II 1of the Income Tax Act 1994 A number of provisions in the Income Tax Act 1994 dealing with the treatment of net losses (sections IE 2(5A), IE 3(1), IE 4(1) and II 1(1)) have been amended by removing references to section 92 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. These references were redundant because they relate to determinations of net losses, which were removed from the tax Acts as part of the main self-assessment amendments made in 2001. Income Tax Act definition of ìtaxable supplyî Section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 The definition of ìtaxable supplyî in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 has been amended to cross-refer directly to the definition of that term in section 2 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Previously, the definition of ìtaxable supplyî in section OB 1 referred to the definition in section ED 4(7), but that provision was amended in 2002 to remove its taxable supply reference. Removal of redundant definition Section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 Section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 has been amended by repealing the definition of ìEuropeanî. That term was redundant because it was not used anywhere in the Income Tax Act 1994. This amendment applies from 26 March 2003. 81 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) 82 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) REGULAR FEATURES DUE DATES REMINDER June 2003 3FBT return and payment due 5Employer deductions and employer monthly schedule Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) ïEmployer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due ïEmployer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 20Employer deductions Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) ïEmployer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due Employer deductions and employer monthly schedule Small employers (less than $100,000 PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) ïEmployer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due ïEmployer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 30GST return and payment due July 2003 7Provisional tax instalments due for people and organisations with a March balance date Employer deductions and employer monthly schedule Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) ïEmployer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due ïEmployer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 21Employer deductions Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) ïEmployer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due Employer deductions and employer monthly schedule Small employers (less than $100,000 PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) ïEmployer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due ïEmployer monthly schedule (IR 348) due FBT return and payment due 31GST return and payment due These dates are taken from Inland Revenueís Smart business tax due date calendar 2003-2004 83 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) INLAND REVENUE NATIONAL OFFICE PO BOX 2198 WELLINGTON TELEPHONE (04) 498 5800

Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 6 (June 2003) 4 BINDING RULINGS This section of the TIB contains binding rulings that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has issued recently. The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our booklet Adjudication & Rulings, a guide to binding rulings (IR 715) or the article on page 1 of Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 12 (May 1995) or Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995). You can download these publications from our website at www.ird.govt.nz PRODUCT RULING ñ BR PRD 03/12 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by TrustPower Limited (ìTrustPowerî). Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section CF 3(1)(b) and the section OB 1 definition of ìshares of the same classî. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the proposed off-market, pro rata cancellation of a minimum of 40 million ordinary shares in TrustPower, arising from a share repurchase offer made by TrustPower to shareholders. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs following. Establishment of TrustPower and current ownership 1.Currently, there are 198,274,779 TrustPower shares on issue, all being of the same class and having the same voting and dividend rights (subject to paragraph 7 below), being those rights set out in section 36 of the Companies Act 1993. There are no ìnon-participating redeemable sharesî on issue in TrustPower. As of 17 February 2003, the ordinary shares were held by: (a) Infratil Limited (27.93%) (b) Tauranga Energy Consumer Trust (22.67%) (c) Australian Gas Light Companyís 100% owned NZ subsidiary AGL NZ Limited (20.47%) (d) Alliant International New Zealand Limited (18.87%) (e) Others (10.07)%. On 20 March 2003 the shares were trading on the New Zealand Stock Exchange at $3.95, giving a market capitalisation of approximately $783 million. The shares have been listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange since 18 April 1994. 2.TrustPower has made an offer to repurchase shares to all the holders of ordinary shares in TrustPower. The terms of the offer are as follows: ïThe offer is to repurchase two of every seven shares held by shareholders. ïThe offer price is $3.70 per share. (This is lower than the market price for TrustPower shares, which at 20 March 2003 was around $3.95 per share). 3.The offer is conditional upon: ïTrustPower receiving valid acceptances of the offer in respect of at least 40 million shares (which will produce a repurchase amount of $148 million). ïThe increase of voting control of those shareholders who require approval to retain this increase being approved under the Takeovers Code (Class Exemptions) Notice (No. 2) by shareholders permitted to vote. ïThe passing of such other shareholder resolutions as are required to give effect to the transaction and its completion, and ïReceipt by TrustPower of an irrevocable notice to convert the outstanding 1,000 convertible notes (ìTEL Notesî) on the first Interest Payment Date after the notice is given. 5 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 6 (June 2003) 4.In accordance with section 60(2) of the Companies Act 1993, the offer permits TrustPower to acquire additional shares from a shareholder who wishes to sell them, to the extent that another shareholder does not accept the offer or accepts the offer only in part. 5.TrustPower has received a binding ruling to the effect that it has Available Subscribed Capital (ìASCî) with respect to its ordinary shares (including those referred to in paragraph 7) of not less than $217,498,432.47 (ìASC Amountî). TEL Notes and Voting Debentures 6.TrustPower has issued: (a) 14,975 million TEL Notes, issued on 31 October 1997 with a face value of $2 each, and bearing interest at 11% pa to 30 October 2002 and at the Treasury Bill rate plus 1% thereafter. These notes were issued on the basis that they were, at the holderís election, either: (i) convertible into TrustPower shares on a 1:1 basis on 30 October 2007, or earlier on interest payment dates. The terms of the TEL Notes provide that the shares issued on conversion: (AA) are not entitled to dividends declared, paid or made on or before conversion, and (BB) are entitled to only a pro rata portion of dividends declared, paid or made in respect of financial periods beginning before, but ending after, the conversion date, or (ii) redeemable for their face value, in either TrustPower shares or cash. However, the right to redeem the TEL Notes for cash expired 30 business days prior to 1 October 2000. The TEL Notes also have a right, in general terms, to participate in any adjustment in the share capital of TrustPower. They confer no right to vote. (b) 14,975 voting debentures (ìTEL Voting Debenturesî), issued at 1c each, with no right to any distributions, except on redemption. One TEL Voting Debenture was attached to each parcel of 1,000 TEL Notes, and cannot be severed from it. Each TEL Voting Debenture carries the same voting rights as those which would arise if 1,000 TEL Notes were converted into ordinary shares (ie 1,000 subject to any capital reconstruction). 7.On 3 January 2003, all but 1,000 of the TEL Notes, which were then held by AGL NZ Limited, were converted into TrustPower ordinary shares. In accordance with the terms of the TEL Notes, the resulting 14,974 million TrustPower ordinary shares are entitled to only 50% of the final 2003 year dividend. Desire to increase leverage 8.The reason for the share cancellation is to increase TrustPowerís debt to equity ratio. TrustPowerís debt to equity ratio at 31 March 2002, was 26%, calculated as follows: (a)Debt was $210.4 million, being the total of unsecured loans ($179.3 million) plus convertible notes ($35.5 million) less cash ($4.4 million) (b)Equity was $608 million. This was the total of reported equity in the accounts of $563 million plus a notional revaluation reserve in respect of TrustPowerís retail business of $45 million. Sales of retail customer bases between armís length parties have established that TrustPowerís customer base has a value of $45million. However, this cannot be recog- nised in the accounts under NZ GAAP. 9.Following the conversion of the TEL Notes into TrustPower shares, TrustPowerís debt-to-equity ratio is 27.7%. 10. The directors have determined that at this level, TrustPower is in a commercially under-geared position and has capital surplus to its current requirements. From the perspective of reducing TrustPowerís weighted average cost of capital, and thereby also maximising returns to shareholders, a gearing of between 30-50% has been recommended by management, in consultation with external consultants. The optimal gearing was arrived at by considering the enterprise value of TrustPower under a number of different scenarios with key factors being the: (a) nature of the Companyís assets (b) nature and volatility of the Companyís earnings/ cashflows (c) capital needs of the Company over the foreseeable future (d) available sources of future capital and the relative costs of these services (e) capital structure of competitors, and (f) tax status of major shareholders. 11. At a meeting of the Board of Directors of TrustPower held on 1 November 2001, a target gearing of 35-40% was accepted in principle. Subsequent discussions have suggested that a 50-55% ratio may be preferable. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 6 (June 2003) 6 12. A further factor which the Directors have considered relevant in determining the amount of capital to be returned to shareholders by way of a cancellation of shares is the amount of ASC which would remain after the cancellation. The Directors do not wish to leave the company in a position after the cancellation which is currently proposed where it has a significant amount of ASC which is nevertheless not sufficient to enable TrustPower to make a pro rata return of capital to its shareholders in a substantially tax-free manner (because the amount of ASC would not be sufficient to meet the 10% threshold). There is no current intention to undertake a further repurchase or cancellation. 13. The cancellation is proposed to be funded by a mixture of: (a) proceeds of a public issue of capital bondsó ie bonds which bear interest and which can, at the option of TrustPower, be either redeemed in cash or converted into TrustPower shares at a slight discount to their market value at the time of conversion, and (b) bank facilities. TrustPower has no current intention to convert any bonds issued. 14. The remaining 1,000 TEL Notes will not participate in the return of capital in any way. 15. TrustPowerís current dividend policy is to pay at least 60% of its profits each year by way of dividend. The current directors intend to maintain or, if possible, grow the amount of dividend per share in the future, subject to compliance with their duties under the Companies Act. In particular, this policy will not be affected by the proposed share cancellation. 16. At the time of entering into this Arrangement, TrustPower has no intention to return capital to shareholders in the future. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a)All shares cancelled as part of the relevant cancellation will be cancelled in whole, not in part. b)The TEL Notes and the TEL Voting Debentures were issued on commercial armís length terms. c)The form of the TEL Notes and Voting Debentures was chosen by TrustPower to avoid the effect of section 117 of the Companies Act 1993 and does not have a purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of any provision of the Act whose application is dependent upon measurement of voting and market value interests. d)If there is a market value circumstance, then the cancellation, if the offer were accepted in full by all shareholders, would not alter the market value interest or voting interests of any person in the company (except possibly by reason solely of the existence of the TEL Notes and Voting Debenture). e)The aggregate amount paid by the company on account of the cancellation is equal to or greater than 15% of the market value of all shares in the company at the time the company first notified shareholders of the proposed relevant cancellation. f)At the time of entering into the Arrangement, TrustPower does not anticipate issuing any shares subsequent to the cancellation. This condition will not be breached if an event unanticipated at the time of the repurchase occurs that requires the issue of further shares. An example of this would be TrustPower finding a suitable electricity generation investment and issuing shares to fund that investment. g)TrustPower has not previously distributed amounts upon the acquisition, redemption or cancellation of TrustPower ordinary shares. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: ïAmounts distributed to shareholders on cancellation will be excluded from the definition of dividends pursuant to section CF 3(1)(b) to the extent that they do not exceed the available subscribed capital per share cancelled. ïThe shares issued on conversion of the TEL Notes and the other ordinary shares issued by TrustPower are ìshares of the same classî as defined in section OB 1. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 January 2003 to 31 March 2005. This Ruling is signed by me on the 17 th day of April 2003. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 7 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 6 (June 2003) PUBLIC RULING ñ BR PUB 99/6 EXTENDED The following notice to extend public ruling BR Pub 99/6 was published in the Gazette of 19 June 2003 (issue No. 67) Notice of Extension of Public Ruling 1.This is a notice of extension of a public ruling made under section 91DD of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 2.Public ruling BR Pub 99/6 entitled ìCar parks provided by employers ñ fringe benefit tax exemptionî was signed on 12 August 1999 and notice of its making appeared in the New Zealand Gazette of 19 August 1999 (No 97, page 2,336). A copy of the ruling appeared in Inland Revenueís Ta x Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 8 of September 1999. 3.Public ruling BR Pub 99/6 originally applied for the period from 1 November 1999 to 31 March 2002. The ruling now applies for the period from 1 April 2002 until 31 March 2005. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings). Explanation In the context of reviewing public ruling BR Pub 99/6, the Commissioner has reconsidered the legal interpretation of the words ìthe premises of the employerî as used in section CI 1(q) of the Income Tax Act 1994. These words are undoubtedly ambiguous. In public ruling BR Pub 99/6 the Commissioner took the view that they included a car park that is on land or in a building owned or leased by the employer where there is an exclusive right to occupy the property and a legal estate or interest in that property. It is acknowledged that alternative arguments can also be made for these words meaning the place in which an employer conducts their business. However, such a meaning in itself requires interpretation, and the Commissioner considers that the legislative intent in this area is insufficiently clear for a test based on this meaning (or any variation) that is capable of application to be formulated. As this issue is scheduled to be considered and resolved as part of a policy review of fringe benefit tax which is currently in progress, and to provide continuing certainty in the meantime to taxpayers who have followed the approach in public ruling BR Pub 99/6, the Commissioner has decided to extend public ruling BR Pub 99/6 under section 91DD of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 6 (June 2003) 8 ANGEL CAPITAL CORPORATION LTD V CIR Case:Angel Capital Corporation Ltd v CIR Decision Date:7 May 2003 Act:The GST Act 1985 Keywords:Summary judgment, arguable defence, section 46, mandatory time limit, CIR v Sea Hunter. Summary Summary judgment application for GST refund made under section 46 GST Act 1985 and CIR v Sea Hunter (2001) 20 NZTC 17,478. The Court found there were disputed facts as to the filing of the return and the creation of the tax invoice. Therefore the plaintiff could not satisfy the onus of showing the defendant had no defence to the claim. The Court also found the case of Sea Hunter was sufficiently different so that it did not assist the plaintiff's case. Application for summary judgment unsuccessful. Costs reserved. Facts This case concerned a claim by the plaintiff for a GST refund under section 46 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (ìthe GST Actî) which requires the Commissioner (ìthe CIRî) to refund an amount claimed within a certain time period unless specific criteria are fulfilled. The plaintiff was incorporated on 12 April 2001. It was registered for GST from that date and had a monthly filing frequency. On 28 March 2003 the plaintiff entered into an agreement, as agent for a Joint Venture, with Totara Group Limited, to purchase software for $3 million. On the same day the plaintiffís sole director, Mr Anderson, allegedly filed the plaintiffís GST return claiming a $375,000 input tax credit based on the purchase. Approximately 50 other returns relating to the LEGAL DECISIONS ñ CASE NOTES This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. Weíve given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. plaintiff and other entities Mr Anderson was involved with were filed at the same time. Although the CIR received all the other returns filed and duly processed them, the CIR had no record of ever having received the one in question. The CIR contended, among other things, that the return had not been received until the proceedings in question were filed. The plaintiff contended that the return had been filed on 28 March 2002 and that the CIR had not responded within the 15 day time limit and was therefore obliged to refund the amount under section 46 of the GST Act. Decision The plaintiff relied on Rule 136 of the High Court Rules which sets out the onus is on the plaintiff to satisfy the Court the defendant has no defence to the claim. See Pemberton v Chapell \[1987\] 1 NZLR 1 and Towers v R & W Hellaby Limited \[1987\] 3 NZCLC 100,064. The essence of the plaintiffs claim was that, as in CIR v Sea Hunter Fishing Limited (2001) 20 NZTC 17,478, the CIR had failed to pay out the refund in the mandatory timeframe set out in section 46 of the GST Act. The CIR raised four grounds of defence: 1. Plaintiff as agent for unregistered principle The plaintiff contended that it purchased the software and filed the GST return as principle in its own right. The CIR disputed this and referred to the agreement for sale and purchase (ìthe SAPAî) which described the plaintiff, as purchaser, as ìagent for a joint venture Öî. The CIR then raised the issue of the joint ventureís non-registration at 28 March. The CIR argued that section 60 of the GST Act, which states supplies made to an agent are deemed to be made to the principle, would require that the principle be registered to be entitled to an input tax credit under section 20(5) and therefore section 46 of the GST Act. 9 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 6 (June 2003) Master Gendall did not consider the CIRís argument in any great detail but did note that there could be some force in it. However, he felt that in light of the description of the purchaser in the SAPA the CIR had satisfied him that the plaintiff may not be the person entitled to the refund. On this claim alone the plaintiffís application failed. 2. Plaintiff did not hold a valid tax invoice The CIR argued that the plaintiff did not hold a valid tax invoice at the time the return was allegedly filed as required under section 20(2)(a) of the GST Act. See Superannuation v Mutual Savings Ltd v Automobile Association (Auckland) Incorporated (1989) 11 NZTC 6,124. The CIR also contended that the plaintiff did not satisfy the ìinvoice created by recipientî criteria under section 24 of the GST Act. The plaintiff was therefore not entitled to make a deduction of input tax under section 20(5). Although the Master made no determinative finding on the tax invoice issue he felt there was enough doubt as to the factual circumstances surrounding it for the plaintiffís application for summary judgment to fail on this ground also. 3. Disputed issues of fact and credibility There were a range of contested factual disputes between the parties. In particular, whether the return in question was filed on 28 March or whether the date stamp had been falsified. The plaintiffís application on this ground failed as the Master found there were serious factual disputes which could not be determined on the current application. 4. Court's discretion As the Master found against the plaintiff on the above three grounds it was not necessary to consider whether the Court should exercise its discretion to refuse summary judgment. The ìSea Hunterî argument The plaintiff contended its application for summary judgment was indistinguishable from the Court of Appeal case of CIR v Sea Hunter. Master Gendall however felt there were two major distinctions: ïIn Sea Hunter, it was agreed by both counsel that the CIR was required to make a refund under section 20(5). The disagreement was about the application of section 46 and the strict time compliance and giving of notice under that section. That was not the case here. ïThe Sea Hunter claim involved an action on a cheque as the CIR had issued a cheque and then stopped payment. An obligation to refund existed at the time the CIR issued the cheque due to section 46 and that was sufficient for action on the cheque to be upheld. No cheque had been issued in the current case. While the Master made no definitive determination in relation to the Sea Hunter argument he tended to the view that the circumstances in Sea Hunter were sufficiently different so as not to assist the plaintiffís case. Costs were reserved. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 6 (June 2003) 10 TRA 084/02 Case:TRA 084/02 Decision date:16 May 2003 Act:Tax Administration Act 1994/GST Act 1985 Keywords:Shortfall penalty, unacceptable interpretation Summary The disputant was successful in its application for an order preventing the CIR relying on information in his Additional Statement of Position Facts This case concerns the imposition of a shortfall penalty for an unacceptable interpretation (section 141B TAA) of the time of supply rules (section 9 GST Act). After investigation, the Commissioner advised the disputant that he intended to disallow a claim for an input credit based on the construction of a vessel, and proposed an agreed adjustment to this effect. Written agreement to the adjustment was received from the disputant in August 2000. The disputant was also advised that the imposition of a shortfall penalty was being considered under both section 141A (reasonable care) and section 141B. A NOPA and disclosure notice were issued by the Commissioner, and the disputant responded with a NOR. The Commissioner issued a statement of position (not specifically referring to section 9 GST Act). The Commissioner subsequently issued an addendum to his SOP, under section 89M(8) TAA, which did refer to section 9. The matter then went to Adjudication, which concluded that the disputant was not liable for a shortfall penalty under section 141A, but was liable under section 141B. It is accepted by all concerned this conclusion is only possible by reference to section 9 GST Act. Proceedings were brought before the Authority, and the disputant sought an order on a preliminary point that the Commissioner failed to raise his reliance on section 9 GST Act prior to issuing the addendum to his SOP, and was therefore precluded by the evidence exclusion rule (section 138G TAA) from relying on section 9. Decision After a determination that the preliminary point raised by the disputant was able to be considered by the Authority, the facts as understood by the Authority are set out, noting that: ìThe disputant (in person) made a lengthy response and statement of position in which he adverted to section 9 contending in passing that it did not apply. ... ìThe disputantís statement of position appeared to alert the Commissioner to the possibility that section 9 might be relevant, and on 11 June 2002 he issued to the disputant a document entitled ìCommissionerís Statement of Position (addendum).îî The decision then briefly sets out the submissions of both parties, before turning to discuss them. The general purpose of the disputes resolution procedure are discussed, the statutory provisions set out, and section 89M(8) identified as the ìcrucial provisionîó specifically the interpretation that should be given to ìinformationî. In determining this, the Authority considers that it is a matter of ìfirst impressionî, and, after considering dictionary and thesaurus meanings, states that ì\[c\]learly the word does not mean anything which one person communicates to another.î The Authority concludes that ì\[i\]t is the requirement of knowledge based in fact which in my view is central to ìinformationî, and that: ìÖ Parliament must have intended section 89M(8) as serving the purpose of permitting the Commissioner unilaterally to pass on to a disputant any additional facts which come into his possession after he receives the disputantís statement of position.î The Authority considered that section 89M(8) did not allow the Commissioner to change the legal basis upon which he has made his disputable decision. In considering the application of section 138G, the Authority determined that ìthe only propositions of law which the Commissioner is entitled to rely on are those ìdisclosed in the Commissionerís statement of position.îî In consequence, the Authority determined that the Commissionerís ìpurportedî addendum, insofar as it sought to rely on the ìadditional groundî to support his disputable decision, was ìnot permitted by the provisions of the Tax Administration Actî, and that the Commissioner was restricted to the legal basis set out in his original SOP. 11 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 6 (June 2003) NZHB HOLDINGS V CIR Case:NZHB Holdings v CIR (first defendant) & Wright Wiseman (second defendant) Decision date:15 May 2003 Act:GST Act 1985 Keywords:Summary judgment, section 43 attachment notice, solicitor trust account, priority interests, proceeds from the sale of, Christchurch Readymix Concrete v Rob Mitchell Builders (in liquidation) Summary Summary judgment application claiming that the CIR had acted unlawfully making an attachment order under section 43 of the GST Act 1985 over proceeds from the sale of a property being held in a solicitorís trust account due to a dispute between the plaintiff and the CIR as to who had priority over the funds. The Court awarded summary judgment to the plaintiff. Christchurch Readymix Concrete v Rob Mitchell Builders (in liquidation) was followed and the Court held that the CIR could not make an attachment order over the proceeds as he did not have ìpriorityî over them and because they were not payable to the taxpayer as required under section 43. Facts Background This case arises because there were competing debts owed by a company not a party to these proceedings, being the taxpayer, Wallace Wells & Wilson Enterprises Limited, to the plaintiff and the first defendant. The taxpayer was registered for GST and the owner of a property at Carlton Gore Road. This property was not a mortgagee sale. The taxpayer defaulted on its obligations to both the first mortgagee and the plaintiff, and a decision was made to sell the Carlton Gore Road property. This was not a mortgagee sale. In order for the sale to be effected, the caveats needed to be lifted and an agreement was reached between the plaintiff and the taxpayer in that respect. An attempt was also made to resolve a dispute that had arisen about whether the GST on the sale should be paid by the taxpayer before the complete satisfaction of its debt to the plaintiff. It was apparent that the taxpayer was motivated to pay the GST and maintain a good commercial relationship with the department. Several ìagreements to mortgageî were also in existence between the plaintiff and the taxpayer relating to the Carlton Gore Road property. The CIR was not privy to these agreements and it was not established in the hearing the exact nature of this equitable interest although the judgment refers to this interest as a ìmort- gageî. With respect to His Honour, it was agreed between the parties at the hearing that the exact nature of this interest needed to be confirmed further. This case was an application for summary judgement against the CIR by the plaintiff alleging that the CIR had no defence to the plaintiffís request for repayment of the GST obtained through the section 43 notice issued to the second defendant, Wright Wiseman. The Dispute The sale of the property settled on 31 January 2002 and the taxpayer paid the plaintiff $158,000 from the proceeds of the sale. The balance of the proceeds $106,787.27 was paid to a law firm, which was holding the funds in trust for the parties as an independent third party, Wright Wiseman (the second defendant). Wallace Wells completed a GST return for the period ending 28 February 2002 for a net amount of GST being $109,574.32. Accompanying the return was a letter from the taxpayer explaining that payment could not actually be made at present as the money being held by Wright Wiseman was in dispute with a third party. The CIR subsequently issued an attachment notice under section 43 of the GST Act 1985 to Wright Wiseman and the sum of $109,574.32 was paid over to the CIR. Decision His Honour, Judge MD Robinson reserved his judgment for the plaintiff and awarded summary judgment against the CIR. His Honour discussed the decision of the Court of Appeal in CIR v Edgewater Motel Limited and how Christchurch Readymix Concrete Limited v Rob Mitchell Builder Ltd (in liquidation) was distinguishable from the Edgewater decision. His Honour accepted that Christchurch Readymix was binding on this decision because Venning J held that the mortgagee had priority ahead of liability for GST on the sale of a property, the sale being by the company pursuant to an agreement for sale and purchase that had become unconditional prior to the company going into liquidation. This was distinguished from Edgewater and the statutory provisions placing an onus on the mortgagee to pay GST when exercising the power of sale. His Honour declined the CIRís submission to defer judgment for this case until the outcome of the CIRís appeal of the Christchurch Readymix was decided. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 6 (June 2003) 12 Further, His Honour held that: ïìOn the existing state of the law there can be no doubt that the plaintiff is entitled to priority over the claim by the first defendant (the CIR) for GST in respect of the sale that is the subject of these proceedingsî. ïThe evidence established that the first defendant with the full knowledge of the agreement between the plaintiff and the second defendant as to the terms and conditions under which the second defendant was to hold the net proceeds from the sale without notice to the plaintiff, persuaded the second defendant to pay those proceeds to the first defendant. ïThat ìtaking into account the high-handed way in which the first defendant (CIR) seized the funds, I am satisfied that it would not be an appropriate exercise of my discretion to refuse the plaintiffís application for summary judgment in these circumstancesî. ïHe considered the issue to be whether the amount held by the second defendant is an amount payable in relation to the taxpayer. The term amount payable is defined in section 43(1)(a) of the GST Act 1985 as follows: (a) Any amount that on the day on which a notice to the person is given under subsection (2) of this section in relation to the registered person, is payable by the person (whether on that personís own account, or as an agent, or as a trustee, or otherwise howsoever) to the registered person. ïThe agreement makes it clear that the funds were either payable to the first defendant (CIR) or the plaintiff and that as the funds held by the second defendant were not at the appropriate time payable by the second defendant to the taxpayer, the first defendant had no right to require the second defendant to pay the funds to the first defendant in terms of a notice under section 42. ïThat the second defendant was in breach of the agreement paying the funds. That the section 43 notice could not require payment of those funds as the funds have never been payable to the taxpayer. ïThat the first defendant should have been aware that the second defendant could not be required to pay those funds to the first defendant under a notice issued pursuant to section 43 of the GST Act, that payment of those funds by the second defendant was in breach of the arrangement between the second defendant and the plaintiff, and that because the plaintiff has priority to the funds over the first defendant, the funds are held under constructive trust by the first defendant. His Honour declined to award summary judgment against the first defendant (CIR) for $10,000 exemplary damages claimed by the plaintiff. 13 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 6 (June 2003) JARROD PETER HESTER & ORS V CIR Case:Jarrod Peter Hester & Ors v CIR Decision date:23 May 2003 Act:Tax Administration Act 1994 Keywords:Interrogatories, secrecy Summary The taxpayersí interlocutory application was not successful. The Commissioner was not required to provide answer to certain interrogatories because they were not relevant. The interrogatories were also caught by section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Facts The plaintiffs were the trustees of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints Deseret Benefit Plan (a superannuation scheme for some of the employees of the church). The plaintiffs claimed that the superannuation scheme was charitable, and was thus exempt from income tax. The Commissioner considered that it was not. The plaintiffs filed interrogatories (written questions of fact that the Commissioner would have to answer prior to the hearing) requesting information about other superannuation funds connected to religious organisations. The Commissioner resisted this on the basis that that information was not relevant and further that he could not reveal information about other taxpayers by virtue of the secrecy provisions in Part IV of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The plaintiffsí original statement of claim made no mention of discrimination on the part of the Commissioner. However, they amended their statement of claim and alleged that the Commissioner acted in breach of section 19 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and section 21 of the Human Rights Act 1993 (discrimination on the grounds of religious belief). The amended pleadings arguably made the Commissionerís treatment of other taxpayers relevant to the proceedings. The plaintiffs considered that the interrogatories would provide evidence of discrimination by the Commissioner. The Commissioner opposed the interrogatories on three grounds: 1.The interrogatories did not relate to matters in question in the proceeding, and 2.The interrogatories were oppressive, and 3.Answers to the interrogatories were not necessary. Decision Master Faire upheld two of the three grounds of the Commissionerís opposition. Firstly, the Master agreed that the interrogatories were not relevant. The Commissioner provided affidavit evidence from the investigator who prepared the Commissionerís notice of response (the plaintiffs had paid the tax and then NOPAed their own return) that he had not compared his analysis to other instances where Inland Revenue had given or declined charitable status to any other church-related fund. Inland Revenue submitted that an action for breach of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 is not a remedy that has been traditionally been available to attack tax assessments. This was consistent with section 109 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 which limits the ways disputable decisions can be challenged. Master Faire concluded (at paragraph \[20\]): In short, those inquiries \[relating to the treatment of other superannuation funds\] are not relevant to the issues that are currently pleaded. What the Court will be required to do is to look at the plaintiffsí Plan and judge it against the type of analysis carried out by Heron J in Presbyterian Church of NZ Beneficiary Fund v Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Secondly, Inland Revenue considered that the interrogatories were oppressive. It was submitted that Inland Revenue had an alphabetical list of some 17,266 organisations with charitable status. They were not organised into subject matter categories and there is no register of organisations which have applied for charitable status and been declined. However, Master Faire accepted that if the interrogatories were limited in some way then this ground of opposition might not be sustainable. Finally, Inland Revenue submitted that answers to the interrogatories were not necessary, by virtue of section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The interrogatories asked a number of questions that could potentially identify other taxpayers. Master Faire concluded that the particular interrogatories were caught by section 81, and that he would have disallowed them on that basis.

DETERMINATION: AMOUNT OF A SPECIFIED WITHHOLDING PAYMENT (BEING HONORARIA PAID TO MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL NEW ZEALAND PLUNKET SOCIETY (INC.)) THAT SHALL BE REGARDED AS EXPENDITURE INCURRED IN PRODUCTION OF PAYMENT Introduction This Determination sets out the amount regarded as expenditure incurred in the production of specified withholding payments when those payments are honoraria paid to members of the Royal New Zealand Plunket Society (Inc.)óìPlunketî. Section NC 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994 requires anyone who makes a source deduction payment to deduct tax when making it. Under section OB 2(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 a withholding payment is included in the definition of ìsource deduction paymentsî. Consequently, any person who makes a withholding payment must deduct tax from it at the time it is made, unless an exemption applies. Honoraria paid to Plunket members come within the definition of ìwithholding paymentî in The Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979. The regulations require withholding tax of 33% to be deducted from honoraria. Regulation 7 of The Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 allows the Commissioner to determine an amount or proportion of any specified withholding payment that is considered to be expenditure incurred in the production of that payment. If the Commissioner has made such a determination, the person paying the specified withholding payment is only required to deduct tax from the amount that exceeds this threshold. Application This determination applies to payments made to Plunket members as reimbursement of costs incurred in undertaking Plunket-related matters. It applies to honoraria paid on or after 1 April 2002. This determination will apply until 31 March 2007, unless previously withdrawn. Interpretation When any Plunket member receives honoraria as reimbursement of expenditure that member had incurred in carrying out Plunket-related activities that payment, up to a maximum of $600 per annum, shall be regarded as expenditure incurred in the production of that payment. However, if the member receives any reimbursement (in addition to honoraria) for expenditure they have incurred, the amount exempted under this determination ($600) shall be reduced by that additional reimbursement. This determination is made by me, acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The determination is signed on the 24 th day of April 2003. Margaret Cotton National Manager Technical Standards Examples Example 1 A Plunket member receives honoraria of $500 in respect of the Plunket-related activities carried out during the year. No other reimbursement had been paid during the year. The payer does not have to deduct withholding tax because the total payment does not exceed $600. Example 2 A Plunket member receives a payment of $525 at the end of February. During the year, in May and August, the member had also received two smaller payments of $100 each as reimbursement of expenses incurred for Plunket-related activities, making a total of $725 for the year. Because the Plunket member had received reimbursement payments of $200 earlier in the year, only $400 of the honorarium received in February could be regarded as expenditure incurred under this determination. Therefore, withholding tax of $41.25 should be deducted from the balance ($125) of the honorarium. 15 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 6 (June 2003) NATIONAL AVERAGE MARKET VALUES OF SPECIFIED LIVESTOCK DETERMINATION 2003 This determination may be cited as ìThe National Average Market Values of Specified Livestock Determination, 2003î.

Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 17 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 6 (June 2003) STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS These statements describe how the Commissioner will, in practice, exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. RETROSPECTIVE ADJUSTMENTS TO SALARIES PAID TO SHAREHOLDER- EMPLOYEES IR-SPS GNL-410 Introduction 1.This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) sets out the criteria for considering whether the circumstances are appropriate for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to permit retrospective adjustments to salaries paid to shareholder-employees where an error has been made in the preparation of a companyís accounts. Application 2.This SPS replaces the QWBA item entitled Retrospective adjustment to salaries paid to shareholder-employees published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 4 (April 1997) at page 9. It addresses the question of when a correction to a shareholder-employeeís salary may be made and should not be taken as being applicable to situations where other mistakes have been made in a companyís accounts and the company is seeking to rectify them. 3.This SPS will apply from 1 July 2003. Background 4.In Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 4 (April 1997) at page 9 we published a QWBA item entitled Retrospective adjustment to salaries paid to shareholder-employees. Its effect is that where an error has been made in the preparation of the accounts of a company, Inland Revenue will amend the companyís assessment to take account of the additional expenses that should have been included in the original return. However, it will not agree to consequential adjustments that the company and the shareholder-employee may wish to make in relation to any salary that was originally agreed to be paid. So neither the companyís nor the individualís assessments would be amended to reflect the fact that a reduced salary would be paid. 5.Subsequently Case U27 (1999) 19 NZTC 9,261 considered this same issue and the Taxation Review Authority, His Honour Willy DJ, arrived at a different conclusion, holding that decisions as to the amounts of a shareholder-employeeís salary for two income years that were made mistakenly could be reversed or amended. The facts in that case were that the accountant was not fully informed of the companyís financial affairs (there was, unknown to him, a tax dispute with Inland Revenue) and this led him to prepare end-of-year accounts that did not accurately reflect the companyís true position. 6.The company had over several years fallen behind in accounting for PAYE, GST, ACC premiums and FBT to the Commissioner. The omitted taxes and penalties not accounted for in error resulted in a substantial overstatement of the resulting profit. This was important because these salaries in this company were only ever paid out of profits. So the level of salaries was based on incorrect profit figures. Although the resolutions authorising the salaries were prepared these were never signed. When the accountant discovered his mistake new resolutions were prepared to authorise the distribution of reduced salaries. 7.The Taxation Review Authority held that section 75 of the Income Tax Act 1976 (now section EB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994), which deems a person to have derived income when it has been dealt with in the personís interest or on their behalf in any of various ways, including being ìcredited in accountî, took effect accordingly, ie it operated on the circumstances brought about by the company resolutions correcting the error. His Honour decided that the company was entitled to and did rectify the error when it came to its notice and the shareholder-employee was obliged to pay tax only on the reduced amounts of income for the relevant income years. 8.In the light of Case U27 it has been decided that the 1997 QWBA should now be withdrawn and replaced by this item. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 6 (June 2003) 18 Legislation Income Tax Act 1994 EB 1 Income credited in account or otherwise dealt withó (1) For the purposes of this Act an amount shall be deemed to have been derived by a person although it has not been actually paid to or received by the person, or already become due or receivable, but has been credited in account, or reinvested, or accumulated, or capitalised, or carried to any reserve, sinking, or insurance fund, or otherwise dealt with in the personís interest or on the personís behalf. (2) Ö . (3) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1), where a deduction is allowed to a company for an income year in respect of expenditure incurred by way of monetary remuneration paid or payable to a person who in relation to the company is a shareholder-employee, the shareholder-employee shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to have derived the monetary remunerationó (a) As to an amount equal toó (i) The amount of the deduction allowable to the company under this Act in respect of that income year and that expenditure; less (ii) Such amount (if any) of that expenditure as is treated as the unexpired portion of accrual expenditure by virtue of section EF 1(5)(c),ó in the same income year as that in which the deduction was allowed to the company; and (b) As to the balance of the monetary remuneration, in such income year, or income years, as the expenditure of the company in respect of the monetary remuneration ceases to be treated by virtue of section EF 1(5)(c) as the unexpired portion of accrual expenditure of the company. (4) For the purposes of subsection (3),ó (a) Where a company referred to in that subsection is a person with a non-standard accounting year, the ìsame income yearî means the income year to which the accounting year in which the deduction was allowed corresponds: (b) Where the shareholder-employee referred to in that subsection is a person with a non-standard accounting year, the ìsame income yearî means the accounting year of the shareholder-employee that corresponds to the income yearó (i) In which the deduction was allowed to the company; or (ii) To which the accounting year of the company in which the deduction was allowed corresponds (where the company is of the kind referred to in paragraph (a)). Standard Practice 9.Provided full disclosure is made, and the relevant financial statements are amended and lodged, then generally Inland Revenue, where: ïa genuine error has been made in the accounts as a result of which a deduction has not been claimed for legitimate expenditure incurred, or a receipt has been incorrectly categorized, and ïthe company has passed a resolution reflecting the change in light of the relationship between the company and the shareholder-employee, and ïa request for correction has been filed with a copy of the resolution, will consider the request in accordance with Standard Practice Statement INV-510 entitled Requests to amend assessments published in Ta x Information Bulletin Vol 14, No 8 (August 2002) and the principles set out therein. 10. It is expected that requests of this nature will be made in a timely fashion. What is timely involves an exercise of judgment. There are two aspects of timeliness here: ïOnce a mistake has been discovered then the parties should set about attending to it promptly. In the majority of cases a month should be a sufficient period of time to discuss, prepare amending resolutions, hold a formal meeting and then to file fresh accounts with the department. ïAs to how long a mistake may go undetected, the answer is less certain. Timeliness requires that a mistake is discovered when in the course of events and in the circumstances of the taxpayer company one would have expected it to have been discovered. It could be that many months may go by before the error is detected. The Commissioner will not adopt ìthe normal course of eventsî criterion for some cases will be unusual. For example, Case U27 was unusual in that there was a lack of communication between the accountant and principal shareholder and director. The latter kept certain information about the arrears of taxes to himself. 11. Where Inland Revenue agrees to approve such a retrospective adjustment, section EB 1 will deem the shareholder-employeeís salary to be the amount as determined by the amending resolution and, under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, Inland Revenue will adjust the companyís and employeeís assessments accordingly. 19 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 6 (June 2003) Examples 12. The following situations may give some guidance as to when Inland Revenue will permit adjustments to be made. a.Incorrect treatment of receipt Where there is an error in the categorization of a loan receipt as revenue and this results in an overstatement of income, an adjustment may be made. b.Omission of expenditure Where an error arises from the omission of expenditure incurred in the current year an adjustment may be made. However, for a loss to trigger an adjustment it should be a real loss. c.Company still in profit even though error made Although an error has been made in the accounts that error is not sufficient to produce an overall loss and the company still has sufficient profit after the accounts have been corrected to cover the salary originally agreed to be paid. In this situation Inland Revenue will consider each application for an adjustment on its merits. The Commissioner will need to consider the nature of the contract between the parties and past practice. While in this circumstance there would not be the same pressing need to amend or rescind the salary declaration, nevertheless the company could find the situation inconvenient and desire that the amount credited to the shareholder- employee at least be reduced to some extent. d.Accrual expenditure A company has committed itself to certain expenditure in one year although it has not had to discharge or bear that expense until a following year. If such an item has been overlooked and the accounts need revision then it would be less likely for the amounts credited to the shareholder-employee as salary to be revised as well. There may still be funds available to pay them. Once again this is a matter where circumstances will vary. Where there is accrual expenditure the answer will depend on the amount of the unexpired portion of that expenditure relating to future income years. The Commissioner will consider each application for an adjustment on its merits. This determination is signed by me on the 17 th day of June 2003. Margaret Cotton National Manager (Technical Standards) SHORTFALL PENALTIES A number of Standard Practice Statements are affected by changes to the shortfall penalty provisions contained in the recently enacted Taxation (Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003. Withdrawn Standard Practice Statements The following Standard Practice Statements are withdrawn from 1 April 2003, in relation to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2003. The affected Standard Practice Statements are: ïINV-200 Not taking reasonable care TIB Vol 10, No 3 (March 1998) ïINV-205 Unacceptable interpretation TIB Vol 10, No 3 (March 1998) ïINV-206 Unacceptable interpretationó non-application of a tax law TIB Vol 10, No 6 (May 1998) ïINV-210 Gross carelessness TIB Vol 10, No 3 (March 1998) ïINV-215 Abusive tax position TIB Vol 10, No 3 (March 1998) ïINV-220 Evasion or similar act TIB Vol 10, No 3 (March 1998) Please note that the above Standard Practice Statements will continue to apply to tax positions taken before 1 April 2003. Inland Revenue is reviewing the affected Standard Practice Statements and drafting new Standard Practice Statements in relation to the reduction of penalties for previous behaviour (ìgood behaviourî) and the new promoter penalty (sections 141FB, 141EB & 141EC of the Tax Administration Act 1994). Inland Revenue will be consulting on the new items in due course. For further information on the legislative changes, please see Tax Information Bulletin Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 6 (June 2003) 20 NEW LEGISLATION DEEMED RATE OF RETURN FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUND INTERESTS The deemed rate of return for foreign investment fund interests has decreased from 10.46% to 9.90% for the 2002-2003 income year. The deemed rate of return, which is set annually, applies to all types of investments, including interests in superannuation schemes and life insurance policies. It is based on an average of five-year government stock rates to which a margin of 4% is added. The change was approved by Order in Council on 26 May 2003. Income Tax (Deemed Rate of Return, 2002-03 Income Year) Regulations 2003/114 NZAID GRANTS TRANSFERRED TO OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES From July 2003, grants or parts of grants made by the New Zealand Agency for International Development and transferred to overseas development programmes will be exempted from GST. The change corrects an anomaly in the law whereby no GST is payable on a government grant that is paid directly to an overseas agency, but a grant made to a New Zealand agency that transfers the money to an overseas agency attracts GST. The change means that New Zealand recipients of NZAID grants intended for overseas use will have to return GST only on the portion of the grant that is allocated for administration and capacity building in New Zealand, typically between 1% and 4%. The change was approved by Order in Council on 26 May 2003. Goods and Services Tax (Grants and Subsidies) Amendment Order 2003/113 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX ñ PRESCRIBED RATE OF INTEREST ON LOW-INTEREST, EMPLOYMENT-RELATED LOANS The prescribed rate of interest used to calculate fringe benefit tax for low-interest employment-related loans has decreased from 7.83% to 7.74% for the quarter beginning 1 April 2003. The rate is reviewed regularly to ensure it is in line with the Reserve Bankís survey of first mortgage interest rates. It was last changed with effect from the quarter beginning 1 October 2002. The new rate was approved by Order in Council on 26 May 2003. Income Tax (Fringe Benefit Tax, Interest on Loans) Amendment Regulations 2003/115 21 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 6 (June 2003) QUESTIONS WEíVE BEEN ASKED This section of the TIB sets out answers to some inquiries weíve received. We publish these as they may be of general interest to readers. A general similarity to items published here will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case should be considered on its own facts. GENERAL DEPRECIATION DETERMINATION ñ FISHING NETS We have been asked for clarification of depreciation determination DEP50 (published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) at page 18). Two separate matters have been raised. Background Determination DEP50 inserted two general asset classes in the ìFishingî industry category. The general asset classes are ìNets (fishing) bottom trawl, complete with accessoriesî and ìNets (fishing) other, complete with accessoriesî. The depreciation rate set for bottom trawl fishing nets is based on an expected useful life of one year. All other nets have an expected useful life of two years. There were corresponding changes to the six specific asset classes which previously covered a fishing net and its associated parts. ìNets (fishing)î was removed. ìBridlesî, ìSweepsî and ìTrawl Boardsî were also removed and are now to be treated as ìaccessoryî items. The estimated useful life of ìWire (trawl)î was amended to one year. A further change applies to ìLines (fishing)î. This has been deleted from the industry category and is now to be treated as an allowable deduction. The first query ñ fishing nets become unusable QOrdinarily, fishing nets are depreciated over the expected useful life of the particular asset. However, it may be that due to accident or other damage beyond normal wear and tear, the net is lost, damaged beyond repair, with the result that the actual life of a particular net is less than its expected useful life. It has been suggested that actual life of nets is highly variable and may (depending on unpredictable events) be as short as a one-off use or, with regular repairs and maintenance, a year or more. We have been asked how to account for allowable deductions for depreciation in that situation. AThese types of situations are covered by section EG 19 of the Income Tax Act 1994 which deals with dispositions of depreciable property (other than a building). The definition of ìdisposalî in section EG 19 is wide and includes any event as a consequence of which the property is irreparably damaged, or lost and not recovered. For example, when a net is lost in one trawl through snagging or becomes unusable as a result of other circumstances. This broad concept of ìdisposalî is important because, for the purposes of section EG 19, such property is deemed to have been disposed of by a taxpayer for a consideration that is less than its adjusted tax value at the time of disposition. In that situation the loss on disposition is deductible in the income year in which the disposition occurs (rather than there being ongoing depreciation deductions claimed). The second query ñ allowable deductions for fishing lines QWe have also been asked to clarify the correct treatment to be applied to fishing lines. This issue is significant for long-lining operators, whose vessels do not carry nets (and so cannot account for lines as an ìaccessoryî item), but will also be of interest to the wider fishing industry. ATaxpayers operating in the fishing industry will normally be entitled to claim a tax deduction in respect of expenditure outlaid on the acquisition and use of fishing lines. Information available to the Commissioner indicates that a long-lining operation will typically consume large quantities of line coils each year, thus supporting the treatment of lines as potentially an allowable deduction and not depreciable property (as was previously the case). This means that the expenditure will now be allowed as an immediate deduction under section BD 2(1) as an ordinary business expense (as long as the normal tests of deductibility are met). As such, fishing lines are not covered by the potential range of accessory items now included in the two general asset classes for fishing nets. This will be the case for all fishing industry taxpayers and not only long-lining operators. It is not expected that this will result in any significant change, as lines were described as an ìexpenseî item previously. The effective timing of the deduction may, however, be subject to section EF 1 in the event that the lines have not been fully used up in deriving gross income at the end of the income year. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 6 (June 2003) 22 COMPANY RESTRUCTURING: ìDEMERGERSî AND ìSPIN-OUTSî ñ BHP, WMC AND CSR The department has noted several recent occasions on which Australian-listed companies have restructured in such a way as to distribute shares in a subsidiary of the listed company. Such restructurings are commonly referred to as demergers or ìspin-outsî. We have been asked about the tax consequences for New Zealand resident taxpayers who receive new shares as the result of such a ìspin-outî. Background We are aware of demergers or spin-outs in the last twelve months by BHP Billiton Limited, WMC Limited and CSR Limited. Typically, the restructuring company (ìheadî company) reduces its own capital (but without reducing the number of shares it has on issue) and applies funds on behalf of the shareholders to acquire shares in a subsidiary company (the ìspin-outî company), which are transferred or issued to the shareholder. There will sometimes also be a ìdemergerî dividend declared at the time of the demerger, the proceeds also being applied to acquiring the spin-out shares. After the demerger or spin-out the head company shareholders still hold the same number of shares in the head company and also hold shares in the spin-out company. Additional shareholders may also own some (typically less than 20%) of the spin-out company. Issues There are several taxation issues to consider: the dividend consequences, the treatment of gains on disposal of the new shares, and their cost base. The discussion following is specific to the above-mentioned Australian demergers as circumstances can vary from country to country and company to company. Dividend consequences A ìcapital reductionî of the type described above resulting in a ìspin-outî or ìdemergerî, is a dividend derived by New Zealand tax resident shareholders. It is derived on the date the capital reduction is effected. The dividend must be included in the shareholderís gross income for the period. Likewise any specific ìdemergerî dividend is also income and must be returned. The term ìdividendî is defined in section CF 2(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994. The definition is extensive: it applies to any company, and to any payment, distribution, or transaction, whether in money or moneyís worth, made to or with any person, with respect to their own or another personís capacity as a shareholder in that company. While some transactions involving the cancellation of shares are treated as not constituting dividends, the Commissioner does not consider that those rules have any application in the transactions identified above or in other similarly structured demergers, as there is no cancellation of any shares. Nor would the transactions be treated as bonus issues for New Zealand tax purposes. The value of the dividend is the New Zealand dollar equivalent of the amount credited to the shareholder. The market value of the shares subsequently acquired on the date of distribution is not relevant for dividend calculation purposes. For the purpose of establishing an appropriate exchange rate the New Zealand/Australia exchange rate should be used (these are set out on page 23 for the purposes of those transactions identified). Taxpayers may use the departmentís IR 270 exchange rate form or its online calculator, which gives the mid-month telegraphic buying rates for Australia, or obtain from their bank the actual exchange rate for the day in question. Tax treatment of the dividend differs according to whether the New Zealand tax resident is a corporate or non-corporate shareholder. (1)Non-corporate shareholders (including individuals, trusts (other than unit trusts) and superannuation funds) New Zealand tax resident non-corporate shareholders must include the amount of the distribution derived (converted to equivalent New Zealand dollars) as dividend income, when calculating gross income in their income tax return for the relevant year. It is unlikely that any foreign tax credits would be available as these payments (including demerger dividends) are not treated as dividends under Australian tax rules, so no non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) will have been deducted. (2)Corporate shareholders (including unit trusts) Dividends derived from a foreign company by corporate New Zealand tax resident shareholders are exempt income under section CB 10(1) ITA. However, corporate shareholders are required by section NH 1 ITA to deduct and pay to the Commissioner an upfront dividend withholding payment from foreign withholding payment dividends. The amount of dividend withholding payment is calculated according to a formula provided in section NH 2 ITA. The formula uses the basic company income tax rate of 33%. Underlying foreign tax credits would only be available if any person held more than 10% of the Australian head companyís shares (which, in the examples discussed, is unlikely). 23 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 6 (June 2003) Gains on any disposal of shares The Scheme of Arrangement (or equivalent documentation) sent to shareholders for a ìspin-outî or ìdemergerî may include a sale facility option. That is, shareholders have the ability to instruct the company to sell the ìspin-outî shares and receive cash. The normal tax rules regarding share disposals apply to New Zealand resident shareholders wishing to sell shares received under the restructuring process. Where the shares in the ìheadî company are held on capital account the shares in the ìspin-outî company should also be held on capital account. Thus there should be no tax implications for those shareholders who use the sale facility to sell their shares, or sell later, provided that the shares continue to be held on capital account. However, taxpayers, if uncertain, should obtain their own advice on the issue. Sale proceeds, whether by way of the ìsale facility optionî or later, will be gross income if the ìheadî company shares which created the distribution entitlement were held on revenue account. A deduction is available for the cost of the shares. Cost base of shares for tax purposes The scheme applies funds that belong to the shareholders (being the capital reduction and any demerger dividend) to acquire shares in the demerged company. Therefore the cost base for tax purposes to the shareholder of the shares acquired in the demerged company will be equal to the amount of the dividend received. Again for tax purposes the cost base of the shares in the head company does not change. Recent Australian demergers In the last twelve months at least three Australian-listed companies have demerged: ïBHP Billiton Limited: shareholders now have shares in BHP Billiton Limited (ìheadî) and, on a one-for-five basis, BHP Steel Limited (the ìspin-outî) (effective 22 July 2002), ïWMC Limited: shareholders now have shares in Alumina Limited (formerly WMC Limited) and, on a one-for-one basis, WMC Resources Limited (ìspin-outî) (effective 11 December 2002), and ïCSR Limited: shareholders now have shares in CSR Limited (ìheadî) and, on a one-for-one basis, Rinker Group Limited (ìspin-outî) (effective 11 April 2003). Each of these will have a number of New Zealand shareholders. Using the exchange rates on IR 270, the dividend amounts of the three demergers (both the capital reduction, and where appropriate, the demerger dividend) are: Head company$A dividend$NZ dividend per head shareper head share BHP Billiton Limited$0.69$0.80 WMC Limited$3.51$3.86 CSR Limited$1.53$1.69 Example of effect on a shareholder Using WMC Limited as the example, the demerger involved the following steps: ïA capital reduction in WMC Limited of $A2.78 per WMC Limited share ïA ìShare Scheme Dividendî or ìdemergerî dividend of $A0.73 ïThe application of the total proceeds of this, $A3.51, to acquire shares in WMC Resources Limited, and ïThe renaming of WMC Limited to Alumina Limited. The shareholder still has the same number of ìhead companyî shares, now in Alumina Limited, at their original cost. The shareholder also has an equivalent number of shares in WMC Resources Limited at a cost of $A3.51 and has received a dividend of $A3.51. Return filing While taxpayers have a duty to make due enquiry about their own tax affairs, this item is published to clarify the Commissionerís position. Some taxpayers may have already filed tax returns for the year ending 31 March 2003 and may have overlooked inclusion of the dividends (and where applicable the proceeds of share sales) derived from the spin-out. The department will accept and process a request to amend the return from those taxpayers. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 6 (June 2003) 24 OTHER ITEMS OF INTEREST LOSS ATTRIBUTING QUALIFYING COMPANIES Inland Revenue has determined that Loss Attributing Qualifying Companies (LAQCs) must attribute all losses in full to the shareholders, and could not first offset losses to other group companies in the same way that ordinary group companies and qualifying companies can. The Qualifying companies booklet (IR 435) contains the previous view that the company could elect to make inter-company offsets prior to attributing losses to the shareholders. This is now considered to be incorrect.

Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 7 (July 2003) 6 BINDING RULINGS This section of the TIB contains binding rulings that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has issued recently. The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our booklet Adjudication & Rulings, a guide to binding rulings (IR 715) or the article on page 1 of Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 12 (May 1995) or Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995). You can download these publications from our website at www.ird.govt.nz Note: Product Ruling BR Prd 01/09 was withdrawn, effective from 16 August 2003, to allow for a replacement ruling to be issued to reflect the Commissionerís change of view in relation to the withholding tax treatment for payments made in relation to the delivery of newspapers, leaflets, brochures, catalogues and other such advertising material (to the extent that the carriage of those items does not require registration under the Postal Services Act 1998). The replacement ruling, BR Prd 03/14, is set out below. PRODUCT RULING ñ BR PRD 03/14 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Deltarg Distribution Systems Limited (ìDeltargî). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 (ìthe ITAî) unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BD 2(2)(c) and DE 1; the definitions of ìextra emolumentî, ìincome from employmentî, ìsalary or wagesî, ìspecified office holderî and ìwithholding paymentî in section OB 1; the definition of ìsource deduction paymentî in section OB 2(1); the definition of ìPAYE rulesî in section OZ 1(1); and section 6(3)(b) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (ìthe GST Actî). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the engagement of persons (ìthe Contractorsî) by Deltarg pursuant to a standard form contract (ìthe Contractî), for the delivery of newspapers, leaflets, brochures, catalogues, advertising material, samples and other similar items to households and other premises throughout New Zealand. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs following. 1.Deltarg carries on the business of distributing newspapers, leaflets, brochures, catalogues, advertising material, samples and other similar items to households and other premises throughout New Zealand. 2.Deltarg engages the Contractors pursuant to the Contract, to deliver particular items within a specified period, to each house, flat or other premises located within a designated area, by placing one of each item in each letterbox (or other specified location). 3.The Contract contains both general terms and conditions (the text of which is appended to this Ruling as Appendix I) and a schedule (a copy of which is appended to this Ruling as Appendix II) setting out the terms specific to the particular delivery for which the Contractor is engaged. 4.The items delivered by the Contractors pursuant to the Contract are not items the carriage of which requires Deltarg to be registered as a postal operator under the Postal Services Act 1998. Condition stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is subject to the following condition: a)The relationship between Deltarg and the Contractors is, and during the period of this Ruling will continue to be, entirely in accordance with the Contract provided in the application and affixed to the ruling as appendixes I and II, and that there are no other collateral contracts, agreements, terms or conditions, written or otherwise, relating to the engagement of any of the Contractors. 7 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 7 (July 2003) How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: ïFor the purposes of the PAYE rules, any payment made to a Contractor by Deltarg pursuant to the Contract will not be ìsalary or wagesî, an ìextra emolumentî, a ìwithholding paymentî or a payment made to a ìspecified office holderî in respect of the activities of a specified office, within the meaning of those terms as defined in section OB 1. Any such payment will therefore not be a ìsource deduction paymentî as defined in section OB 2(1), for the purposes of the PAYE rules. ïFor the purposes of sections BD 2(2)(c) and DE 1, any payment made to a Contractor by Deltarg pursuant to the Contract will not be ìincome from employmentî as that term is defined in section OB 1. ïFor the purposes of the GST Act, the provision of services by any Contractor to Deltarg under the Contract will not be excluded from the definition of ìtaxable activityî in section 6 of that Act by section 6(3)(b) of that Act. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 16 August 2003 to 16 August 2006. This Ruling is signed by me on the 4th day of July 2003.

Appendix II Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 7 (July 2003) 10 PAYMENTS MADE BY PARENTS OR GUARDIANS OF STUDENTS TO STATE SCHOOLS ñ GST TREATMENT PUBLIC RULING ñ BR PUB 03/04 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (ìthe Actî) unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections 8 and 10(2) of the Act and the definition of ìconsiderationî in section 2 of the Act. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the payment of amounts (whether described as ìschool feesî, ìactivity feesî or otherwise) by parents or guardians of pupils who are New Zealand citizens or New Zealand residents (or who are otherwise not foreign students under the Education Act 1989) and who are enrolled at state schools (including schools integrated within the state system of education under the Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975) to a Board of Trustees of such a school. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: A payment which is consideration for the supply of goods or services by a registered person, in New Zealand, in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity, is subject to GST. Payments made by parents or guardians of children who are New Zealand citizens or New Zealand residents (or who are otherwise not foreign students under the Education Act 1989) and who are enrolled at state schools to the Board of Trustees of such a school for the purpose of a general fund to assist with meeting school costs, are not consideration for the supply of education to which there is a statutory entitlement and which the Board has a statutory obligation to provide free of charge. Therefore, GST is not payable on such amounts. If other services, not integral to the supply of education services to which there is a statutory entitlement, are supplied on the basis that the supply is conditional upon payment being made for such services, the payment is consideration for that supply. GST is chargeable on payments made in those circumstances. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 20 June 2003 to 20 June 2006. This Ruling is signed by me on the 20 th day of June 2003. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 03/04 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 03/04 (ìthe Rulingî). The subject matter of the Ruling was previously considered in Appendix B of TIB Vol 2, No 4 (November 1990) at page 1. The Ruling replaces that earlier item. Background State primary and secondary schools are controlled and managed by their Boards of Trustees: section 75 of the Education Act 1989 (ìthe Education Actî). Under that section, except to the extent that any enactment or the general law of New Zealand provides otherwise, a schoolís Board has complete discretion to control the management of the school as it thinks fit. Under section 93 of the Education Act, every state school is required to have a Board of Trustees. Grants are paid out of public money to Boards for the purpose of administering their schools: section 79 of the Education Act. The Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975 (ìthe PSCI Actî) enables private schools originally established to provide education with a special character to become part of the state system of education as an integrated school. Under section 7 of the PSCI Act, integration is effected by the proprietors of a private school entering into an integration agreement with the Minister of Education. Upon integration, an integrated school becomes part of the state system of education and is subject to the legislation governing other state schools, but subject to the PSCI Act: section 4 of the PSCI Act. Under section 40(2) of the PSCI Act, the proprietors of integrated schools own, hold on trust, or lease the land and buildings of the schools and are liable for all mortgages, liens, and other charges in respect of the land and buildings. They are also responsible for the maintenance and preservation of the special character of the school: section 3(3) of the PSCI Act. As with other state schools, the controlling authority of an integrated school is its Board of Trustees: section 25(5) of the PSCI Act. 11 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 7 (July 2003) Under section 70 of the Education Act, the Secretary of Education may specify the terms and conditions applying to land and buildings occupied by Boards of Trustees, whether or not the land and buildings are owned by the Crown. The terms and conditions specified may include standards of maintenance of capital works and minimum safety and health requirements. Every Board is to have a written charter. The purpose of the charter is to establish the missions, aims, objectives, directions and targets of the school Board that will give effect to the Governmentís national education guidelines and the Boardís priorities: section 61. A copy of the schoolís first charter and every updated charter must be provided to the Secretary of Education: section 62. The effect of a school charter is that it is an undertaking by the Board to the Minister to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the school is managed, organised and administered for the purposes set out in the school charter and the school, its students and community achieve the aims and objectives set out in the school charter: section 63 of the Education Act. A school charter will not take effect if the Secretary of Education determines that it is inconsistent with the Education Act or the national administration guidelines: section 63A Education Act. The Secretary of Education may direct a Board to get specialist support if the Secretary considers that the Board is not meeting or is not likely to meet its statutory obligations (including the aims, purposes and objectives of its charter): section 64A of the Education Act. The national education guidelines are defined in section 2 of the Education Act as the national education goals, foundation curriculum policy statements, national curriculum statements, and national administration guidelines, for the time being in force under section 60A of that Act. Section 60A(1) permits the Minister to publish by notice in the Gazette all or any of the following: (a)National education goals (that is to say statements of desirable achievements by the school system, or by an element of the school system): (aa) Foundation curriculum policy statements, which are statements of policy concerning teaching, learning, and assessment that are made for the purposes of underpinning and giving direction toó (i)The way in which curriculum and assessment responsibilities are to be managed in schools: (ii) National curriculum statements and locally developed curriculum: (b)National curriculum statements (that is to say statements ofó (i)The areas of knowledge and understanding to be covered by students; and (ii) The skills to be developed by students; and (iii) Desirable levels of knowledge, understanding, and skill, to be achieved by students,ó during the years of schooling): (c)National administration guidelines, which are guidelines relating to school administration and which may (without limitation)ó (i)set out statements of desirable codes or principles of conduct or administration for specified kinds or descriptions of person or body, including guidelines for the purposes of section 61: (ii) set out requirements relating to planning and reporting includingó (A) scope and content areas, where appropriate: (B) the timeframe for the annual update of the school charter: (C) broad requirements relating to schoolsí consultation with parents, staff, school proprietors (in the case of integrated schools) and school communities, and the broad requirements to ensure that Boards take all reasonable steps to discover and consider the views and concerns of Maori communities living in the geographical area the school serves, in the development of a school charter: (D) variations from the framework for school planning and reporting for certain schools or classes of schools, based on school performance: (iii) communicate the Governmentís policy objectives: (iv) set out transitional provisions for the purposes of national administration guidelines. Regulations providing for the control, management, organisation, conduct, and administration of schools may be made: section 78 of the Education Act. Regulations made under section 78 prescribing a course of study are not to restrict the method by or manner in which any subject forming part of the course is to be taught, except to the extent necessary to ensure that the teaching of the subject is consistent with the general aims of the course. Under section 3 of the Education Act, everyone who is not a foreign student (that is, generally a New Zealand citizen or resident) is entitled to free enrolment and free education at any state school during the period beginning on their 5th birthday, and ending on the 1st of January after their 19th birthday. Students enrolled at an integrated school are entitled to free education on the same terms and conditions as students enrolled at other state schools: section 35(1) of the PSCI Act. However, the proprietors of an integrated school may require payment of attendance dues as a condition of enrolment and attendance: section 36 of the PSCI Act. The money received from attendance dues can only be used for the purpose of meeting debts, mortgages, liens, Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 7 (July 2003) 12 or other charges relating to the school premises or for improvements required under the integration agreement or for capital works required by the Minister pursuant to section 40(2)(d) of the PSCI Act: section 36(3) of the PSCI Act. Attendance dues paid to the proprietors of integrated schools are payments to secure the enrolment of a pupil in a school for which the proprietors provide the buildings and ensure the special character, and are subject to GST. See Turakina Maori Girls College Board of Trustees v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,032. Each year parents or guardians of students enrolled at state schools may be asked by school Boards for payment of a nominated amount to assist with meeting school costs. These payments are commonly referred to by schools as ìfeesî. In the case of integrated schools such fees are in addition to attendance dues payable to the proprietors. A Ministry of Education Circular (Circular 1998/25), however, states that whatever terms are used to describe such payments, they are in fact donations and cannot be made compulsory. Schools may also ask for payments to cover a variety of items including: the cost of class trips, the cost of materials in practical subjects such as workshop technology, the cost of swimming lessons, fees for performances by visiting drama groups etc. These payments are commonly referred to as ìactivity feesî. The Ruling addresses the issue of whether such payments (however described, but commonly referred to as ìschool feesî or ìactivity feesî) are subject to GST. Legislation Under section 8 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (ìthe Actî), GST is charged on supplies (other than exempt supplies) made by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity by reference to the value of the supply. The value of the supply is determined under section 10(2). Section 10(2) states: Subject to this section, the value of a supply of goods and services shall be such amount as, with the addition of the tax charged, is equal to the aggregate of,ó (a)To the extent that the consideration for the supply is consideration in money, the amount of the money: (b)To the extent that the consideration for the supply is not consideration in money, the open market value of that consideration. The definition of ìconsiderationî in section 2 of the Act reads as follows: ìConsiderationî in relation to the supply of goods and services to any person, includes any payment made or any act or forbearance, whether or not voluntary, in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of any goods and services, whether by that person or by any other person; but does not include any payment made by any person as an unconditional gift to any non-profit body: Application of the Legislation Scheme of the Act Under section 8(1), GST is chargeable on the supply of goods and services by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person by reference to the value of the supply. The value of the supply is the consideration provided for the supply (including both monetary consideration and non-monetary consideration): section 10(2). GST is not payable on payments which are not ìconsiderationî as defined in the Act. ìConsiderationî is widely defined. Consideration The statutory definition of ìconsiderationî is wider than the contract law meaning of ìconsiderationî. In The Trustee, Executors and Agency Co New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,076 Chisholm J commented in respect of the definition of ìconsiderationî as follows: In the context of this matter I am not persuaded that it is helpful or appropriate to reflect upon the ordinary meaning of the word. The statutory definition extends the ordinary meaning and it is the scope of the extended statutory definition which needs to be determined. (p.13,085) The following principles can be drawn from the cases on the statutory definition of ìconsiderationî: ïUnder the first part of the definition of ìconsiderationî, it is irrelevant whether the payment is voluntary. No contract between the person making the supply and the person providing the consideration is necessary. The supply need not be made to the person who makes the payment: Turakina Maori Girlsí College Board of Trustees v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,032. In the Turakina case McKay J, referring to the definition, said: It is clear from this definition that the supply of any service for consideration is part of a ìtaxable activityî under sec 6, even though it is to a person other than the person who provides the consideration. Likewise, the value of the supply is to be measured by the consideration, whether or not the consideration is provided by the person to whom the service is supplied. It is not necessary that there should be a contract between the supplier and the person providing the consideration, so long as the consideration is ìin respect of, in response to or for the inducement of the supplyî. ïThe supply also need not be made by the person who receives the payment. In Trustees & Executors Chisholm J said: Ö in my opinion the crucial factor is the strength of the connection between the payment and the supply. If there is sufficient proximity between the supply and payment to satisfy the requirement that the payment is ìin respect ofî (or ìin response to, or for the inducement ofî) the supply of goods then the payment qualifies as ìconsiderationî notwithstanding that the payment is made to a third party. (p.13,086) 13 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 7 (July 2003) ïAlthough the statutory definition of ìconsiderationî is wider than the contract law meaning, not every payment received by a registered person is ìconsiderationî for GST purposes. A distinction is drawn between a payment in respect of the payeeís taxable activity and a payment that is consideration for a supply of goods and services: Director- General of Social Welfare v De Morgan (1996) 17 NZTC 12,636. ïFor a payment to be ìconsiderationî within the first part of the definition, there must be a sufficient relationship between the making of the payment and the supply of goods or services. See CIR v NZ Refining Co Ltd (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187; Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,075; Taupo Ika Nui Body Corporate v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,147; Trustees & Executors. In the NZ Refining case Blanchard J said: It is fundamental to the GST Act that the tax is levied on or in respect of supplies. It is not a tax on receipts or on turnover; it is a tax on transactions: C of IR v Databank Systems Ltd. It is therefore necessary, as Mr Green submitted, to distinguish between supplies and the taxable activity (as defined in section 6) in the course of which they are made. The definition in section 6 itself requires a nexus between a supply and consideration, as does section 10. The tax itself is levied by section 8 on a supply in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity and is ìby reference to the value of that supplyî. Section 10 provides that the value of a supply is ìto the extent of the consid- eration for the supplyî the amount of the money involved or the non-monetary open market value of the considera- tion. Already, before turning to the definition of ìconsid- erationî, it can be seen that, again, a linkage between supply and consideration is requisite to the imposition of the tax. The definition of ìconsiderationî, though broad, cannot and does not dispense with that requirement. To constitute consideration for supply a payment must be made for that supply, though it need not be made to the supplier nor does the supply have to be made to the payer. There is a practical necessity for a sufficient connection between the payment and the supply. The mechanics of the legislation will otherwise make it impossible to collect the GST (p.13,193). \[Emphasis added\] ïAn expectation that the payee will supply goods and services is not enough. It is not sufficient that the person who receives the payment carries out some activity which has the effect of benefiting either the person making the payment or some other person. It is also not sufficient that the payment enables the payee to carry on its activity. Hence, a payment made by the Crown to a charitable trust established by the Crown to promote the economic development and well-being of the Chatham Islands and to promote the provision of services in the interests of the community was not consideration for GST purposes. The trustees were fulfilling their fiduciary duties under the trust and the payment was not an inducement for the performance of services by the trustees. Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,075. ïThe expressions ìin respect of, in response to, or for the inducement ofî in the definition involve an element of reciprocity: Taupo Ika Nui Body Corporate v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,147; Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,075. ïThere can be two separate supplies for GST purposes where performance of services under a contract with one person, is also performance under a separate contract with another person. In Suzuki New Zealand Ltd v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,096 the Court of Appeal said: \[23\]Ö.This is simply an instance of the common enough situation in which performance obligations under two separate contracts with different counter-parties overlap, so that performance of an obligation under one contract also happens to perform an obligation under another. In such case a supply can simultaneously occur for GST purposes under both contracts. There is a nexus in both cases between the performance and the consideration given by the other party. In Suzuki, the taxpayer had an obligation to repair defective vehicles under a warranty given by the taxpayer to its customers. In turn, the taxpayer had a warranty from its parent company (from which the taxpayer had purchased the vehicles) and had received payments from the parent company for carrying out the obligations of the parent company under the parent companyís warranty. There were two separate supplies: the supply of repair services under the warranty to customers and the supply of repair services to satisfy the obligations of the parent company under its warranty. As two separate supplies were made, the Court of Appeal did not accept that the Commissioner had sought to impose tax on the same supply \[para 24\]. Existing statutory obligation There have been two GST cases relating to a situation where the parties had statutory rights or obligations outside any contractual relationship there might have been between the parties. These are: Television New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,295 and Case U1 (1999) 19 NZTC 9,001. The TVNZ case concerned payments made by the Maori Affairs Department to the Broadcasting Council (whose assets and liabilities were later vested in TVNZ) for the purpose of a training scheme operated by the Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 7 (July 2003) 14 Broadcasting Council (and later TVNZ) for Maori trainees. The taxpayerís argument was that a supply had not been made for the payment because in collaborating with the Maori Affairs Department the Broadcasting Council was merely discharging a statutory obligation to be a good employer (which included operating a personnel policy that complied with the principle of being a good employer, including recognition of the aims and aspirations of the Maori people, the employment requirements of the Maori people, and the need for greater involvement of the Maori people as employees of the Broadcasting Council). Tompkins J held that the Broadcasting Council had made a supply of services, being the provision of the training programme. There was a contractual obligation to provide the services and the fact that the supply was in accordance with the statutory obligations of the Broadcasting Council did not affect the conclusion that a supply was made under the contract. Under contract law, the performance of a statutory duty is not consideration, although the undertaking of something more than the bare discharge of the duty can be good consideration: see Ward v Byham \[1956\] 2 All ER 318; Williams v Williams \[1957\] 1 All ER 305. The TVNZ case is consistent with that principle. There was reciprocity between the Broadcasting Council and the Maori Affairs Department. Payment would not have been made if the services had not been provided. The Broadcasting Council had discretion as to how it would carry out its statutory obligation to be a good employer. The provision of training services under the agreement with the Maori Affairs Department was in accordance with the Broadcasting Councilís statutory obligations, but there was no direct and specific statutory obligation to provide the training. In Case U1 the taxpayer had granted a lease which provided that the tenant had an obligation to pay rates (in addition to rental). The tenant in Case U1 was an ìoccupierî under the Rating Powers Act 1988 (being the lessee of a property under a lease for a term of not less than 12 months). Under that Act the occupier has primary liability to pay rates. The issue in Case U1 was whether the payment of rates formed part of the consideration for the lease. (Hence, the issue considered in Case U1 was slightly different from the issue considered in the TVNZ case.) Judge Barber considered and rejected the argument that the payment of rates was consideration (as the obligation contained in the lease to pay rates was ìin respect ofî the lease) and that the payment of rates by the lessee was part of the inducement to persuade the landlord to lease the farm at the rental figure agreed upon and was also part of the lesseeís response to the granting of the lease. Judge Barber considered that the lease merely recorded the legal position and was not consideration as the payment of rates by the lessee satisfied the lesseeís own statutory obligation rather than an obligation of the lessor. (However, the payment of rates by a lessee under a lease would be part of the consideration for the lease if the lessor was primarily liable for payment of rates and the lessee had accepted an obligation under the lease to meet the lessorís liability.) In both cases, the essential issue was whether there was a sufficient relationship between the payment and a supply. The fact that one of the parties has an existing statutory duty is to be considered in that context. Role of School Boards In Maddever v Umawera School Board \[1993\] 2 NZLR 478 Williams J discussed the role of school Boards as follows: The 1989 Act was based on Administering for excellence: The Report of the Task Force to Review Education Administration (the Picot report (1988)) which found that the existing administrative structure of the Education Act 1964 was over- centralised and overly complex. Its recommendations for change were largely implemented in the Education Act 1989, the title of which states that it is ìAn Act to reform the administration of educationî. The statute brought about a marked devolution of decision making away from the Minister of Education so that schools became the basic unit of education administration. The primary mechanisms in the statute to achieve the legislative objectives were the novel concept of Boards of Trustees who were given by section 75 broad powers to manage schools and the idea of a school charterÖ. Williams J then referred to section 61 of the Education Act. Williams J went on to say: It is thus clear that the Act contemplates that the board, in consultation with the Minister, should have a significant role in determining the schoolís educational goals and a degree of independence in deciding how those goals should be achieved. While the Ministry of Education influences a schoolís broad objectives through the application of the national educational guidelines established under section 60AÖ and the Minister also has a power of approval of school charters, the guidance thus provided is in rather general terms. It is for the parents, staff and other persons to largely determine the distinctive character of the charter for a particular school. (p.505) Williams J noted that the accountability of school Boards was achieved in a number of ways, including the requirement that Boards must adhere to their charters. The policy of the Education Act, therefore, is to decentralise the administration of education so that Boards of Trustees are responsible for the control and management of the schools. Although school Boards have considerable power to manage schools, such powers are subject to any enactment and the law of New Zealand: sections 72 and 75 of the Education Act. The Education Act provides for a number of ways of achieving accountability of Boards, including the obligation to adhere to their school charters (which must incorporate guidelines specified by the Minister for the education services to be provided). 15 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 7 (July 2003) What are education services? The term ìeducationî is defined in the Concise Oxford Dictionary as: 1the act or process of education or being educated; systematic instruction. 2A particular kind of or stage in education (further education, a classical education) 3a. development of character or mental powers. b. a stage in or aspect of this (travel will be an education for you). It is possible to define the limits of the obligation of school Boards to provide education services (and, therefore, the scope of the entitlement to free education). The national education guidelines issued by the Minister specify: ïthe outcomes desired from the school system; ïthe policy concerning teaching, learning, and assessment for the purposes of underpinning and giving direction to the way in which curriculum and assessment responsibilities are to be managed; ïthe subjects in which education is to be provided (including areas and levels of knowledge). The type, level, and standard of instruction or education to be provided in state schools is specified by the Minister in broad terms through the issue of the national education guidelines or by regulation. Every school must have a school charter. The purpose of the charter is to establish the missions, aims, objectives, directions and targets of the school Board that will give effect to the Governmentís national education guidelines and the Boardís priorities: section 61. Although the Board itself has a significant role (through the preparation of the schoolís charter) in determining the aims and objectives of the school and how these are to be achieved, the charter will not take effect if the Secretary of Education determines that it is inconsistent with the Education Act or the national administration guidelines: section 63A. The effect of a school charter is that it is an undertaking by the Board to the Minister to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the school is managed, organised and administered for the purposes set out in the school charter and the school, its students and community achieve the aims and objectives set out in the school charter: section 63. Therefore, school Boards have an obligation to provide education (which complies with the requirements of the national education guidelines). New Zealand citizens and residents (or children who are otherwise not foreign students under the Education Act 1989) have a statutory right to free enrolment and free education at any state school: section 3 Education Act 1989. The Ministry of Education (which is responsible for developing the national education guidelines and the review of school charters) has issued a circular to Boards of Trustees and principals of state and integrated schools on the rights of Boards, parents and students regarding the rights of Boards of Trustees, parents and students regarding requests for donations and other forms of payments in schools: Circular 1998/25. The Ministryís views are that: ïNo charge can be required for materials used in delivering the curriculum such as photocopying charges, use of musical instruments, use of computer facilities, as the right to free education implies that there should be no charge for materials used in the delivery of the curriculum. However, students may be charged for the hire of musical instruments owned by the school and used outside the basic delivery of the music curriculum. Also, a charge may be made for costs involved in project work (such as the production of a T-shirt in a design class) if the student takes ownership of the finished product. Schools cannot, however, insist that the students take the finished product home. ïNo charge can be made for attendance at a school camp which is a compulsory part of the schoolís curriculum or which is part of the content of a particular course at the school. The Ministry has stated in the circular that it considers that: It is reasonable, however, for parents to be asked to contribute towards the cost of food and towards the costs which are involved in travel to and from the camp. In cases where parents are unwilling or unable to pay for a camp, teachers should try to provide work which will be an appropriate alternative to the camp. In cases where attendance at an outdoor or recreational activity is voluntary, parents should expect to meet the costs involved if they agree to their childrenís participation. ïStudents should not be excluded from activities organised away from school as part of the curriculum (for example, field work in geography, biology and outdoor education programmes). The Ministry says: It is reasonable to expect parents to pay the travel costs which are inevitably connected with such activities, provided the staff have made every effort to minimise costs by ensuring that the activities are held as close to the school as possible. In cases where parents are unwilling or unable to pay for a trip, teachers should provide an alternative which would give the student an insight into the curriculum experience covered by the trip. To avoid misunderstanding which may lead to later problems with payment, boards should ensure that parents are made aware of the situation at the beginning of the year. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 7 (July 2003) 16 ïBoards cannot require the purchase of a workbook which accompanies a course and in which answers are written, but the circular indicates that where a student chooses to purchase a workbook, a charge may be made. The Ministry considers that workbooks lie between textbooks, which are provided free to students, and stationery, which students are expected to provide for themselves. ïNo charge can be made for programmes such as Reading Recovery, English for Speakers of Other Languages, special education services (speech therapy, behaviour or learning difficulties) or music tuition. The circular says resourcing is provided to schools for these programmes as part of the conventional curriculum or through the Ongoing Resource Scheme, Specialist Education Services or Special Education Grant. ïNo charge may be made where secondary schools purchase tertiary level courses which they offer to senior students as part of the school programme. However, where the school merely facilitates enrolment in a tertiary course for students, the student would be enrolled only part-time at the school and would be required to pay the fees associated with the tertiary course. ïA charge can be made for in-school activities such as performances by visiting drama groups at which attendance is voluntary. ïBoards are required by the national education guidelines to report on student progress and they are also subject to the Official Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1993. Therefore, Boards are not entitled to withhold items such as reports or leaving certificates to encourage parents to pay school donations or to resolve unpaid debts for services provided by the school. The Commissioner accepts the views expressed in the circular. The supply of services which are necessary to the supply of education services (in which a school Board has an obligation under its charter to provide instruction and in which participation by students is compulsory) are also within the scope of education services to which there is a statutory entitlement to receive free of charge. Examples of services that are necessary to the supply of education services are as follows: ïThe use of materials or goods necessary for delivering the curriculum. Examples are the use of computers, photocopying charges for materials used in delivering the curriculum, materials for practical subjects (such as woodwork); ïThe right to participate in activities which are a compulsory part of the curriculum. Examples are outdoor education camps which are part of the curriculum, fieldwork in geography or biology; and ïThe provision of remedial programmes such as Reading Recovery, English for Speakers of Other Languages, special education services (speech therapy, behaviour or learning difficulties). There is a distinction between such supplies and supplies made in circumstances where the supply made is not necessary to the supply of education services and students have a choice as to whether to receive the supply such as: ïGoods are supplied where there is a take-home component (for example, the supply of stationery or the supply of materials where a student is entitled to ownership of the finished product from practical classes such as woodwork). In such circumstances a school may not insist that the student take ownership of the goods supplied; or ïAttendance at or participation in activities is voluntary; or ïTransport to and from school activities (such as a camp) or food at the camp are supplied. Whether sufficient relationship between payment and a supply Grants paid to school Boards by the Crown are deemed to be consideration for a supply. Under section 5(6) of the Goods and Services Tax Act, payments in the nature of a subsidy or grant made by the Crown or any public authority to a person in relation or in respect of that personís taxable activity are deemed to be consideration for a supply. The Commissioner considers that school Boards also make an actual supply of education services for which the grant received from the Crown is consideration. The definition of ìconsiderationî does not require the supply to be made to the person providing the consideration: Turakina. The supply of education services in terms of the undertaking given to the Minister may be taxed only once, but GST would be chargeable on any separate supply of education services made by the Board to parents: Case R34 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,190; Suzuki New Zealand Ltd v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,096. Payments made by parents or guardians may supplement the grant received from the Government. School Boards have a considerable degree of autonomy as to how their funds are used. How the amounts paid are used is not the test of whether a supply is made for the payment: Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust. The Turakina case also confirms that how payments are used does not determine the nature of the supply for the payments. In Turakina the court rejected the argument of the taxpayers that because attendance dues were applied to meet mortgage obligations of the proprietors of the schools, the attendance dues were paid for exempt supplies (being the payment or collection of any amount of interest, principal or any other amount in respect of a debt security in terms of sections 14(a) and 3(1)(ka)): see p.10,037. 17 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 7 (July 2003) There is an expectation that amounts paid will be used for the purposes of the school. However, when the supply of education services is not conditional upon payment being made, the payments are not made for any particular purpose and the school Boards do not undertake any obligations in return for payment, the Commissioner considers that there would not be a sufficient relationship between the payment and the supply of education services (or any other services). Refer Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust. Some school Boards may attempt to collect amounts unpaid by withholding items, eg reports, leaving certificates, school magazines, until payment is made. It is possible to argue that although school Boards have an obligation to the Minister to supply education services, if there is a threat to withhold education services unless payment is made, there is a separate obligation to parents to supply education services under a separate transaction with the parents. On that basis it could be argued that the payments are consideration, being a payment for the inducement of the supply of education services. However, the cases emphasise that for a payment to be consideration for a supply, there must be a sufficient relationship between the payment and the supply. The relationship between the pupils and the school Board is based at least partly on the Education Act: refer Grant v Victoria University of Wellington (CP312/96; 13 November 1997; High Court, Wellington). There is a statutory right to free education. School Boards have a corresponding statutory obligation to provide education in state schools free of charge. The Boards are responsible for providing free education in state schools. They cannot contract out of that statutory obligation. Although Boards may represent that education services would not be supplied if payment is not made, the true legal nature of the transaction is that the Board is obliged to supply education services free of charge. In the Chatham Islands case Tipping J commented: GST is payable on transactions. When deciding whether a particular transaction is of a kind which attracts GST, it is important to analyse carefully its legal characteristics. A person may waive a statutory benefit conferred on that person under a statute if the waiver does not infringe some public right or public policy: see Bowmaker Ltd v Tabor \[1941\] 2 All ER 72; Reckitt & Colman (New Zealand) Ltd v Taxation Board of Review \[1966\] NZLR 1032. To determine whether a statutory right to free education can be waived, it is appropriate to consider whether the purpose of the legislation under which the right is conferred would be infringed by the waiver or contracting out: see Johnson v Moreton \[1978\] 3 All ER 37; Lieberman v Morris 69 CLR 69. Sections 20 and 25 of the Education Act require all New Zealand citizens and residents between the ages of 6 and 16 to be enrolled at a state registered school and to attend the school. Private schools must satisfy requirements as to the suitability of premises, staffing, equipment and curriculum, and, in order to be registered, must give students a tuition no lower in standard than that of tuition given to students enrolled at state schools: section 35A of the Education Act. The purpose of the PSCI Act was to enable private schools, originally established to provide education of a special character, to be brought within the state system of education as integrated schools. As with other schools in the state system, the Board of a private integrated school is responsible for the provision of education free of charge to their pupils. Parents have the choice of having their children educated at non-state schools. It could be argued that in that sense the statutory entitlement to free education can be waived. However, the statutory entitlement is to free enrolment and education in state schools. The public policy objective expressed in the Education Act is that all children are to receive education of a minimum standard. The provision of public funding for education and the entitlement to free education are intended to ensure that cost is not a barrier to education access. Therefore, it can be argued that the right to free education is not solely a private right. If Boards were able to impose a requirement for the payment of ìfeesî and individual parents were able to waive the right to free education, the purpose of the legislation would be infringed. Although school Boards have wide discretion to manage and control schools, such powers cannot be exercised in a manner inconsistent with a statutory provision: sections 72 and 75 of the Education Act. The Commissionerís view is that school Boards do not have the power to require the payment as a condition of the provision of education or any other services or items that are properly regarded as being integral to the supply of education to which there is a statutory entitlement. However, given that an illegal activity can be a taxable activity, and given that the definition of ìconsiderationî does not require a contract to exist between the supplier and recipient for a payment to be consideration, payment need not be enforceable for the payment to be consideration. Therefore, the fact that the transaction is invalid because parties do not have power to enter into a transaction, does not mean that the transaction would not be recognised for GST purposes. In C & E Commrs v Oliver \[1980\] 1 All ER 353 it was held that a taxpayer who dealt in stolen cars had made a supply for VAT purposes, and the fact that the contracts of sale might subsequently become void was not relevant. However, the statutory entitlement to education could not be altered by a representation that education services are conditional on the payment of ìfeesî. Amounts paid to the Board of Trustees of a state school would not be consideration for the supply of education services even if there was a representation that reports or other information relating to the assessment of students would be withheld unless payment was made (albeit contrary to the legal position ). However, if school Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 7 (July 2003) 18 Boards supplied other goods or services not integral to the supply of education services on the basis that the supply was conditional upon payment being made, the payment would be consideration for that supply. If a separate charge is not made for an item such as a school magazine, there will be a case for apportionment of the payment. Section 10(18) states: Where a taxable supply is not the only matter to which a consideration relates, the supply shall be deemed to be for such part of the consideration as is properly attributable to it. Conclusion Amounts paid by parents are not consideration for the supply of education services to which there is a statutory entitlement, because: ïThe GST definition of consideration is not the same as the contract law definition. A contract is not required between parents and school Boards for the payments to be consideration for GST purposes: Turakina. However, for the payments to be consideration for a supply, there must be a sufficient relationship between payments and a supply: NZ Refining; Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust; Suzuki; Trustee Executors. ïAs there is a statutory right to free education, in circumstances where the amounts are not paid for any particular purpose or for the Board undertaking any specific obligation there is not a sufficient connection between the payments and a supply (whether of education services or a supply of a different nature). This is so even though there is an expectation that the payments would be used for the Boardís taxable activity: Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust; NZ Refining. The fact that the amounts are used to pay for things not covered by the government grant does not establish that they are paid for services of a particular nature: Turakina; Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust. ïIt is possible to argue that where a representation is made that education services would be withheld if payment is not made, the payments would be made ìin respect of, in response to or for the inducement ofî the supply of education services. However, as there is a statutory entitlement to free education in state schools, the true legal position is that education services would be provided whether or not payment was made. Therefore, there would not be a sufficient connection between the payment of ìfeesî and the supply of education services to which there is a statutory entitlement. ïGST consequences are determined on the basis of the legal character of the transaction: Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust. The relationship between parents and school Boards is based on the Education Act, which requires Boards of state schools to provide education and entitles students to free enrolment and education at state schools, and the PSCI Act which entitles students enrolled at integrated schools to free education on the same terms and conditions as in state schools. The true legal nature of the arrangement between parents and the school Board is that school Boards have a statutory obligation to provide free education and students have a right to free education. The supply of education services is not conditional upon the payment being made, and payment is not required for the supply of education services. ïA statutory right conferred on a person may be waived only if the waiver does not infringe the purpose of the legislation: Bowmaker Ltd v Tabor; Reckitt & Colman v TBR; Johnson v Moreton; Lieberman v Morris. The purpose of the Education Act is that all children should receive education of a minimum standard, and there should be no barriers to access to such education. That purpose would be infringed by a waiver of the right to free education and an ability of school Boards to require the payment of ìfeesî for education. The scope of the obligation to provide education services is defined by the national education guidelines, incorporated in every school charter, and by the schoolís charter. The supply of reports and other information relating to the assessment of students is integral to the supply of education services, and are to be supplied free. The amounts would not be consideration, even if there was a representation that the supply of such information would be withheld unless payment was made (albeit contrary to the legal position). Therefore, GST is not payable on amounts paid for the purpose of a general fund to assist the schools with meeting costs or for ìactivity feesî for activities which are an integral part of the course requirements in which the school has an obligation to provide instruction and in which participation by pupils is compulsory. However, if other services not integral to the supply of education services are supplied on the basis that the supply is conditional upon payment being made, the payment will be consideration for that supply. Where a separate charge is not made for such an item, apportionment may apply: section 10(18). For payments made by parents or guardians to schools to be consideration, it must be possible to identify a supply of goods or services other than the supply of education services which the schools must supply in terms of their charters. The issue requires determining which payments made to schools are made for a supply other than the supply of education services (to which there is a statutory entitlement free of charge). 19 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 7 (July 2003) Examples \[It is assumed for the purposes of these examples that the students are either New Zealand citizens or New Zealand residents.\] Example 1 Each year the Board of Trustees of a state school asks parents or guardians of students enrolled at the school to pay a nominated amount to assist with meeting school costs. The Board is not required to use the fee for any particular purpose and the fee is paid for the general purposes of the school. The only benefits received by pupils are facilities for common use, such as the school library, swimming pool or computer facilities. Such payments are not consideration for a supply made by the Board. Therefore, GST is not chargeable on the payments. Example 2 Students at a state school are required to pay a fee for materials used in a clothing class. The students are not required to take ownership of the completed item but will not be entitled to ownership unless payment is made. The fee is not consideration for the use of the materials as the use of such materials is necessary for the provision of instruction in the subject. However, if a student elects to take ownership of the completed item, the fee is consideration for the right to ownership of the item and the Board is liable to account for GST on the fee. Example 3 Students at a state school are asked to pay photocopying charges for materials (such as articles, extracts from textbooks or homework exercises) used in teaching. The payment is not consideration. It is implicit in the right to free education that there should be no charge for the cost of materials used in the delivery of the curriculum. The provision of photocopied materials necessary for teaching is incidental to the supply of education services. GST is not chargeable on the payment. However, if a student chooses to purchase a photocopy of an entire item (such as a workbook or a magazine produced by students) which may be retained by students, the payment made would be consideration for the supply of that item and GST would be chargeable on the payment. Example 4 A state school hires a bus to transport students on a field trip to carry out activities which are part of the geography curriculum. Students are asked for payment of an amount to cover the cost of hiring the bus. The payment does not relate to the right to participate in the activities carried out on the field trip. The payment is consideration for the supply of transport and GST is chargeable on the payment. Example 5 Students at a state school are asked to make a payment to cover the costs of food provided at a school camp and transport to the camp site. Attendance at the camp is a compulsory part of the schoolís total curriculum. The payment does not relate to the right to participate in activities at the camp. The payment is consideration for the supply of food and transport. GST is chargeable on the payment. Example 6 A state school asks for payment for stationery and a workbook which students are entitled to retain. The payment is made for the supply of the stationery and the work book and is consideration. GST is chargeable on the payment. Example 7 A drama group puts on a performance at a state school. Attendance by students is voluntary but if students wish to attend a charge is payable. The payment is consideration for the right to attend the performance. GST is chargeable on the payment. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 7 (July 2003) 20 NEW LEGISLATION WAR PENSIONS AMENDMENT ACT 2003 ñ MINOR AMENDMENTS TO INCOME TAX ACT 1994 AND CHILD SUPPORT ACT 1991 From 15 April 2003, the War Pensions Amendment Act 2003, enacted on 14 April 2003, transfers the veteransí entitlements provisions from the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1990 to the War Pensions Act 1954. This consolidates the legislation governing veteransí entitlements. The definitions of ìemployerî, ìliving alone paymentî, ìportable veteranís pensionî and ìveteranís pensionî in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 have been consequentially amended. The new Act has also made consequential amendments to the Child Support Act 1991 to reflect this consolidation and the new office of ìSecretary for War Pensionsî. 21 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 7 (July 2003) LEGAL DECISIONS ñ CASE NOTES This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council.

CIR LOSES CFC CASE Case:TRA Dec 17/2003 Decision date:26 June 2003 Act:Income Tax Act 1994 Keywords:Controlled foreign company, bare trust,agency, shares transactions Summary The Commissioner was unsuccessful in assessing the taxpayers for gains on share transactions by an agent acting through a holding company ultimately owned by the taxpayers. Facts The taxpayers were a husband, wife and daughter. The husband is now dead and the wife suffers Alzheimerís disease. The taxpayers had interests in an overseas company: AMCE. Through this company, a stockbroker managed three investment portfolios for AMCE (and ultimately the taxpayers). The only instruction to the stockbroker was to generate £600 per month for each taxpayer from the portfolios (£1,800 per month). The Commissioner assessed the taxpayers for the proceeds of the share activity on the basis it was foreign income (CG1 or section 65(2)(ea) and (eb)), business profits (now section CD3 or section 65(2)(a)) and income from personal property (section CD 4 or section 65(2)(e)). The taxpayers denied that the income was assessable to them. Decision Judge Willy determined there was no taxable income to the taxpayers. All parties accepted that the taxpayers were not directly within the relevant statutory provisions and Judge Willy describes the issue as ìwhether the actions of Mr Cloake \[the stockbroker\] in transacting the sale and purchase of the family investments in the way he did renders each of them liable as principals for income tax on any gains made on the sale of investments in the years in question.î\[par 40\]. His Honour accepted that AMCE was a bare trustee of the funds for the taxpayers and thus it was correct to treat the taxpayers as the stockbrokerís principals \[par 74 and 76\]. He also accepted that the stockbroker would be the taxpayersí agent in the dealings and thus ìit does not assist the objectors to say and prove, as they have, that they had no intention or ability to engage in share trading or to buy investments with a view to resale if that was, in fact, what Mr Cloake was doing within their instructions on their behalf.î \[par 79\] He considered there was no business activity as ìI have found for a fact that none of the objectors was in the business of buying and selling the investments which yield the assessed income taxî\[par 88\] He noted the only instruction was to earn £600 each which was not characteristic of a business activity. On the facts Judge Willy considered the stockbroker did no more than ìmaintain the capital of the funds at a level which yielded this sumî \[par 93\] and the transactions were intended to maintain the capital base. Judge Willy considered this finding also addressed the issue of whether the taxpayersí were in the business of dealing in shares \[par 109\]. His Honour also dismissed the Commissionerís reliance on the disposal of personal property acquired by resale. While recognising this test was subjective and it was the stockbrokerís mind that was relevant, His Honour concluded that for him to for the purpose of resale on acquisition was outside the scope of his agency \[par 119-120\]. His Honour dismissed the 118 purchases and 109 sales in the relevant period as irrelevant when each individual transaction had not been examined by the Commissioner \[par 125\]: ìIt may be acceptable to view the portfolios as a whole for the purpose of enquiring whether of share trading existed, or whether the gains were trading profits. It is not acceptable to treat the buying and selling globally for the purposes of the second limb.î\[par 126\] Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 7 (July 2003) 22 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS These statements describe how the Commissioner will, in practice, exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts.

We publish these as they may be of general interest to readers. A general similarity to items published here will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case should be considered on its own facts. GOODS AND SERVICES TAX ACT 1985 Trophies and animal products derived from the tourist, hunting and safari industry: zero-rating under GST Section 11A ñ Zero-rating of services Background Previously the status of some services performed by the taxidermy industry had been considered in a TIB article Vol 9, No. 6 (June 1997) titled ìTrophies and animal products derived from the tourist, hunting and safari industry: zero-rating under GSTî. Currently, the article, in regard to the taxidermy industry, states: INTERPRETATION Taxidermy fee The taxidermy fees are chargeable with GST at the standard rate as they do not fall within the zero-rating provisions of the GST Act. While the services are supplied to someone who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are carried out, they are in connection with ìmoveable personal property situated inside New Zealand at the time the services are performedî and are clearly excluded by section 11(2)(e)(ii). Section 11 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 has been substituted by sections 11, 11A, and 11B pursuant to section 90(1) of the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000 with application on and after 10 October 2000. In particular, section 11A(1)(m) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 has now been inserted into the Act. Question We have received a query regarding whether the TIB article, as far as the taxidermy industry is concerned, is still correct given the amendments to the GST legislation enacted on 10 October 2000. The TIB article is stated to apply to taxidermists performing the service of processing animal carcasses before they are exported to tourists. We have also been asked whether the TIB article applies to all taxidermy arrangements in the taxidermy, hunting, and safari industries. Legislation Section 11A(1)(m) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 applies to zero-rate services that are provided directly in connection with goods to which section 11(1)(a) to (e) apply. Section 11A(1)(m) provides: 11AZero-rated services (1)A supply of services that is chargeable with tax under section 8 must be charged at the rate of 0% in the following situations: Ö (m)the services are supplied directly in connection with goods to which any one of section 11(1)(a) to 11(1)(e) applies if supplied to a person who is not resident in New Zealand and who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed; of Ö Conclusion Taxidermy fees are chargeable with GST at a zero rate where they are consistent with the requirements of section 11A(1)(m). That is, the service must be supplied directly in connection with goods to which any one of section 11(1)(a) to 11(1)(e) applies (that is, goods exported, or goods entered or deemed to be entered for export), and the supply must be to a person not resident and outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. Thus, in respect of the provision of taxidermy services, the TIB article is no longer correct due to the change in the legislation. In relation to non-taxidermy services considered by the TIB article, it may also be noted that the title and drafting of the TIB article may be considered misleading in that it may suggest to some readers that it applies to all participants in those industries discussed in the item. However the TIB article, in respect of these other matters, is only intended to explain the factual scenarios described. Therefore, where a taxpayerís particular facts differ from those described in the TIB article different tax consequences may follow.

The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet Adjudication & Rulings, a guide to Binding Rulings (IR 715) or the article on page 1 of Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 12 (May 1995) or Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995). You can download these publications free from our website at www.ird.govt.nz PRODUCT RULING ñ BR PRD 03/11 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Barkworth Olive Groves Pty Limited (ìBOGLî) ñ Project No 5. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections EP 1, BD 2(1)(b)(i), BD 2(2)(e), EG 1, and the section OB 1 definition of ìdepreciable propertyî. This Ruling does not consider or rule on the potential application (if any) of sections EF 1 and BG 1, or Determination E 10. This Ruling considers expense deductibility in relation to section BD 2(1)(b)(i) (incurred by the taxpayer in deriving the taxpayerís gross income). Accordingly it has not been necessary for the purposes of this Ruling to consider or rule on whether investors are carrying on a business for the purposes of the Act. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the purchase of a minimum of 250 ìEî class shares in BOGL, and the growing of olives on certain land situated in Australia in respect of which the shares provide the right to grow olives, and the appointment of Barkworth Olive Management Limited (ìBOMLî) to manage the growing, processing and marketing of those olives. This Ruling only applies to investors who appoint BOML to manage their Farms. All amounts quoted in this Ruling are exclusive of Australian GST (if any). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.The Arrangement is governed by the terms of the ìBarkworth Olive Groves Project No 5î (ìProject No 5î) prospectus dated 9 April 2001 (ìthe prospectusî). Project No 5 is in no way dependent on the Barkworth Groupís four existing projects and may be operated independently of the other four. Key aspects of the prospectus are as follows: (i)Investors (also referred to as ìmembersî or ìGrowerî) purchase a minimum parcel of 250 ìEî class shares of $1 each in a land owning company (BOGL): additional shares may be applied for in parcels of 250. (ii)Holders of ìEî class shares have the following rights: ïA member shall have the absolute right to occupy one ìFarmî (or section of olive grove) in respect of each 250 ìEî Class shareholding held by that member, subject to the payment of all moneys due to BOGL. The Farm shall be an identified area of land as nearly as practicable in area to 0.08 hectares and suitable for the planting of 20 olive trees at spacings of approximately 5 metres by 8 metres. The memberís Farm or Farms will be separately identified on a master plan maintained under the supervision of the directors of BOGL. ïA member shall have an absolute right to process up to 1.5 tonnes of olives per annum in respect of each 250 ìEî Class shareholding, subject to the payment of Factory Access Fees. The time allotted for each memberís processing 5 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 8 (August 2003) operations will be advised at least two weeks prior to commencement of the harvest period. The member may exchange his or her allotted time with any other member or members with the approval of BOGL: such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. The time allotted per 250 ìEî Class shareholding will be as near as practicable to one half-hour and will be with respect to a machine or machines capable of processing in excess of 3 tonnes per hour. ïA member shall have the right to own and operate a business, as defined by the Constitution of BOGL, for the commercial cultivation and harvesting of olives on the memberís Farm and the sale of produce therefrom. ïA member shall also have the right to own and operate a business as defined in the Constitution of BOGL, for the commercial processing and marketing of processed olive products which include, but are not necessarily limited to, olive oil and pickled table olives. ïA member shall have the right to use the agricultural infrastructure which includes, but is not necessarily limited to, roads around the property, access to irrigation mains and storage areas.

Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 13 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 8 (August 2003) NEW LEGISLATION SCREEN PRODUCTION INDUSTRY ñ WITHHOLDING PAYMENTS From 8 September 2003 payments to independent contractors engaged in the film production industry will be subject to a withholding payment tax deduction of 20 cents in the dollar. The new withholding tax rate applies to payments relating to television, video, or film productions or presentations and includes work commonly involved in the on-set and off-set pre-production, production and post-production processes. The rate will not apply to salary and wages paid within the industry, which continue to be subject to PAYE in the normal way. A new class of withholding payment overrides all other classes of withholding tax that might apply to workers within the screen production industry, including free-lance journalists and writers. The new rate of 20 cents in the dollar is consistent with withholding tax rates applying to payments to resident and non-resident entertainers. Having only one rate of withholding tax applying to all independent contractor payments will simplify tax practices for the screen production industry. The change was approved by Order in Council on 4 August 2003. Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Amendment Regulations 2003/Number186 14 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 8 (August 2003) LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, and livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. DETERMINATION: AMOUNT OF A SPECIFIED WITHHOLDING PAYMENT (BEING PER DIEM ALLOWANCES PAID IN THE SCREEN PRODUCTION INDUSTRY) THAT SHALL BE REGARDED AS EXPENDITURE INCURRED IN PRODUCTION OF PAYMENT Introduction This Determination sets out the amount regarded as expenditure incurred in the production of specified withholding payments when those payments are per diem (per day) allowances paid to resident and non-resident contractors and resident and non-resident entertainers working in the Screen Production Industry in New Zealand. Section NC 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994 requires anyone who makes a source deduction payment to deduct tax when making it. Under section OB 2 (1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 a withholding payment is included in the definition of ìsource deduction paymentsî. Consequently, any person who makes a withholding payment must deduct tax from it at the time it is made, unless an exemption applies. The Screen Production Industry pays per diem allowances to resident and non-resident contractors and resident and non-resident entertainers working on screen productions when they are working away from their town of normal residence. These allowances are to cover the costs of breakfast, lunch and dinner as well as other minor incidental expenses incurred by a contractor or entertainer while working in the Screen Production Industry in New Zealand. Money paid to resident and non-resident contractors and resident and non-resident entertainers working in the Screen Production Industry in New Zealand, comes within the definition of ìwithholding paymentî in the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979, so section NC 2 applies. Therefore per diem allowances come within the definition of ìwithholding paymentî in the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 and the Regulations require withholding tax to be deducted from such payments. Regulation 7 of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 allows the Commissioner to determine an amount or proportion of any specified withholding payment that is considered to be expenditure incurred in the production of that payment. If the Commissioner has made such a determination, the person paying the specified withholding payment is only required to deduct tax from the amount of the withholding payment that exceeds this threshold. Application This Determination applies to payments of per diem allowances made to resident and non-resident contractors and resident and non-resident entertainers in the Screen Production Industry. It applies: ñto per diem allowances paid on or after 1 September 2003, ñwhere the contractor or entertainer is working away from their town of normal residence, ñexcept where any resident or non-resident contractor, or any resident or non-resident entertainer is also provided with the goods and services for which the allowance is paid by the payer or another party acting on the payerís behalf, ñunless a specific Regulation 7 determination has been issued by the Commissioner in relation to the per diem allowances in question, and ñuntil the Commissioner varies or revokes this determination. 15 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 8 (August 2003) Interpretation In this Determination, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions have the same meaning as in the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 and sections NC 2 and OB 2(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Determination Where any resident or non-resident contractor, or resident or non-resident entertainer receives a per diem allowance in relation to services provided to a screen production and that allowance is a withholding payment, the sum of $60 per day shall be regarded as expenditure incurred in the production of the withholding payment. If the allowance is less than $60 per day, the total amount of the allowance shall be regarded as expenditure incurred in the production of the withholding payment. However, to the extent that the resident or non-resident contractor, or resident or non-resident entertainer is also provided with the goods and services for which the allowance is paid, either by the payer or another party acting on the payerís behalf, then the amount that will be exempted by operation of this Determination from the application of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 shall be reduced on a pro rata basis. This Determination is made by me, acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This Determination is signed on the 8 th day of August 2003. David Kelly Manager Resources Sector Corporates Examples 1.Contractor/entertainer receives a per diem allowance of $60 while required to work away from their town of normal residence. The cost of the goods and services for which the allowance is paid are incurred by the recipient. The payer does not have to deduct withholding tax because the total payment does not exceed $60 per day. 2.Contractor/entertainer receives a per diem allowance of $60. The contractor is working in their town of normal residence. As the contractor is working in their town of normal residence the determination does not apply. The payer has to deduct withholding tax from the per diem allowance of $60. 3.Contractor/entertainer receives a per diem allowance of $60. Contractor/entertainer is also provided with all meals while working, either on the set, or at some other location. The recipient has not incurred the expense so the determination doesnít apply. The payer has to deduct withholding tax from the per diem allowance of $60. 4.The payer provides goods and services to the value of $15 per day to the contractor/entertainer. Therefore the maximum amount that can be paid as a per diem to the contractor/entertainer without withholding tax being deducted, is $45 per day. 5.Contractor/entertainer receives a per diem allowance of $75. The cost of the goods and services for which the allowance is paid are incurred by the recipient. The payer has to deduct withholding tax from $15 of each daily payment as the payment exceeds the $60 threshold on a daily basis. 16 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 8 (August 2003) LEGAL DECISIONS ñ CASE NOTES This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council.

FINANCIAL SERVICES EXEMPTION FOR CLUB MEMBERSHIP Case:Gulf Harbour Development Ltd v CIR Decision date:27 June 2003 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keywords:exempt supply, financial services, equity security, composite supply, multiple supplies Summary The supply of membership shares in a golf and country club was held to be an exempt supply for GST purposes because it was the supply of an equity security. Facts Gulf Harbour Development Ltd (ìGHD Ltdî) is the representative member of a group of companies which includes Gulf Harbour Holdings Limited, Gulf Harbour Country Club Holdings Limited (ìHoldingsî) and Gulf Harbour Country Club Limited (ìCountry Club Ltdî). In March 1996, Country Club Ltd sold membership shares to Holdings in consideration for Holdings agreeing to pay all of the costs associated with the development of a golf and country club (Gulf Harbour Country Club: ìthe Clubî). The shareholding in Country Club Ltd comprises fully paid up $1 ordinary shares and fully paid redeemable preference shares (ìRPSísî). It is the RPSís that are the membership shares in issue. Holdings issued a prospectus for the sale to the public of the membership shares in Country Club Ltd. Each membership share is issued for a fixed term of just over 75 years, all memberships expire on 31 March 2073. On that date, each membership share will be redeemed for $1 and all rights attaching to each share will cease. There are three types of membership shares (individual, restricted and corporate) with obligations and restrictions attaching to each type. All holders of membership shares are required to pay annual subscriptions; and have no entitlement to participate in dividends or distributions of any type (except on liquidation), or to vote or attend any company meetings (except where membersí interests are directly affected), or to participate in the companyís management and operations (except as described in the prospectus in relation to the establishment and operation of the Club Committee). The Club board may impose a penalty, fine or suspend rights to use the Club facilities or any other rights attaching to the relevant membership share if holders fail to comply with the obligations and restrictions of that membership share. The Club board may also cause Country Club Ltd to forfeit a holderís membership shares in the case of insolvency, criminal conviction, ceasing to be of good character or failing to comply with the obligations or restrictions of the membership share or with the Club rules. GST Treatment Country Club Ltd did not charge GST in respect of the sale of membership shares to Holdings, and Holdings did not receive an input tax credit in respect of that sale. Holdings did not charge GST on the sale of the membership share to the public because Holdings believed that the on-sale of the membership shares was an exempt supply for GST purposes. The Commissioner contended that the supply was a composite supply of club membership. Alternatively, the Commissioner contended if the supply was not a composite supply, then there were multiple supplies consisting of an equity share (exempt supply) and a club membership (taxable supply). GHD Ltd contended there was a single supply of the membership shares and the consideration paid was for shares and not the membership rights. 17 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 8 (August 2003) The issue was whether the supply of membership shares in a golf and country club were an exempt supply for GST purposes, by reason of being the supply of financial services in the form of either equity securities or participatory securities. Decision Baragwanath J found the supply of membership shares was the supply of an equity security, and therefore exempt for GST purposes. Because His Honour found this was an equity security, it was not necessary for him to consider the arguments pertaining to participatory securities. His Honour identified some of the features of membership (at paragraphs 5, 11-21 and 45), but stated: Öthere was no evidence to support the supply of more than the shares; the right to membership passed not as a discrete element but as an incident of share ownership. At paragraph 4, pg 3 Baragwanath J considered the rights attached to each share and passing to the purchaser include membership of the Club: The transfer of the member share carries with it the entire bundle of rights which include entitlement to use the Club facilities including the golf course. That bundle of rights may be described as entailing membership of the Club. But such membership rights inhere in the personal property comprised in the share which is ìa share in the capital of a body corporateî. That is Parliamentís definition of what falls within the exemption. There is no occasion to look beyond it. At paragraph 79, page 32 His Honour found that, in terms of the definition of equity security, holders of membership shares became entitled to an interest in or right to share in the capital of the body corporate. Baragwanath J posited the issue in several forms, including: A lay response to \[the\] enquiry what was being supplied might be, as the Commissioner submits, that it was membership of the Club provided through the vehicle of a share transfer. A lawyerís response might be, as the plaintiff argues, that it was a chose in action in the form of a share that carries with it a bundle of legal rights which include the right to access to Club facilities. Each is correct in fact. The issue is which is correct in law. At paragraph 33, page 15 His Honour stated, in distinguishing Court Barton Property plc v Customs & Excise Commissioners (1985) VATTR 148: To characterise the present class of transaction as the supply of country club facilities rather than as a share sale would infringe the most fundamental principleó of a companyís distinct entityóof the corporate law which Parliamentary counsel, by their reference to the shares exception, have been at pains to adopt. At paragraph 62, pp 25-26 His Honour traversed the English authorities before him, and also made comment on the substance and reality test, affirming that in New Zealand, the test as to the true nature of a transaction is to be ascertained by considering the legal arrangements actually entered into and carried out. The Commissioner has filed an appeal of the decision in the Court of Appeal. 18 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 8 (August 2003) TAX AVOIDANCE GST ACT Case:TRA 019/2003 Decision date:18 July 2003 Act:GST Act 1985 Keywords:Section 76 Tax avoidance arrangement, Summary This case arose because a property /housing developer attempted to take advantage of GST timing differences between the invoice and payments basis which would enable the disputant to claim input tax credits without having to return the output tax credits for some 20 years. The effect of this arrangement was to use public money to fund the development of $80 million worth of property. This case provides precedent for section 76 of the GST Act. Facts On 5 November 1998, the Disputant entered into conditional agreements with 114 companies (the A Group of companies) by which it would purchase from each a section of land in a subdivision in which the vendor had contractual rights as a conditional purchaser from the developer, W Developments Limited. Each agreement provided for a purchase price of $70,000, with a deposit of ten dollars to be held by the vendorís solicitor as stakeholder, with no other money due until settlement. On 21 May 1999, the A Group of companies entered into agreements to sell all 114 sections to the taxpayer. The total value of these transactions exceeded $80,000,000. All agreements had deferred settlement dates, which in general ranged between 10 and 20 years after each agreement was entered into. Each agreement provided for a deposit of $30,000, payable by an initial deposit of ten dollars on execution of the agreement with the balance of $29,990 payable on the later of 20 August 1999 or such other date agreed by the parties. The disputant has paid the initial $10 deposit on each transaction, but nothing more. Each agreement used the standard form. The form provides that deposits are held by the recipient as stakeholder until the agreement becomes unconditional. This clause was deleted from all agreements. Each agreement provided for the relevant A Group company to construct a house to an agreed plan and specification prior to settlement. The agreed purchase price for each contract reflected the improved value of each section, and the projected market value at settlement. The disputant registered for GST on an invoice basis, and the A Group of companies were registered on a cash basis. This meant an input tax deduction could be claimed by the disputant immediately, but the A Group of companies would not be required to account for GST on each transaction until settlement funds were received. In the GST period ended 31 May 1999, the disputant claimed the input tax credits on the purchase of 13 properties. Three of these were existing houses, and the others were Dominion Road properties. The value of supply of each property for GST purposes was the market value of the property at the time the agreement was entered into. This method of valuing the supply was based on the agreements for sale and purchase being credit contracts, in terms of a binding private ruling issued by the Commissioner on 15 June 1999. The ruling was to the effect that each agreement for sale and purchase was a credit contract, and thus pursuant to section 10(5) of the GST Act, the value of the supply was the ìcash priceî as that term is defined in the Credit Contracts Act 1981. In the GST period ended 31 July 1999, the disputant claimed input tax credits on the purchase of 104 properties. Unlike the method used in the period ended 31 May 1999, which followed the private binding ruling, the supplies were valued according to the purchase price specified in each agreement for sale and purchase. This method meant the total input credit claimed was nearly $9,000,000 instead of just over $3,000,000. Extracts from the judgment 4. Summary of Evidence The judgment goes through the evidence presented in significant detail at paragraphs 23-100. The TRA accepted that the disputant was part of a scheme conceived that would enable the disputant being registered on the invoice basis to obtain substantial refunds of GST consequent on the purchase of the 114 properties. Further, the sale and purchase agreements were structured so that the vendor (the A Group of companies) would not be required to give possession for up to 20 years in the future. In the meantime, the vendors contracted with building companies to develop dwellings on the land. The price of the property which the disputant agreed to pay on settlement included an agreed sum for the value of all the improvements adjusted upwards to accommodate expected increases in the price of such properties. The GST refund claimed is based on this adjusted figure for the land and buildings payable to the disputant in the GST periods in which the tax invoices are issued. The 114 vendors being registered on a payments basis are not required to pay output tax until they receive payment for the properties from the disputant. This would not occur until the agreed settlement date in each case. 19 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 8 (August 2003) This allows the disputant the timing advantage of the use of the GST input refunds to pay the deposits on each agreement to the relevant company in the A Group. The A Group then have the funds to complete the purchase of the sections from W Developments Ltd, and along with mortgage finance embark on the building of the houses to fulfil the contracts with the disputant. The TRA further comments that without the lengthy period of mismatch between the GST input refund and any output liability, the scheme is incapable of execution, essentially amounting to the use of public revenues for periods of up to 20 years. 5 Credit Contract The TRA held that there is no element of loan in this case and that the agreements were not credit contracts for the purposes of either the Credit Contracts Act or the GST Act. 6 Section 25(4) GST Act The TRA covers this at paragraphs 120-141 of the judgment. Inland Revenue considers the result is correct on the cancellation issue. The TRA held: ìGST is a tax on supplies of goods and services embodied in specific transactions. In this case 114 agreements for sale and purchase of land. Where the agreements are between registered persons, as here, section 25(4) provides that if the contract the subject of the input claim is cancelled, then the purchaser must refund to the Commissioner any input refund paid to the extent that the amount of the refund exceeds the amount of the output tax payable on the transaction. Hence there is no output tax payable at the time of supply, and therefore the full amount of the input which would have been payable to the purchaser had the contracts not been cancelled must be repaid to the Commissioner or foregone by the purchaser if the refund has not actually been made. See TRA decision 003/2003 judgment 26 February 2003î. ìIn coming to this view I do not overlook the fact that the disputant paid a $10 deposit in respect of each contract. That is not a supply for the purposes of the GST Act. The contracts are not divisible into equitable and legal estates. The ìsupplyî is for all the rights in the plot land contracted for. Once it is clear that the vendor cannot perform its bargain to convey those rights, then section 25(4) supervenes to in effect cancel out any GST refund entitlement of the purchaser. See TRA decision 005/2003 judgment 12 March 2003î. At paragraphs 135 ñ 139, the TRA discusses the relevance of section 25. ìThis argument overlooks section 25. It applies not only to contracts which have been cancelled but to those where ìThe nature of that supply of goods and services has been fundamentally varied or altered.î Clearly that is the case here. The nature of the supply to the disputant has been altered by the fact that to make it good the vendor must seek to repurchase all of the 114 contracts, because it is all of them which are the subject of the two GST returns. That of itself is a ìfundamental alterationî. Equally, if the vendor is successful in repurchasing only some of the properties, then the disputant will not be entitled to claim the GST input refunds it has. It will require amended returns (if that is possible) and they will be assessed according to their own merits depending upon the precise terms of any renegotiated contracts for supply. The amended s.76 will then no doubt become relevantî. 7 Section 76 This case applies section 76. The TRA begins by summarising the circumstances in which the arrangement arose. The TRA accepts that: ïThe arrangements were carefully designed to take advantage of the mismatch between registration on an invoice and payments basis; ïThe centrality to the scheme of the need for the disputant to secure GST refunds on purchases of $80 million of land where a small company with no assets or income would seek such no doubt experienced advice, or that some other entity which hoped to profit from the scheme would do so on its behalf; ïThe fundamental objective of the scheme was to extract $80 million from the CIR in the form of GST on the purcahse of the 114 properties. Application of section 76 The TRA succinctly finds there is an ìarrangementî and that it is ìbetween personsî (paragraphs 160-170). The judgment goes into more detail on the intent to defeat the intent and application of the Act. It attempts to distinguish income tax avoidance and GST avoidance on the basis that with regard to income tax, the taxpayer is always endeavouring to establish that the transaction should not be brought to tax, and the CIR that it should. Where there is a GST avoidance arrangement, the taxpayer is trying to escape paying output tax while being granted the input credit. The TRA recognises that (paragraphs 190-192) ìthe Courts have held that the intent of the Act in relation to outputs and inputs is expressed in unequivocal terms. There is no matching symmetry between payment of output tax and deduction of input tax. Each occurs at the time and in the GST period allowed for by the Act, and at no other time. This series of transactions has been structured in such a way so as to ensure that the relevant provisions of section 20 apply. There is a liability on the vendor to pay output tax and there is an entitlement on the part of the purchaser to claim an input tax refund. The problem for the revenue base is that it will be many years before the liability to pay the output tax crystalises and in the meantime the disputant being one of the parties to the overall ìplansî will have the use of the inputs and in that way make the whole series of arrangements financially possible. 20 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 8 (August 2003) This however in my view is an irrelevant consideration. What the disputant taxpayer does with money it receives by way of an input deduction is entirely a matter for itî. Subjective Significantly, the TRA finds that it is the intentions of the parties at the time the arrangement is entered into which is crucial and that is a ìwholly subjective matterî. In deciding what were the subjective intentions of the parties to the transaction it will be necessary to look at all relevant circumstances. Each case will turn on its own facts, but conventionally one would enquire into: (a)The relationships of the parties. Are they strictly at arms length, or is there a degree of premeditated collusion in the design of the arrangement? (b)The significance to the transaction of the GST consequences under consideration. (c)Whether the arrangement is explicable in ordinary commercial terms if the contested GST component is abstracted. (d)In what way the arrangement defeats the particular intent and application of the GST Act which is relevant to the facts. (e)The identity, relevant experience and financial probity of the parties as that touches on their ability to perform their side of the bargain without the benefit of the contested GST component. Viewed in this way the impugned transactions fail on every count. Thus: (a)The relationships between Mr A and the original proprietor of the disputant company were more social than commercial. The company which she formed was to be no more than a conduit for obtaining the GST input refunds. (b)The arrangement was entirely dependent on obtaining the GST inputs. The disputant had no ability to pay for any of the land purchased from its own resources. Similarly with the input refunds the A Group of companies had no ability to finance the purchase of the sections which they onsold to the disputant. (c)If one removes the input refund from the equation the arrangements are wholly inexplicable in commercial terms. They could not and did not come to fruition. (d)This arrangement defeats the intention of the Act to tax transactions at the time they are entered into by exploiting the mismatches which the Courts have found to exist between payment based and invoice based taxpayers. That served to prevent the application of the Act by denying on the one hand the Crown the revenue which the Act was designed to exact, and on the other, requiring the Crown to disgorge public monies for private use. (e)The disputantís original proprietor had no relevant business experience, and no resources remotely capable of meeting the financial obligations undertaken. It is inconceivable that any lending institution would have funded the disputantís purchase of $80,000,000 worth of property given the identity, business experience and financial standing of the original proprietor of the disputant company, and the assets of that entity. 21 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 8 (August 2003) 22 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 8 (August 2003) REGULAR FEATURES DUE DATES REMINDER September 2003 5Employer deductions and employer monthly schedule Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) ïEmployer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due ïEmployer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 22Employer deductions Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) ïEmployer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due Employer deductions and employer monthly schedule Small employers (less than $100,000 PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) ïEmployer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due ïEmployer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 30GST return and payment due October 2003 6Employer deductions and employer monthly schedule Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) ïEmployer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due ïEmployer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 20Employer deductions Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) ïEmployer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due Employer deductions and employer monthly schedule Small employers (less than $100,000 PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) ïEmployer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due ïEmployer monthly schedule (IR 348) due FBT return and payment due 31GST return and payment due These dates are taken from Inland Revenueís Smart business tax due date calendar 2002 - 2003 23 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 8 (August 2003) INLAND REVENUE NATIONAL OFFICE PO BOX 2198 WELLINGTON TELEPHONE (04) 498 5800

BR Pub 00/05 applied until 30 June 2003. This ruling is essentially the same as BR Pub 00/05. Its period of application is from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2008. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of section CD 1(2). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the sale or other disposition of land by a taxpayer who is associated with another person. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: ïFor the purposes of determining whether any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of land is included in the gross income of any taxpayer by virtue of paragraphs (b) to (d) of section CD 1(2), the test of whether a taxpayer and another person are associated persons is applied only at the time of the acquisition of the land. The test of association is not applied at the time of the sale or other disposition of the land. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2008. This Ruling is signed by me on the 14 th day of August 2003. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 6 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 9 (September 2003) COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 03/05 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusion reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 03/05 (ìthe Rulingî). Background Paragraphs (b) to (d) of section CD 1(2) include within the gross income of a taxpayer any amounts derived from the sale or other disposition of land if the taxpayer, or any other person associated with the taxpayer, carried on certain businesses at the time the land was acquired. For the purposes of section CD 1, associated persons or persons associated with each other are defined in section OD 8(4). The Ruling confirms that the test of association under paragraphs (b) to (d) of section CD 1(2) applies at the time the land is acquired. This question is important in general terms because in many cases a taxpayer may be associated with a person at the time of acquisition of land, but may not be associated with the person at the time of the sale or disposition of the land (and vice versa). A number of commentators have expressed their view as to the timing of the test of association in section CD 1(2)(b) to (d), but there seems to be uncertainty as to the correct view. This uncertainty stems from the wording and tenses used. The Commissionerís view is, and always has been, that the test of association is applied at the time the land was acquired. Legislation Section CD 1(1) states: Any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of any land, being an amount to which this section applies, is gross income. Section CD 1(2) sets out the amounts that are included in the gross income of any person under section CD 1(1): For the purposes of subsection (1), the gross income of any taxpayer includes the following amountsó Ö (b)Any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of any land where the taxpayer, or any other person where the taxpayer and that other person are associated persons, carried on, at the time the land was acquired, the business of dealing in land, andó (i)That land, which was sold or disposed of by the taxpayer, was acquired by that taxpayer for the purpose of that business of dealing in land; or (ii) That land was sold or disposed of by the taxpayer within 10 years after the date on which it was acquired by the taxpayer: (c)Any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of any land where the taxpayer, or any other person where the taxpayer and that other person are associated persons, carried on, at the time the land was acquired, the business of developing or dividing land into lots, being development or division of the kind (not being work of a minor nature) referred to in paragraph (f), andó (i)That land, which was sold or disposed of by the taxpayer, was acquired by that taxpayer for the purpose of that business of developing or dividing land into lots; or (ii) That land was sold or disposed of by the taxpayer within 10 years after the date on which it was acquired by the taxpayer: (d)Any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of any land, where the taxpayer, or any other person where the taxpayer and that other person are associated persons, carried on, at the time the land was acquired, the business of erecting buildings, and the taxpayer or that other person carried out, whether before or after the acquisition of that land by the taxpayer, any improvements, not being improvements of a minor nature, to that land (whether by way of erecting a building or otherwise); and (i)That land, which was sold or disposed of by the taxpayer, was acquired for the purpose of that business of erecting buildings; or (ii) That improved land was sold or disposed of by the taxpayer within 10 years after the date on which those improvements were completed. ... \[Emphasis added\] Section OD 8(4) defines ìassociated persons or persons who are associatedî for the purposes of section CD 1: (4)In sections CD 1, FF 6, and GD 9, associated persons or persons associated with each other areó (a) Any 2 companies where there is a group of personsó (i) The aggregate of whose voting interests in each company is equal to or exceeds 50%; or (ii) In any case where a market value circumstance exists in respect of either company, the aggregate of whose market value interests in each company is equal to or exceeds 50%; or (iii) Who have control of both companies by any other means whatsoever; or (b) A company and any person (other than a company) whereó (i) The person; or (ii) Any spouse of the person; or (iii) Any infant child of the person; or (iv) Any trustee of a trust under which such person or spouse or infant child has benefited or is eligible to benefit,ó or any 2 or more of them have, when aggregated, a voting interest in the company equal to or exceeding 25% or, in any case where a market value circumstance exists in respect of the company, a market value interest in the company equal to or exceeding 25%; or 7 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 9 (September 2003) (c) Any 2 persons one of whom is the spouse or infant child of the other person, or is a trustee of a trust under which that spouse or infant child has benefited or is eligible to benefit; or (d) A partnership and any person where that person is a partner in that partnership; or (e) A partnership and any person, where that person and any partner in that partnership are, in accordance with this subsection, associated persons. Application of the Legislation Paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of section CD 1(2) all use the same phrase to include in a taxpayerís gross income ìAny amount derived from the sale or other disposition of any land where the taxpayer, or any other person where the taxpayer and that other person are associated persons, carried on, at the time the land was acquired, the business of Öî. The question is raised as to whether the use of the words ìare associated personsî means that in order for the provisions to be satisfied the test of association is applied: ïAt the time of acquisition of the land by the taxpayer: eg this requires a person who carried on the business of dealing in land at the time the taxpayer acquired the land to have been associated with the taxpayer at the time the land was acquired (but that person would not necessarily be associated with the taxpayer at the time of disposition); or ïAt the time of disposition: eg this requires a person who carried on the business of dealing in land at the time the taxpayer acquired the land to be associated with the taxpayer at the time the land was disposed of (but that person would not necessarily have been associated with the taxpayer at the time of acquisition); or ïAt the time of acquisition and at the time of sale or other disposal: eg this requires a person who carried on the business of dealing in land at the time the taxpayer acquired the land to have been associated with the taxpayer at the time the land was acquired and also to be associated with the taxpayer at the time the land is disposed of. Plain words On an ordinary reading of the words of the legislation, it seems clear that the phrase ìat the time the land was acquiredî relates to the carrying on of the relevant business, rather than to the timing of the associated persons test. However, it is not clear as to the point in time that the words ìare associated personsî are referring to. The word ìareî generally indicates a present tense and, therefore, arguably indicates that the test should be applied at the most recent point in time (ie the time of the disposal of the land). However, another reading of the words indicates that the test should be applied at the time of acquisition. The meaning of the words without the presence of an associated person is clear: ïAn amount will be gross income if: ïa taxpayer derives that amount from the sale or other disposition of land, ïthe taxpayer was carrying on the relevant business when the land was acquired, and ïthe land was acquired for that business or sold within 10 years of acquisition. There are three elements to the section. First, an amount must be derived from the sale or disposition of land. Second, the taxpayer must have been carrying on the relevant business at the time the land was acquired. Third, the land must have been acquired for that business or sold within 10 years. Arguably the second element is the most important. The fact that the taxpayer was carrying on the relevant business at the time the land was acquired is central to the issue of the taxability of any amount derived on the sale of the land. For example, if the taxpayer were not carrying on a business of dealing in land, any amount derived would not be taxable under section CD 1(2)(b). However, if the taxpayer were carrying on such a business, any amount derived would be taxable if the land was either acquired for the business or sold within 10 years. If the land was acquired for the purpose of a relevant business, it is logical that any amount derived from the sale of the land would be taxable. This is entirely consistent with the fact that any amount derived from a business is gross income under section CD 3. However, where the land was not acquired for the purpose of such a business, any amount derived would still be taxable if the land was sold within 10 years. In this situation, it is simply the fact that the taxpayer carried on the relevant business that leads to the inclusion of the amount derived within gross income. All acquisitions of land by the taxpayer are tainted by the existence of the business, regardless of whether the land is acquired as part of that business. Now consider the effect of the section where an associated person is involved: ïAn amount will be gross income of a taxpayer if: ïthe taxpayer derives that amount from the sale or other disposition of land, ïan associated person of the taxpayer was carrying on the business of dealing in land when the taxpayer acquired the land, and ïthe land was sold by the taxpayer within 10 years of acquisition. 8 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 9 (September 2003) Again, there are three elements to the section. First, an amount must be derived from the sale or other disposition of the land. Second, an associated person of the taxpayer must have been carrying on the business of dealing in land when the taxpayer acquired the land. Third, the land must have been sold within 10 years of acquisition. In a situation where an associated person is involved, the central focus of the section is even more clearly the fact that a relevant business, such as dealing in land, must have been carried on at the time the land was acquired. As it is the associated person who was carrying on the required business at the time of acquisition, the taxpayer could not have acquired the land for the purposes of the business. In these circumstances the amount derived will only be taxable if the land is sold within 10 years. It is only the existence of the business at the time of acquisition that allows the section to include the amount derived on sale in the taxpayerís gross income. The taxpayer is effectively tainted by the activities of the associated person at the time the land was acquired. The section, therefore, is concerned with what was happening at the time the land was acquired ñ was an associated person of the taxpayer carrying on a business of dealing in land? It would seem that in these circumstances it is logical to argue that the associated person must have been associated with the taxpayer when the land was acquired. To separate the associated persons test from the test of the relevant business is an artificial interpretation of the section. Although the section is including in gross income amounts derived on sale, the focus of the section is on the activities of either the taxpayer or the associated person at the time the land was acquired. The time of sale or other disposition of the land is certainly important in the context of section CD 1. The time of the sale of the land is the time at which the application of the section is triggered. However, once the application of the section is triggered by the sale of the land, the focus of the section is clearly on the activities which took place at an earlier time. The mere fact of the sale of the land is insufficient to include any amount derived from that sale in a taxpayerís gross income. The scheme and purpose of the provisions is not simply to bring to tax amounts derived on the sale of property. There must be some other relevant purpose or intention, some other relevant action on the part of the taxpayer or associated person, or some link with business activities, before any amount will be included in gross income. However, as it is not completely clear on the plain reading of the words that the test is applied at acquisition, relevant case law should be considered. The question as to the relevant time for testing association does not appear to have been directly considered by any New Zealand court. However, there is implicit support in some TRA cases for the view that the test of association is applied at the time the land was acquired. For example, in Case H92 (1986) 8 NZTC 630, the TRA considered whether the objectors were assessable on the profit made on the sale of land, A, under any of sections 65(2)(a) and 67(4)(a), (b) and (e) of the Income Tax Act 1976. On concluding that the objectors were not dealers in land at the time the land was acquired, the issue was then whether an associated company, P, was dealing in land when the relevant land was purchased by the taxpayer. The TRA found that the companyís activities did not constitute the business of dealing in land at the time of purchase. Although the TRA did not specifically consider the time at which the parties needed to be associated, the judgment appeared to assume that this was at the time of acquisition. Bathgate DJ said (at page 642): The thrust of cross-examination of the objectors concerning P was to show that it was involved in erecting buildings when A was purchased by the objectors. At that time P and the objectors were associated persons for the purposes of section 67(4)(b) and (c). \[Emphasis added\] Case T25 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,160 concerned whether a taxpayer was assessable on the proceeds of the sale of a commercial property. The question to be answered by the TRA was whether, on the date of acquisition by the objector of his interest in the commercial property, the objector carried on any business of developing or dividing land into lots or whether on that date any associated person of the objector (ie the CC Partnership or the R Syndicate) carried on such a business. Although the timing of the test of association is not specifically referred to by Barber DJ, his Honour makes it clear that he considers the time of acquisition to be the appropriate time and he proceeds on that basis. When discussing whether the objector was a developer or subdivider as at the date of acquisition of the property, his Honour stated (at pages 8,174 ñ 8,175): However, as at 17 October 1978 only two relevant projects had been undertaken. One subdivisional project (of residential land) had been completed and the other was a building project so that, at that date, the objector could not be described as carrying on the business of developing or dividing into lots ëany landí and nor was any associated person of the objector at that time. I appreciate that the CC Partnership and the R Syndicate each commenced in 1974 and ended in late 1979; but on the crucial date, 17 October 1978, the nature of their activity did not offend section 67(4)(ba). \[Emphasis added\] Barber DJís statement that the CC Partnership and R Syndicate ended in 1979 impliedly gives strong support for the proposition that the time for the test of association is at acquisition. In this case the property in question was disposed of in 1988. In these circumstances, if the test of association were to be applied at the time of disposal the above comments by Barber DJ would have been irrelevant. 9 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 9 (September 2003) Notwithstanding the above statements, it is clear that the issue of the timing of the test of association was not argued in Case H92 or Case T25. Case law, therefore, provides limited guidance on the interpretation of the words ìare associated personsî in the context of land sales. However, case law does indicate that one should be careful in the interpretation of tenses. The use of a tense may be decisive only if it is clear what the tense used relates to. For example, in Maradana Mosque Board of Trustees v Mahmud \[1967\] 1 AC 13, the Privy Council considered a provision that empowered the Minister to make a certain order if satisfied that a school ìis being administeredî in contravention of the Act. Counsel for the Minister argued that it was permissible to take account of the past running of the school. The Privy Council held that only the current method of administration at the time of the order could be considered. By way of contrast, in Norman v Simpson \[1946\] 1 All ER 74 the United Kingdom Court of Appeal needed to interpret the words ìhave beenî and concluded that the expression could be equated to ìareî or ìisî in the context before the Court. In that case the use of the words ìhave beenî did not limit the Court to considering only the point in the past at which the sub-letting commenced. In relation to section CD 1(2), it can be argued that the use of the word ìareî does not necessarily limit the inquiry to the present time and that it could be interpreted as operating in the past tense. The approach of the courts has been that if the use of a tense is not clear or is ambiguous, other sources such as the statutory context and the scheme and purpose of the legislation will be used as aids in determining the correct interpretation. This approach is also consistent with the Court of Appealís approach to statutory interpretation set out in CIR v Alcan New Zealand Ltd (1994) 16 NZTC 11,175. Section GD 9(1) The associated persons test is used in many provisions of the Revenue Acts. Generally, these provisions are unhelpful for present purposes as it is obvious in most cases that the associated persons test relates to only one point in time. However, section GD 9(1) is relevant here because it is closely related to the provisions currently being considered. Section GD 9(1) deals with the situation where a person transfers land to an associated person some time after acquisition. Section GD 9(1) is in the nature of an anti-avoidance provision, and applies where land is transferred from a ìtransferorî to a ìtransfereeî and the transferor and the transferee ìare associated personsî. If the transferee later sells or otherwise disposes of the land, any amount derived from the transaction is gross income of the transferee if that amount would have been gross income of the transferor under section CD 1(2). Section GD 9(1) states: Whereó (a)Any land has been transferred from any person (the ìtransferorî) to any person (the ìtransfereeî); and (b)The transferor and the transferee are associated persons; and (c)The transferee subsequently sells or otherwise disposes of that land and the consideration from that sale or disposition exceeds the cost of the land to the transferee; and (d)If, had the transferor not transferred the land to the transferee but instead had sold or otherwise disposed of the land for the consideration referred to in paragraph (c), that consideration would have been gross income of the transferor under section CD 1 ñ that consideration shall be deemed to be gross income of the transferee under section CD 1. Thus, section GD 9(1), like section CD 1(2), also uses the phrase ìare associated personsî in a context where its meaning could be ambiguous. The section is concerned with the situation of a property being disposed of at a profit or gain, ie something that happens in the present and triggers the application of the section. However, the section also refers to the earlier transfer from the transferor to the transferee who ìare associated personsî. In section GD 9(1), the words ìare associated personsî clearly relate back to the earlier time of the transfer from the transferor to the transferee, rather than the present time of the disposal of the land. The words ìare associated personsî are followed by ìand the transferee subsequently sells or otherwise disposes of that landî. The use of the word ìsubsequentlyî denies any connection to the event of disposal to the words ìare associated personsî. The section, therefore, is an example of words in a present tense being used to relate to a past event. Section GD 9(1) clearly supports the conclusion that ìare associated personsî does not necessarily mean associated at the most recent point in time, ie the time of disposal, but can be interpreted as ìwere associated personsî. In the case of section GD 9(1), this means looking back to the time of acquisition by the relevant taxpayer, ie the transferee. Legislative purpose The use of the associated persons test in section CD 1(2) is essentially for anti-avoidance reasons and aims to stop the use of associated persons who are not carrying on any relevant business. This was referred to in the Parliamentary Debates in 1973 on the Land and Income Tax (Annual) Bill (which contained the predecessor provisions to section CD 1). Mr Munroe (MP, Invercargill) explained the difficulties in applying the then current law on the taxation of profits relating to land and the need for amendment, and stated (NZPD Vol 386, 1973: 3653): 10 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 9 (September 2003) There is a provision in the \[Land and Income Tax\] Act which makes dealing in real or personal property for profit or gain assessable for tax. The Inland Revenue Department has had difficulty with this provision because of interpretations of it by the courts. The courts have tended to take the view before they will uphold an assessment, that as there is no capital gains tax in New Zealand there must be a clear pattern of previous dealings, or the circumstances must be such as to leave an inference that a profit motive was present at the time of purchase. In cases where the taxpayers have been land dealers or builders they have been able to avoid assessment of profits on property deals by claiming quite successfully that the property was held as an investment even if the sale was made shortly after acquisition. In other cases the land dealers or builders have held properties in the names of members of their families or in associate companies for the purpose of avoiding tax on the sale of the properties. \[Emphasis added\] If the intention were to prevent dealers in land using associates (who are not dealers) to acquire the land, one would expect that the relevant association would need to be examined at the time of acquisition. The intention behind the provisions of section CD 1(2) would seem to be to make it more difficult for a person who is carrying on one of the specified businesses to hide behind associated persons. If the test of association applies only at the time of disposal, this would mean that associated person purchasers of land who are ìsubstitutedî for land dealers could avoid being taxed where the association was technically terminated immediately before the disposal of the land. Furthermore, if the association test applies only at the time of disposal, it would apply to persons who happen (by way of ìaccidentî or otherwise) to become associated with, for example, a land dealer just prior to their disposing of property where no taxable purpose or connection previously existed. In addition, the anti-avoidance policy would tend to suggest that the possible interpretation of applying the association test at both acquisition and disposal is also incorrect. As such an interpretation would also require the test to be applied at disposal, the concerns expressed above would be equally applicable to that interpretation. Proposed Amendments The Income Tax Bill 2002 which seeks to rewrite Parts A to E of the Income Tax Act 1994 proposes changes to section CD 1(2). Clauses CB 6 to CB 9 of the Bill expressly state that the test of association applies when the land is acquired or, in the case of builders undertaking improvements, improved, rather than at the time of disposal. In respect of builders undertaking improvements this represents a change to the current law. Whereas currently the associated persons test is applied at the time of acquisition of the land, under the proposed changes the test will be applied at the time that improvements were begun. If the Bill is passed in its present form it is currently proposed that these changes will take effect from 1 April 2005. Conclusion In paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of section CD 1(2), on an ordinary reading of the words ìare associated personsî, the time at which the test of association must be applied is ambiguous. However, the scheme and purpose of the provisions indicate that the correct interpretation is that the test of association is applied at the time the land is acquired by a taxpayer. The test is not applied at the time of sale or other disposition of the land, nor must it be applied at both the time of acquisition and at the time of sale or other disposition. 11 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 9 (September 2003) ìCOST PRICE OF THE MOTOR VEHICLEî - MEANING OF THE TERM FOR FRINGE BENEFIT TAX (FBT) PURPOSES PUBLIC RULING ñ BR PUB 03/06 Note (not part of ruling): This ruling replaces public ruling BR Pub 00/10 which was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 10 (October 2000).

Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section CI 3(1) and Schedule 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (and the meaning of ìcost priceî for the purposes of determining the value of the benefit to the employee). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the provision of a motor vehicle by an employer, who owns the motor vehicle, to an employee for the private use and enjoyment of the vehicle by the employee. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: The ìcost price of the motor vehicleî for the purpose of the calculation of fringe benefit tax under section CI 3(1) and Schedule 2 will be determined as follows: ïThe ìcost price of the motor vehicleî will include: ïthe purchase price of the vehicle (inclusive of goods and services tax (GST)). ïthe cost of initial registration and licence plate fees (inclusive of GST). ïthe cost of accessories, components, and equipment (other than ìbusiness accessoriesî) fitted to the vehicle at the time of purchase or at any time thereafter (all costs inclusive of GST). ïthe cost of sign writing or painting the vehicle in the employerís colours or style (all charges GST-inclusive). 12 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 9 (September 2003) COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 03/06 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusion reached in public ruling BR Pub 03/06 (ìthe Rulingî). All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Background If an employee has the private use or enjoyment, or the availability for private use or enjoyment, of a motor vehicle that is owned by the employer of the employee, the employer must pay FBT on the value of the benefit. The benefit is calculated by reference to the cost price of the vehicle to the employer, not the value of the benefit to the employee. If an employer purchases a motor vehicle to be used by, or to be made available for use by, an employee, a number of costs are incurred in addition to the purchase price of the vehicle for the vehicle to be in a state where it can be used by the employee. Some of the additional costs include: ïOn-road costs. Under section 5 of the Transport (Vehicle and Driver Registration and Licensing) Act 1986, no motor vehicle can be driven on the road unless: ïthe motor vehicle is registered; and ïthe registration plates and a current license issued for the vehicle are affixed and displayed on the vehicle; and ïthe full amount of the accident compensation levy has been paid. ïThe cost of transporting the vehicle to the initial place where it is to be used. ïThe cost of fitted accessories, components, or equipment required for and relating solely to the business operations for which the vehicle is used. ïThe cost of accessories, components, and equipment, such as towbars, roof racks, and stereos, fitted to the car at the time of purchase or at some later time. This Ruling identifies the costs that form part of the ìcost price of the motor vehicleî for the purposes of calculating FBT. The Commissioner considers the cost of motor vehicles includes accessories that are permanently affixed to the vehicle. Everything that is permanently affixed to the vehicle, including accessories such as CD players, towbars, and radiotelephone sets, is part of the cost to the employer of making the vehicle available to the employee. Accessories not so permanently affixed are not part of the cost price of the vehicle in the first place and their FBT (or other income tax) status is to be determined separately. However, the Commissioner considers that certain accessories, permanently fitted to the vehicle and relating solely to the business operations for which the vehicle is used, should not be treated as part of the cost of the vehicle for FBT purposes. For example, a radiotelephone set fitted to the vehicle and only able to be used for business purposes would be excluded from the vehicleís cost price because it is a ìbusiness accessoryî. On the other hand, a mobile phone is an example of an item considered not to be part of the cost price of the vehicle because it does not meet the test of being permanently affixed to the vehicle. Legislation Section CI 3(1) provides a formula for calculating the value of the fringe benefit that consists of the private use and enjoyment, or the availability for the private use and enjoyment, of a vehicle. This formula is: when the benefit is subject to FBT on a quarterly basis; and when the benefit is subject to FBT on an income year basis. In these formulae, if the benefit is subject to FBT, (z) is the amount calculated in accordance with Schedule 2. Schedule 2 states: PART A ñ MOTOR VEHICLES Subject to clause 3, in relation to any quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable in respect of the vehicle on an income year basis under section ND 14) to any income year, and to any motor vehicle that in the quarter or income year is provided by any person for the private use or enjoyment of an employee or is available for such private use or enjoyment, the value of the benefit that would be able to be enjoyed by the employee, if the employee had unlimited private use or enjoyment or availability for private use or enjoyment of the motor vehicle in that quarter or income year, shall be, - (a)Where the motor vehicle is owned (whether in the personís own right or jointly with any other person) by that person, 6% or (where fringe benefit tax is payable in respect of the vehicle on an income year basis under section ND 14) 24% of the cost price of the motor vehicle to that person or, as the case may be, those persons: (Emphasis added) (b)Where the motor vehicle is leased or rented by that person from any other person (that person and that other person being associated persons) under a lease or rental agreement that commenced - (i)Ö (ii) On or after 23 September 1985, 6% or (where fringe benefit tax is payable in respect of the vehicle on an income year basis under section ND 14) 24% of the y x z 90 y x z 365 13 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 9 (September 2003) cost price of the motor vehicle to the person who is the owner of the motor vehicle at the time the benefit is provided to the employee: (Emphasis added) The definition of ìAdjusted tax valueî in section OB 1 states: (a)Means, in relation to any depreciable property of a taxpayer and any particular time (and subject to section EG 11, in the case of property in a pool, and to section EG 19(10)(a), in the case of software to which that section applies), the amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: bv (base value) ñ ad (aggregate deductions) where ñ bv (base value) is ñ (i) Except where paragraph (ii) or paragraph (iii) or paragraph (iv) of this item applies, the cost of the property to the taxpayer (excluding any expenditure of the taxpayer allowed as a deduction under any provision of this Act or the Income Tax Act 1976 other than s sections EG 1 to EG 15 and section EG 18 of this Act or sections 108 to 108N and section 113A of the Income Tax Act 1976): (Emphasis added) Application of the Legislation The determinative factor in the calculation of FBT on motor vehicles is the ìcost price of the motor vehicle to that personî (the employer) as contained in Schedule 2. The calculation of fringe benefit tax on the provision of a motor vehicle to an employee is based on the vehicleís cost price, and not its value to the employee. This was the ìtestî adopted by Parliament and confirmed in C of IR v Atlas Copco (NZ) Ltd (1990) 12 NZTC 7,327. At pages 7,334 and 7,335 Sinclair J said: The Tenth Schedule to the Income Tax Act clearly states that the value of the benefit is an amount equal to ì6% of the cost price of the motor vehicle to that personî, where ìthat personî is the person providing the benefit. In other words, the schedule expressly states that the value of the benefit is to be calculated by reference to the cost price to the employer. There is no justification in the legislation for defining the term by reference to the value of the benefit to the employee rather than the cost of the benefit to the employer. There is no room for an employee notion to be introduced when construing the Schedule. The above comment is consistent with the intent of Parliament that the cost price of motor vehicles for FBT purposes should equal the cost to the employee, had the employee purchased the vehicle rather than having the vehicle provided by the employer. In introducing the Tax Reform Bill 1990, on the 19 December 1990, the then Minister of Revenue (Hon. Wyatt Creech) said that the amendment to the FBT rules was to ensure that the value of the motor vehicle for FBT purposes included GST. He said that this was to ensure that the FBT ìcost priceî would equate with the cost that the employee would have had to pay had the employee purchased the vehicle. Meaning of ìcost priceî ìCost priceî is not defined in the Act for the purposes of the FBT rules. It is, therefore, not clear whether it is limited to the purchase price of the vehicle, as some suggest, or whether it includes costs incidental to the purchase, such as on-road costs and the costs of transporting the vehicle to the place where it will be used. The words ìcostî and ìcost priceî are used extensively throughout the Act. Section OB 1 defines these words for a very limited number of sections where the words are used. Examples include: ïFor the purposes of Part EE (the trading stock rules) ìcostî is defined as: In Part EE, for trading stock other than an excepted financial arrangement, means costs incurred in the ordinary course of business to bring trading stock to its present location and condition including purchase costs and costs of production calculated under sections EE 5 to EE 7. (Emphasis added) ïìCost priceî in relation to ìspecified leasesî means: Öthe amount of expenditure of a capital nature incurred by the lessor in acquiring and installing that lease assetÖ (Emphasis added) The significance of these two definitions (even though they have limited application in the Act) is that they both include a reference to costs (ìbringing to its present locationî and ìinstallingî) that are more than simply the purchase price of the item in question. In the definition of ìcostî (for the purposes of the trading stock rules), it could be argued that getting the stock ìto its present locationî is synonymous with ìinstallingî as used in the definition of ìcost priceî. ìInstallî is defined in the Concise Oxford Dictionary as ìplace (heating or lighting etc.) in position for useî. While the two definitions relate to the two different sides of the revenue/capital distinction, they both relate to the assets used in a business. This leads to the view that there may be very little difference (if any) between the terms ìcostî and ìcost priceî as used throughout the Act. This view is supported by the comments of Fullagar J in Australian Jam Co. Pty Ltd v FCT (1953) 10 ATD 220. This case concerned the valuation of trading stock. At 570 the Judge said: The words ëcost priceí in the section \[relating to the valuation of trading stock\] are perhaps not literally appropriate to goods manufactured, as distinct from goods purchased, by the taxpayer, but I feel no difficulty in reading them as meaning simply ëcostí. This implies that ìpriceî adds nothing to the meaning of ìcostî. ìCost priceî is simply ìcostî. In commenting on the above citation in an item entitled ìSome Aspects of Valuation of Trading Stock for Income Tax Purposesî in the NZ Universities Law Review, Vol. 1 (September 1964), ILM Richardson (now Sir Ivor) said: 14 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 9 (September 2003) If ìpriceî adds anything to ìcostî it is only in emphasis, in stressing that what is involved is the actual expenditure of money by the taxpayer with relation to the trading stock. In Phillip Morris Ltd v. F.C. of T. 79 ATC 4,352, the Supreme Court of Victoria had to decide what constituted ìcost priceî for the valuation of cigarettes (trading stock) on hand at the end of an income year under section 31(1) of the Income Tax Act Assessment Act 1936. The Court determined that in respect of manufactured goods: Öthe words ìcost priceî in that subsection \[section 31(1)\] should be understood as meaning ìcostî. Both the above cases (Australian Jam and Phillip Morris) considered section 31(1) of the \[Australian\] Income Tax Assessment Act, which gives taxpayers an option of valuing trading stock at its ìcost priceî. The wording of the section is very similar to the former New Zealand equivalent - section EE 1(3) prior to amendments that applied from the 1998-99 income year - that is, the same ìcost priceî option applied to New Zealand taxpayers. It follows that in considering the use of the words ìcost priceî in New Zealand, the courts would arguably adopt the same position as the Australian courts in the above decisions. Where the words are used in other parts of the Act (including Schedule 2), and there is no specific definition, it is considered that ìcost priceî should be given a similar interpretation. This means that ìcost priceî as used in Schedule 2 for FBT purposes also means ìcostî. In discussing trading stock, some authorities take the view that ìcost priceî relates to things purchased, while ìcostî relates to things manufactured. For example, in Phillip Morris Jenkinson J said: The statutory conception of ìcost priceî or, in the case of manufacturerís stock, ìcostî is merely a value at a particular timeÖ (Emphasis added) In Australian Jam, Fullagar J said: The words ëcost priceí in the section \[relating to the valuation of trading stock\] are perhaps not literally appropriate to goods manufactured, as distinct from goods purchased, by the taxpayer, but I feel no difficulty in reading them as meaning simply ëcostí. (Emphasis added). In TRA Case S12 (1995) 17 NZTC 7,102, Barber DJ considered what is meant by ìits cost priceî in relation to the valuation of foals born to broodmares owned by a horse breeder. He determined that the foalís cost price should include the write-down (depreciation) of the broodmare. At 7,107 he said: ...the Legislature has provided that the breeder or farmer must take progeny into account at ìits cost priceî. Those words do not seem to me to be a particularly happy choice because ìcost priceî is normally that which a merchant buys something (refer Sixth Edition of the Concise Oxford Dictionary). The cost is the price to be paid for a thing and the price is the money or other consideration for which a thing is bought or sold. The taxpayer has not purchased the foal but has had the foal created through the mare after servicing from the stallion. However, in their context, the words ìits cost priceî must be given a sensible interpretation. In the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (3rd Edition) a meaning for ìcostî is ìThat which must be given in order to acquire, produce or effect somethingî. (Emphasis added) In these cases the courts make a distinction between ìcostî and ìcost priceî. ìCostî relating to manufactured goods (the cost of manufacture) and ìcost priceî relating to goods purchased (the cost of purchase). However, under both the Australian and the former New Zealand trading stock valuation rules there is only one option for valuing trading stock at cost and that is its ìcost priceî. In terms of the legislation, therefore, both manufacturers of trading stock and purchasers of trading stock are required to value their goods under its ìcost priceî. So, in the trading stock context at least, ìcost priceî includes both the terms ìcostî and ìcost priceî. Trading stock context As mentioned above, the trading stock rules changed with effect from the 1998-99 income year. The current definition of ìcostî applying to the valuation of trading stock requires the ìcostî to include, ìany costs incurred in the ordinary course of business to bring the trading stock to its present location and condition including purchase costs and costs of production calculated under sections EE 5 to EE 7î. The effect is that now trading stock must be valued by the taxpayer using generally accepted accounting principals (section EE 5(1)). Effectively, section EE 5(2) says that the trading stock must comply with Financial Reporting Standard No.4 (FRS 4) 1994 (Accounting for Inventories). In FRS 4, the value of inventories (trading stock) is to include: 4.6ìCost of inventoriesî is the total of: (a) cost of purchase (as defined in paragraph 4.10 below); (b) costs of conversions (as defined in paragraph 4.13 below); and (c) other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. 4.10 ìCost of purchaseî includes: (a) import duties and other purchase taxes (other than those subsequently recoverable); (b) Transport and handling costs (c) Ö (Emphasis added) As this standard applied from 1994 (replacing the previous standard -SSAP 4), presumably FRS 4 could have been used as a guide by taxpayers in valuing trading stock under the former valuation option, ìcost priceî. That the Commissioner accepted similar calculations to FRS 4 is illustrated by the contents of an item on the valuation of trading stock published in Public Information Bulletin No 82 (December 1974). This item 15 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 9 (September 2003) set out the three options available to taxpayers, being cost price, market selling value, or replacement price. It then went on to define ìcostî - (note: not ìcost priceî). In respect of purchases of finished goods the item said: Here the cost should include freight inwards, customs duty, insurance, and sales tax in addition to the actual purchase price of the goods. (Emphasis added) In the context of their use in relation to trading stock, the words ìcostî and ìcost priceî are interchangeable. Depreciation context The only provisions that deal with valuation of capital assets in the Act are the depreciation rules set out in Subpart EG. Generally, business assets are ìdepreciable propertyî as defined in section OB1, being property that ìmight reasonably be expected Öto decline in value Öwhile used or available for use Öin carrying on a business for the purposes of deriving gross incomeî. This is provided that the assets are not trading stock, land, financial arrangements, or intangible property. Motor vehicles are ìdepreciable propertyî and will qualify for depreciation deductions under Part EG. Under section EG 2(1)(a) depreciation is calculated: ïwhere the diminishing value method is being used, on the ìadjusted tax valueî of the property. ïwhere the straight-line method is being used, on the ìcost of the propertyî to the taxpayer. ìCostî is not defined in the Act for the purposes of section EG 2. ìAdjusted tax valueî is defined in section OB 1. The main component of this definition is the ìbase valueî of the property. ìBase valueî in the majority of cases, especially in respect of property acquired after the beginning of the 1993-94 income year, will be its ìcostî. As stated above, as far as trading stock is concerned there appears to be no difference between the use of the words ìcostî and ìcost priceî. The words are interchangeable. If the same applies in respect of the word ìcostî used in subpart EG, it could mean that ìcostî and ìcost priceî are interchangeable elsewhere in the Act, eg in Schedule 2, in determining the ìcost priceî of a motor vehicle for FBT purposes. The definition of ìcost priceî, as it applies to Schedule 2, was discussed in C of IR v Atlas Copco (NZ) Ltd. This case considered whether the ìcost priceî in respect of motor vehicles was the GST inclusive or exclusive cost. While it was not necessary for the Court to formulate an exhaustive meaning of ìcost priceî, Sinclair J concluded that the words ìcostî and ìpriceî are susceptible to a wide variety of meanings. At page 7,332 Sinclair J referred to expert accounting evidence on the meaning of ìcostî and stated: This accords with the expert evidence given by two accountants, Mr John Hagen and Professor David Emanuel. Professor Emanuel cited a number of definitions of ìcostî from leading textbooks on accounting: ì(a) ëCosts represent the financial sacrifices which are involved in acquiring or producing assets.í Ma, Matthews and Macmullan, The Accounting Framework (2 nd ed, 1987) at p 43. (b)ëAccountants have placed a great deal of emphasis upon the principle of objective evidence, and nowhere is it more apparent than in accounting for the acquisition of plant and equipment. Cost is used as the valuation method in this instance because it is more easily identified than any other valuation and because it is said to be the sacrifice given up now to accomplish future objectives.í McCullers and Schroeder, Accounting Theory: Text and Readings (1978) at p 233. (c)ëWe define cost here as the sum of the quantitative representations of the sacrifices necessarily incurred to bring the fixed asset to its place and state of use.í Most, Accounting Theory (1977) at p 235. (Emphasis added) (d)ëCost is thus the economic sacrifice expressed in monetary terms required to obtain a specific asset or group of assets.í Hendriksen, Accounting Theory (3 rd ed, 1977) at p 270. (e)ëCost is an economic sacrifice, an outflow of wealth, by giving up asset value or incurring liability value.í Staubus, Activity Costing for Decisions (1988) at p 192.î Professor Emanuel then summarised the position by saying that: ìCost is the economic sacrifice associated with getting the purchased item to its current location and condition.î (Emphasis added) It is interesting to note that here the accountants used the term ìcostî rather than ìcost priceî ñ the term (as used in Schedule 2) that the Court was considering. This is consistent with the earlier analysis that the words are interchangeable. In Atlas Copco the Commissioner objected to the evidence of the accountants. At page 7,333 the Court said: Counsel for the Commissioner objected to the evidence of the two accountants on the basis that the interpretation of ìcost priceî is a question of law for the Court, and to rely upon the interpretation of accountants would infringe the ìultimate issueî rule. Moreover, counsel felt that the accountants had mistakenly placed economic substance over legal form in analysing the nature of the payment paid by the purchaser. It is true that defining ìcost priceî is a question of statutory interpretation and, as such, must be resolved by the Court. Where the meaning of words in a statutory context is unclear or ambiguous, however, the Court may derive some assistance from common business parlance and practice, as well as international standards. Moreover, as I have already discussed, the approach of the accountants accords with both the economic substance and the legal form of the transaction: the GST component of the purchase price which may be recovered by a registered purchaser cannot be considered part of the effective ìcost priceî. (Emphasis added) 16 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 9 (September 2003) Here the Court accepts that where uncertainty in the legislation exists, common business practice can be taken into account in defining terms or words. As sufficient doubt surrounds the use of the words in question, accounting or business usage may be of assistance. Generally, the accounting treatment is that the initial cost of a fixed asset includes the costs of putting it into the working condition necessary for its intended use, installation costs, and freight etc (see for instance, FRS 4, 4.6(c), and the expert evidence given in Atlas Copco (cited above)). This further strengthens the proposition that no fundamental difference exists between ìcostî and ìcost priceî as used in the Act. Conclusion On the above analysis it is concluded that ìcostî and ìcost priceî as used in the Act are interchangeable. The calculations of both terms, using accepted accounting principles, include costs in addition to what can be termed the ìpurchase priceî. This means that for the purposes of the phrase ìcost price of the motor vehicleî in the FBT rules, the ìcost priceî of a motor vehicle will be more than just its purchase price. What is the ìcost priceî of a motor vehicle for FBT purposes? When a new motor vehicle is purchased, a number of Government charges have to be paid before the purchaser can use the vehicle on the road. The purchaser may also have accessories fitted to the vehicle at the time of purchase or at a later date. Some of these accessories may be of a non-business nature, such as a towbar, CD player, CNG/LPG conversion, air conditioning, alloy wheels, etc. Generally, unless they are part of a special deal, these accessories will be additional costs to the purchaser. In some instances the purchaser may have a business accessory, eg a radio-telephone, fitted to the vehicle at the time of purchase or at a later date. The question to be considered is whether all or any of (the cost of) these items forms part of the ìcost priceî of the vehicle. Government charges Fees payable at the time of purchase of a new car so that it can be driven on the road include: ïOnce only payments: registration fee, number plate fee. ïAnnual (recurring) fees: annual relicensing fee, ACC levy, label fee. It is arguable that without payment of the initial registration and plate fees (as distinct from the recurring annual re-licensing fees) by the employer the vehicle cannot be used immediately. The employer has to pay these costs before the vehicle can be ìput on the roadî or in a position to be used. This suggests that they are properly to be treated as part of the ìcost priceî of the car. Support for the view that ìcostî includes such items as getting the vehicle ìon the roadî so that it can be used, is found in the High Court of Australia case of BP Refinery (Kwinana) Ltd v FCT (1960) 8 AITR 113. At page 117, Kitto J in considering the issue of what was included in the term ìcostî, said. Ö in my opinion, the word ìcostî in section 56 (1)(b) bears the meaning which it has in the business life of the community. It seems to me impossible to suppose that the depreciation provisions of the Act are intended to apply only to those simple cases in which the ascertainment of cost is a purely arithmetical process. I interpret it as embracing the whole sum which, according to accepted accountancy practice as applied to the circumstances of the case, ought to be considered as having been laid out by the taxpayer in order to acquire the subject- matter as plant, that is to say installed and ready for use as plant for the purpose of producing assessable income. (Emphasis added) Therefore, the cost of the vehicle must include expenditure making it ìready for useî by the taxpayer. Without payment of the registration and plate fees the vehicle is not ready for the purpose intended. Whether the costs of the initial registration fee and the plate fee form part of the cost of the vehicle is not entirely clear. The Commissioner considers the better view of the law, and the likely intent of Parliament, is that such expenses form part of the cost price of the vehicle, particularly given that they are one-off costs that fall into the ìonce and for all paymentsî category (see BP Australia Ltd v FCT/1965/3 All ER 209) and hence are capital in nature. These fees are intended to make the vehicle able to be used. The remaining fees are annual charges and normal accounting practice would treat them as revenue expenditure, even if they were incurred upon purchase of the vehicle. In summary, the better view is that registration and plate fees are ìonce and for allî payments, are of a capital nature, make the vehicle able to be used, and are part of the ìcost priceî of the vehicle. Annual charges (licensing, ACC levy, etc.) are revenue expenditure and not part of the ìcost priceî. Business accessories Generally, accessories permanently fitted to the motor vehicle are properly to be included as part of the vehicleís cost. As discussed earlier, accessories, such as stereos, towbars, roofracks, etc., fitted to a vehicle will form part of its cost price. However, some components or equipment fitted to vehicles may be of a purely business nature. The issue arises as to whether such components or equipment should also be included in the ìcost price of the vehicleî for FBT purposes. 17 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 9 (September 2003) There is no legislative direction on this issue. This may indicate that all accessories, components, or equipment attached to the vehicle form part of its ìcost priceî. It is arguable, however, that business accessories, components, and equipment fitted to the vehicle should not be treated as forming part of the cost price, where they are required and relate solely to the special business operations for which the vehicle is used, and are in themselves depreciable property for the purposes of the Act, eg a two-way radio telephone in a salespersonís vehicle. Such components or equipment are fitted to the vehicle to facilitate the business use of the vehicle, and may be considered as separate business assets located in the vehicle. Another factor (relevant to this last-mentioned aspect) possibly pointing to the components or equipment as not being part of the cost price, is to consider the nature of the assets and how they are treated by businesses for accounting purposes. For example, it is most likely that components such as two-way radios are accounted for and depreciated separately. The radios can be removed from vehicles, or moved from one vehicle to another, and it seems logical that they be treated as separate assets for depreciation purposes. Note: motor vehicles and radiotelephone equipment are listed separately in Depreciation Determination DEP 1. Two-way radios have their own depreciation rate because they are regarded as assets in their own right and not accessories (to a motor vehicle). They form part of a larger asset, for example, the entire radio telephone network, consisting of radios in vehicles and the central control unit in the employerís premises. In such circumstances, even though they are a form of accessory or addition to the motor vehicle, they are an asset in their own right and therefore require a separate asset classification. Usually, radio networks are purchased as a package consisting of a number radios (for each vehicle) plus the central control station. To treat the network as part of the cost price of each car would require an apportionment of the overall expense, including installation costs to each vehicle. The Commissioner does not consider this to be a sensible approach. The same could be said of accessories such as roof- mounted flashing lights, and electronic monitoring equipment. If these types of assets are added because they are required for and relate solely to the business operations for which the vehicle is used, they will be treated similarly to the two-way radio system. Therefore, where business components, such as two-way radios, roof-mounted flashing lights, electronic testing or monitoring equipment, etc, are fitted to the vehicle and are paid for by the employer, they do not form part of the ìcost priceî for FBT purposes. As mentioned earlier, such accessories are business assets of the employer, coming within the definition of ìdepreciable propertyî for the purposes of the Act. As previously discussed under the heading ìApplication of the Legislationî, it was the clear intent of Parliament that the ìcost priceî for FBT purposes should equal the cost to the employee had the employee purchased the vehicle rather than having it provided by the employer. It follows that if the employee had to pay for the vehicle, the cost to the employee must also include accessories fitted to the vehicle as already discussed. Exceptions are the cost of separately depreciable components or equipment fitted to the vehicle solely to meet the special needs of any business operations for which the vehicle is used. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that business components fitted to the vehicle, which are required for and relate solely to the business operations for which the vehicle is used, and are in themselves depreciable property, should be excluded from the ìcost priceî of motor vehicles for FBT purposes. This covers assets requiring the vehicleís power source in order to operate: they are not part of the cost price of the car itself. There may be isolated instances, where the type of business asset mentioned above will unavoidably be used for non-business purposes. The Commissioner considers that any extraordinary and unenvisaged use of the accessory for non-business use over the life of the asset will not in itself negate the purpose of fitting the accessory to be ìsolely for business purposesî in this context. Cost of non-business accessories Commonly, when a vehicle is purchased the owner asks for certain ìextrasî or accessories (other than business accessories) to be fitted to the vehicle. If these accessories are not ìoptionedî (and included in the purchase price), the dealer will charge for their cost and fitting to the vehicle. Such accessories can include: ïstereos, towbars, sunroof, roofrack, CNG/LPG conversions, alloy wheels, air-conditioning, electric windows and locking systems, higher specification tyres, etc. Where the vendor charges for any of these accessories, the question arises as to whether they should be added to the ìcost priceî of the vehicle for FBT purposes. The same issue arises if the accessories are acquired from another person or supplier, or acquired at a later date. Such accessories are of a capital nature and should be added to the vehicle purchase price to arrive at its ìcost priceî. They are part of the vehicle as a whole and are not generally removed at the time the vehicle is sold or otherwise disposed of. They are either singularly or collectively a ìonce and for allî payment(s), culminating in the ìcost priceî of the vehicle that is provided to the employee by the employer for the employeeís ìprivate use and enjoymentî. 18 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 9 (September 2003) Under this interpretation, the cost price may vary from period to period, depending on when accessories are added (or in the unlikely or rarer event of an accessory being removed). Therefore, in summary, accessories fitted to a vehicle form part of its ìcost priceî for FBT purposes (as contemplated in Schedule 2), irrespective of the time they are purchased and fitted to the vehicle. Cost of sign writing or painting the vehicle in the employerís colours or design It is the Commissionerís view that costs associated with sign writing and painting the motor vehicle in the employerís colours, logo, or design are part of the ìcost priceî of the vehicle for FBT purposes. It was concluded earlier that ìcost priceî for the purposes of Schedule 2 means something more than the ìpurchase priceî of the motor vehicle. While the cost of sign writing or painting may not add to the value of the motor vehicle, that is not the test. As discussed earlier, the test is the ìcost to the employerî, not the ìvalue to the employeeî. Some may argue that the costs associated with sign writing and painting the vehicle are primarily of a business nature and should be excluded from the vehicleís cost price. However, unlike business accessories, the sign writing and painting will generally not be depreciable property and therefore, such costs must be added to the cost of the vehicle. The better view of the law is that the costs are correctly attributable to the vehicle itself and form part of the cost price for FBT purposes. Transporting or freighting the vehicle to its place of use In the above discussion on ìcost priceî, it is clear that the courts have accepted that the cost of transporting or freighting goods (whether those goods are trading stock or capital assets of the business) to the place where they are to be used is part of the cost of the goods. As a general rule, the initial cost of fixed assets will include expenditure incurred to put it (the asset) into the working condition necessary for its intended use. And in Atlas Copco, ìcost is Öassociated with getting the purchased item to its current location and conditionî. This would include installation costs and freight. The cost of transporting a purchased motor vehicle to the place where it can be used by the taxpayer, is clearly part of its ìcost priceî, both for FBT and depreciation purposes. For example, the purchase of vehicles direct from a manufacturer or from another source overseas, where the purchaser pays for the cost of transporting the vehicle to New Zealand. It is the Commissionerís view that these transport costs form part of the ìcost priceî of the vehicle for FBT purposes. However, these costs only relate to the initial cost of getting the vehicle to the place it will first be used by the employer, after acquisition. Subsequent transport costs of moving the vehicle within New Zealand (say from one branch of the employerís firm to another) are considered to be part of the normal business operations of the employer and on revenue account. Cost of repairs and maintenance Another issue is the costs of repairs and maintenance of the vehicle and/or accessories, and whether they should be added to the cost price. Generally, repairs and maintenance expenditure on the vehicle or accessories will not increase the vehicleís ìcost priceî for FBT purposes. However, if work on the car is more than normal repairs and maintenance, such as replacing the existing motor with one of larger capacity, the question arises whether that alteration will increase the cost price of the vehicle for FBT purposes. If the repair or replacement is considered to be of a revenue nature, and deductible for income tax purposes, the cost price of the vehicle will not increase in value for the calculation of FBT. On the other hand, if the repair or replacement is of a capital nature, the cost price for FBT purposes must be increased by the amount of that capitalisation. Each case will need to be considered on the basis of its own facts applying established capital/ revenue distinction rules. If the FBT cost price is increased, the recalculation of FBT (on the increased cost price) will apply from the quarter in which that capital expenditure was incurred. Example 1 Employer A purchases a secondhand motor vehicle as a company car for the use of a salesperson employee. The employee will be travelling long distances, so the employer purchases a CD player and has it fitted to the vehicle. As the employee has the full use of the vehicle for private use and is likely to tow his own trailer from time to time, he asks the employer to purchase and fit a towbar to the vehicle. The employer agrees. The ìcost priceî of the vehicle for FBT purposes will be the total of the purchase price plus the cost of acquiring and fitting the CD player and the towbar (all costs GST-inclusive). Example 2 Employer B is looking for a vehicle to replace an existing vehicle written-off by the firmís Wellington-based accountant. The accountant will be entitled to use the vehicle for private purposes when it is not being used for business purposes. While on a trip to Auckland the employer locates a suitable secondhand car, purchases it, and has it transported to Wellington where the accountant will use it. The ìcost priceî of the car for FBT purposes will be the purchase price plus the cost of transporting it to Wellington (both costs GST-inclusive). 19 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 9 (September 2003) Example 3 Employer C decides to replace the companyís fleet of cars used by its sales representatives, because of the high cost of maintaining the existing fleet. The sales representatives are permitted to use the vehicles for private use when they are not required for business purposes. Through a contact with a motor vehicle dealer, the company decides to purchase 10 secondhand cars direct from Japan. The employer agrees on a purchase price with a Japanese car dealer and arranges for the vehicles to be shipped to New Zealand. The ìcost priceî of the vehicles for FBT purposes will be the total of: ïthe purchase price of the cars, including any costs or commissions paid in Japan or in New Zealand ïthe cost of transporting the cars to New Zealand ïGST and any import or inspection levies payable at the time of importation ïthe cost of initial registration and licence plate fees, and ïthe cost of any accessories fitted to the cars at the time of purchase or any time after purchase, either in Japan or on their arrival in New Zealand. Example 4 Employer D is a forestry contracting firm, and has recently purchased a four-wheel drive motor car for its forestry foreman. The foreman has the full use and enjoyment of the vehicle for private purposes while not working. As with the employerís other work vehicles, the car is fitted with a radiotelephone used only for communication between the companyís headquarters and its own vehicles. As the radiotelephone is fitted solely for business purposes, and may be considered a separately depreciable business asset located in the vehicle, it does not form part of the cost price of the vehicle for FBT purposes. Example 5 An employee of Employer E is a travelling salesman. When the employer purchased a new vehicle for the employeeís use, a mobile phone kit (mobile phone and car kit) was installed in the car at the employerís expense. The cost of the mobile phone will be excluded from the cost price of the motor vehicle because it is not ìpermanently affixed to the vehicleî. Whether use of the mobile phone gives rise to a fringe benefit in its own right must be decided on the facts. Comments on technical submissions received Many comments received in the course of producing this item suggested that the cost of fitted accessories should not be subject to FBT, as they have no inherent benefit for employees. As noted earlier in the ruling commentary, this argument ignores the fact that the statutory test, in the context of motor vehicles, is not the value of the benefit to the employee, but the cost price of the vehicle to the employer. It is considered that the Commissionerís approach in excluding any such fittings and accessories on the basis of being business assets is arguably a favourable interpretation of the legislation to taxpayers, particularly when compared to the wording in the Australian legislation where such a test has been specifically legislated. 20 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 9 (September 2003) PRODUCT RULING ñ BR PRD 03/13 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by PMP Distribution Limited (ìPMPî). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 (ìthe ITAî) unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BD 2(2)(c), DE 1, NC 13 and KC 2; the definitions of ìextra emolumentî, ìincome from employmentî, ìsalary or wagesî, ìspecified office holderî and ìwithholding paymentî in section OB 1; the definition of ìsource deduction paymentî in section OB 2(1); the definition of ìPAYE rulesî in section OZ 1(1); regulation 4(1) and clause 5(d) of Part A of the Schedule to the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 (ìthe Regulationsî); and section 6(3)(b) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (ìthe GST Actî). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the engagement of persons (ìthe deliverersî) by PMP pursuant to a standard form contract, for the delivery of newspapers, leaflets, brochures, catalogues, advertising material, samples and other such items to households and other premises throughout New Zealand. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1PMP carries on the business of distributing newspapers, leaflets, brochures, catalogues, advertising material, samples and other such items to households and other premises throughout New Zealand. 2PMP engages the deliverers pursuant to a standard form contract which includes a Deliverersí Handbook, the conditions contained in which are required to be agreed to by the deliverers when entering into a contract (ìthe Contractî), to deliver particular items within a specified period, to each house, flat or other premises located within a designated area, by placing one of each item in each letter box (or other specified location). The deliverers are paid specified rates per item delivered (varying depending on the weight of the item). The Contract is affixed to this Ruling as Appendix I. Condition stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following condition: a)The relationship between PMP and the deliverers is, and during the period of this Ruling will continue to be, entirely in accordance with the Contract affixed to this Ruling as Appendix I, and there are no other collateral contracts, agreements, terms or conditions, written or otherwise, relating to the engagement of the deliverers. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: ïFor the purposes of the PAYE rules, any payment made to a deliverer by PMP pursuant to the Contract will not be ìsalary or wagesî, an ìextra emolumentî or a payment made to a ìspecified office holderî in respect of the activities of a specified office, within the meaning of those terms as defined in section OB 1. To the extent that any such payment is also not a ìwithholding paymentî, it will therefore not be a ìsource deduction paymentî as defined in section OB 2(1), for the purposes of the PAYE rules. ïFor the purposes of sections BD 2(2)(c) and DE 1, any payment made to a deliverer by PMP pursuant to the Contract will not be ìincome from employmentî as that term is defined in section OB 1. ïFor the purposes of the PAYE rules, any payment made to a deliverer by PMP pursuant to the Contract will not be a ìwithholding paymentî as defined in section OB 1, to the extent that such payment relates to the delivery of any item the carriage of which does not require PMP to be registered as a postal operator under the Postal Services Act 1998. ïFor the purposes of the PAYE rules, any payment made to a deliverer by PMP pursuant to the Contract (other than a payment made to a company), will fall within the class of payment specified in clause 5(d) of Part A of the schedule to the Regulations and be declared to be a ìwithholding paymentî by regulation 4(1) of the Regulations and thus a ìwithholding paymentî as defined in section OB 1, to the extent that such payment relates to the delivery of any item the carriage of which requires PMP to be registered as a postal operator under the Postal Services Act 1998. ïIn accordance with section NC 13, and in relation to payments made pursuant to the Contract to deliverers entitled to the child rebate provided for by section KC 2, the amount of any tax deductions 21 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 9 (September 2003) required to be made will be reduced to $0 if the delivererís total weekly earnings do not exceed $20, or their annual earnings are not expected to exceed $1,040, and reduced by $3 per week if the delivererís total weekly earnings exceed $20, and their total earnings for the income year are expected to exceed $1,040. ïFor the purposes of the GST Act, the provision of services by any deliverer to PMP under the Contract will not be excluded from the definition of ìtaxable activityî in section 6 of that Act by section 6(3)(b) of that Act. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 2 July 2003 to 2 July 2006. This Ruling is signed by me on the 2 nd day of July 2003.

The Act provides for the conversion of the Board, which was a statutory body, into a company incorporated under the Companies Act 1993. This company, named Wool Board Disestablishment Company Ltd, assumes the Boardís assets and liabilities and will oversee the disbursement of the Boardís net assets to wool-growers as provided for in the restructuring plan. The board converted into a company on 15 September 2003óthe restructuring day as notified in New Zealand Gazette (11/9/03 Notice:go6006). The net assets of the Board have been allocated to wool-growers by the issue of exchangeable shares, redeemable shares and ordinary shares in Wool Board Disestablishment Company Ltd, on the basis of sheep numbers. The end result of the allocation, exchange and redemption of these shares is that: ïmerino wool-growers have received cash and shares in a company called Merino Grower Investments Ltd and ïnon-merino growers have received cash and shares in a company called Wool Equities Ltd. Non- merino growers can use this cash to acquire further shares in Wool Equities Ltd. The Act contains a number of provisions to address the tax issues associated with the restructuring. These provisions, which are discussed in ìKey featuresî, allowed the restructuring to occur without any adverse tax implications. The ìDetailed analysisî explains the various steps of the restructuring in relation to the distribution of the assets of the Board to wool-growers and the associated tax implications. Background The New Zealand Wool Board was a statutory body established under the Wool Board Act 1997 and was treated as a statutory producer board for tax purposes. Under that Act, the Boardís assets ultimately belonged to the wool-growers. The Act also allowed for the imposition of a levy on wool produced in New Zealand. Wool Equities Ltd was a subsidiary of the Board. Merino Grower Investments Ltd was a company that was incorporated around 2001, and its shares were held by a discretionary trust (Merino Distribution Trust) on behalf of the merino wool-growers. This company had a loan from the Board. Key features The tax-related provisions in the Act are explained below. These provisions ensured that the restructuring occured without any adverse tax implications. Conversion of the Board As part of the restructuring, the Board was converted into and continues as a company incorporated under the Companies Act 1993, named Wool Board Disestablishment Company Ltd. Section 11 of the Act provides that this company is the same ìpersonî as the Board and that no new entity is created as a result of the conversion. The conversion, therefore, has not given rise to tax implications, and any tax obligations or liabilities of the Board became those of the company. Issue of shares to wool-growers Section 36(1) of the Act provides that the issue by Wool Board Disestablishment Company Ltd as part of the share allocation plan in the restructuring plan of shares to a wool-grower is: ïnot a dutiable gift ïnot a dividend for income tax purposes, and ïnot otherwise gross income of the grower for income tax purposes. Section 36(5) of the Act ensured that proceeds from the sale, exchange, redemption or other disposition of a share (or other equity or similar instrument) received by a wool-grower as part of the restructuring process are not gross income for income tax purposes. This provision ensured that the exchange, redemption or other disposition of the shares received is not treated as revenue account property that is acquired for the purposes of resale and therefore taxable. These provisions ensured that no tax implications have arisen as a result of the issue of shares in Wool Board Disestablishment Company Ltd and from the various transactions undertaken as part of the restructuring process in relation to those shares so the merino wool- growers own all the shares in Merino Grower Investments Ltd and the non-merino growers own all the shares in Wool Equities Ltd. 29 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 9 (September 2003) Available subscribed capital Section 36(3) of the Act provides for Wool Board Disestablishment Company Ltd to have available subscribed capital of $47,720,400. This available subscribed capital has been allocated between the classes of shares issued by Wool Board Disestablishment Company Ltd on the restructuring day and in such proportions as it nominated. Continuity of shareholding interest and net tax losses Section 36(2), (4) and (6) of the Act deals with the continuity of shareholding interest in relation to the restructuring process, to ensure that shareholder continuity is not breached as part of that process. In particular, section 36(2) provides that in relation to the issue of shares by Wool Board Disestablishment Company Ltd to non-merino wool-growers, those growers are treated as having held those shares at all times before the restructuring day. This provision allows the tax losses and imputation credit balances of this company (in substance, the tax losses and imputation credit balances of the Board) to be utilised by Wool Equities Ltd in the future, subject to the continuity rules. As part of the restructuring process, Wool Board Disestablishment Company Ltd became a wholly owned subsidiary of Wool Equities Ltd. Section 36(4) of the Act deals with the transfer of the shares in Merino Grower Investments Ltd by the Merino Distribution Trust to a person who is a merino wool- grower as a part of the restructuring plan. It provides that merino wool-growers to whom the shares have been transferred are treated as having held the shares at all times before the transfer. The provision ensured that the transfer of shares in Merino Grower Investments Ltd from the trustees to the merino wool-growers did not constitute a breach in shareholder continuity and, as a result, the tax losses and imputation credit balances of Merino Grower Investments Ltd can be carried forwarded subject to the continuity rules. As part of the restructuring process, the issue of the shares by Wool Board Disestablishment Company Ltd was to two trusts that will deal with the shares in terms of the restructuring plan on behalf of wool-growers. There is a separate trust for merino wool-growers and non-merino wool-growers. Section 36(6) ensures that these trusts nominated to hold shares or rights on behalf of growers are each treated as nominees for income tax purposes. Without these provisions, the tax losses and imputation credit balances may have been forfeited as part of the restructuring. Section 37 of the Act provided for the transfer of 7.2 percent (the merino wool-growersí share of the Board) of the tax losses to be carried forward by the Board immediately prior to the restructuring day to Merino Grower Investments Ltd. Statutory producer board tax rules Section 62(2) of the Act provides that on restructuring day, the Board ceased to be a statutory producer board for tax purposes. Section 38 of the Act, however, allows Wool Board Disestablishment Company Ltd to be treated as a statutory producer board for tax purposes for the period in which it continues to be responsible for the administration of the wool levy imposed under this Act. Application date Sections 11, 36, 37, 38, 39 and 62(2) apply from the day after the date on which the Act received the Royal assent (7 July 2003). Detailed analysis This part of the item provides an explanation in broad terms of the various steps of the restructuring plan relating to the distribution of the assets of the Board to the wool-growers and the associated tax implications. Merino wool-growers Before the restructuring day, the Board converted its loan to Merino Grower Investments Ltd into mandatory convertible notes and these notes were converted, as part of the restructuring plan, into shares in that company. On the restructuring day, Wool Board Disestablishment Company Ltd issued exchangeable shares and redeemable shares (both non-voting shares) to merino wool-growers on the basis of sheep numbers. Section 36(1) of the Act ensures that issue of these shares does not constitute a taxable event. Wool Board Disestablishment Company Ltd redeemed the exchangeable shares by transferring the mandatory convertible notes it held in Merino Grower Investments Ltd to the merino wool-growers. Section 36(5) of the Act ensures that the proceeds of this redemption (the mandatory convertible notes) are not treated as gross income. These mandatory convertible notes converted into shares in Merino Grower Investment Ltd. Section 36(4) of the Act ensures that the change in ownership of Merino Grower Investments Ltd from the Merino Distribution Trust to the merino wool-growers who received those shares did not constitute a breach in the shareholding continuity rules. 30 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 9 (September 2003) Wool Board Disestablishment Company Ltd redeemed the redeemable shares for cash. Wool Board Disestablishment Company Ltd was able to use its available subscribed capital to ensure that the redemption of these shares was not a taxable dividend. Non-merino wool-growers On the restructuring day, Wool Board Disestablishment Company Ltd issued exchangeable shares, redeemable shares (both non-voting shares) and ordinary shares (voting shares) to non-merino wool-growers based on sheep numbers. Section 36(1) of the Act ensures that issue of these shares does not constitute a taxable event. Wool Equities Ltd was granted an option to purchase the ordinary shares in Wool Board Disestablishment Company Ltd when they were issued. Wool Equities Ltd exercised this option, thereby acquiring all the ordinary shares in Wool Board Disestablishment Company Ltd. The effect of this is that Wool Board Disestablishment Company Ltd became a subsidiary of Wool Equities Ltd, thereby allowing both companies to be able to group for tax purposes. Section 36(2) of the Act ensures that the non-merino wool-growers are treated as having held the shares in Wool Board Disestablishment Company Ltd at all times before the restructuring day. Wool Board Disestablishment Company Ltd redeemed the exchangeable shares for the shares it owns in Wool Equities Ltd. The result is that the non-merino growers own all the shares in Wool Equities Ltd. Section 36(5) of the Act ensures that the proceeds of this redemption (the shares in Wool Equities Ltd) are not treated as gross income. Wool Board Disestablishment Company Ltd redeemed the redeemable shares for cash. Wool Board Disestablishment Company Ltd was able to use its available subscribed capital to ensure that the redemption of these shares was not a taxable dividend. Non-merino wool-growers can reinvest all or some of the proceeds from this redemption in a further issue of shares by Wool Equities Ltd. FRINGE BENEFIT TAX ñ PRESCRIBED RATE OF INTEREST ON LOW-INTEREST, EMPLOYMENT-RELATED LOANS The prescribed rate of interest used to calculate fringe benefit tax for low-interest employment-related loans has decreased from 7.74% to 7.33% for the quarter beginning 1 July 2003. The rate is reviewed regularly to ensure it is in line with the Reserve Bankís survey of first mortgage interest rates. It was last changed with effect from the quarter beginning 1 April 2003. The new rate was approved by Order in Council on 25 August 2003. Income Tax (Fringe Benefit Tax, Interest on Loans) Amendment Regulations (No 2) 2003/214 SCREEN PRODUCTION INDUSTRY ñ WITHHOLDING PAYMENTS A correction has been made to the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Amendment Regulations 2003 to ensure that the withholding tax rate of 20 cents in the dollar applies only to payments to New Zealand resident independent contractors. The rate applying to contract payments to non-resident contractors will remain at 15 cents in the dollar. The amendment will apply from 8 September 2003, the date from which the original Regulation applies. The amendment was approved by Order in Council on 1 September 2003.

Correction to the foreign currency article in TIB Vol 15, No 10
---------------------------------------------------------------

A couple of errors have been identified in the "Foreign currency amounts - conversion to New Zealand currency" article.

In the introduction to the article (page 10) we state that:

"The tables in this item list exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand currency under the controlled foreign company (CFC) and foreign investment fund (FIF) rules for the **three months** ending 30 September 2003."

This should in fact be "**six months**".

Also the dates heading the columns in Table B (page 14) show 2002. Despite this, the rates in this table are the rates for 2003.

Determination”, the deleted general asset class for milking machinery, its estimated useful life, and diminishing value and straightline depreciation rates (in the table in the first bullet point) was incorrectly duplicated in the table in the third bullet point. The table in the third bullet point should read: 

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Dairy plant** | **Estimated useful life (years)** | **DV banded dep'n rate (%)** | **SL equiv banded dep'n rate (%)** |
| Milk storage vat/silo (on farm) | 15.5 | 12  | 8   |
| Compressor (refrigerant)(on farm) | 12.5 | 15  | 10  |

Corrections
-----------

In SPS 06/02 Writing off outstanding tax published under the section “Standard practice statements” pp 55-64, paragraph 63 is incorrect.

Paragraph 63 of the standard practice statement should read:

63\. If Inland Revenue considers that recovery of part, or all of the outstanding tax would not represent an efficient use of administrative resources, then pursuant to section 176(2)(a), the outstanding tax would be written off. 

In “New Legislation” page 78 in the second part of the example the reference to “1 July 2006” should read “1 July 2005” and the reference to “1 July 2007” should read “1 July 2006”. 

The example implicitly assumes that the employer can use the tax value option in the return for April–June 2006, although the vehicle was owned before that date.

This would be the case if:

*   when the vehicle was owned for the whole year, at least five years had lapsed since the beginning of the vehicle’s initial return period; and
*   when the vehicle was acquired on 7 December 2005, the first return for the vehicle is for the April–June 2006 quarter (that is, the vehicle was not used to provide fringe benefits until that quarter even though it had been purchased some months earlier).

1 THE T.I.B. READERSHIP SURVEY We asked, You told us, and Here’s the Result In Tax Information Bulletin No 5 of November 1989, we included a questionnaire to find out what our read- ers thought of the T.I.B., and more importantly, what you would like to see changed in it. Beginning with this issue, the format will change slight- ly, to take into account the opinions given in the replies to the survey. As well as the present technical items, future issues will contain articles of more general in- terest, where these come to light. Since the first T.I.B. issue was released twelve months ago in July 1989, we’ve started re-numbering from 1 again, and made this year’s issues Volume Two. The majority of respondents to the survey preferred the present two-column layout of the bulletin, and the sepa- ration of the extremely technical material into a sepa- rate appendix, so these features will not change. To all our readers who replied to the survey, a Big Thankyou; your input was appreciated. TARANAKI, WANGANUI AND HOROWHENUA FLOODS RELIEF FOR FARMERS AND GROWERS AFFECTED INTRODUCTION At a meeting on 7 May 1990 Cabinet agreed to spe- cial assistance for farmers and growers affected by flooding in January and March 1990 for bona fide farmers within the following geographic region: .the broader Taranaki and southern King Country regions bounded by the coast in the west from New Plymouth north to Awakino; .from Awakino inland and north along Highway 3 to Mahoenui, then east in a straight line from Man- gatupoto on Highway 4; .from Mangatupoto south on Highway 4 to Wan- ganui; .from Hawera northeast along Highway 3 to Strat- ford, west in a straight line through the Egmont National Park to the coast through Pungarehu and then north to New Plymouth. Amongst other things, Cabinet approved early with- drawal of money deposited into Income Equalisation accounts for farmers within the geographic areas de- fined above. COMMENT Farmers in the flood affected area will be able to take advantage of this decision by making use of the income spreading provisions of the Income Equalisation Scheme. Normally deposits made to the scheme can only be withdrawn after 12 months. Where an area has been declared an adverse event area the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has the authority to make refunds from the scheme at an earlier date. This will enable the income arising from the forced sale of capital stock to be deposited in the scheme and withdrawn when the stock is replaced. The scheme also provides for early refunds, from funds already deposited, where those funds are used to undertake development or repair work arising from the adverse event that was unfore- seen at the time the deposit was made. The Commis- sioner can also authorise early refunds “to avoid the suffering by the taxpayer of serious hardship”. Reference: H.O. 10.F.1.2. 2 PROBLEM RESOLUTION SERVICE — WHAT CAN IT DO FOR YOU? Inland Revenue’s Problem Resolution Service was set up in May 1989, to help people who are having trou- ble in their dealings with this Department. It is intended to be used where regular contact with Inland Revenue has failed to resolve a problem, rather than as a first point of contact. If you are experiencing long delays in getting results from Inland Revenue, or if you have been affected by a decision or an action which seems unfair or incom- plete, the first step is to see our staff at the counter, or to telephone or write to us. The majority of problems are solved in this way. However, if this action is not successful, then the Prob- lem Resolution Service can help. In each Inland Reve- nue office there is an experienced senior staff member who has been appointed Problem Resolution Officer. This person’s task is to sort out (usually within 5 work- ing days) situations where previous contact with the Department has not brought results. Reprinted below is a list of the Problem Resolution Officers in each office, whom you should not hesitate to contact should the need arise.

INLAND REVENUE COMPUTER PROGRAMMES Would you be interested in a copy? 4 PROVISIONAL TAX ESTIMATES AND USE OF MONEY INTEREST - Cases that should not have been treated as Estimates - BACKGROUND Individual taxpayers whose provisional income does not exceed $100,000 are able to base their provisional tax wn the past year’s terminal tax plus 10%. This option is re- ferred to as ‘safe harbour’. These taxpayers are able to make additional voluntary payments, above the statutory minimum, without being exposed to the use of money in- terest provisions. The Department has become aware of a number of cases where this voluntary payment has been incorrectly treated as an estimate. This has serious implications for taxpay- ers. Once a taxpayer makes a written election to pay pro- visional tax using the estimation option, it becomes bind- ing and cannot be reversed. Where the end of year residual tax exceeds the estimated provisional tax, the taxpayer is charged interest under the use of money provisions. The Department pays interest on any overpayment. WHICH OPTION TO USE It is therefore very important that ‘safe harbour’ taxpay- ers who wish to pay more than their statutory minimum do so by using Option 1, terminal tax plus 10%. This is the amount which will appear on their statements; any ad- ditional voluntary payments will be held as credits in their account. Any taxpayer who indicates Option 3, Estimation, or com- pletes the panels to show estimated income or estimated tax will be fully liable to the use of money interest provi- sions. This is so even when the taxpayer estimates an amount higher than the statutory minimum they are obliged to pay. POLICY The crucial point is whether or not an estimate has been made. The following policy has been determined for in- dividual taxpayers whose provisional income does not exceed $100,000: a)Provisional taxpayers who paid more than terminal tax plus 10%, but did not stipulate the ESTIMATE option as the method of calculating their payments, are to be treated as having made voluntary payments. These taxpayers are not subject to the interest provisions. b)Provisional taxpayers who paid more than terminal tax plus 10%, and clearly indicated that the payments were calculated on the ESTIMATE basis, are subject to the interest provisions. Where the payment exceeds residual tax, they will be entitled to receive interest on the overpayment. APPLICATION ‘Safe harbour’ taxpayers, who believe they did not stipu- late the ESTIMATE option but whose assessments include a charge for interest on use of money, should contact their local IRD district office. District office staff will review all the documentation held to ascertain whether or not a valid estimate was made. Only those taxpayers who clearly indicated that they wished to use the Estimate option will remain liable to the use of money interest charge. All other taxpayers will have the interest cancelled. JOINT ASSESSMENTS AND IMPUTATION CREDITS Inland Revenue has been asked for its view on the correct approach to crediting tax to imputation credit accounts (ICAs) where a joint assess- ment is issued under section 191(8) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Where the Commissioner issues a joint assessment under section 191(8) in respect of companies in a group, credits arise in the ICAs of each company in the group for the amount of income tax that would have been assessed to each company had separate assessments of income tax been made. Under section 191(8) the individual companies remain severally liable for income tax. It was never intended that a credit should arise to the imputa- tion credit account of a company for tax paid by that company to satisfy the liability of another company. The same principle applies to credits arising to the branch equivalent tax account. FRINGE BENEFIT TAX - PRESCRIBED RATE OF INTEREST The Minister of Revenue, Peter Neilson, has confirmed that the prescribed rate of interest used to calculate the fringe benefit of low interest employment related loans will continue at 14.8 percent for the quarter commencing 1 July 1990. Mr Neilson said that any change in interest rates will be reflected in the prescribed rate of interest for subsequent quarters. 5 PUBLIC SERVICE MILEAGE RATES WITH EFFECT FROM 1 JULY 1989 The following rates have been set for use by Public Service Employees who are required to use their own vehi- cles for Official Business.

The tax measures in the Finance Bill were enacted as the Income Tax Amend- ment Act (No 3) 1990, the GST Amend- ment Act (No 2) 1990 or the Land Tax Abolition Act 1990. These Acts were all assented to on 8 August 1990. The issues covered are: \* Living Alone Payment for Guaranteed Retirement Income earners \* Donations and school fees rebate \* Bloodstock amendments \* Motor vehicle log book requirements \* Repeal of Sec 129 interest clawback \* Donations by public companies \* Income Equalisation Account \* Repeal of Sec 188A loss limitations \* Maori Authorities - distributed income \* Payment of PAYE and SSCWT deduc- tions \* Provisional Tax \* Retirement Tax \* Accident Compensation Levy \* GST taxable periods \* GST payment date \* GST thresholds \* Land Tax See Part 1 for details of each measure. 2 In the Taxation Reform Bill (No 2) 1990 which was introduced to Parliament on 26 July 1990. At the time of printing, this Bill had not been passed, and all items shown here may be subject to change during the Parliamentary process. Items contained in the Bill are described briefly in Part 2, based on the Bill as it was introduced. Detailed information will be printed in a later TIB when the Bill has been passed. 3 Announced by the Government as in- tended future actions, but without accom- panying legislation. These are described briefly in Part 3, but could be subject to change during the Parliamentary process. A later TIB will cover these issues in depth when legislation has been introduced and passed. Included with this TIB is a summary of the budget tax issues and application dates. Please contact your local Inland Revenue office if you want more copies of this sum- mary. 3 DONATIONS AND SCHOOL FEES REBATE Sec 3, Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1990 PART ONE FINANCE BILL (NO. 2) 1990 INCOME TAX AMENDMENT ACT (NO. 3) 1990 LIVING ALONE PAYMENTS Sec 2, 4, and 14 - 22, Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1990 Two amendments have been made to Section 56A of the principal Act. The first amendment increases slightly the per- centage figure for calculating the rebate on do- nations from 33 percent to 33 1/3 percent. The second amendment increases the maximum allowed as a rebate under this section from $200 to $500. This means that donations up to a maximum of $1,500 will qualify for the rebate. These amendments will apply from the income year commencing 1 April 1990. ADDITIONAL BLOODSTOCK EXPENSES NOW ALLOWABLE Sec 5 and 6, Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1990 During April the Minister of Revenue under- took formal discussions with the bloodstock industry resulting in an announcement that cer- tain minor amendments would be made to the bloodstock taxation regime to address various concerns raised by the Industry. This Act gives effect to that announcement by - .Amending section 86H of the Act to allow a taxpayer to write-down bloodstock 2 years of age or over which has been used for breeding, or is intended to be used for breeding. Starting on 26 September 1990, The Social Wel- fare Department will pay a living alone payment to Guaranteed Retirement Income Earners who live alone. These payments are in addition to Guaranteed Retirement Income. They will be subject to income tax, and treated in the same way as GRI for surcharge purposes. Living alone payments will be paid to unmar- ried persons who are receiving Guaranteed Re- tirement Income or Veteran’s Pension, and who are living alone. A person is considered to be living alone who - (a) Occupies a house, flat or hotel, motel unit, a room in a boarding house, etc; and (b) Does not share that residence or household expenses with any person over the age of 18 years of age other than a dependent child, or a temporary visitor who stays less than 13 weeks in any 26 week period. The sections of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) relating to Living Alone Allowances are set out in Appendix A to this TIB. 4 Adoption of a Log Book Section 7 of the Amendment Act replaces section 106B of the Principal Act. The new provisions provide that the keeping of a log book for a 90 day period will be sufficient to determine the proportion of use of a motor vehicle that is for business purposes. The option to keep a log book expands the previous section 106B, which required that the deduction of expenditure and the allowance for depreciation had to be justified by the taxpayer keeping full and complete records for the entire income year. A log book may be maintained by any self- employed taxpayer who uses a motor vehicle partly for business and partly for private pur- poses. The log book may then apply for a period up to 3 years. However, the taxpayer is required to start a new log book where the business use of the motor vehicle decreases by 20 percentage points of total distance travelled (i.e. reduces by 20 per- cent of total usage on which the current log book is based) and the taxpayer considers that the log book no longer fairly represents the use of the motor vehicle. The maintaining of a log book does not in any way amend the requirement to keep records verifying the expenditure incurred by the tax- payer, but simply apportions the usage of the vehicle between business and private use, in order to determine the deductible expenditure. The Commissioner has powers to- (a) Require the taxpayer to keep a further log book; and (b) End the 3 year period to which a log book relates; and (c) Decide that a log book is not representa- tive of the use of a motor vehicle. Option to Keep Full and Accurate Records A taxpayer may choose to keep full and accurate records instead of a log book. These records may only apply in periods where the log book does not apply, or where the Commissioner approves their application during the period covered by the log book. Absence of Full and Accurate Records If a taxpayer does not retain a log book or full and accurate records for a period, the business use proportion will be calculated on those records which are available up to a maximum of 25%. If no records are kept no deduction will be al- lowed. These provisions apply from 1 April 1991. A section-by-section discussion of these provi- ons is included as Appendix C to this TIB. FFF .Amending section 106(1)(n) to allow horse breeders a deduction for expenditure incurred in preparing bloodstock for sale where that breeder does not race that bloodstock. It effec- tively provides that expenses incurred in train- ing a horse for a “ready to race” sale are deductible. .Amending section 106(1)(n) to allow a deduc- tion for expenditure incurred by a taxpayer who trains a horse for another party and the consideration for that training is assessable income. This clarifies the legislation to ensure that taxpayers who train horses for other taxpayers may deduct their expenditure. These amendments apply from the income year commencing on 1 April 1991 and for every sub- sequent year. A section-by section discussion of these changes is included as Appendix B to this TIB. "TEST PERIOD" MOTOR VEHICLE LOG BOOKS Sec 7, Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1990 5 DESIGNATION OF INCOME EQUALISATION DEPOSITS Sec 10 and 11, Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1990 The Income Equalisation Reserve Account has been brought into line with the Public Finance Act 1989. The amend- ments clarify that the de- posits are public money that can be deposited in a Crown Bank Account at any registered bank. SECTION 129 INTEREST CLAWBACK REPEALED Sec 8, Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1990 Before Budget night, a taxpayer selling a prop- erty within 10 years of purchase which was used for any commercial activity except farming, was generally caught by the provisions of section 129. Under section 129, the taxpayer had to return all interest deductions claimed since pur- chase (but limited to the profit on sale) against the income received from that property. These interest clawback provisions ceased to apply from Budget night. Any sale or other disposal of property that takes place after 24 July will therefore not be subject to section 129. Section 8 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1990 achieves this by inserting a new subsection (A1) at the beginning of section 129. GIFTS OF MONEY BY PUBLIC COMPANIES Sec 9, Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1990 Section 147 of the principal Act is amended to increase the maximum deduction that can be claimed for donations to any one donee. The new maximum limit is the greater of - - 1 percent of the company’s assessable income; or - $4,000. Previously the maximum donation to any one donee was limited to $4,000. The overall maximum amount of deductions that a company can claim remains the same. It is the greater of - - $1,000; or - 5 percent of the company’s assessable income. These amendments apply from the income year commencing 1 April 1990. SECTION 188A $10,000 LOSS LIMITATION REPEALED Sec 12, Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1990 section 188A provisions, i.e., a maximum of $10,000 of those losses carried forward may be offset in each year, in addition to any current year losses. Section 12 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1990 amended section 188A by inserting an extra proviso to subsection (7) and (7A). An example is set out overleaf. Section 188A limited the losses from rental ac- tivities that could be offset against other income to $10,000, where that rental activity was not the main business activity of the taxpayer. The $10,000 loss limitation provisions have been removed for all losses incurred in the 1990/91 and all future income years.

The First Schedule to the Act is amended so that it applies only to undistributed income. THRESHOLD INCREASE FOR PAYE AND SSCWT TWICE MONTHLY PAYMENTS Sec 23, Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1990 The threshold for twice monthly payment to Inland Revenue of PAYE and Specified Super- annuation Contribution Withholding Tax (SSCWT) deductions was increased in the 1990 Budget from $50,000 to $100,000 per annum. The increased threshold will apply to all PAYE and SSCWT deductions required to be made on or after 1 July 1991. The threshold will continue to be calculated on the basis of the previous year’s deductions of PAYE and SSCWT, and without regard to any reduction of that figure by the payment of Fam- ily Support Tax Credits to employees. The dates by which payments to the Commis- sioner are required to be made, and the payment periods applicable to twice monthly payments remain unchanged. 7 INCOME TAX PAYMENT AND PROVISIONAL TAX CHANGES Sec 24 - 31, Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1990 A number of changes have been made to the legislation covering the payment of income tax and provisional tax. From the 1991/92 income year the terminal tax due date is being moved forward to 20 Novem- ber for all individuals who do not have to pay provisional tax. (For odd balance dates, pay- ment will be due in the eighth month after balance date.) This means that the income tax payable by such individuals for the income year ending 31 March 1992, which would previously have been payable on 7 February 1993, will be due on 20 November 1992. The threshold for determining who is a provi- sional taxpayer has also been raised substan- tially. From the 1991/92 income year only tax- payers with residual income tax of greater than $2,500 will be provisional taxpayers. Taxpayers will only have to pay 1992 provisional tax in the 1991/92 income year if their previous year’s residual income tax was greater than $2,500. Residual income tax is the tax (including GRI Surcharge) liability remaining after the deduc- tion of all tax credits, source deductions of PAYE and resident withholding tax, but before the deduction of provisional tax payments. The change to a threshold of $2,500 of residual income tax is expected to remove 230,000 tax- payers from the provisional tax regime. All other provisional tax thresholds are also changing from provisional income amounts to equivalent residual income tax amounts. From the 1991/92 income year the compulsory esti- mation provisions will apply to taxpayers with residual income tax, or expected residual in- come tax, of greater than $300,000, rather than $1,000,000 of provisional income. Natural per- sons not making an estimate will pay or receive use of money interest if their residual income tax is $30,000, rather than if their provisional income is $100,000. The only provisional tax change which applies immediately relates to all estimates made after 24 July. Such estimates will be required to be fair and reasonable estimates based on details avail- able to the taxpayer at the time the estimate is made. These changes in the Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1990 are summarised on a clause by clause basis in Appendix D to this TIB. RETIREMENT TAX RATES Sec 33, Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1990 The rates of retirement tax for the next 30 years, as set out in the 20th Schedule to the Income Tax Act, are amended. The rate of retirement tax for the 1990/91 and 1991/92 income years is 7.5 cents. This amendment will apply from 8 August 1990. CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENT TO ACCIDENT COMPENSATION ACT Sec 34, Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1990 To make sure the due dates for Accident Com- pensation self-employed levies remain consis- tent with the terminal tax due dates, a conse- quential amendment has been made to the Acci- dent Compensation Act 1982. The due date for self-employed levies is now set by reference to the day on which terminal tax is due under section 388 or 395 of the Income Tax Act. This amendment will not have any effect on the AC levy due date for most taxpayers. Only those self-employed taxpayers who are not making provisional tax payments in the 1991/92 income year, because their previous or current year’s residual income tax was less than $2,500, will have their AC levy due date brought forward to the eighth month after balance date. 8 FFF ACCIDENT COMPENSATION Cont'd The consequential amendment to the Accident Compensation Act 1982 was made by section 34 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1990. This section repealed and replaced subsection (1) of section 44 of the Accident Compensation Act, which defines the term “due date” for the purposes of that section. The new subsection makes the due date for the AC Levy calculated on a statement of earnings the same day as the due date for income tax (due under section 388 or 395 of the Income Tax Act) on those earnings. GST AMENDMENT ACT (NO. 2) 1990 ALIGNING OF GST TAXABLE PERIODS WITH INCOME TAX BALANCE DATES Sec 2, 3 and 8, GST Amendment Act (No. 2) 1990 The Tax Simplification Consultative Committee recommended that registered persons be al- lowed to align their GST return period with their income tax balance dates. Presently the legislation provides the Commis- sioner with the discretion to approve a change in the last day of a registered person’s two month taxable period. This discretion will be used to allow registered persons whose income tax bal- ance date is at the end of a month, or 7 days either side of the end of the month, to align their income tax and GST returns. For those registered persons who account for GST on a 6 monthly basis, the present legislation does not allow the Commissioner to change the last day of a 6 monthly period to the last day of another month. In order to enable these regis- tered persons to align their taxable periods with their income tax balance date, the GST Act has to be amended. Again, only those registered per- sons whose balance dates for income tax pur- poses are on the last day of a month, or seven days either side of the end of a month, will be able to take advantage of the amendment. This new policy will apply from 1 September 1990. CHANGE OF DUE DATE FOR PAYMENT OF GST Sec 4 - 6, GST Amendment Act (No. 2) 1990 All references to the due date for filing returns and special returns, and payment of GST, are amended from the first day of the second month following the end of the registered person’s taxable period to the last working day of the month following the end of the taxable period. This change applies to taxable periods ending on or after 31 January 1991. For example, the first payment under the new rules will be for taxable periods ending on 31 January 1991. This pay- ment will be due on the last working day in February, which is the 28th. 9 GST THRESHOLD LEVELS PAYMENTS BASIS THRESHOLD Sec 6, GST Amendment Act (No. 2) 1990 Section 19 of the principal Act has been amended to increase the thresh- old amount of taxable supplies be- low which a person can adopt the payments basis of accounting, from $500,000 to $1,000,000. This amendment applies to applica- tions made on or after 1 October 1990. INVOICE THRESHOLDS Sec 7, GST Amendment Act (No. 2) 1990 Section 24(4) of the principal Act has been amended to increase the threshold amount of taxable supplies below which a simple tax invoice can be issued, from $100 to $200. Section 24(5) of the principal Act has been amended to increase the threshold amount of taxable supplies below which a tax invoice does not have to be issued, from $20 to $50. These amendments apply to taxable supplies made on or after 1 October 1990. REGISTRATION THRESHOLD Sec 9 of the GST Amendment Act (No. 2) 1990 Section 51 of the principal Act is amended to increase the threshold amount of taxable supplies above which a person must register for GST, from $24,000 to $30,000. Registered persons with annual turnover presently between $24,000 and $30,000 should consider carefully whether they should deregister. Deregistration could render them liable for GST on all goods and services forming part of the assets of the business at cessation of registration. This amendment applies to persons becoming liable to be registered in terms of section 51(1) of the principal Act on or after 1 October 1990. This Act halves the rate of land tax to 0.5 cents in the dollar for land valued on 31 March 1991 and abolishes land tax from 31 March 1992. Full payment will still be required for the current land tax year. Taxpayers should make payment on 7 October 1990 of the last half of the tax due on land valued on 31 March 1990. For land valued at 31 March 1991, when the rate of land tax is halved, payment is required in only 1 instalment - on 7 May 1991. The Land Tax Act 1976 is repealed on 31 March 1992, but still applies to tax due and payable prior to that date, so the repeal does not in any way affect the taxpayer’s responsibilities or rights, or the Commissioner’s powers. A detailed discussion of the sections of the Act forms Appendix E to this TIB. LAND TAX ABOLITION ACT 1990 10 PART THREE BUDGET ANNOUNCEMENTS PART TWO TAXATION REFORM BILL The major issues in the Taxation Reform Bill (No 2) 1990, as introduced to Parliament, were: \* A new hybrid accounting basis for GST which will allow registered persons to account for output tax on an invoice basis and input tax on a payments basis. The hybrid system will be available for any return period starting on or after 1 January 1991. See Appendix F for more information on this subject. \* The payment dates for Resident and Non- Resident Withholding Tax will be moved to the 20th of the relevant month. This will apply from 1 July 1992. \* From 1 April 1992, any employer who, in the previous year, made gross PAYE and SSCW deductions of less than $100,000, may elect to furnish Fringe Benefit returns and pay Fringe Benefit Tax on an annual basis. Employers choosing this option will be charged an inter- est factor to reflect the deferral of payment of FBT. \* The current FBT exemption of $50 per em- ployee per quarter will be increased to $75 per quarter from 1 April 1992. \* The Taxation Review Authority will be able to make orders for payment of costs against any person appearing before the Authority. \* Return filing requirements and payment dates under both the Imputation and Foreign Divi- dend Withholding Payment regimes will change. The Bill also contains a number of minor meas- ures relating to imputation, the Controlled For- eign Companies regime, accruals, the trust re- gime and minor amendments to some defini- tions. The following items were announced by the Government on Budget night. As yet, there is no legislation for any of these items. They were: \* Administration of the Family Support and Guaranteed Minimum Family Income schemes is to be transferred from Inland Rev- enue to Social Welfare from 1 April 1991. \* From 1 July 1992, a new Child Support Agency will operate within Inland Revenue. This Agency will be responsible for assessing and collecting child support payments from non- custodial parents and passing on some or all of the money collected to the parent who does have custody of the child/ren. \* A new provisional tax regime which will include changed payment dates for provi- sional tax, use of money interest to be charged /paid from the first instalment date and a changed terminal tax payment date. 11 LATE IR5 RETURNS Inland Revenue issued a Press release in July 1990, aimed at people who had not yet filed their 1990 IR 5 returns. Following is an outline of its contents. Inland Revenue is urging taxpayers who missed the June 7 deadline to work on getting their returns in as soon as possible. The Department has received 741,690 IR 5 re- turns, out of an expected 1.4 million for the year. 627,000 returns had been filed by this time last year. Although more returns have been received so far, more of them came in right on the deadline this year. Taxpayer Services Director Martin Scott said that this may have been due to the new requirements of the Interest PAYE tax. “Many taxpayers are unsure of their responsi- bilities when it comes to Interest PAYE, and a lot of this year’s enquiries have been about this tax,” he said. “For this and other reasons, there are still another 658,310 IR 5s to come in. We’re not going to start imposing penalties yet, but want to encourage people to speed up their returns.” Martin Scott said that Inland Revenue was con- cerned that many people weren’t sure which return form to use, or even if they had to file a return. “We’ve produced a one-page explanation of who must file a return. It’s called “Do you need to file a return?” and is available on counter stands at our all district offices.” INCOME TAX (WITHHOLDING PAYMENTS) REGULATIONS 1979 - AIRCRAFT AND SHIPPING OPERATORS Inland Revenue has been asked to confirm its policy on the application of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 in relation to payments made to non-resident aircraft and shipping opera- tors. We have considered the matter and concluded that, whilst as a matter of law the withholding payments regulations will apply to payments made to these classes of taxpayer, we will not be seeking to apply the regulations to these payments. A brief analysis of the regulations and the appropri- ate provisions of the Income Tax Act as they relate to non-resident aircraft operators and shippers follows: Regulation 4 of the Income Tax (Withholding Pay- ments) Regulations 1979 states “(1) Subject to the provisions of these regulations, all payments of the classes specified in the schedule to these regulations are hereby declared to be withholding payments for the purposes of part XI of the Act”. The focus of the regulations is therefore on the nature and type of payment made and not on the type of taxpayer in receipt of that payment. A non-resident contractor is defined in the regula- tions as being “..any person..who is not deemed to be resident in New Zealand within the meaning of part IV of the Act and who, under a contract..or an agreement or arrangement undertakes ..any contract activity”. The definition of “contract activity” has recently been amended to broaden the scope of the regulations as they apply to non-resident contractors. (A detailed discussion of the amendment was appended to T.I.B. No. 11 issued June 1990) The definition of contract activity now includes “The performing or rendering of any work or contract service in New Zealand, whether or not that work or contract service is car- ried on or carried out in connection with, or in relation to, any contract project.” Whether or not the withholding payments regula- tions apply to payments made to non-resident air- craft and shipping operators depends on whether or not their activities carried out in New Zealand con- stitute the performing or rendering of any work or contract service. Inland Revenue believes that the withholding pay- ments regulations would apply to payments made to non-resident aircraft and shipping operators for their 12 Depreciation increase for Supermarket Trolleys Background Currently the Commissioner allows a depreciation rate of 10 per cent diminishing value on supermarket trolleys, which is the general rate for plant and machinery. It has now been established that this rate is not high enough, because of the wear and tear on supermarket trolleys. Ruling As from \[and including\] the income year starting on 1 April 1990, the rate of depreciation applicable to supermarket trolleys will be 16 2/3 per cent DV. It should be noted that the loss of trolleys through theft is loss of capital, and is non-deductible in terms of section 106(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Reference: H.O. 10.D.3.6 ACCRUALS CONTACT PEOPLE SOON TO BE AVAILABLE The Accruals Rules for financial arrange- ments have been in place for four years. However, with the complexity of these rules, many taxpayers and their agents approach them with some trepidation. The Commissioner, Mr David Henry, is committed to providing an improved serv- ice to taxpayers on accrual issues. To do this, Inland Revenue is currently training people in each District Office specifically to deal with accruals. A list of these officers will be published in a future TIB as soon as training is com- plete. Withholding Payments Cont'd activities carried out in New Zealand. Also, because the payments made are deemed to be derived from New Zealand in terms of section 243(2)(q) of the Act, the withholding payment would be the total pay- ment received in respect of those activities. Section 245(1) of the Act does not apply to income of this class; the payment would therefore not be appor- tioned in respect of that part of the activity performed outside New Zealand. In the majority of cases the payments made will either be exempt from New Zealand tax in terms of sections 64A or 223(3) of the Act or not subject to tax in New Zealand pursuant to a Double Taxation Agreement. For cases where the income of the aircraft or shipping operator is not exempt from New Zealand tax under our domestic law, and/or a Double Taxation Agree- ment does not restrict our taxing rights, we will not be seeking to apply the withholding payments regu- lations to payments made to these classes of taxpayer in pursuance of their activities carried out in New Zealand. 13 DUE DATES REMINDER September 1GST Return and payment for period ended 31 July 1990 due. 5PAYE Deductions for last 16 days of August 1990 due - “Large” employers. 7First instalment of 1991 Provisional Tax due for taxpayers with May balance dates.

APPENDICES TO TIB VOLUME TWO, NO 2, AUGUST 1990 Appendix A: Living Alone Allowances Appendix B:Bloodstock Amendments Appendix C:"Test Period" Motor Vehicle Log Books Appendix D: Income Tax and Provisional Tax Changes Appendix E:Detailed Discussion of Land Tax Appendix F: Hybrid Accounting Basis for GST 2 Section 5 amends section 86H(2) of the Act by inserting a new paragraph (a) in the specified write- down provision. This new paragraph allows a write- down to commence in the income year that the bloodstock is 2 years of age or older and is- i)First used for breeding by that taxpayer in the business of breeding bloodstock; or ii)Purchased by the taxpayer with the intention of being used for breeding in the business of breed- ing bloodstock; or iii) Owned in the conduct of breeding bloodstock and the taxpayer has the intention of using that bloodstock for breeding. This subparagraph provides for the case where a breeder owns bloodstock not intended for breeding but subse- quently decides to breed from that livestock. This expanded paragraph will allow a taxpayer who purchases bloodstock at any time up to the end of the income year to write-down that livestock if it is used or intended to be used for breeding. These amendents apply from the income year com- mencing on 1 April 1991 and for every subsequent year. Section 6 of the Act amends section 106(1)(n) to expand the circumstances under which a taxpayer may deduct expenditure incurred in relation to the racing of bloodstock. The section is further amended to clarify the tax treatment relating to expenditure incurred by horse trainers in training a horse for racing. Paragraph (n) now disallows deduction for any expenditure or loss incurred in preparing any blood- stock for racing, except where:- a)A bloodstock breeder prepares that bloodstock for sale and the breeder does not race that bloodstock. It effectively provides that the ex- penses incurred in training a horse for a “ready to race” sale are deductible. The provision makes it clear that expenses incurred in racing a horse as part of the training for a “ready to race” sale are not deductible. b)A taxpayer in exchange for consideration under- takes the training of a horse on behalf of another APPENDIX A TO TIB VOLUME TWO, NO. 2, AUGUST 1990 LIVING ALONE PAYMENTS Sec 2, 4, and 14 - 22, Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1990 The following sections specify the tax treatment of Living Alone payments to be paid to GRI Earners by Social Welfare from 26 September 1990 - Section 2 of the Amendment Act amends section 2 of the principal Act to insert a definition of the term “living alone payment”: "A living alone payment means a living alone payment paid or payable under section 18A of the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1990." Section 4 of the Amendment Act amends section 65(2) of the principal Act to insert another paragraph (db) which includes living alone payments within the meaning of assessable income. Sections 14 to 22 of the Amendment Act make a number of consequential amendments to sections 336A to 336L of the principal Act, which deal with the Guaranteed Retirement Income Earner Sur- charge. Section 25 of the Amendment Act makes a conse- quential amendment to the definition of residual income tax in sec 375 of the principal Act. Residual income tax is the tax liability remaining after deduct- ing all tax credits, source deduction payments and resident withholding tax. The living alone payment is included in the list of deductions from the taxpay- ers total tax liability in order to determine residual income tax. APPENDIX B TO TIB VOLUME TWO, NO. 2, AUGUST 1990 DETAILED DISCUSSION OF BLOODSTOCK AMENDMENTS Sec 5 and 6, Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1990 3 taxpayer. The provision is effectively limited to horse trainer’s as the consideration for the train- ing must be assessable for a deduction to be allowed. This amendment clarifies the legisla- tion to ensure that taxpayers who train horses on behalf of another taxpayer may deduct their expenditure. Bloodstock Amendments Cont'd The paragraph still denies any deduction for any expenditure or loss to the extent it was incurred in racing any bloodstock or related to the racing of any bloodstock. The section has an application date of the income year commencing on the 1st day of April 1991. APPENDIX C TO TIB VOLUME TWO, NO. 2, AUGUST 1990 MOTOR VEHICLE LOG BOOKS Sec 106B - 106E, Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1990 A detailed policy statement on this matter will be issued at a later date and will incorporate examples. This item only outlines the broad legislative require- ments in relation to record keeping and application of the Commissioner’s discretion in specific circum- stances. Section 7 repeals the existing section 106B and in- serts new sections 106B to section 106E the provi- sions of which are summarised as follows: Section 106B - Deductions for Motor Vehicle Expenses Subsection (1) provides that no expenditure shall be deductible, or depreciation allowable, except to the extent that the deduction or allowance qualifies in terms of this section. Subsection (2) ensures that sections 104 and 108 may still apply where a motor vehicle is used solely for the gaining or producing of assessable income or the use of it constitutes a fringe benefit. The section does not apply to any person who is a company or who derives income solely from employment. Subsection (3) provides that where a motor vehicle is used by a taxpayer partly for business purposes and partly for other purposes the taxpayer may deduct expenditure and shall be allowed deprecia- tion in proportion to the business use of the motor vehicle . Subsection (4) provides the following definitions: “Business purposes” or “business use” is defined to mean travel undertaken wholly and exclu- sively in the gaining or producing of the assess- able income of the taxpayer. “Motor Vehicle” means a road vehicle (other than a trailer) of the kind ordinarily used for the carriage of persons or the transport or delivery of goods or animals. Subsection (5) provides that sections 106C to 106E will also cover taxpayers who have an annual bal- ance date other than 31 March. Section 106C - Use of Actual records to establish business use proportion of motor vehicle Subsection (1) provides that a taxpayer may choose to maintain complete and accurate details for a period rather than keep a log book as provided for under section 106D. The Commissioner may specify the keeping of further details. These records may be used to determine the propor- tion of the travel of the motor vehicle relating to business travel for that period. This is likely to occur where a taxpayer maintains records for other purposes such as the allocation of the motor vehicles costs between different jobs. Subsection (2) provides that the section does not apply to the extent the records are maintained dur- ing a log book application period unless the Com- missioner approves otherwise. This provision is to cover situations where the use of the vehicle is not representative of average use. e.g. holiday period etc. Conversely a dramatic but nevertheless tempo- rary unforeseen increase in business use. In that event the records kept for that unforeseen period may be used, subject to the agreement of the Com- missioner, for that unforeseen period rather than the proportion established under the log book. 4 The period ends on the earlier of: (i)The day on which the motor vehicle is sold or otherwise disposed of: (ii) A day specified by the taxpayer: The taxpayer may want to commence an- other period as the use of the motor vehicle is to change or align the logbook application period with another date such as a balance date. (iii) A day specified by the Commissioner: The Commissioner may end a logbook ap- plication period where the Commissioner has required the taxpayer to maintain a fur- ther log book and as a result of that further log book the Commissioner has decided that the first log book, while originally correct, has become unrepresentative. (iv) A day three years after the logbook application period commenced: Subsection (4) provides that where in any month comprising part of the logbook application period the business use proportion for that month drops by 20 percentage points or more compared with the log book business proportion and it is established that the log book business use proportion no longer fairly represents the use of the motor vehicle then the logbook application period ceases on the last day of that month. This subsection will not apply where the use of the motor vehicle changes significantly but that change in use is of a short duration. Further in cases where the change in use is of a longer duration the taxpayer may choose to keep supplementary records to deter- mine the proportion of business use for that dura- tion. A new log book would be required where the log book is not representative for an income year or part of an income year. Subsection (5) caters for taxpayers who have a rapid turnover of motor vehicles, where for example mo- tor vehicles are car-pooled or simply where a car is replaced during a logbook application period. Where a taxpayer- (i)Replaces a motor vehicle with another motor vehicle and the log book kept in relation to the first motor vehicle is likely to be representative of the use for the replacement motor vehicle during the remainder of the logbook applica- tion period;and Motor Vehicle Log Books Cont'd Section 106D - Use of Logbook to Estab- lish Business Use Proportion of Motor Vehicle Subsection (1) provides that where a taxpayer has maintained a log book along the lines provided for in section 106C and a record of the total distance travelled during an income year or part of an income year those details so kept shall be used to calculate the proportion of business use of that motor vehicle during the income year or part income year. Subsection (2) requires a taxpayer maintain a log book covering a period of not less than 90 days commencing on a day elected by the taxpayer. The log book must be kept for a period that represents or is likely to represent the average travel for business purposes and nonbusiness purposes. In other words it should be maintained for a period where the motor vehicle is expected to receive average use. If the period is not of average use the taxpayer must choose a further 90 day period or keep full and complete records. The log book must record complete and accurate details of the reasons for and the distance of journeys undertaken for business purposes. The Commis- sioner may require taxpayers to keep additional details. The log book must also record the total distance travelled during the period the log book is main- tained. As a result any journey not recorded in the log book automatically becomes a private journey, however, this provision also removes the need for the taxpayer to record the details of all private journeys. Subsection (3) provides for the “logbook applica- tion period”, the application of which commences on the latter of- (i)The first day of the income year commencing on the 1st day of April 1991: (ii) The first day of the income year in which the taxpayer commences to keep a log book: (iii) The day on which the motor vehicle was pur- chased (not being a replacement motor vehicle): (iv) The day following the day the last application period ended: (v) A day specified by the taxpayer: 5 Motor Vehicle Log Books Cont'd (ii) The taxpayer keeps a record of the total distance travelled by the replacement motor vehicle dur- ing each income year or part income year to which the log book relates then that replacement motor vehicle is treated as if it were the original motor vehicle. Subsection (6) provides specific powers to the Com- missioner in relation to a logbook with which the Commissioner is not satisfied. During a logbook application period the Commissioner may require the taxpayer maintain a further logbook. After the end of an application period the Commissioner may deem that taxpayer to not have maintained a log- book. In this case the taxpayer will be limited to a maximum proportion of business use of 25% or such lesser amounts the available records support. Subsection (7) sets out the Commissioner’s powers in relation to an application period where the Com- missioner has required the taxpayer to maintain a further log book and the business use in that further log book is 20 percentage points less than that calcu- lated in the first log book. APPENDIX D TO TIB VOLUME TWO, NO. 2, AUGUST 1990 INCOME TAX PAYMENT AND PROVISIONAL TAX CHANGES Sec 24 - 31, Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1990 The following sections govern the changes to pay- ment of income tax and provisional tax made in the 1990 Budget. Section 24 amends section 361 of the Act by replac- ing subsection (2) to change the terminal tax due date for taxpayers with non-provisional income from 7 February to 20 November. If such taxpayers have a balance date other than 31 March, the due date will be the eighth month after balance date. Section 25 amends section 375 of the Act by inserting a new definition of provisional taxpayer. From the 1991/92 income year, provisional taxpayers will be persons with residual income tax for the year of greater than $2,500. Section 26 amends section 377 of the Act by inserting a new subsection (2) with effect from the 1991/92 income year. This relieves provisional taxpayers from having to make payments of provisional tax during the income year if their residual income tax for the previous year was $2,500 or less. Section 27 replaces subsection (2) and inserts a new subsection (5A). Subsection (2) sets the threshold for compulsory estimation at the third instalment. Subsection (5A) applies from budget night. It re- quires that any estimate of provisional tax shall be a fair and reasonable estimate. Section 28 replaces subsection (2) in section 388 of the Act. Subsection (2) sets the terminal tax due dates for provisional taxpayers. From the 1991/92 income year provisional taxpayers who do not have to make payments of provisional tax, i.e., persons whose residual income tax for the previous year was under $2,500, are also having their terminal tax due date moved forward to 20 November (or the Eighth month after balance date for persons with nonstan- dard balance dates). Where the Commissioner considers that the first logbook was representative but became unrepresen- tative the Commissioner can determine a day on which the logbook application period in relation to that first log book ceased. The further logbook shall apply to a new logbook application period com- mencing the day after the first period ceased. Where the Commissioner considers that the first logbook was always unrepresentative the Commis- sioner can direct that the further logbook shall apply instead. Section 106E: Business Use Proportion of Motor Vehicle where no Log Book Kept Where, in respect of any period, a taxpayer has not maintained a logbook or full and complete records the business use proportion applied in section 106B shall be limited to the lesser of actual business use or 25 percent of total use, whichever is less. The propor- tion of actual business use is determined based on records available. It follows that there are no records no deduction will be allowed. 6 be reached, before natural persons not making an estimate of provisional tax are liable to pay use of money interest, has been changed from $100,000 of provisional income to $30,000 of residual income tax, with effect from the 1991/92 income year. Section 31 amends section 413A by replacing para- graph (a) of subsection (3). The threshold that has to be reached, before natural persons not making an estimate of provisional tax are eligible for use of money interest, has been changed from $100,000 of provisional income to $30,000 of residual income tax, with effect from the 1991/92 income year. Income Tax and Provisional Tax Cont'd Section 29 replaces subsection (2) of section 395 of the Act. This subsection sets the terminal tax due dates for tax not otherwise due and payable under any other section of the Act. In line with the other amendments being made, natural persons have had their terminal tax due date for the 1991/92 income year brought forward to 20 November (or equiva- lent). Section 30 amends section 398A by replacing para- graph (a) of subsection (3). The threshold that has to Section 1 Annual Act Provisions Section 2 repeals the existing schedule in the Land Tax Act and substitutes a new schedule containing the 0.5 cents in the dollar rate to apply from 1 April 1991. Section 3 then confirms that land tax shall be im- posed, levied, and paid at the rate specified in the new schedule from 1 April 1991. These sections came into force on 8August 1990. Abolition of Land Tax Act 1976 Section 4 repeals the Land Tax Act with effect from 31 March 1992. Various other Acts are consequen- tially amended by removing references to Land Tax. The sections in the Income Tax Act 1976 which refer to Land Tax have not been consequentially amended in this Act, but will be corrected prior to 31 March 1992. The consequential amendments are being de- layed because they could be rendered incorrect by other income tax amendments enacted prior to 31 March 1992. Section 5 is a saving provision which ensures that land tax imposed and levied prior to 31 March 1992 is still due and payable by the taxpayer. APPENDIX F TO TIB VOLUME TWO, NO. 2, AUGUST 1990 HYBRID ACCOUNTING BASIS FOR GST The adjustments that are required when a registered person changes to or from the hybrid basis are as follows: (i) HYBRID/INVOICE Invoice to Hybrid Where the change is from an invoice basis to a hybrid basis input tax will be claimed on a pay- ments basis, with output tax continuing to be returned on an invoice basis. An adjustment is required to avoid a double deduction when pay- ment is eventually made to any creditors that the registered person had at the end of the last tax- able period on an invoice basis and for which an input tax credit has already been claimed. The registered person is required to: 1 Identify all creditors (from whom a tax in- voice has been received for the supply and in respect of which an input tax credit has been claimed) of the taxable activity as at the last day of the taxable period in which the old accounting basis is used.

(ii) HYBRID/PAYMENTS Hybrid to Payments Where the change is from a hybrid basis to a payments basis output tax will change from the invoice basis to the payments basis and input tax will continue to be claimed on the payments basis. The output tax brought into account on all debtors at the time invoices were issued must be reversed as output tax will be brought into ac- count in subsequent periods as payment is re- ceived for the supply. 1 Identify all debtors (to whom a tax invoice has been issued for the supply) of the taxable activity as at the last day of the taxable period in which the old accounting basis is used. 2 Identify those debtors relating to supplies that have a time of supply determined under section 9(1), \[“ordinary” supplies\]; 9(3)(a), \[goods supplied under an agreement to hire or services supplied under an agreement or enactment which provides for periodic pay- ments\]; 9(3)(aa), \[progressive supplies and buildings and civil engineering works\]; or 9(6), \[supplies where the consideration is not determined at the time goods taken\]. No ad- justment is required in respect of supplies which have any other time of supply rules. 3 Apply the tax fraction to the amount deter- mined under number 2. 4 Include the amount calculated under number 3 as an adjustment to input tax. Payments to Hybrid In the reverse situation, i.e., where the change is from a payments to a hybrid basis output tax will change from the payments basis to the invoice basis and input tax will continue to be claimed on the payments basis. An adjustment is required to bring into account the registered person’s debt- ors at the time of the change that would not otherwise be brought into account. The registered person is required to: 1 Identify all debtors (to whom a tax invoice has been issued for the supply) of the taxable activity as at the last day of the taxable period in which the old accounting basis is used. 2 Identify those debtors relating to supplies Hybrid GST Method Cont'd 2 Identify those creditors relating to supplies that have a time of supply determined under section 9(1), \[“ordinary” supplies\]; 9(3)(a), \[goods supplied under an agreement to hire or services supplied under an agreement or enactment which provides for periodic pay- ments\]; 9(3)(aa), \[progressive supplies and buildings and civil engineering works\]; or 9(6), \[supplies where the consideration is not determined at the time goods taken\].

Hybrid to Invoice In the reverse situation, i.e., where the change is from a hybrid basis to an invoice basis, input tax will change from the payments basis to the in- voice basis and output tax will continue to be returned on the invoice basis. An adjustment will be required as the registered person will make claims following the end of the last taxable period on the hybrid basis as invoices are received rather than when payment is made. Without this adjust- ment a registered person would be denied an input credit for any amount where an invoice had been received before the changeover but where payment was actually made after the change in accounting basis. The registered person is required to: 1 Identify all creditors (from whom a tax in- voice has been received for the supply) of the taxable activity as at the last day of the taxable period in which the old accounting basis is used. 2 Identify those creditors relating to supplies that have a time of supply determined under section 9(1), \[“ordinary” supplies\]; 9(3)(a), \[goods supplied under an agreement to hire or services supplied under an agreement or enactment which provides for periodic pay- ments\]; 9(3)(aa), \[progressive supplies and buildings and civil engineering works\]; or 9(6), \[supplies where the consideration is not determined at the time goods taken\].

Consequential changes have been made to sec- tion 20 to allow registered persons to calculate their liability on the hybrid accounting basis. Consequential changes have also been made to sections 78B and 78C to require a registered person on the hybrid basis to make adjustments in the event of a further rate change. These are: Section 78B (ADJUSTMENT FOR PER- SONS USING PAYMENTS BASIS FOLLOWING A CHANGE IN THE GST RATE) This section is extended to apply also to persons using the hybrid accounting basis following a rate change.

Introduction This item has been prepared in light of the recent High Court decision in State Insurance Office v CIR. It raises questions on the assessability of share exchanges in relation to the Department’s policy on the taxation of profits from selling shares by insurance companies. Issues There were three main issues in the case for consideration by Judge Heron, they were; (1) Whether pursuant to section 65(2)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1976 State’s assessable in- come included profits from any business be- ing such profits or gains from share exchanges, including those where a cash element was involved. (2) If the gains are income, whether there has been a realisation of the gain by reason of the share exchanges. (3) If the gains are taxable, whether the shares are trading stock. Decision First Issue Judge Heron concluded that whilst there is a nexus between the income generated by the shares and the operation of State’s business, there is no nexus between the realisations which occurred and the method of operation of the business. He considered the realisations which did take place to be “sporadic isolated transac- tions”. He said that while sale of the shares had some connection with the business because the income fell into the cash flow there was no nexus between those sales and the method of operation of the business. His final statement on the issue says that the gains were made without the intention of meet- ing the needs of the “insurance” business or the desire to realise or vary any investment, and to that extent they were at least not motivated by business considerations. He sees State as an unusual case with quite unique considerations. Second Issue Judge Heron found that because section 65(2)(a) speaks of gains “derived”, it must be construed as meaning realised. Third Issue Judge Heron cited the case of Anson v Commis- sioner of Taxes \[1922\] NZLR 330, where it was held that the test is “whether an asset has been procured for the purpose of being sold at a profit”. He found that the dominant purpose of State’s acquisition of the shares was to hold, not sell. Comment Judge Heron’s decision turns to a large degree on his findings of fact, such as the finding that State is unique in the way it operates its busi- ness. Ultimately, the matter has been decided on the basis of the unique capital structure and methods of business adopted by State. He also points to the distinctions between State’s case and the case of other insurance companies. It therefore does not change the Department’s policy in relation to the taxation of profits from the sale of shares by insurance companies. 3 CASINO CONTROL ACT 1990 Amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Summary This item explains the amendments contained in the Casino Control Act 1990 which amend the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to provide the GST treatment for gaming conducted within a casino. Introduction The Casino Control Act 1990 provides for the licensing, supervision, and control of casinos. It also contains amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to provide the GST treat- ment of gaming activities conducted within a casino. This treatment reflects the recommendations of the Committee of Enquiry into the Establish- ment of Casinos in NZ in that GST will apply to the casino’s “win”. The treatment is consistent with that afforded to other forms of gaming such as games of chance and lotteries conducted in terms of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977. These amendments to the GST Act will have no application until casinos become operational and commence to make supplies in respect of their gaming activities. The Casino Control Act comes into force on the 2nd of August 1990. GST Amendments Section 5 of the GST Act, which deals with the meaning of supply, is amended by the insertion of two new subsections. The amendment deems AIRPORT OPERATORS Depreciation on Concrete Pavements Effective from 1 April 1988, the taxation treatment of concrete pavements is as follows: 1. Depreciation will be allowed on concrete airport pavements at the rate of 4 percent cost price. 2. In the case of demolition , prior to the end of the pavements useful life, the unallocated cost be allowed as an additional allowance in the year of demolition. The unallocated cost must be reduced to the extent runways, taxi ways, apron areas, airstrips and other pavement areas are not demolished. 3. No special treatment is available for expendi- ture incurred on the pavements, other than what is permitted in accordance with Section 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976. Note: This treatment applies only to concrete pavements and not to asphalt pavements. a supply of services to occur where a person pays money to purchase a chip or otherwise to participate in a game played or conducted in a casino. This deemed supply is made by the holder of the casino licence. Section 9 of the GST Act, which sets out the time of supply rules, is amended by the insertion of a new time of supply rule in respect of the deemed supply described above. The new time of sup- ply rule deems the supply to occur at the time a “casino count” occurs. A “casino count” is a defined term and means a count of money or money’s worth paid for the right to participate in gaming. Such counts will occur on a regular basis in terms of the conditions that will be attached to a casino licence. Section 10 of the GST Act, which determines the value of a supply, is amended by the insertion of two new subsections. The amendment deems the value of the supply to be the amount of money paid by persons to purchase chips or otherwise to participate in games less the amount of money paid out in winnings by the casino in respect of those games. The amount paid to participate in a game is GST inclusive. These amendments only provide the GST treat- ment for gaming activities played or conducted within a casino. In respect of other goods and services supplied by a casino the normal GST provisions of the GST Act will apply. Reference: LA GST 1990Leg. Vol. 4 TRANSIT NEW ZEALAND ACT 1989 Consequential Amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Summary This item explains the consequential amendments to the GST Act 1985 contained in the Transit New Zealand Act 1989. Introduction The Transit New Zealand Act 1989 was enacted to: (a) Constitute Transit New Zealand as a central land transport authority; and (b) Provide the framework for the planning, funding, and development of New Zealand’s land trans- port system. It also provided the mechanism for the dissolution of the National Roads Board, the National Roads Fund, and the Urban Transport Council. This Act came into force on 1 October 1989. This reform of the land transport system has a bear- ing on a number of provisions in the GST Act 1985. Accordingly, the GST Act 1985 was consequentially amended via the Fourth Schedule to the Transit New Zealand Act 1989 to reflect these changes. GST Amendments The Transit New Zealand Act provides for the estab- lishment within the Crown Bank Account for a fund to be known as the Land Transport Fund to which the following revenue will be credited: (a) A portion of all excise duty collected in respect of motor spirits; (b) All fees and charges collected under the Road User Charges Act 1977; (c) All fees and charges collected under Part I of the Transport (Vehicle and Driver Registration and Licensing) Act 1986; and (d) Other amounts as specified by section 8 of the Transit New Zealand Act. Unlike the National Roads Fund, the Land Transport Fund will not be deemed to be supplying goods and services in respect of the receipt of some of these payments and therefore will not be registered for GST purposes. The revenue accumulated in this fund will be appropriated to Transit New Zealand and the Ministry of Transport to meet budgeted costs in respect of certain output programs. Both Transit New Zealand and the Ministry of Transport are registered for GST purposes and will be required to account for GST on this payment from the Crown. A number of consequential changes have been made to the GST Act 1985 following the dissolution of the National Roads Fund. Those changes are: Section 5(6A): The provision has been amended to explicitly provide that the taxable activity is carried on by the person who collects those fees. For ex- ample, if NZ Post collects these fees it will be required to account for the GST on the supply and issue tax invoices as it is deemed to be carrying on the taxable activity. Previously, the GST Act did not indicate the supplier of those services. The reason for not explic- itly identifying the collector of these fees in the legislation, was to recognise that the person collect- ing these fees may change from time to time. Section 5(6B): Road user charges are deemed to be consideration for a supply of services in course or furtherance of a taxable activity by the person who collects those fees. Section 5(13A): A refund of excise duty paid out of the Land Transport Fund to a registered person, where the excise duty paid by the registered person was incurred for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, is deemed to be consideration for a supply of services in the course of that registered person’s taxable activity. This provision only applies in respect of excise duty on motor spirits. Section 11(3): This section is no longer required and has been repealed. Dissolution of the National Roads Board and the Urban Transport Council The Transit New Zealand Act 1989 also provides for all the real and personal property belonging to or vested in these two bodies to vest in Transit New Zealand. The vesting of these goods in Transit New Zealand is a taxable supply made in the course of the termination of the taxable activities carried on by the National Roads Board and Urban Transport Council. However, as no consideration is being paid for the supply, there are no GST implications in regard to accounting for output tax and input tax on this supply. Reference: LA GST-1989-Leg. Vol. 5 GST TREATMENT OF EXPENDITURE BY EMPLOYEES IN THE COURSE OF THEIR EMPLOYER’S BUSINESS Introduction There are many circumstances where employ- ees will incur expenditure in the course of their employment. Employers may wish to reim- burse employees for such expenditure. Employ- ers may pay for such expenditure by employees in various ways, such as the payment of allow- ances or the reimbursement of actual expendi- ture. As registered persons, employers will want to claim input tax credits arising from such expenditure. The purpose of this item is to set out the circumstances under which this may be done. Background For a registered person to be able to claim an input tax credit under section 20 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the Act) the supply to which the particular input tax credit relates must have been made to the particular person claim- ing the input tax credit. The United Kingdom VAT tribunal decisions have determined that a supply is only made to a person if the person is in a contractual relationship with the supplier. This approach may limit the circumstances in which employers can claim input tax credits for expenditure incurred by employees. Thus, where employees contract in their own right to receive supplies, the tax paid on the supplies cannot be claimed as input tax credits by employers, not- withstanding that the expenditure may have been in the course of the employer’s business and that the employers may have reimbursed the employees for actual expenditure. It is the Department’s view that the application of the decided UK cases in this context is limited. It was always the intention of the legislation and the practice of the Department to allow employ- ers, who are registered persons, to be able to claim input tax credits for expenditure initially incurred by employees and reimbursed by em- ployers where the expenditure was incurred in the course of the employer’s business. Ruling Reimbursement of Actual Expenditure Where expenditure is incurred by an employee in the course of the employer’s business, and the actual expenditure is reimbursed by the employer, the em- ployer is entitled to claim an input tax credit. Whether or not the expenditure is incurred by the employee in the course of the employer’s business is a question of fact. Examples are the reimbursement of transport costs (taxi fares) and accommodation costs (hotels). It is also confirmed that expenditure incurred on residential telephone rentals of an employee may be expenditure in the course of the employer’s business if the private phone is used for business purposes. Further, subscriptions to professional associations- the New Zealand Law Society or the New Zealand Society of Accountants for example, may be expendi- ture in the course of the employer’s business. In such situations employers will be able to claim input tax credits for such expenditure, where it is shown that the membership to the society relates to the employ- ment of the particular employee. Payment of Allowances Where actual expenditure is not reimbursed and/or an allowance is paid by the employer to the em- ployee, an input tax credit will not be allowed as: no GST is incurred by the employer if there is no reimbursement; or there is insufficient connection between the pay- ment made by the employer and the expendi- ture incurred by the employee if reimburse- ment is by way of allowance. Tax Invoices Where employers seek to claim input tax credits for expenditure incurred by employees in the course of the employer’s business, the invoicing requirements of section 24 must be met. Employers must be in receipt of valid tax invoices before input credits will be allowed. Reference: H.O. GST A.5.1 6 USE OF CREDIT CARD SALES VOUCHERS AS TAX INVOICES FOR GST A credit card sales voucher is acceptable as a tax invoice only when the requirements of section 24 of the Goods and Services Tax Act (1985) (the Act) are complied with. Some credit card companies have requested approval of their sales vouchers as tax invoices. Further, the credit card companies have re- quested, and been granted, a dispensation un- der section 24(6) of the Act. This dispensation precludes the need for the address of the recipi- ent to be shown on invoices where the supply exceeds $100 in value ($200 from 1 October 1990). The following credit cards have had Head Office approval for use of their vouchers as tax invoices and have been granted dispensation relating to the recipient’s address on a full tax invoice: Diners Club American Express BNZ Visa National Bank Visa Auckland Savings Bank Visa Trustee Bank Visa Westpac Mastercard/Bankcard. Reference H.O. T.4.2.1 PRIZES WON IN COMPETITIONS RUN BY BANKS AND OTHERS Introduction Inland Revenue has recently looked at the in- come tax assessability of prizes offered by banks to selected account holders. Background With the changes to the definitions in the Income Tax Act 1976 of “interest” and “money lent” there has been uncertainty as to whether prizes won by account holders were assessable income. Were the prizes “payment in respect of or in relation to money lent”? Industry representa- tives argued that the account holders only re- ceived a right to participate in the competition. The prizes related to that right and not to the money lent and held in the depositors’ accounts. Ruling The Department’s policy in respect of prizes won in competitions linked to the holding of a bank (or similar) account is: (a) Where an account holder receives a right to take part in a competition any prize received is in relation to the competition and not the money lent. The prize does not constitute assessable income to the account holder. (b) The right to take part in the competitions received by the account holder is in relation to the money lent. The value of that right is assessable income to the account holder. (c) Where the value of the right is of negligible monetary value the Department would not seek to pursue the income tax owing in re- spect of that right. The value of the right to participate in a compe- tition is determined by reference to the chance of winning a prize. The greater the chance of winning, the greater the value of the right to participate. In most cases the value of the right is small and no action is required to include that value as assessable income. Where the value is more than nominal the De- partment would seek to treat the value as assess- able income to the taxpayer/account holder. Each competition must be looked at individu- ally. H.O. Reference: 10.I.6.8 7 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX - PRESCRIBED RATE OF INTEREST The Minister of Revenue, Peter Neilson, has confirmed that the prescribed rate of interest used to calculate the fringe benefit of low interest employment related loans will continue at 14.8 percent for the quarter commencing 1 October 1990.

SHORT TITLE - Section 1 This Act can be cited as the Income Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1990, and shall be read as part of the Income Tax Act 1976. The provisions of this section shall come into force on the day on which this Act received the Royal Assent (1 August 1990). 2. INTERPRETATION - Section 2 Subsection (1) adjusts the definition of a “company” to preclude any arguments that a port company or a local authority trading enterprise is a local authority and therefore is not a company for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. Section 2 also includes a definition of “life insur- ance” to which the new taxation regime for life insurers contained in the Bill will apply. Subsections (3) and (5) tidy up the legislation in relation to the definition of “major shareholder”. Subsection (3) inserts the definition of the term “major shareholder” in section (2) of the principal Act. Subsection (5) consequentially repeals the sec- tion 374E(1) definition and corrects all the other references to a major shareholder. These amend- ments are purely to simplify the legislation and have no substantive impact. Subsection (6) consequential- ly repeals the section 52 of the Income Tax Amend- ment Act (No.5) 1988 which inserted the definition of “major shareholder” into the Act originally. Subsection (4) corrects a minor drafting error in the definition of pay period taxpayer in section 2 of the principal Act. It incorrectly referred to section 356(1) of the Act instead of section 356(2). Subsection (7) provides the application date for subsection (1) of this section. The exclusion of local authorities from the definition of company applies for the income year commencing on 1 April 1989 and some subsequent income years. Some local author- ity trading enterprises were formed during the 1989/ 1990 income year. The exclusion of public authori- ties applies for the income year commencing on 1 April 1990, and subsequent income years. 3. DEFINITION OF TERM DIVIDEND - Section 3 Corrects a minor drafting error by inserting words which were incorrectly omitted. 4. COMMISSIONER TO MAKE ASSESS- MENTS, DETERMINATIONS OF LOSS, AND OTHER DETERMINA- TIONS - Section 4 The Act makes provision to ensure that determi- nations of tax credits by the Commissioner take account of the new provisions which have credits relating to life insurers. 5. REBATE FOR SAVINGS IN SPECIAL FARM, FISHING VESSEL, AND HOME OWNERSHIP ACCOUNTS - Section 5 Changes are made to ensure that special savings account holders are not adversely affected by the introduction of resident withholding tax on interest. An adjustment is made in the calculation of the rebate allowed in respect of a special saving account to take account of the amount of resident withhold- ing tax deducted. 6. REBATE IN RESPECT OF GIFTS OF MONEY AND SCHOOL FEES - Sec 6 Section 56A(2) of the principal Act is amended by adding the following charitable organisations to the list of organisations having donee status- a) “Water for Survival”; and b) “International Christian Aid (ICA)”; and c) “Christian Children’s Fund of New Zealand Ltd.” Taxpayers will therefore be able to claim the rebates in section 56A and section 140 in respect of donations made to Water for Survival, International Christian Aid, and the Christian Children’s Fund of New Zealand from the 1990/91 income year. 2 7. INCOMES WHOLLY EXEMPT FROM TAX - Section 7 The tax exemption for annuities paid in respect of a life insurance policy is amended to ensure that it is consistent with the scope of the new life insurance taxation regime. Annuities which relate to policies offered or entered into in New Zealand are exempt from tax, together with policies offered and entered into outside New Zealand but issued by a New Zealand resident life insurer. 8. EXEMPTION OF DIVIDENDS FROM TAX - Section 8 As life insurance companies are to be taxed in a manner similar to other taxpayers, they are now eligible for the exemption from taxation provided at section 63 of the Income Tax Act for dividends received from other companies. As a result subsec- tion (1) repeals paragraph (a) of section 63(3).This subsection applies from the income year commenc- ing on 1 April 1990 and for every subsequent income year. Subsection (2) confirms that the inter-corporate divi- dend exemption does not apply to dividends de- rived by a local authority from a local authority trading enterprise. This subsection applies from the income year commencing on 1 April 1989 and for every subsequent income year. 9. INTERPRETATION - ACCRUALS - Section 9 This section amends the definition of a specified option, so that all property transactions under the accruals regime reflect only the implied interest of the transaction rather than the capital gain of the underlying asset. In addition, annuities except those subject to the new life insurance taxation regime, are now subject to the provisions of the accruals regime. 10. NEW START GRANTS FOR FARMERS - Section 10 Section 64FB of the principal Act is amended by providing that the drought conditions that occurred during the years 1988 and 1989 which affected parts of the East Coast qualify as an adverse event for the purposes of the section. The land affected must be designated by either the Minister of Agriculture as an adverse climatic area or by a local appeals committee as being subject to an adverse climatic event area. This section applies from the income year commenc- ing 1 April 1990. 11. LOSSES INCURRED MAY BE SET OFF AGAINST FUTURE PROFITS - Sect 11 The loss-carry forward provisions were amended to ensure that local authority trading enterprises (LATEs) were not disadvantaged. In certain circum- stances companies are required to satisfy a 40% common shareholding test in order to offset losses against future income. For the purposes of this test it is necessary to “look through” any interposed com- pany structures and allocate shares owned by com- panies to the eventual shareholders. Difficulties arose because a portion of shares in a LATE are owned by a local authority. As local authorities do not have shareholders, it is impossible to “look-through” the local authority. Therefore a LATE could not satisfy the requirements of section 188 of the income Tax Act 1976. Section 11 of the amendment removes this requirement to “look through” interposed companies where those com- panies do not have the liability of their members limited by a memorandum of association. 12. EXCESSIVE REMUNERATION BY PROPRIETARY COMPANY TO SHAREHOLDER, DIRECTOR, OR RELATIVE - Section 12 This section corrected a minor drafting error with application from the date the drafting error first applied. 13. BUSINESS OF LIFE INSURANCE - Sec- tion 13 and 14 The Bill repeals the old section 204 which provided for the taxation of life insurance companies and substitutes new provisions in sections 204 to 205F which provide for a comprehensive taxation regime for all life insurers. Briefly, the regime is based on the report of the Consultative Committee on Superannuation, Life Insurance and Related Areas (the Brash Commit- tee). It provides for a comprehensive tax base for life insurers for their income received in their capacity as insurers which includes underwriting income to- gether with all other income received, less any ex- penses incurred in deriving its income. In addition, the regime provides for the taxation of life insurers as a proxy for policyholders for distributions made to policyholders. 3 The provisions of the new life insurance taxation regime are discussed in greater detail in appendix C to this TIB. 14 SEPARATION OF LIFE INSURER’S SUPERANNUATION BUSINESS - Section 14 As part of the implementation of the new life insur- ance regime, the Consultative Committee recom- mended that life insurers should be permitted to separate their superannuation business from their life insurance business. This is achieved through a transfer of the superannuation business to a super- annuation fund provided the approval of the Gov- ernment Actuary has been obtained. The Bill inserts a new section 206 which provides for the taxation of assets held by a superannuation fund which were transferred pursuant to an approved arrangement. This provision is discussed in more depth together with the new life insurance taxation provisions in Appendix C to this TIB. 15. NEW SECTION INSERTED - PETRO- LEUM MINING - Section 15 and 16 The new regime commences on 1 October 1990. Central to it is the concept of petroleum mining development expenditure. Petroleum Mining Development Expenditure Petroleum mining development expenditure means any expenditure which is incurred after the submis- sion of an application for a prospecting licence for the purpose of: Obtaining or evaluating any prospecting infor- mation by way of geophysical prospecting, re- gional reconnaissance surveys, drilling of explo- ration wells, or in any other way related to pros- pecting and exploring for petroleum, and Planning, drilling, testing or abandoning explora- tory wells, and Acquiring any asset, for the purpose of petro- leum mining, which has an estimated useful life that is dependent on, and no longer than the unexpired portion of the relevant mining licence (licence specific asset). Generally petroleum mining development expendi- ture is capitalised and spread over a 10 year period with deductions commencing in the later of: The first year of commercial production, or The income year in which the expenditure was incurred. Specific provisions which allow an earlier write-off of this expenditure are discussed below. Other Expenditure All other expenditure is dealt with under normal tax rules. The effect is that: Administrative overheads which do not relate to a specific mining licence can be deducted as incurred. Expenditure on scientific research, other than capital expenditure, can be deducted as incurred. Note that expenditure on prospecting and explo- ration activities is considered not to qualify as scientific research. Interest or other expenditure incurred in respect of a financial arrangement will continue to be deductible in terms of the accruals rules in the Tax Act. Assets, other than licence specific assets, can be depreciated in the normal way. The cost of land is not deductible under any circumstances. Early Write-off of Petroleum Mining Develop- ment Expenditure Early write-off can occur where: A petroleum mining licence is relinquished. Any undeducted petroleum mining development ex- penditure can be deducted immediately. If, as a result of those deductions, the petroleum miner incurs a tax loss in the year of relinquishment, that loss can be carried back and offset against assessable income derived in previous income years. Where: A dry exploratory well is sealed and aban- doned, and The petroleum miner completes a statutory declaration that it has no intention of: Utilising the exploratory well in petroleum mining activities, or Applying for a mining licence in respect of the area in which the well is located, the full costs of planning, drilling, testing and 4 abandoning the exploratory well can be written- off immediately. A clawback can apply if a mining licence is later granted for the area where the dry well is located. This is explained below. Where a licence, or share in a licence, or a licence specific asset is sold, any undeducted petroleum mining expenditure applicable to the licence or asset is offset against assessable income arising from the sale. Full details of the treatment of licence and asset sales are explained below. Clawback of Exploratory Well Expenditure Writ- ten-Off As explained above, exploratory well expenditure can be written-off where the well is found to be dry, and the miner files a declaration to the effect that it has no intention of utilising the well or of applying for a mining licence in respect of the area in which the exploratory well is located. If a mining licence is subsequently granted in respect of that licence area a clawback of the deductions claimed, plus an inter- est factor may apply. The clawback is an adjustment made to the assess- able income of any petroleum miner which currently owns a share in the petroleum licence (the subse- quent licence holder) and consists of the aggregate of 3 components: (1) The amount of exploratory well expenditure, relating to any dry exploratory or appraisal well located within the licence area over which the mining licence has been granted, which has been deducted by the subsequent licence holder in the year in which the licence was granted and in earlier income years, where that expenditure contributed to defining the scope, character, or size of the petroleum deposit subsequently lo- cated, multiplied by the following formula: b c Where b is the subsequent mining licence holder’s share in the licence at the time the mining licence is granted, and c is the subsequent mining licence holder’s share in the prospecting licence at the time the deductions were claimed. (Note, however, that b/c cannot be greater than one) (2) The amount of exploratory well expenditure, relating to any dry exploratory or appraisal well located within the licence area over which the mining licence has been granted, which has been deducted by any person associated with the sub- sequent licence holder in the year in which the licence was granted, to the extent that that licence share was transferred to the subsequent licence holder by the associated person, where that ex- penditure contributed to defining the scope, char- acter, or size of the petroleum deposit subse- quently located. (3) Interest at a specified rate, on the amounts deter- mined under components (1) and (2) above. The aggregate of the amounts calculated are deemed to be assessable income in the income year during which the subsequent mining licence is granted. The aggregate of components (1) and (2) is deemed to be petroleum mining development expenditure and is deductible over the 10 year period applying to such expenditure. Sales of Licences and Licence Specific Assets Consideration, defined as money and the market value of any assets received, but not excess expendi- ture - see under farm-out arrangements below, is assessable in all cases. Undeducted petroleum min- ing expenditure, applicable to the asset sold is al- lowed as a deduction in the year of sale. Consideration paid is treated as petroleum mining development expenditure incurred by the purchaser. Farm-out Arrangements A farm-out arrangement is defined as any arrange- ment under which a person (the farm-in party) agrees with a petroleum miner (farm-out party) to incur expenditure in return for a share in a petro- leum licence, where the share of expenditure to be incurred by the farm-in party is greater than the share of the licence transferred. The excess expendi- ture is referred to as excess outgoings. A farm-out arrangement is also considered to be a licence sale. Any consideration, but not excess expenditure, which forms part of a farm-out ar- rangement is assessable under the provisions relat- ing to sales. Special rules apply to excess outgoings. Excess outgoings are not assessable income to the farm-out party. However that party is required to reduce the amount of petroleum mining develop- ment expenditure available for future deductions by the lesser of: 5 quences of election or non-election with reference to periods before and after the date upon which an election is made or the election expiry date, respec- tively. The wording of the two subsections has been amended to clarify that a reference to a period after the date of election or the election expiry date is inclusive of those dates. This amendment is neces- sary to ensure that subsections (2) and (3) of section 226A are consistent with subsection (4) of the sec- tion. This amendment is effective from the 1st day of August 1990. 19. INCOME ASSESSABLE TO BENEFICIARIES - Section 19 This section amends subsection (2) of section 227. Section 227 sets out the circumstances in which a beneficiary of a trust is assessable to income tax. Section 227(2) provides that where a beneficiary is assessable to tax, the trustee of the trust is liable for that tax as an agent for the beneficiary. The wording of the section has been modified to ensure that a trustee bearing tax as agent for a beneficiary is both assessable and liable for the tax. This amendment is necessary to align the wording of the section with the other provisions of the Act and is to apply from the income year commencing on 1 April 1990. 20. TRUSTEE INCOME -Section 20 The Act inserts a new section 228(2C) to provide that where one superannuation fund is a member of another superannuation fund, certain administra- tion or marketing expenses incurred by member funds may be transferred to the other funds. This is to cover the situation where a member fund may earn no assessable income because all of its invest- ments are held by the ‘parent’ superannuation scheme and therefore expenses incurred by the member scheme may otherwise be non-deductible. 21. CALCULATION OF CONTROL INTEREST Section 245C(7) is amended to delete an incorrect reference to section 245B. The correct reference is section 245C(3). 22. PERSONS NOT REQUIRED TO CAL- CULATE ATTRIBUTED FOREIGN IN- COME AND LOSS - Section 22 This section corrects two drafting errors in section 245F of the principal Act which relate to the situ- The amount of the excess expenditure, An amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: a x c - b c Where: a is the amount of undeducted petroleum min- ing development expenditure, and b is the excess expenditure c is the sum of the excess expenditure and consideration paid by the farm-in party. That is the farmout party will lose the benefit of those deductions. Excess expenditure is deemed to be petroleum min- ing expenditure incurred by the farm-in party. Removal and Restoration Expenditure This type of expenditure refers to the costs of restor- ing mining sites after mining operations are com- pleted or abandoned. The previous treatment, whereby a petroleum miner who incurs a loss as a result of deducting removal and restoration expen- diture, could apply to have that expenditure offset against assessable income derived in previous in- come years, is continued. Maui The new regime does not apply to the Maui project. 17. INTERPRETATION TRUSTS - Sec 17 This section corrects a minor drafting error in sec- tion 226(4). Subsection (4) specifies the persons who are the settlors of a trust where the trust has been settled by a controlled foreign company. The amend- ment removes an incorrect reference to categories of control interest as listed in section 245C(3) and substitutes a reference to section 245C(4). 18. TRUSTS SETTLED BY PERSONS BEFORE BECOMING RESIDENT - Section 18 This section amends subsections 2(b) and 3(b) of section 226A. Section 226A provides the procedure for making an election to pay tax on the trustee income of trusts settled by New Zealand immi- grants. Subsections (2) and (3) contain the conse- 6 ations where persons are not required to calculate attributed foreign income or loss under the con- trolled foreign company regime. The first amendment makes a minor amendment by removing the words “be required to” from subsec- tion (1) of the section. The second amendment corrects the wording of the section to ensure that it applies to persons not resi- dent in New Zealand in terms of section 241 of the principal Act. The amendments are to apply from the 1st day of August 1990. 23. BRANCH EQUIVALENT INCOME CALCULATION - Section 23 The amendments to section 245J are of a minor nature to correct drafting oversights. The first amendment will ensure that subsections (3) and (16) of that section relate to all countries or territories outside New Zealand. This is consistent with the other provisions contained in Part IVA of the Income Tax Act. The second amendment is to remove the words “assumed to” in subsection (4) of section 245J. The words are inconsistent with the other provisions in section 245J of the Act. The amendments take effect from the 1st day of August 1990. 24. FOREIGN TAX CREDITS - Section 24 This section amends section 245K(1) to ensure that it applies to all countries or territories outside New Zealand. This wording is consistent with other provisions of Part IVA of the Income Tax Act. This amendment takes effect on the 1st day of Au- gust 1990 25. CHANGES OF RESIDENCE OF CON- TROLLED FOREIGN COMPANIES - Section 25 This amendment clarifies the meaning of section 245O(2) and ensures that the section correctly ap- plies when a foreign company ceases to be a foreign company. This amendment takes effect on the 1st day of Au- gust 1990 26. FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUND INCOME AND LOSSES - Section 26 This section amends subsections (1), (11) and (14) of section 245R. Section 245R determines which for- eign entities are foreign investment funds and also requires foreign investment fund income or losses to be calculated where a New Zealand resident has an interest in a foreign investment fund. Subsection (1) removes the definition of an “ex- cepted financial arrangement”. This term is not referred to elsewhere in section 245R. Subsection (2) amends the foreign investment fund regime as it applies to life insurance policies to ensure that it is consistent with the scope of the new taxation regime for life insurers. The foreign invest- ment fund regime will not apply to policies offered or entered into in New Zealand as these policies are subject to New Zealand tax under the new life insurance taxation regime. Subsection (3) amends the wording in section 245R(11) of the principal Act. The wording has been changed to ensure that the subsection applies to all persons not resident in New Zealand. Subsection (4) corrects a drafting defect in the legis- lation. Where a person becomes resident in New Zealand during an income year section 245R(14) deems any interest they hold in a foreign investment fund to have been acquired, on the date on which they became resident, at the market value on that date. That deemed acquisition is included in item d of the calculation required by subsection (3) of the principal Act. However, section 245R does not prohibit the person from also deducting, at item c, the market value of the interest as at the end of the previous income year where that interest was held at that date. As a result a double deduction could have been allowed in respect of the same interest. This was clearly not intended. The amendment will ensure that where a person becomes resident in New Zealand during an income year no deduction shall be allowed in respect of the value of the interest as the end of the previous accounting year. Subsections (2) and (4) of this section apply from the income year which commenced on 1 April 1990 while all the remaining subsection apply from the date of the Governor-General’s assent; 1 August 1990. 27. CASES WHERE ASSESSABLE IN- COME CALCULATIONS CANNOT BE UNDERTAKEN - Section 27 This section makes an amendment to section 245V of the Act to correct a minor drafting error. 7 Section 245V(b) makes references to “an interest of that taxpayer in a controlled foreign company or a control interest or an income interest of that tax- payer in a foreign investment fund”. The use of the terms “interest” and “control or an income interest” where they appear in paragraph (b) of that subsection are incorrect, i.e. a person has an “interest in a foreign investment fund and a “control or an income interest” in a controlled foreign com- pany. 28. APPLICATION OF PART RELATING TO NON-RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX - Section 28 Section 28 of the Act extends the application of the NonResident Withholding Tax provisions to include life insurers as they are now taxable in a manner similar to all other taxpayers. Life insurance compa- nies were previously not subject to NRWT as they were subject to a specific taxation regime as regards their investment income. 29. INTERPRETATION - RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX - Section 29 The definition of “exempt interest” for the purposes of the Resident Withholding Tax (RWT) has been extended to include interest payable on National Development Bonds or New Zealand Savings Cer- tificates up to a maximum of $500 in any one year. Interest on these bonds and certificates is exempt from income tax under section 61(14) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (to a maximum of $500), and it was therefore an anomaly that deductions of RWT were being made from income which is exempt from tax. This will take effect in respect of interest paid on or after 1 August 1990. Where any RWT deduction has been made from interest paid between 1 April 1990 and 30 September 1990 a refund will be available on application from Hamilton District Office. Applicants for refunds should enter their IRD number on the RWT deduc- tion certificate which they received when a bond or certificate matured and use that form rather than the customary IR15F used for refunds to exempt recipi- ents. The refund process has been centred in one District Office so that the total paid to any one recipient can be monitored and will not exceed the exemption. Resident Withholding Tax deductions made prior to 1 April 1990 can be claimed as credits in the 1990 return of income. 30. DETERMINATION OF OTHER INCOME - Sections 30 and 31 Sections 336B(2) and 336BA(1)(a) of the principal Act, which deal with the determination of other income and specified exemption respectively, are amended in order to change the basis of apportion- ment of the other income and specified exemption where the guaranteed retirement income is received for only part of the income year. Previously the apportionment was done on the basis of the number of pay days in which the guaranteed retirement income earner qualified for guaranteed retirement income in relation to the number of pay days in the income year. This apportionment could result in guaranteed re- tirement income earners paying more surcharge then they received in guaranteed retirement income (net of tax) for the year. The new method apportions the other income and specified exemption of a guaranteed retirement in- come earner on the basis of the number of days the guaranteed retirement income earner received GRI in relation to the number of days in the income year. This apportionment ensures that the guaranteed retirement income earner does not pay more sur- charge then he/she receives in net guaranteed retire- ment income. A number of other minor drafting amendments are also made with respect to section 336BA of the principal Act. This section applies for the income year commenc- ing on the 1st of April 1990 and every subsequent income year. 32. INTERPRETATION - FRINGE BENEFIT TAX - Sections 32, 33 and 34 Superannuation Schemes These sections provide that where an employer makes a contribution to a superannuation scheme that contribution will be subject to FBT, except where the newly introduced specified superannuation con- tribution withholding tax applies to that contribu- tion. In practise, this will mean, all non-monetary contributions, contributions to overseas superan- nuation schemes, and contributions to some New Zealand schemes will be subject to FBT. The sections further provide that the value of the fringe benefit provided by the employer to the em- ployee is the amount of that contribution. 8 These amendments confirm existing Government policy in this area and they are considered necessary as it has been contended that the existing legislation is inadequate in certain circumstances. Charitable and Religious Organisations The “Report to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Social Welfare by the Working Party on Charities and Sporting Bodies” published in No- vember 1989, contained the following recommenda- tion: “The Working Party recommends that the pres- ent exemption of nonbusiness charitable activi- ties from fringe benefit tax be removed. It also recommends that the definition (in the Income Tax Act 1976, Section 336N) of an emergency vehicle for fringe-benefit-tax purposes be exam- ined, and that adequate exemption for fringe benefit tax is made where the vehicle is required because of factors peculiar to charitable work.” Subsection (3) of this section amends the “emer- gency call” exemption as a result of Select Commit- tee considering that it should reflect factors peculiar to charities. The recommendation is accommodated by extending the emergency call exemption to cover emergency services relating to the health or safety of any person. The effect is that where a vehicle is used for such a service on any day, no fringe-benefit tax will accrue for any private use of the benefit on that day. Note that the restriction relating to calls made between the hours of 6.00am to 6.00pm on week days, which applies to other emergency calls, does not apply to calls relating to the health or safety of any person. In the context of this exemption the term “health and safety” encompasses the spiritual well being of any person. Subsection (6) of this section withdraws the exemp- tion for non-business charities. Both subsection (3) and subsection (6) of this section take effect from 1 October 1990. Life Insurance Subsection 7 inserts provisions to ensure that low interest loans made by a life insurer to a policyholder are subject to fringe benefits tax as from 1 October 1990. 33. INTERPRETATION - PAY PERIOD TAXPAYERS - Section 36 Minor amendments have been made to the defini- tion of “pay period taxpayer” in sections 2 and 356 of the Tax Act, to correct drafting errors. The definition was recently rewritten to take account of the introduction of Resident Withholding Tax. Pay period taxpayers are taxpayers who do not have to file a tax return. The tax collected during the income year from PAYE and RWT is accepted as the taxpayers final income tax liability if no return is furnished. The two corrections that were made to the definition of pay period taxpayer are: 1) The reference to “section 356(1)” in the definition in section 2 was amended to read “section 356(2)” 2) The application of the definition (as given in section 356(2)) was limited to individual taxpay- ers. The corrections take effect from 1 August 1990 so apply for the 1990/91 income year. It was never intended that non-individuals should qualify as pay period taxpayers. Subsection (2) is a transitional provision which re- lieves certain persons from the obligation to file a tax return for the year ended 31 March 1990. This provision is necessary because although there is a new definition of “pay period taxpayer” which will exclude persons deriving small amounts of interest and dividend income from the requirement to file tax returns in future, that does not take effect until after 1 April 1990. Following the introduction of resident withholding tax (RWT) regime, and the reduction in the interest and dividend exemption from 1 October 1989 there will be a class of persons (in particular children) adversely affected. Where such persons earn inter- est or dividends of less than $100 in the first half of the 1990 income year, and also earn such income in the 2nd half of the year which is subject to deduc- tions of RWT there will be an obligation to file an income tax return pursuant to section 9 but there will be no liability for income tax. Similarly, pay period taxpayers, who also earn small amounts of interest and dividends which were pre- viously under $200 will also be affected. The amendment removes the obligation to file re- turns from both these groups, but subsection (4) ensures that right to file a return remains, and subsection (2) retains the requirement to file a return where taxpayer receives a family support credit of tax. 9 The two groups of persons not now required to file returns are:- a) A person whose only income is from interest and dividends who derives less than $100 between 1 April 1989 and 30 September 1989 and $200 or less from which a deduction of RWT has been made between 1 October 1989 and 31 March 1990. b) A person who would be a pay period taxpayer (under the definition as it applied prior to the replacement of S356 by section 15(1) of the In- come Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1989) and who derives interest and dividends of less than $100 between 1 April 1989 and 30 September 1989 and $200 or less from which a deduction of RWT has been made between 1 October 1989 and 31 March 1990. Subsection (3)(b) ensures that where an RWT deduc- tion was not made because of a taxable bonus issue, a deduction will be deemed to have been made. 34. DETERMINATION OF ASSESSABLE INCOME - Section 37 Section 374B(1)(a) of the principal Act is amended to include in the definition of assessable income for Family Support purposes income derived from over- seas pensions where a deduction is made from the person’s entitlement to a monetary benefit (other than guaranteed retirement income) paid by the Department of Social Welfare. This form of overseas pensions is exempt from income tax under section 61(36) of the Income Tax Act 1976. A person receiving both an overseas pension and a New Zealand benefit can derive income in excess of the level of threshold at which Family Support com- mences to abate. Where such a person qualifies for Family Support, it would be inequitable if the Family Support did not abate in the same way as it would for a person receiving the same amount of income from a different source. The second amendment corrects a cross reference with regard to the definition of major shareholder from section 336N(1) to section 2. This section applies to income derived in the income year commencing on the 1st of April 1990 and sub- sequent income years. 35. IMPUTATION ASPECTS FOR LIFE IN- SURANCE REGIME - Sections 38 to 60 The new life insurance taxation regime allows for imputation credits in respect of taxes paid on life insurer income to be offset against taxes due on income relating to policyholders. In addition, New Zealand resident insurance companies are now re- quired to maintain imputation credit accounts. Sections 38 to 60 of the Bill provide for the implemen- tation of these provisions. They include consequen- tial amendments to the existing imputation regime to incorporate New Zealand life insurance compa- nies together with a new Part XIID of the Income Tax Act which sets up a new memorandum account to be maintained by life insurers called a “Policyholder Credit Account”. This account allows for the offset of imputation credits against tax due on Policy- holder Income. These provisions are discussed in more depth a separate Appendix to this Information Release. 36. TAX RATES - Section 61 The First Schedule to the Income Tax Act is amended to alter the rate of tax pertaining to life insurers and superannuation funds. Life Insurers are taxable on the income they derive on behalf of policyholders at a rate of 33 cents. This is provided at a new clause 2A inserted by section 61(1). As superannuation funds become qualifying trusts on 1 April 1990, subsections (2) to (5) provide that they will be taxable at a rate of 33 cents as from this date. It should be noted that this rate change is from a particular date, and not on an income year basis. There are provisions at subsection (6) to provide that if a superannuation fund’s income year spans this date, then the income for the year is to be appor- tioned on a daily basis between the periods up to 31 March 1990, and the period after this date. Tax is levied on the income apportioned to either period at the appropriate tax rate. 37.

As a consequence of the repeal of these 26 sections, a further 46 sections are to be repealed from some 17 Income Tax Amend- ment Acts. All 72 sections are detailed in the Sched- ule to the Bill. 38. TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS FOR LIFE INSURERS - Sections 64 to 67 As New Zealand life insurance companies are re- quired to maintain imputation credit accounts effec- tive from the 1991 income year, and these accounts operate on a balance date of 31 March which may be different to the company’s balance date there are transitional provisions in section 65 to cater for the initial part-year period. In addition there are other provisions in section 66 to cater for the change in status for New Zealand life insurance companies operating Branch Equivalent Tax Accounts who were previously BETA persons and are now BETA companies. Section 67 caters for other insurers who wish to maintain Policyholder Credit Accounts and have non-standard balance dates. These provisions are discussed in more depth in Appendix C to this TIB. 11 APPENDICES TO TIB VOLUME TWO, NO 3 OCTOBER 1990 Appendix A: Petroleum Mining, Life Insurance, and other amendments Appendix B: Amendments to GST, IRD, and Unclaimed Money Acts Appendix C: New Taxation Regime for Life Insurers
1 This Appendix details the amendments made by the following Acts: The Goods and Services Amendment Act 1990 The Inland Revenue Department Amendment Act 1990 The Unclaimed Money Amendment Act 1990 These Acts were enacted on 1 August 1990. GOODS AND SERVICES AMENDMENT ACT 1990 The following amendments result from issues raised as part of the GST Legislative Audit. 1. SHORT TITLE - Section 1 This Act can be cited as the Goods and Services Amendment Act 1990, and shall be read as part of the Goods and Services Act 1985. Unless other- wise stated these provisions of this section shall come into force on the day on which this Act received the Royal Assent (1 August 1990). 2. INTERPRETATION - Section 2 This section makes a number of amendments to definitions. The section omits the definition of the term “superannuation scheme” from section 3(2) of the GST Act and inserts a new definition of “superan- nuation scheme” which refers to the Superannua- tion Schemes Act 1989. The section also amends the definition of second- hand goods to allow wool (as defined in section 2 of the Wool Industry Act 1977) purchased from a non registered grower to be treated as secondhand goods for the period 24 March 1988 to 1 July 1989. Retirement villages The definition of commercial dwelling is amended and a new definition of license to occupy is in- cluded. These changes, together with a change to section 14, extend the exemption from GST for rent to include the supply of accommodation in a dwell- ing (ie. a unit, apartment, etc.) situated within a rest home complex or a retirement village. The exemption applies where the only service sup- plied in return for rent paid, is the right to occupy that dwelling. This amendment ensures that the supply of accommodation in a dwelling within a retirement village or a rest home is treated in the same manner as other supplies of residential accommodation . This amendment applies from 1 August 1990 which is the date the Act received the royal assent. 3. MEANING OF THE TERM SUPPLY - Section 3 Section 5 of the principal Act is amended by repealing subsection (11A). This subsection included within the meaning of the term supply, the application of postal stamps to a postal note where the postal note will be used as considera- tion for a supply. This subsection is now repealed as New Zealand Post ceased to issue postal notes in August 1986. This section applies from 1 August 1990 which is the date the Act received the royal assent. 4. ZERO RATING - Section 4 Section 4 of the amendment Act makes four amendments to Section 11 of the principal Act. The amendments are as follows. 1. The legislation is clarified to make it clear that the supplier has to enter the goods for export and that the goods have to be exported by the supplier in order to be zero rated. 2. The zero rating provisions are amended to allow the customs sealed bag system to qualify for zero rating. 3. The Commissioner is given the discretion to extend the time allowed to elapse between goods being entered for export and actually being exported before GST is charged at the standard rate. 4. The legislation is clarified to make it clear that moveable personal property does not include “choses in action”. 5. Consequential amendment to section 32 of the principal Act. APPENDIX B TO TIB VOLUME TWO, NO. 3, OCTOBER 1990 AMENDMENTS TO GST, IRD, AND UNCLAIMED MONEY ACTS 2 Supplier to be the exporter of the Goods Section 11(1)(a) of the principal Act is amended to make it clear that in order for a good to be zero rated the supplier has to enter the good for export and actually export the good within 28 days of supply. Previously the Act allowed goods to be zero rated where they were entered for export, however there was no requirement for the supplier to export the goods or to ensure that the goods were actually exported. Sealed Bag system As a result of the above amendment a specific provision had to be inserted into the zero rating provisions to enable goods exported under the sealed bag system to qualify for zero rating. The sealed bag system allows holders of an export warehouse licence, who have been granted a licence to operate a sealed bag system, to sell duty free and GST free goods to tourists who will be departing NZ within five working days of the date of the sale. The duty free goods are placed in a sealed bag which is uplifted by the tourist. The purchase is evidenced as having been exported by the plucking of a sales docket from the sealed bag by an agent of the duty free shop when the pas- senger enters the departure lounge at an interna- tional airport. Sales made by the licensed duty free shop which cannot be evidenced as having been exported in the sealed bag by the matching of dockets col- lected at the airport with those of the duty free shop, will be subject to GST at the standard rate. The Commissioner’s discretion to extend the 28 day time limit for goods to be exported. The time limit allowed to elapse between goods being entered for export and actually being exported before GST is charged at the standard rate is extended. Previously the proviso to section 11(1)(a)(ii) only catered for circumstances, beyond the control of the parties to the contract, which prevented the goods from being exported within 28 days of the time of supply. This proviso applied to such events as strikes, bad weather etc. The legislation now provides that the Commis- sioner may extend the 28 day period within which a good has to be exported, upon written applica- tion by the supplier, where 1. Circumstances beyond the control of the supplier and recipient, have prevented or will prevent the exportation of those goods within 28 days of the time of supply; or 2. Due to the nature of the supply it is not practi- cal for those goods to be exported within 28 days of the time of supply. It is proposed that suppliers of similar goods on a regular basis, such as magazines, newspapers, books, etc, may seek the prior approval of the Commissioner for individual suppliers to extend the period allowed between the deemed time of supply and the export for a certain class of sup- plies. Where the good is not a high volume supply or a supply of similar goods, for example the supply of a boat, then the supplier may seek prior approval by the Commissioners to extend, for a specified time, the period allowed between the deemed time of supply and export of an individual supply. Moveable personal property does not include choses in action Prior to this amendment it could be argued that the term “moveable personal property” included choses in action. A chose in action is a right to something which the person who holds the right does not have posses- sion of, for example, shares, trademarks, copy- rights, patents, mortgages, life insurance policies, and debts. It was never intended that choses in action be included in the term moveable personal property for the purposes of the zero rating provisions contained in section 11(2) of the principal Act. The term moveable personal property in para- graphs (c)(i) and (e)(ii) of section 11(2) of the principal Act is amended to exclude choses in action. This amendment also ensures that choses in action provided to a non resident who is outside NZ at the time the service are performed, but where those rights are for use within NZ, are not zero rated. Consequential amendment to section 32 of the principal Act Section 32(1) of the principal Act is consequen- tially amended to replace the previous reference to section 11 of the principal Act in order to take account of the new paragraphs inserted in section 11. 3 This section applies from the 1st of August 1990 which is the date the Act received the royal assent. 5. IMPOSITION GOODS AND SERVICES TAX ON IMPORTS - Section 5 Two amendments are made to Section 12(4) of the principal Act. The first amendment inserts a new paragraph (ba) which allows a non registered person who im- ports goods, or a registered person who imports goods in his/her private capacity, to claim back the GST paid on the imported good where the good is found to be faulty or the wrong good has been sent. The person who imports the good has to be the person who exports the good in order for a refund to be obtained. The re-export of the faulty or wrong good has to be - 1) In relation to the wrong goods imported, within a two month period of the date of importation or, where the Comptroller of Customs approves, a period up to 12 months after the date of importation. 2) In relation to faulty goods, within 12 months of the date of importation. The second amendment exempts from GST the importation of certain tourist publicity and pro- motional material. This amendment was insti- gated by the OECD Council on International Tourism which adopted a convention under which member countries were obliged to admit certain tourist and publicity material free of all duties and taxes. Material covered by this convention is listed below. This section applies from the 1st of August 1990 which is the date the Act received the royal assent. a) Documents (folders, pamphlets, books, maga- zines, guides, posters framed or unframed, unframed photographs and photographic enlargements, maps whether illustrated or not, printed window transparencies, illustrated calendars) for free distribution, the chief purpose of which is to encourage the public to visit foreign countries, including inter alia, attending cultural, touristic, sporting, religious or professional meetings or demonstrations held in such foreign countries, provided that these documents do not contain more than 25 percent private commercial advertising and are obviously designed for general publicity purposes. b) Lists and year books for foreign hotels pub- lished or sponsored by official tourist organisa- tions and timetables of transport services operating abroad, when such documents are for free distribution and do not contain more than 25 percent private commercial advertis- ing. c) Technical material sent to the representative or correspondents appointed by official tourist organisations, not intended for distribution, eg year books, telephone or telex directories, lists of hotels, catalogues of fairs, samples of negli- gible value of handicrafts, documentation about museums, universities, spas and other institutions. The following “tourist promotional material” is required to be admitted free of any duties or taxes when it is imported by official tourist organisa- tions or bodies recognised by them and approved by the competent authorities of the importing country: a) Pictures and drawings, framed photographs and photographic enlargements, art books, paintings, engravings or lithographs, sculp- tures and tapestries and other similar works of art. b) Display material (show cases and similar articles), including electrical and mechanical equipment required for operating such dis- plays. c) Documentary films, records, video and tape recordings and other audio visual works intended for use in performances at which no charge is made, but excluding those whose subjects lend themselves to commercial adver- tising and those which are on general sale in the country of importation. d) A reasonable number of flags. e) Dioramas, scale models, lantern-slides, print- ing blocks, photographic negatives. f) Specimens, in reasonable numbers, of articles of local handicrafts, local costumes, and similar articles of folklore. 6. EXEMPT SUPPLIES (LEASEHOLD LAND) - Section 6 Two amendments are made to section 14 of the principal Act. The first exempts from tax the supply of residential rental accommodation in a 4 rest home or a retirement village. This amend- ment has been explained above in relation to retirement villages (section 2). The second amendment relates to the sale of leasehold land that has previously been used for the supply of rental accommodation. The sale by any registered person of any dwelling used for the supply of residential accommodation for a period of 5 years or more is deemed by the GST Act 1985 to be an exempt supply. The freeholding of leasehold land used for resi- dential accommodation is now (from 1 August 1990) treated in the same manner. 7. TAXABLE PERIOD (RETURN TO THE DATE OF BANKRUPTCY OR DEATH) - Section 7 Section 15, which provides for the allocation of return periods, has been amended to allow return periods to be cut short in certain circumstances. Normally taxable periods end on the last day of the final month of the period. Now, (from 1 August 1990) where a registered person dies, goes into liquidation or receivership, or becomes bankrupt - the date of death, insolvency, etc., is deemed to be the last day of the person’s taxable period. This amendment removes the requirement for trustees and the like to furnish GST returns that include supplies made both before and after the date of death, adjudication of bankruptcy, etc. Two returns will now be furnished in such cases - the second return will cover the period from the day after death or insolvency until the end of the usual taxable period. Both returns will be due on the normal due date. The amendment does not affect the status of a trustee, liquidator or receiver. These persons are still deemed to be carrying on the taxable activity of the deceased or insolvent person. This amendment takes affect from the 1st of August 1990 which is the date the Act received the royal assent. 8. CALCULATION OF TAX PAYABLE - Section 8 This section includes two of the threeamendments to section 20 of the principal Act. The first amendment repeals paragraph (da) of subsection (3) which allowed the National Roads Fund to claim an input credit in respect of any excise duty refunded in terms of the Transport Act 1962. This paragraph has been repealed because with the advent of The Transit NZ Act 1989, which came into force on the 1st of October 1989, the National Roads Fund has been abol- ished. The second amendment redrafts section 20(3A) and splits it into 2 subsections, with effect from 1 August 1990, because there were doubts about its effectiveness. It was originally inserted in con- junction with the temporary concessional deregis- tration provision given by section 5(3A). That section gave voluntary registrants and non-profit bodies the opportunity to deregister without having to pay output tax on assets held before 1 October 1986. The new sections 20(3A) and 20(3AB) prevent any input credit being claimed by the owner, or an associated person of the owner, for the subsequent use, within 5 years, of any asset concessionally treated under section 5(3A). 9. CANCELLATION OF REGISTRATION - Sections 9, 10, and 13 A number of amendments are made to the GST Act to allow the Commissioner to instigate the deregistration of a registered person where the Commissioner is satisfied that the person has not been carrying on a taxable activity. The first amendment amends section 27(1) of the principal Act by inserting a new paragraph (ca). This paragraph allows the Commissioner to make an assessment of the amount of the tax payable, where that person has been deregistered by the Commissioner, from the date of original registra- tion. This ensures that the Commissioner can require the repayment of input tax previously claimed by the deregistered person. Section 32(1) is amended to enable a person to object to the Commissioner’s decision to either deregister or register the person for GST pur- poses. The amendment includes within the term “decision” anything which is left to the satisfaction of the Commissioner. The words “satisfies” and “satisfied” appear in sections 51 and 52 of the principal Act with respect to the Commissioner being satisfied that a person should be registered, or that the person should be deregistered for GST purposes. Section 52 enables the Commissioner to instigate the deregistration of a registered person. Previ- ously the Commissioner could only deregister a registered person where the registered person made written application seeking deregistration. 5 Also a minor amendment is made to Section 27(4) of the principal Act which deals with setting a new due date for the payment of tax after a reassessment has been issued or a where an assessment has not been issued until after the due date for the payment of tax. This section allows the Commissioner to set a new due date for the payment of tax where the Commissioner does not suspect “wilful neglect” on behalf of the registered person in complying with the GST Act. The amendment removes the word “wilful” from the expression “wilful neglect” because it is felt that it would be difficult for the Commissioner to prove “wilful neglect” as opposed to “neglect”. This section applies from the date of assent of the Act which is 1st of August 1990. 10. RECOVERY OF TAX - Section 11 Previously section 42 of the principal Act, which deals with the recovery of tax, did not cover the situation where a business entity other than a company, went into receivership. The amendment inserted another paragraph into section 42(2) of the GST Act to ensure that when a receiver is placed in charge of a partnership, trust, or unincorporated body that any unpaid GST ranks ahead of all other debts. This amendment applies from 1 August 1990 which is the date of assent of the legislation. 11. INTEREST ON REFUNDS - Section 12 This item modifies the circumstances in which interest is paid to registered persons where a refund has been requested. Where the Department is not satisfied with a return and requests information about it, interest will have to be paid if, within 15 working days of the receipt of that information, no response has been made by the Department. If however, the Department is not satisfied with a return and decides at any time that the return needs investigation, then the Department, provid- ing notice is given is not bound by the require- ment to pay interest on the refund. The second change prevents the Department from incurring interest on a refund that has been withheld due to a registered person having failed to furnish returns for any taxable period as re- quired by the Act. The change will mean that where a person claims a refund, the Department will not start to incur interest on that refund until 15 working days after the Department has re- ceived all of that registered person’s outstanding returns. This amendment applies from the 1st of August 1990 which is the date of assent of the Act. 12. GROUP OF COMPANIES - Section 14 This section makes a minor drafting amendment to section 55(8)(c) of the GST Act. The amendment replaces the word “persons”, with the word “individuals”. This amendment applies from the 1st of August 1990 which is the date of assent of the Act. INLAND REVENUE DEPARTMENT AMENDMENT ACT 1990 14. SHORT TITLE - Section 1 This Act can be cited as the Inland Revenue Department Amendment Act 1990, and shall be read as part of the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974. The provisions of this section shall come into force on the day on which this Act received the Royal Assent (1 August 1990). 15. EVIDENCE OF FINANCIAL OR PROPERTY TRANSACTIONS - Section 2 This section amends section 21 of the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 which relates to evidence of financial or property transactions and allows the Commissioner to use certain types of evidence in proceedings. Previously the section only applied to proceedings in relation to the Income Tax Act 1976 or the Land Tax Act 1976 but the amendments made by this section extend the scope of the section to include proceedings in relation to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. As a result of the amendment any record, or entry in any record, or photocopy thereof, made in the regular course of business or a taxable activity shall be admissible as evidence when produced by the Commissioner in proceedings for proving the alleged offence. Although the amendment applies from the date of the Governor-General’s assent, section 21 has its own application. As a result all records will be admissible irrespective of when they came into existence and irrespective of when any offence, or alleged offence, was committed. 6 UNCLAIMED MONEY AMENDMENT ACT 1990 16. SHORT TITLE - Section 1 This Act can be cited as the Unclaimed Money Amendment Act 1990, and shall be read as part of the Unclaimed Money Act 1971. The provisions of this section shall come into force on the day on which this Act received the Royal Assent (1 August 1990). 17. COMMISSIONER MAY MAKE PAYMENT TO CLAIMANT - Section 2 This section corrects a minor drafting error to ensure that the Commissioner is not responsible for the payment of money which has been paid out to a prior claimant.
1 1.0 INTRODUCTION The Income Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1990, (“the Amendment Act”), provides for a new taxation regime for persons in the business of providing life insurance. The new tax regime for life insurance is the outcome of a lengthy process of consultation between Gov- ernment and affected parties that was spearheaded by the Consultative (Brash) Committee on Superan- nuation, Life Insurance and Related Areas. The leg- islation largely embodies the recommendations re- lating to life insurance contained in the second re- port of that Committee. The new legislation takes effect from the income year commencing 1 April 1990. It repeals the existing section 204 of the Income Tax Act 1976 (“the Act”), and replaces it with a new regime (sections 204 to 205F) that provides for a much more comprehensive base for both income and expenditure. In the past, a company to which the old section 204 applied was assessable only on the investment in- come relating to life insurance policies issued in New Zealand, and could claim deductions only in respect of expenses relating to that investment reve- nue. Premium income was not taxable, and outgo- ings relating to premiums were not deductible for tax purposes. Under the new taxation regime, life insurance companies resident in New Zealand will be subject to tax on their worldwide underwriting income as well as their investment income. Life insurers will now be able to claim deductions for all their expenditure incurred in earning that income. Under the new provisions, nonresident life insurers will be able to elect to be deemed resident in respect of their New Zealand business. This means that they will be treated as if they were resident for tax purposes. It will have various effects, for instance they will be eligible for the inter company dividend exemption, but would also be liable for foreign dividend withholding tax which will arise from New Zealand funds invested in overseas equities. Alternatively they may remain nonresident and be taxed under the new regime on underwriting and investment income from life insurance policies of- fered or entered into in New Zealand. There are also transitional provisions (section 206) which provide for the separation out of superannua- tion assets and liabilities from the life fund to a registered superannuation scheme. 2.0 DEFINITION OF A LIFE INSURER The new taxation regime applies to life insurers. A “life insurer” is defined for the purposes of sections 204 to 206 as “any person who carries on the business of providing life insurance”. A definition of “life insurance” has been inserted into section 2 of the Act, and means : “Insurance (including reinsurance and the provi- sion of annuities) where and to the extent that a person provides to another person for considera- tion, benefits contingent upon the death or sur- vival of a human being or beings.” Two items are specifically excluded from the defini- tion of life insurance : (a) Medical or accident insurance where the only benefits provided which are contingent on death or survival are contingent on death from a specified cause (for example contrac- tion of a terminal illness), or where such bene- fits are included as an incidental element to the provision of medical or accident insur- ance; and (b) Superannuation funds where the only bene- fits provided to beneficiaries are the return in a lump sum form of contributions and the allocation of investment earnings; that is, su- perannuation funds without any life insur- ance provided by the trustees of the fund For the purposes of sections 204 to 205F, where a person in the business of providing life insurance provides annuities, this activity will also be treated as part of the business of providing life insurance. However where any other person provides annui- ties which are not contingent on human life, these will now be treated as “financial arrangements” and will be subject to the provisions of the "accruals rules" contained in sections 64B to 64M of the Act. 3.0 APPLICATION OF THE NEW REGIME Sections 13(3) and 13(4) of the Amendment Act provide that the new sections 204 to 205F will apply from the income year commencing 1 April 1990, except to the extent where a New Zealand resident life insurer has business outside New Zealand. APPENDIX C TO TIB VOLUME TWO, NO. 3, OCTOBER 1990 NEW TAXATION REGIME FOR LIFE INSURERS 2 For the first year of the new regime, the 1991 income year, where a life insurance company has life poli- cies, reinsurance policies or annuities issued outside New Zealand, then the portion of life insurance underwriting income and other income which re- lates to those policies will not be subject to taxation in New Zealand. Previously, New Zealand resident life insurance companies have been assessable only on income that relates to policies offered and entered into in New Zealand. This deferral of the new life insurance regime in respect of policies offered or entered into outside New Zealand is designed to give life insurers affected time to adjust themselves to the new regime in respect of their overseas busi- ness. Thereafter sections 204 to 205F will apply to the worldwide income of all types of a New Zealand life insurer. 4.0 ASSESSABLE INCOME Section 204A provides that life insurers will be required to pay tax on two bases : (a) Life Insurer income (or “ordinary income”) determined according to sections 204B to 204Q; and (b) Policyholder income (where the life insurance company is taxed as a proxy on income that is attributable to policyholders) determined ac- cording to sections 205 to 205F. Whilst tax is payable on both of these income bases, the life insurance company can utilise imputation credits in respect of the tax paid on the life insurer base to offset its liability for tax on policyholder income. (A)LIFE INSURER INCOME 5.0 CALCULATION OF LIFE INSURER INCOME In terms of the new section 204B of the Act, the life insurer income for a New Zealand resident life insurer is calculated by calculating all income (other than underwriting income) plus underwriting in- come (as defined) less expenses. This is given by : Life Insurer Income or Loss = i + u - e Other Income (i) This item consists of the total of all amounts of assessable income under the general provisions of the Act derived from the life insur- ance business (but not taking into account deduc- tions or allowances available), other than : underwriting income (as defined), and policyholder income (as defined in Section 205) Underwriting Income (u) This is made up of three components: Mortality profit, calculated as per section 204F Premium loading, calculated as per sec- tion 204G Discontinuance profit, calculated as per section 204H Expenses (e) These are all expenses or losses deduct- ible, or allowances available under the general provisions of the Act other than: reinsurance premiums, and claims and amounts credited to actuarial reserves. Where an item of expenditure or loss is included in item “e” as defined in section 204B no deduc- tion will be available under any other section of the Act (section 204J). This is to prevent the possibility of claiming a deduction for the same expenditure more than once. Tax is levied on the assessable income at the rate applicable to resident companies, currently at a rate of 33 cents per dollar. 6.0 OTHER INCOME 6.1 PROFIT OR LOSS ON THE DISPOSAL OF PROPERTY The rules applicable to life insurance companies regarding the profit or loss on the disposal of prop- erty are contained in the new section 204C. Section 204C provides that the assessable income of a life insurer will include profits or gains derived by, or losses incurred by a life insurer on the sale or other disposal of any property. The rules are somewhat complex reflecting the changing historical modifica- tions to life insurance and superannuation. It should be noted that the legislation provides that the gains or losses on sale or other disposal of any “property” are taken into account. This has a wider compass than “investments”,the term used in the old tax regime. “Property” is a very comprehensive term and includes, amongst other things, buildings used principally as premises by the life insurer. These were previously likely to be excluded from the term “investments”. However in effect, the new legislation provides for the same treatment afforded by the old regime in respect of most property pur- chased before the 1991 income year, for the period until the commencement of the 1991 income year. premiums, claims in respect of reinsurance, 3 The gains and losses on the sale or other disposal of any property other than financial arrangements (to which the “accruals rules” contained in sections 64B to 64M of the Act apply) or any other property where the cost is taken into consideration in calculating assessable income (other than by depreciation) in an income year, will be calculated as follows: (a) Where the property was acquired on or before the last day of the 1983 income year the gains or losses are calculated on the difference between: Consideration received (or receivable) from the sale or other disposal of the property; and The “specified base cost for 1983 income year property” which means the greater of : (i) Cost price; or (ii) The market value of the property on the last day of the 1983 income year. (b) In any other case, the gains or losses are calcu- lated on the difference between : Consideration received (or receivable) from the sale or other disposal of the property; and Cost price. (c) Notwithstanding the above two calculation meth- ods, where the property consists of land and buildings acquired before the 1990 income year, which if sold before the 1990 income year would have been a capital item not subject to the previ- ous section 204 (in other words, land and build- ings which were not included in the term “invest- ments” used in the old regime), the gains or losses on sale or other disposal of the property are calculated on the difference between: Consideration received or receivable on sale; and Market value on the last day of the 1990 income year. Although there are various particular provisions for determining the gain or loss on sale or other disposal of any property, section 204C(4) confirms that when calculating whether there is any depreciation recov- ered on the sale or other disposal of an asset, this is based on the book value of the asset which is the cost price less any accumulated depreciation. 6.2 DISTRIBUTION OF PROPERTY TO POLICYHOLDERS (Section 204D) Where a life insurer sells or disposes of any property (other than financial arrangements which have an equivalent provision at section 64J) for inadequate consideration to a policyholder, sections 91 and 197 of the Act will apply as if the property were trading stock, and as if the policyholders were shareholders. This has the effect that the disposition of the prop- erty will be treated as the sale of the property by the life insurer at market value, and this amount will be taken into account in computing the gains or losses on sale of the property. 6.3 CERTAIN PROPERTY NOT TRADING STOCK (Section 204K) Where the property of a life insurer consists of property which: Would have been subject to the ‘accruals rules’ (contained in sections 64B to 64M of the Act) but for the application of paragraphs (a), (b) and (d) of Section 64M of the Act, in general terms a financial arrangement acquired be- fore the relevant implementation date for the “accruals rules”; or Is an excepted financial arrangement (as de- fined in section 64B of the Act) for example shares and some other near equity instru- ments, leases and short term trade credits, then that property (except for the provisions of section 204D discussed above), cannot be treated as trading stock. Therefore the life insurer will not be able to account for the change in value of these items until it is realised by sale or other disposal. This provision is intended to make it clear that all financial securities and equities are subject to taxa- tion under section 204C (see item 6.0 above) and not under the other provisions of the Act. The section does explicitly state that any expenditure or loss incurred in acquiring that property will be treated as capital and therefore not deductible. However, this will not prevent the life insurer from taking the costs of acquisition of that property into account for the purposes of Section 204C. 6.4 ADJUSTMENT FOR SUPERANNUATION POLICIES IN RESPECT OF PROPERTY AC- QUIRED BEFORE 1 APRIL 1988 (Section 204E) For the period before 1 April 1988, income relating to superannuation policies was exempt from taxation. Therefore an adjustment is required to exclude the portion of the gains or losses on sale of assets which relates to superannuation policies issued by a life insurer before 1 April 1988. The adjustment is made by way of an apportionment of the gains or losses on sale or other disposal of assets owned as at 1 April 1988 as follows : a x c b 4 where: a is the amount of the liabilities of the life insurer on the last day of the income year that last ended before 1 April1988 which related to: Superannuation policies contained in the Life Fund; and Specified mortgage repayment insurance poli- cies contained in the Fund; and Annuities contained in that Fund b is the total liabilities of the life insurer as at that date; and c relates only to property owned as at 1 April 1988 which was sold or otherwise disposed of during the current income year, and is the total of two items: (1) Where the property is a financial arrange- ment, the base price adjustment (as set out at section 64F) which would have been calcu- lated if the property had matured on 1 April 1988; plus (2) For all other property, the aggregate of the differences between: Market value of the property as at 1April 1988; and either (i) The “specified base cost of 1983 year property” (as discussed ear- lier), if the property was acquired in the 1983 income year or earlier; or (ii) Cost price or acquisition value. As noted above, this adjustment ensures that equiva- lent treatment to the old life insurance regime is applied to all gains and losses arising before super- annuation income became taxable. Therefore gains and losses on land and buildings which were not included in the term “investments” under the old regime are not taxed until the 1991 income year, and so are not subject to the apportion- ment outlined above. It should be noted that the ratio a/b above will remain constant over time because it is as at a specific date. Item “c” of the formula will decrease over time as the assets owned as at 1 April 1988 are progressively realised. 7.0 UNDERWRITING INCOME 7.1 MORTALITY PROFIT Mortality profit, (as calculated under section 204F) represents the profit that arises when the deaths experience of the life insurer is more favourable than expected. Mortality Profits arise in general terms because when a life insurer sets its premiums and the level of insurance cover it can afford to offer, the calcula- tions are done on the basis of existing mortality tables. With improved health care and greater life expectancy it is likely that the number of deaths, and therefore the payout of claims, is likely to be less than originally anticipated by the life insurer. As a conse- quence, the life insurer derives an underwriting profit. For taxation purposes the Mortality Profit will be calculated only in respect of those policies which were in existence at the beginning of the income year in accordance with the following formula for each life insured under each life insurance policy : Mortality Profit = (q x (s0 - v0)) - (s1 - v0) where: q is the probability as at the beginning of the income year of a claim becoming payable on the death of the life insured in the income year s0 is the claim payable contingent on death of the life insured as at the beginning of the income year v0 is the amount of the actuarial reserves in respect of that life insured at the beginning of the income year. The basis for calculating the reserves is discussed at item 8.0 below. s1if death of the life insured has occurred either during the income year, or during a previous income year (after the 1991 in come year) and the amount of the claim payable has not been included in this item in calculating the mortality profit in any previous income year, then S1 is the amount of the claim payable; otherwise S1 is the same as v0 A Mortality profit for each life insured may never be less than zero unless the person whose life was insured died during that income year, or in a previ- ous income year (after the 1991 income year) and the claim was not taken into account in calculating that previous income year’s Mortality Profit. In other words, a Mortality Loss may not occur unless the death of the life insured has occurred. Where there is more than one life insured under a single policy, the life insurer has the option of using as item “q” in the above formula, a common factor for each of the lives insured under the policy provided that it is a reasonable approximation of the average probabil- ity of a claim becoming payable on death of the lives 5 covered under that policy. Where necessary the factor must be weighted to take account of the differing claims payable and actuarial reserves held in respect of the different lives insured. Where a life insurer commences the business of providing life insurance partway through an income year then the Mortality Profit formula will apply to each life insured under each policy taken out during the year instead of just those in existence at the beginning of the year. Also, the Mortality Profit formula is modified so that items “q” and “s0” are calculated as at the date on which the policy is entered into, instead of the beginning of the income year, and item “v0” refers to the end of the income year instead of the beginning. Where a policy provides for an annuity payable on death, a claim is deemed to be payable on death, and a Mortality Profit is calculated on the basis that the amount of the claim is the net present value of the annuity. The net present value is calculated using the same assumptions as were used by the life insurer in calculating its actuarial reserves. These assumptions are discussed at item 8.0 below. 7.2 PREMIUM LOADING (Section 204G) A Premium Loading is a portion of the premium charged by the life insurer which relates to the risk spreading service that is offered by the life insurer. The calculation of Premium Loading for taxation purposes is set out at section 204G and provides that the Premium Loading will be calculated for each life insured under each policy which was in existence at the beginning of the income year as follows: To the extent to which the benefits under the policy are an annuity which was in the course of payment during the income year, The cal- culation is: Premium Loading = 0.01 x q x v0 In all other cases the calculation would be: Premium Loading = 0.2 x q x (s0 - v0) where in either formula - q is the probability of a claim being payable due to the death of the life insured during the income year as determined at the beginning of that year. s0 is the claim payable contingent on death of the life insured, or if there is nothing payable contingent on death, the amount payable con- tingent on the survival of the life insured to a specified date or age, determined as at the beginning of the income year. v0 is the amount of the actuarial reserves in respect of that life insured at the beginning of the income year. The Premium Loading may never be less than zero for any life insured under any policy. The factors of 0.01 and 0.2 were determined with reference to published Tables of Mortality, reinsur- ance premium rates and life office temporary insur- ance rates. They are by necessity an approximation, and were determined by the Consultative Commit- tee following discussions with representatives of the life offices. Where there is more than one life insured under a single policy, the life insurer has the option of using as item “q” in the above formula, a common factor for each of the lives insured under the policy pro- vided that it is a reasonable approximation of the average probability of a claim becoming payable on death of the lives covered under that policy. Where necessary the factor must be weighted to take ac- count of the differing claims payable and actuarial reserves held in respect of the different lives insured. Where a life insurer commences the business of providing life insurance partway through an income year then the Premium Loading formula will apply to each life insured under each policy taken out during the year instead of just those in existence at the beginning of the year. Also, the Premium Load- ing formula is modified so that items “q” and “s0” are calculated as at the date on which the policy is entered into, instead of the beginning of the income year, and item “v0” refers to the end of the income year instead of the beginning. Where a policy provides for the payment of an annuity, then a claim is deemed to be payable on death, which means that the Premium Loading is required to be calculated. If the annuity is actually payable contingent on death of the life insured, the Premium Loading is calculated on the basis that the amount of the claim is the net present value of the annuity determined as at the beginning of the in- come year. If the annuity is contingent on survival of the life insured to a particular date or age, the claim is deemed to be the net present value determined as at that date. In either case, the net present value is calculated using the same assumptions as were used by the life insurer in calculating its actuarial re- serves. 6 7.3 DISCONTINUANCE PROFIT (Section 204H) A Discontinuance Profit calculation arises where the liability of the life insurer has terminated under the policy for any reason other than the death of the life insured or survival by the life insured to an age or date specified in the policy. Generally a life insurer will be required to pay out less than the expected liability under the policy where the policy has been discontinued. In practice most discontinuances will be the result of the policy lapsing and being cancelled, or the life insured cashing in the policy and receiving its sur- render value which if surrendered early in the pol- icy’s intended term, will often be less than the total premiums paid to date. The Discontinuance Profit, which may never be less than zero for any policy, is calculated in accordance with the formulae set out at section 204H in respect of all policies which terminate in whole or in part as follows: Where the policy is in existence at the begin- ning of the year and either the policy termi- nates (wholly or partly) during the year or a claim is paid out for a reason other than death or survival of the life insured to a specified date or age : Discontinuance Profit = va - vb - sv ; or Where the policy was not in existence at the beginning of the income year and the policy terminates for any reason other than the death or survival of the life insured to a specified date or age : Discontinuance Profit = p - sv where in either formula: va is the amount of the actuarial reserves in respect of that life insured immediately prior to the time of termination but calculated using the same assumptions as are used to calculate the actuarial reserves at the beginning of the income year. vb is the amount in the actuarial reserves in respect of that policy determined immedi- ately after the time of termination or the time when the claim became payable having re- gard to the termination or claim and using the same assumptions as above. sv is the amount (including a nil amount) pay- able on termination of the policy, or the claim as appropriate. p is the total of all premiums paid in regard to that policy before it was terminated. 8.0 ACTUARIAL RESERVES (Section 204I) Broadly speaking, an actuarial reserve is an amount set aside by the life insurer to meet its future liabili- ties. An actuarial reserve is calculated using mortal- ity tables, expected rates of return, and other as- sumptions, and the person who makes the calcula- tions is required to be professionally qualified as an actuary. The calculation of the actuarial reserves must satisfy the criteria set out at section 204I, and in particular the assumptions made by the actuary making the calculations must be: Based on the same principles as those used in the actuarial advice by the life office’s actuary in making recommendations on the level of surplus available for distribution to share- holders, policyholders, or allotment to other objects of a superannuation scheme; and In conformity with generally acceptable com- mercial practice; and Likely to produce a reasonable estimation of the future experience of the life insurer and has regard to its past experience. In addition, an actuarial reserve may never be less than zero for any policy, and in total they may not be less than the aggregate of surrender values for the policies. The actuarial reserves at the end of an income year are the same as those at the beginning of the next income year, and hence there is scope for the as- sumptions used in calculating the actuarial reserves to change over time. However the assumptions used must always satisfy the requirements outlined above. In the first year of the regime, the 1991 income year, the assumptions and bases of calculation used in calculating the reserves at the end of the year must be the same as those used in calculating the reserves at the beginning of the year. The actuary responsible for the calculation of the reserves is required to furnish a declaration to the Commissioner with the life insurer’s return of in- come which: States the interest rates, mortality tables and other assumptions and other bases of calcula- tions used in the calculations. Declares that the assumptions and bases of calculation meet the requirements of section 204I. 7 The Commissioner has the power to seek advice from any actuary regarding the interest, mortality and other assumptions used for calculating the actu- arial reserves. In addition, the Commissioner may use different bases of calculation from those used by the life insurer regardless of whether this advice has been obtained. 9.0 NONRESIDENT LIFE INSURERS THAT ISSUE POLICIES IN NEW ZEALAND (Section 204L) In effect, nonresident life insurers are taxed on their New Zealand life insurance business under the new regime in exactly the same manner as a New Zealand resident life insurer. However the scope of the re- gime is limited to the business of the nonresident to the extent to which the business relates to life insur- ance policies which were offered or entered into in New Zealand. For the purposes of section 242 of the Act, this business income is deemed to be derived from New Zealand by section 204L. This occurs regardless of whether the policy was executed in New Zealand and regardless of whether the life insurer has an agent or fixed establishment in New Zealand. In other words, the effect is that the New Zealand tax is levied based on the policy itself having been offered or entered into in New Zealand being the source of the income, not the presence of the life insurer in New Zealand. Therefore as with a New Zealand resident life in- surer, but subject to the above comments, the Life Insurer Income base for the taxation of a nonresident life insurer is given by the formula provided at section 204L as follows: Life Insurer Income (or Loss) = i + u - e Other Income (i): This item consists of the total of all amounts of assessable income under the general provisions of the Act derived from the life insur- ance business (but not taking into account deduc- tions or allowances available) to the extent that business relates to policies offered or entered into in New Zealand, other than : premiums, claims in respect of reinsurance, underwriting income (as defined), and policyholder income (as defined in Section 205) Underwriting Income (u): This is made up of the same three components as for a New Zealand resident life insurer namely: (a) Mortality profit, calculated as per section 204F (b) Premium loading, calculated as per section 204G (c) Discontinuance profit, calculated as per sec- tion 204H In each case the calculation is made only in respect of policies offered or entered into in New Zealand. Expenses (e): These are all expenses, losses and allowances deductible under the general provi- sions of the Act which were incurred in gaining or producing the income included in items “i” and “u” above, other than: reinsurance premiums, and claims and amounts credited to actuarial re- serves. Tax is levied on the assessable income at the rate applicable to the non-resident entity. For nonresi- dent companies this is currently at a rate of 38 cents per dollar. To the extent that a nonresident life insurer derives income from New Zealand which is not included in item “i” above, or derives nonresident withholding income which is not included in item “i” above, then this income will be subject to the ordinary provisions of the Act. This situation may arise for instance where an Aus- tralian resident life insurer issues policies in New Zealand. The income relating to the policies offered or entered into in New Zealand will be subject to tax under the Life Office base discussed above. How- ever if that life insurer derives income such as interest from New Zealand relating to policies of- fered and entered into outside New Zealand, that income will be subject to ordinary tax rules. In this instance NonResident Withholding Tax would be levied on that interest earned. 9.1 NONRESIDENT LIFE INSURERS MAY ELECT TO BE RESIDENT (Section 204M) In terms of section 204M, a nonresident life insurer may elect to be deemed resident for tax purposes in respect of its life insurance business offered or en- tered into in New Zealand. As with the calculation of the nonresident life insurer’s income, this business is regardless of where the policy was executed or whether the life insurer has an agent or fixed estab- lishment in New Zealand. The election is subject to approval by the Commissioner. If a nonresident life insurer does elect to become resident, then the election must be made no later than 20 working days prior to the commencement of the income year to which it relates and the election is permanent. In respect of the 1991 income year however, the election is required to be made no later than 30 September 1990. 8 The effect of an election is threefold. Firstly as from the first day of the income year the business of the life insurer, to the extent that it consists of policies offered or entered into in New Zealand, is deemed to be carried on by a New Zealand resident company. This would mean for example, that the tax is levied on any assessable income at the New Zealand com- pany rate, and also that the life insurer can take advantage of the tax exemption contained in section 63 for intercompany dividends. However as a New Zealand resident company, the life insurer would become liable for foreign dividend withholding tax as set out at section 394ZL of the Act. In addition, distributions made by the life insurer to its Head Office would be dividends for tax purposes and there would be Non Resident Withholding Tax pay- able on all such distributions. Secondly, the life insurer is deemed to be an agent of that company, which would mean for instance that the life insurer would still be ultimately liable for the payment of income tax on the income. Thirdly the life insurer and the company are deemed to be separate persons in respect of that business. This would mean for example, that similar to the provision for nonresident life insurers outlined above, if the life insurer derived income from New Zealand relating to policies which were offered or entered into outside New Zealand then that income would be assessed separately from the income derived by the deemed company in respect of New Zealand life insurance business. 10.0 FULL REINSURANCE (Section 204N) Where a person who would otherwise be a life insurer, has taken out reinsurance policies which were offered or entered into in New Zealand and which fully relieve or secure the life insurer of all liability within that income year for providing the benefits contingent on death or survival of human beings, then in terms of section 204N, the person is deemed not to carry on the business of life insurance. For this provision to apply, the person taking out the reinsurance policies must fulfill two criteria. Firstly the reinsurance policies must reinsure all of the life insurance risks relating to that person’s life insur- ance business, and secondly the reinsurance policies must be offered or entered into in New Zealand. In respect of a New Zealand resident this would mean the worldwide life insurance risks would need to be reinsured, and for a nonresident this would mean the reinsurance must cover all risks relating to poli- cies offered or entered into in New Zealand. The fact that the reinsurance policies are offered or entered into in New Zealand means that the reinsurer would be liable for tax in New Zealand on these policies. The effect of being deemed not to carry on the business of life insurance for tax purposes does not mean that the person is relieved from liability for income tax in that year. What it means is that the income is calculated in terms of the other “ordinary” provisions of the Act. There is specific provision at section 204N to the effect that when calculating the income of the person under the ordinary provisions of the Act, premiums and claims relating to that person’s life insurance business or the reinsurance policies are not assessable or deductible as appropri- ate. Also, when determining the income from invest- ments, the nature of the life insurance business being carried on will still be taken into account in deter- mining what gains and losses are assessable. In other words, the fact that a business of life insurance is deemed not to be carried on for tax purposes will not preclude the application of the body of case law stemming from the decision in California Copper Syndicate (Limited and Reduced) v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159, commonly referred to as the “banking and insurance cases” in determining the taxable invest- ment income of that person. If the reinsurance policy does not fulfil the criteria set out above, then the life insurer is unable to take advantage of the exemption offered, and would be assessable on the life insurance business in terms of sections 204 to 205F of the Act, and the reinsurance premiums would not be deductible expenses, as discussed at item 5.0 above. 11.0 PARTIAL REINSURANCE (Section 204O) Section 204O of the Act provides that irrespective of any other provisions of sections 204 to 204P, where the life insurer has taken out policies of reinsurance which were offered or entered into in New Zealand, then there are a number of allowances made to take the effects of these policies into account: In calculating the Mortality Profit (section 204F) claims payable by the life insurer at the time of death of the life insured are reduced by claims receivable by the life insurer under the reinsurance policies upon the death of the life insured. In calculating the Premium Loading (section 204G) the claim payable on either death or survival of the life insured will be reduced by the claim receivable under the reinsurance policy. In calculating the Discontinuance Profit (sec- tion 204H) the premiums receivable under the policy must be reduced by the premiums 9 payable under the reinsurance policies, and similarly claims payable must be reduced by claims receivable under the reinsurance poli- cies. Actuarial reserves (section 204I) may be re- duced by an amount that the actuary respon- sible for actuarial control of the life insurer considers appropriate. Similar to the provisions for full reinsurance dis- cussed at item 10.0 above, it should be noted that the above provisions only apply if the reinsurance pol- icy is offered or entered into in New Zealand. Also the provisions apply to nonresident life insurers only in respect of their business of life insurance which consists of policies offered or entered into in New Zealand. 12.0 APPLICATION OF THE NEW REGIME TO MUTUAL ASSOC- IATIONS AND TRUSTS (Section 204P) The new life insurance regime applies to any person who carries on the business of life insurance. Section 204P clarifies the scope of the application of the regime. This section provides that to the extent that any person provides to another person for consid- eration benefits contingent upon the death or sur- vival of a human being then that person is deemed to carry on the business of life insurance, and hence would be subject to the new regime. The provisions of section 199 of the Act (which relate to mutual associations and provide that although assessable profits are deemed to be made for transactions between the association and its members, rebates paid to members are also deductible) will not apply, and the person whose life is insured and the life insurer are deemed to be separate unrelated per- sons. However this is not deemed to be the business of providing life insurance if the consideration is natu- ral love and affection, or the benefits provided are either: (i) Medical or accident insurance where the only benefits contingent on human life are benefits contingent upon death from a specified cause or death from a specified cause as an inciden- tal element to the provision of medical or accident insurance; or (ii) Provided by a superannuation fund where the only benefits are the return of beneficiar- ies’ contributions together with allocated in- vestment earnings. The effect of this is that family dealings will not be treated as the business of life insurance, and the implicit definition of life insurance in section 204P has parity with the definition inserted into section 2 as discussed at item 2.0 above. It is important to note that this provision means in practice that with limited exceptions, the provision of life insurance benefits from one person to another person is deemed to be the business of life insurance. Therefore entities which commonly provide these benefits, for instance superannuation funds which provide lump sums payable upon the death of the contributor are, for income tax purposes, partly carrying on the business of providing life insurance. In order not to be treated as a life insurer, the person would need to enter into a reinsurance policy in New Zealand which fully reinsures the life insurance liability. This would mean that section 204N (dis- cussed at item 10.0 above) would deem that no life insurance business was being carried on. 12.1 SUPERANNUATION SCHEMES (Section 204Q) There are a number of difficulties in applying the formulae for Underwriting Income (Mortality Profit, Premium Loading and Discontinuance Profit) to superannuation schemes. In order to allow time for these concerns to be addressed, two limited exemp- tions for certain superannuation schemes from the new life insurance regime have been provided in section 204Q. However, the section specifically confirms the point discussed at item 12.0 above, that where a trustee of a superannuation scheme provides any life insur- ance to members or beneficiaries of the scheme that scheme will, subject to the exemptions discussed below, be treated as providing life insurance. Firstly, an exemption in respect of all superannua- tion funds other than those to which property is transferred pursuant to an arrangement under Part VI of the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989, is pro- vided for the 1991 income year. This exemption from the regime is for a single income year, the 1991 year. After this date all superannuation funds, other than those which qualify for the second exemption dis- cussed below, will be subject to the new life insur- ance taxation regime if they are providing life insur- ance benefits to members or beneficiaries. Briefly, those superannuation funds which do not qualify for this one year exemption are those set up or used for the separation of a life insurer’s superannuation business into separate superannuation funds. The reasons for the separation and the mechanics of the transfer are discussed in more detail at item 22.0 below. The second exemption is a continuing exemption from the regime for a superannuation fund that is a “Qualifying Superannuation Scheme” as defined. In substance, a Qualifying Superannuation Scheme is 10 an employer funded superannuation scheme for the benefit of employees. The definition of “Qualifying Superannuation Scheme” is very specific in order to prevent any tax avoidance opportunity which may be afforded by the exemption, and is provided in section 204Q(4) as a superannuation scheme that, at all times in an income year: Either(i) Was set up by an employer or group of employers to provide benefits to, and make contributions to, a super- annuation fund only on behalf of employees, former employees and relatives or dependents of employ- ees or former employees; or (ii) Was constituted pursuant to any Act relating to the National Provi- dent Fund or the Government Su- perannuation Fund and in respect of the employer who makes contri- butions to the fund, provides bene- fits to employees, former employ- ees and relatives of employees or former employees; and Is registered by the Government Actuary un- der the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989; and No trustee is carrying on the business of life insurance under the Life Insurance Act 1908; and The only beneficiaries are natural persons; and The employer provides significant contribu- tions to the superannuation fund; not just to the cost of its administration; and The superannuation fund has not been estab- lished or utilised in a manner which has the effect of defeating the intent and application of the new life insurance taxation regime. In addition, the scheme must apply in writing to the Government Actuary to qualify for this exemption, and the Government Actuary must be satisfied that the scheme satisfies the above requirements. If the Government Actuary is no longer satisfied that a superannuation scheme qualifies for this exemp- tion, then the scheme ceases to be a Qualifying Superannuation Scheme from any date the Govern- ment Actuary determines. If a superannuation scheme qualifies for an exemp- tion from the life insurance regime, it will fall to be taxed according to the “ordinary” provisions of the Act which apply to superannuation schemes. The exemption afforded is not an exemption from in- come tax, but an exemption from the application of the new life insurance taxation regime. Similar to the provisions discussed for section 204P at item 12.0 above, in order not to be treated as a life insurer, the superannuation scheme would need to enter into a reinsurance policy in New Zealand which fully reinsures the life insurance liability. This would mean that section 204N (discussed at item 10.0 above) would deem that no life insurance busi- ness was being carried on. It is only necessary to reinsure the benefits which are contingent on human life, as if these are reinsured section 204Q will not apply to deem all of the business of the superannua- tion scheme to be the provision of life insurance. (B)POLICYHOLDER INCOME 13.0 CALCULATION OF POLICY- HOLDER INCOME The new section 205 defines the policyholder base income (or loss) on which a life insurer is required to pay tax in addition to the life office base discussed at item 5.0 above. Policyholder income arises from profits attributable to the policyholders. During an income year a life office will distribute some of its income to its actuar- ial reserves for policyholders and some will be distributed directly in claims to policyholders. Since individual policyholders are not taxed on income which is distributed to them, the policyholder tax must be deducted by the life office before the income is distributed. Therefore the life office pays tax as a proxy for the policyholders. Net policyholder income is found by adding to- gether claims, increases in actuarial reserves, and subtracting premiums received net of Underwriting Income as calculated in section 204B. As the amount distributed to policyholders is net of tax, it is neces- sary to gross up this amount by dividing by the after tax rate of income in order to ascertain the pretax figure. Policyholder income is given by: Policyholder (c + (v1 - v0) - (p - u)) Income= (1 - r ) or Loss where : c is the total of all claims due or payable in that year and all claims incurred in previous years (after 1 April 1990) but not included as such in policyholder income or loss for those years. v1 is the total of actuarial reserves at the end of the income year 11 v0 is the total of actuarial reserves at the begin- ning of the income year p is the total of all premiums due or payable in that year (excluding those payable in previ- ous years) u is the Underwriting Income, namely Mortal- ity Profit, Premium Loading and Discontinu- ance Profit, derived by the life insurer as determined under sections 204 to 204Q ris the rate of tax for policyholder income as set out in clause 2A of Part A of the First Schedule to the Act. This rate is currently set at 33 cents per dollar. The life insurer is liable to pay tax on the income resulting at the same rate as item “r” in the formula above. However the liability for tax on the policy- holder base may be substantially reduced or fully offset by utilising imputation credits resulting from the payment of tax on the life insurer income. This is discussed in more detail at item 18.0 below. 13.1 NON-RESIDENT LIFE INSURERS (Section 205A) As with the calculation of Life Insurer income dis- cussed at item 9.0 above, the calculation of Policy- holder Income for a nonresident life insurer is done only in respect of policies offered or entered into in New Zealand. Again, this is irrespective of whether or not the policies were executed in New Zealand, or whether or not the life insurer has an agent or fixed establishment in New Zealand. The amount of Policyholder Income calculated is deemed to be derived from New Zealand for the purposes of section 242 of the Act by section 205A of the Act. 14.0 PARTIAL REINSURANCE (Section 205B) Where a life insurer takes out reinsurance policies which were offered or entered into in New Zealand, an adjustment is made in the Policyholder Income calculation for the premiums payable and claims receivable under the reinsurance policies. It should be noted that no adjustment may be made if the reinsurance policies were offered and entered into outside New Zealand. Where the reinsurance policies qualify, a deduction is made from item “p” of the Policyholder Income formula as follows: Deduction from item “p” = rp - rc where: rp is total of premiums due and payable for reinsurance due or payable in that income year; and rc is the total of claims receivable in respect of reinsurance in that income year; As with other provisions discussed earlier, for non- resident life insurers the adjustment for reinsurance policies applies only in respect of reinsurance poli- cies relating to the nonresident’s business of life insurance which consists of life insurance policies offered or entered into in New Zealand. 15.0 STATUS OF POLICYHOLDER INCOME OR LOSS As the Policyholder tax is payable as a proxy for the policyholders, there are a number of provisions which ensure that the Policyholder Income or Loss is held only for the benefit of policyholders, and is not available for the use of the life insurer or its owners. The two income bases for a life insurer discussed at item 4.0 above, being Life Insurer Income and Poli- cyholder Income are completely separate. As dis- cussed earlier, the Life Insurer Income is akin to the "ordinary" income of any taxpayer. Provided the relevant criteria in the rest of the Act, particularly sections 188 and 191 are satisfied, losses from group companies or prior year Life Insurer Losses may be offset against current year Life Insurer Income. Al- ternatively, Life Insurer Losses may be offset against other group income or carried forward to be offset against future Life Insurer Income. In contrast, as the provisions outlined below show, Policyholder Income and Losses are effectively quar- antined and are not available for offset against any other type of income or loss for any taxpayer. 15.1 POLICYHOLDER LOSSES Section 205C provides that Policyholder Losses may be carried forward and set off only against future Policyholder Income. This means that a Policyholder Loss is not available for offset against Life Insurer Income. In addition Policyholder losses may be carried forward irrespective of the requirements of section 188(7) of the Act. This has the effect that the 40% continuity of shareholding requirements to en- able the carrying forward of losses do not apply in respect of Policyholder Losses. In addition any losses remaining to be carried for- ward from the old section 204 are to be treated under 12 the new life insurance taxation regime as if they are Policyholder Losses. The reason for this is that the old life insurance regime also taxed the life insurer as a proxy for the policyholders and hence this treat- ment is preserved. So any losses remaining to be carried forward at the end of the 1990 income year may not be used as an offset against income from the Life Insurer base. Sections 205D and 205F confirm specifically that Policyholder Losses cannot be offset against any other form of assessable income, and that no expen- diture or loss may be deducted from or offset against Policyholder Income except as specifically author- ised in the Act. 15.2DETERMINATION OF POLICYHOLDER LOSSES As with other taxpayers, where a life insurer has a policyholder loss for an income year the Commis- sioner is obliged to make a determination of that loss and give notice of it to the life insurer (Section 205E). However the omission to give a Notice of Determi- nation of Policyholder Loss would not invalidate any assessment or determination of policyholder loss. 16.0IMPUTATION ASPECTS OF THE NEW LIFE INSURANCE REGIME Under the old life insurance taxation regime, life insurance companies were taxed as a proxy for the policyholders. Therefore as would be the case for policyholders, the life insurance companies were unable to maintain an Imputation Credit Account (“ICA”) as that term is defined in section 394A of the Act. For the same reason, life insurance companies were not eligible for exemption from income tax for intercompany dividends as provided in section 63 of the Act. As life insurance companies are now to be taxed on two income bases, one being their ‘ordinary’ income or Life Insurer Income, and the other as a proxy for the policyholders, or Policyholder Income, life in- surance companies are now required to maintain an ICA and are eligible for the intercompany dividend exemption. They may therefore pass on the imputa- tion credits in respect of dividends received and may attach imputation credits to dividends paid. Tax is payable on both of the life insurance com- pany’s income bases, however the liability for tax on Policyholder Income may be offset in whole or in part by utilising imputation credits arising in the company’s ICA. Imputation credits are offset against the tax liability on Policyholder Income through a Policyholder Credit Account which operates in a similar manner to an ICA. Policyholder Credit Ac- counts are discussed in more detail at item 18.0 below. Only New Zealand resident companies are eligible for the above treatment, and special provi- sion is made for taxpayers who are not New Zealand resident companies. These are discussed in greater detail at item 18.2 below. 17.0 IMPUTATION CREDIT ACCOUNTS Section 394B of the Act is amended so that life insurance companies are no longer exempted from the requirement to maintain an ICA. Life insurance companies will be treated no differently in this respect to any other taxpayer. Therefore a life insur- ance company resident in New Zealand will be required to maintain an ICA. As with other companies not resident in New Zea- land, life insurance companies which are not resi- dent in New Zealand will continue to be unable to maintain an ICA as provided by section 394B(2) of the Act. As noted above, for the purposes of the new life insurance taxation regime these nonresident companies would be an “Other Person” and special provision is made for them to offset credits for the payment of tax on Life Insurer Income against the liability for tax on Policyholder Income. This is discussed at item 18.2.3 below. The ICA of a New Zealand life insurance company will operate in a similar manner to that of other New Zealand companies. However there are a number of provisions which have been inserted in the legisla- tion governing full imputation as a result of the new life insurance taxation regime. 17.1CREDITS ARISING TO IMPUTATION CREDIT ACCOUNTS The new section 394D(1)(a)(ii) provides that no im- putation credits will arise from the payment of tax on Policyholder Income by a company carrying on a business of providing life insurance to which section 205 applies, with effect from the 1991 imputation year. This means that the income tax paid as a proxy for the policyholders does not give rise to credits which could be passed on to shareholders of the company. A transfer from a company’s Policyholder Credit Account (“PCA”) to its ICA has been provided for in section 394D(1)(l), and this transfer gives rise to a credit in the ICA when the company elects to make the transfer. Transfers to and from the PCA are discussed in more detail at item 17.3 below. 17.3DEBITS ARISING TO IMPUTATION CREDIT ACCOUNT A new debit to an ICA in terms of section 394E(1)(aa) has been created for New Zealand resident life 13 insurance companies to reflect transfers to a PCA from the ICA. As discussed at item 18.0 below, transfers to and from the PCA represent credits in the ICA which have been transferred to the PCA to be used as an offset against tax payable on policy- holder income. For a New Zealand resident com- pany, a PCA will not in general have any entries generated in its PCA in their own right other than the offset against the tax liability on Policyholder In- come, all entries represent transfers to and from the ICA. There is no compulsion on a New Zealand resident life insurance company to transfer its imputation credits (although there are some deemed transfers these may be transferred back to the ICA after a time period, see item 18.0 below) and use them as an offset against the tax liability on Policyholder In- come. They may be retained or distributed attached to dividends if the company wishes. However the liability for tax on Policyholder Income would then be required to be settled by an actual payment of tax rather than an offset, and it is therefore likely that in most cases the credits will be used to offset the tax liability on Policyholder Income. 17.3.1 DEBIT TO APPROXIMATE NON- RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX Another new debit is created for New Zealand resident life insurance companies in terms of section 394E(1)(ab) whenever the company receives a divi- dend which is exempt from tax to the insurer and in respect of which the company is not required to make a dividend withholding payment deduction. In other words, in respect of most dividends re- ceived from New Zealand resident companies. The debit to the ICA is calculated at section 394E(2A) of the Act as 18% of the lesser of either: (a) The total of the dividend, plus any imputation credit attached to the dividend, plus any divi- dend withholding payment credit attached to that dividend; or (b) a x c b where : a is Policyholder Income or Loss which would have been calculated under sections 205 to 205F only in respect of policies where the holder is not a resident of New Zealand; and b is Policyholder Income or Loss which was calculated under sections 205 to 205F in re- spect of all policies; (if this is nil or less than zero, item “b” is deemed to be the same as item “a”); and c is the aggregate of the dividend plus any imputation credit and dividend withholding payment credit attached to the dividend. The reason for this adjustment is to account for the non-resident policyholders of the life insurer. A non- resident policyholder would ordinarily be unable to utilise imputation or withholding payment credits attached to dividends received, and would instead have Nonresident Withholding Tax levied on the dividend. Therefore as the life insurer is taxed as a proxy for the policyholders, it is necessary to ap- proximate the treatment of dividends received by the life insurer and distributed to the policyholders through bonuses and actuarial reserves. Thus the credits attached to dividends are appor- tioned by the level of policyholder income which relates to non-resident policyholders, and charges Nonresident Withholding Tax on the dividend re- ceived. Since the dividend is effectively received net of withholding tax an adjustment is first made to gross up the amount to reflect its pre-tax value, and then the withholding tax is levied. Instead of requir- ing the company to remit this amount to the Depart- ment, and since the adjustment is by necessity an estimate, the life insurer is required to treat the amount as a debit to its ICA, thereby reducing the credits available to be offset against the tax liability on Policyholder Income. 17.3.2 TRANSFER OF CREDIT BALANCE FROM IMPUTATION CREDIT ACCOUNT TO POLICYHOLDER CREDIT ACCOUNT (Section 394FA) A New Zealand resident life insurance company is able to transfer credits arising in its ICA to its PCA by election. This transfer arises in both accounts on the date of the election. The transfer of credits allows the company the opportunity to offset the credits arising from the payment of tax on Life Insurer Income against the liability for tax on Policyholder Income. However there are a number of provisions which deem a transfer in certain circumstances, and pro- hibit a transfer in others. The application of these provisions is designed to ensure that a New Zealand resident company that is a life insurer is not able to utilise imputation credits which arise in its ICA in respect of a future imputation year against a tax liability on Policyholder Income which arose in a prior income year which operates on a different date due to the company having a nonstandard balance date. Where a company has a nonstandard balance date, there are two deemed transfers from the ICA to the 14 PCA on the last day of the imputation year. Firstly, by virtue of section 394FA(3)(a), where there are imputation credits arising from the payment of pro- visional tax before the end of the imputation year and during the accounting year in which the last day of the imputation year falls, and the credit has not been offset by a refund of provisional tax then the company is deemed to have elected that any balance of the provisional tax credits shall be transferred from the ICA to the PCA on the last day of the imputation year (31 March). Secondly, under section 394FA(3)(b), where the com- pany does not operate a WPA and receives a divi- dend with withholding payment credits attached these will give rise to credits in the ICA. In a similar manner to the provisional tax credits discussed above, where the credits in the ICA relating to withholding payment credits on dividends are re- ceived before the last day of the imputation year during the accounting year in which the last day of the imputation year falls, and have not been offset by a refund of any dividend withholding payment then the company is deemed to have elected that the balance of the withholding payment credits shall be transferred from the ICA to the PCA on the last day of the imputation year. In addition, by virtue of section 394FA(3)(c), the company is unable to transfer credits from its ICA to its PCA during the period from 31 March until the end of the company’s imputation year, if the credits relate to imputation credits or dividend withhold- ing payment credits attached to dividends received. 17.4DIVIDEND WITHHOLDING PAYMENT ACCOUNTS Section 394ZT of the Act now allows a New Zealand resident life insurance company to operate a Divi- dend Withholding Payment Account if it elects to do so. The effect of this is that the life insurer is able to elect to make transfers to its PCA from its WPA. However as dividend withholding payments are refundable if not fully utilised by the person who ultimately receives them, there are provisions to ensure that a life insurer is unable to stream these credits to its shareholders as opposed to its policy- holders. 17.4.1TRANSFERS FROM WITHHOLDING PAY- MENTS ACCOUNT TO POLICYHOLDER CREDIT ACCOUNT Section 394ZW of the Act now provides for a new debit to a company’s WPA for transfers from the WPA to the PCA. In addition there is an additional debit for a new penalty, an allocation deficit debit which relates to the rate at which dividend with- holding payments were allocated to shareholders as opposed to policyholders. Briefly, the transfers from the WPA to the PCA are achieved in a similar manner to those from the ICA to the PCA and this is recorded in both accounts on the date of the election. In addition, where credits have arisen to the WPA as a result of dividend withholding payments made by the company before the end of the imputation year and during the ac- counting year in which that imputation year falls, and these have not been subsequently offset by a refund of a dividend withholding payment, then the company is deemed to have elected to transfer the credit to the PCA on the last day of the imputation year. However where a credit has arisen to the WPA by virtue of a withholding payment credit attached to a dividend received by the company, the company may not elect to transfer any part of that credit to the PCA during the period from the last day of the imputation year until the end of the company’s accounting year in which the last day of the imputa- tion year falls. 17.4.2 ALLOCATION RULES FOR WITHHOLD- ING PAYMENT CREDITS As withholding payments are refundable to the person who ultimately receives them, there are pro- visions inserted into section 394ZY to ensure that life insurers do not stream imputation credits which are not refundable to policyholders, and withholding credits which are refundable to shareholders. A comparison of two ratios is undertaken : a versus e - f bg where : a is the total of all transfers which the company has elected to make from the WPA to the PCA during that imputation year; and b is the total of all credits arising in the WPA in that imputation year; and e is the total of all transfers from the ICA to the PCA during that imputation year; and fis the total of all transfers from the PCA to the ICA during that imputation year; and g is the total of all credits to the ICA during that imputation year other than transfers from the PCA to the ICA. Where the ratio of “a/b” is less than the other ratio, there is a deemed debit to the WPA, called an “Allocation Deficit Debit” for an amount which 15 would be required to be added to item “a” in order to make the two ratios equal. Therefore to avoid this penalty, life insurance companies must ensure that policyholders share in any withholding payment credits allocated in an equivalent proportion to the level of imputation credits allocated to them. 18.0 POLICYHOLDER CREDIT ACCOUNTS Section 56 of the Amendment Act inserts a new Part XIID into the Act with effect from 1 April 1990. This part of the Act relates to a Policyholder Credit Account (“PCA”) which is the mechanism for a life insurer to offset credits resulting from the payment of tax on Life Insurer Income against the liability for tax on Policyholder Income. A PCA will operate in a similar manner as an Imputation Credit Account (“ICA”) which is re- quired to be maintained by most New Zealand resident companies. Briefly, payments of tax on Life Insurer Income will also be recorded as credits in this account. This credit balance in the PCA will be able to be used to offset tax payable on Policyholder Income. As life insurers which are New Zealand resident companies will now be required to maintain ICAs, there are a number of provisions within Part XIID of the Act to enable transfers between the accounts, and to limit any tax avoidance or deferral opportu- nities which may arise as a result of the two accounts operating. 18.1 NEW ZEALAND RESIDENT COMPANIES A New Zealand resident company which is a life insurer, is required by section 394ZZZ to establish and maintain a PCA, and is thus described as a PCA Company. As discussed above, this is a memoran- dum account similar to the ICA and functions to recognise the tax paid on policyholder’s income. PCAs for life insurers that are not New Zealand resident companies are discussed at item 18.2 below. Each PCA Company is required to record in the PCA the opening balance and debits and credits as they arise. The PCA for a New Zealand resident company will operate on the imputation year (31 March bal- ance date), and the account commences on 1 April 1990 with a nil balance. As the provisions discussed below demonstrate, to a large extent, a PCA for a New Zealand resident company operates subservient to the ICA and the associated Dividend Withholding Payment Account (“WPA”). It should be noted that the provisions of the Act only allow a PCA Company to utilise a credit balance within the PCA. In other words, the PCA is not able to go into debit and be overdrawn. Section 394ZZZB provides that credits to the PCA of a New Zealand resident company arise from trans- fers which the company elects to make from either the ICA in terms of section 394FA of the Act, or from the WPA in terms of section 394ZXA of the Act. In either case the date the credit arises is the date of the election. Similarly, the contra entry within the ICA or WPA occurs at the same time as the entry in the PCA. A PCA Company may elect to offset the credit balance in its PCA against tax payable on Policy- holder Income as provided in section 394ZZZC of the Act. This creates a debit to the PCA and the entry arises in the account on the last day of the company’s income year to which the payment of the tax relates. Alternatively, a company may elect to transfer the credit balance in the PCA back to the ICA, with the entry in both accounts arising on the date of the election. The Commissioner is given the authority by section 394ZZZD of the Act to correct the amount or date of any entry in a PCA if the Commissioner is satisfied that there was an error made or that an entry should not have been recorded. As soon as is possible after the Commissioner determines that an adjustment is required, The Commissioner is required to give notice of this determination to the taxpayer. How- ever omitting to give the notice does not invalidate any determination. The company has the power to object to any determination made by the Commis- sioner, but otherwise it is required to make the required corrections to the PCA. 18.2 POLICYHOLDER CREDIT ACCOUNTS OF OTHER PERSONS In terms of section 394ZZZE of the Act, any person carrying on the business of providing life insurance (other than a PCA Company as discussed at item 18.1 above), may elect at any time during an income year to maintain a PCA. The election takes effect from the beginning of that income year, and contin- ues in effect until the beginning of the income year in which the person elects to cease operating a PCA. If a person does elect to maintain a PCA, then notifica- tion of this election must be given to the Commis- sioner within 21 days. Each PCA Person is required by section 394ZZZF to record in the PCA the opening balance and debits and credits as they arise. The PCA for a New Zea- land resident company will operate on the balance date of the person. The account commences with a nil balance. 16 18.2.1 CREDITS ARISING TO POLICYHOLDER CREDIT ACCOUNT OF OTHER PERSON Section 394ZZZG provides that credits arise to a person’s PCA in the same way as if to the extent that person carries on business in New Zealand, that person were a New Zealand resident company and the PCA were in fact an ICA. However since these persons are unable to maintain an ICA a number of the usual provisions do not apply. For instance the provisions allowing transfers between an ICA and a PCA will not apply as there is in fact no ICA to make transfers from. The date upon which the credits arise to the PCA is the equivalent date as if it were an ICA. In practice it is likely that most credits will arise from the payment of tax on Life Insurer Income, and this will be recorded as at the date the tax was paid. As a person other than a New Zealand resident company is taxed on dividends received, section 394ZZZG(1)(c) provides that credits will not arise to the PCA for imputation credits or dividend with- holding payment credits attached to dividends re- ceived. The credits are treated in the same manner as for any other taxpayer and are allowed as a credit against income tax payable on Life Insurer Income in terms of sections 394ZE, 394ZP or 394ZZV as appro- priate. The credit obtained by the life insurer is deemed to be paid on the date upon which the dividend is paid. 18.2.2 LIMITATION ON CREDITS FOR NON- RESIDENTS The credits arising to the PCA for tax paid are limited in the case of a nonresident life insurer by section 394ZZZG(6). This subsection provides that notwithstanding the other provisions outlined above, for a nonresident life insurer credits for income tax paid are only available for income tax paid in respect of an amount included in item “i” (Other Income) of the Life Insurer Income formula for a nonresident life insurer (see item 9.0 above), or tax paid in respect of an amount of nonresident withholding income which was assessed separately by virtue of section 317 of the Act. Consequentially, debits only arise in respect of refunds of tax paid on these items. The reason for this is that credits are only available in respect of income which is New Zealand sourced, and has had New Zealand income tax paid on it. Therefore, if New Zealand policyholders have re- ceived distributions funded from sources outside New Zealand, and hence Policyholder Income is increased, the credits available to offset against this income are still limited to the tax paid on Life Insurer Income in New Zealand, and as a consequence additional tax may be payable on Policyholder In- come. 18.2.3 DEBITS ARISING TO POLICYHOLDER CREDIT ACCOUNT OF OTHER PERSON The PCA person may elect in terms of section 394ZZZH of the Act to offset credits in the PCA against tax payable on Policyholder Income. This is entered in the PCA on the date that the person makes the election. Similar to the situation for credits discussed above, debits to a person’s PCA arise as if to the extent the person carries on the business of life insurance in New Zealand, that person were a New Zealand resident company, and the PCA were an ICA. Again the provisions relating to transfers between the ICA do not apply. Also the provision substituting NonResident Withholding Tax for imputation cred- its (discussed at item 17.3.1 above) and the continu- ity of ownership provisions contained at section 394E(1)(g) of the Act do not apply. 18.2.4ANNUAL RETURN FOR A POLICY- HOLDER CREDIT ACCOUNT PERSON Every PCA Person is required by section 394ZZZI to provide an annual PCA return for each income year. It must state the opening and closing balances of the PCA, the amount and source of credits and debits that have arisen during the year and any further information specified by the Commissioner. This return is required to be furnished at the same time as the annual return of income. 18.2.5 REFUND OF INCOME TAX NOT TO EX- CEED CREDIT BALANCE OF POLICY- HOLDER CREDIT ACCOUNT As from the 1991 income year onwards as provided at section 394ZZZJ, where a PCA Person becomes entitled to a refund of income tax the amount paid shall not exceed the credit balance in the PCA at the later of either: The end of the last income year; or The last day of any period where a person furnishes a PCA return. Where an income tax refund is not paid to the taxpayer, it will be credited against income tax payable or provisional tax payable in the year in which the refund arose or in a subsequent year. 19.0 TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO LIFE INSURERS A number of transitional provisions have been in- cluded in the Amendment Act to take account of the fact that the Amendment Act was assented to during the 1991 income year and that a number of the PCA provisions need to have retrospective effect. In addi- tion, for a New Zealand resident life insurance 17 company there are provisions to take account of the problems which result if the company’s balance date differs from the 31 March balance date of its PCA and its Branch Equivalent Tax Account. 19.1RESIDENT LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES WITH NON-STANDARD BALANCE DATES Section 65 of the Amendment Act provides the details to enable the new life insurance system to be incorporated into the existing imputation, dividend withholding payment and branch equivalent tax systems for PCA Companies which have a balance date other than 31 March. If the company has an early balance date, that is it balances on a date from 1 October to 30 March each year, the company is required by section 65(1) of the Amendment Act, to maintain an imputation account for the period from the first day of the income year until 31 March 1990. This is in effect an imputation account for the period from the beginning of the 1991 income year for these companies until the balance date of the imputation year. After this, the imputa- tion account will continue with a 31 March balance date. A New Zealand resident life insurance com- pany may elect on or before 30 September 1990 that it will be a WPA Company with effect from the beginning of the 1991 income year. In addition, where the company operates an ICA, a WPA or a PCA then no credits arise in any of these accounts before the commencement of the com- pany’s 1991 income year. Similarly, in respect of late balance date (from 1 April to 30 September) companies, the ICA com- mences from 1 April 1990, but no credits arise in it until the commencement of the company’s 1991 income year. 19.2RESIDENT LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES WITH BRANCH EQUIVALENT TAX ACCOUNTS Where a company that is a resident life insurer has a late balance date for the 1990 income year, is a Branch Equivalent Tax Account (“BETA”) person and does not elect to cease to be so, then it is deemed by section 66(1) of the Amendment Act to have elected under section 394ZZN to be a BETA com- pany from 1 April 1990. As a BETA person, the life insurer would previously have operated its BETA with a balance date the same as its own. As a BETA company, the BETA operates on a 31 March balance date. Therefore, there are provisions to cover the transition from being a BETA person to a BETA company. Briefly, for standard balance date compa- nies the changeover occurs with no real problems, the closing balance of the person’s BETA becomes the opening balance of the company’s BETA. In respect of late balance date companies, a final BETA account as a person is required to be furnished before 30 September 1990 for the period from the first day of the company’s accounting year until 31 March 1990. The closing balance of this account becomes the opening balance of the BETA as a BETA company from 1 April 1990 onwards. Early balance date companies that were BETA per- sons are subject to the same provisions as late bal- ance date companies unless they elect before 30 September 1990 to be treated as a BETA company from the first day of their 1991 income year, in terms of section 66(3) of the Amendment Act. If the com- pany elects for this to happen, the changeover from BETA person to BETA company occurs on the first day of the company’s 1991 income year. The com- pany is required to maintain the BETA for the period to 31 March 1990 and thereafter it reverts to the standard 31 March balance date. Section 66(4) of the Amendment Act provides that a New Zealand resident life insurance company may not make transfers to its imputation account in respect of amounts arising in its BETA in respect of the 1990 or prior income years. This is designed to prevent back-year income tax payments under the old life insurance taxation regime being used to offset Policyholder Income derived under the new life insurance taxation regime. 20.0 FRINGE BENEFITS TAX ON LOW INTEREST LOANS TO POLICY- HOLDERS Section 32(7) of the Amendment Act inserts a new subsection 9 into section 336N of the Act. This provides that where a policyholder owes a loan to a life insurer, then this is treated as if it were a loan to an employee by an employer. The effect of this provision is that fringe benefits tax will be payable if the interest rate on the loan is less than the prescribed rate of interest prevailing at the time for fringe benefits tax purposes. 21.0SEPARATION OF SUPERANNUA- TION BUSINESS OUT OF A LIFE FUND TO A SUPERANNUATION SCHEME Following submissions made to the Consultative Committee on Superannuation, Life Insurance and Related Areas the Committee decided that provided the service being offered is essentially the same, superannuation offered by a life insurer should be subject to the same tax regime as registered superan- nuation funds. To facilitate this, the Committee proposed that life insurers should be allowed to transfer assets, without a taxation penalty, to a superannuation fund which would be taxed under 18 the taxation regime applying to superannuation. The provisions enabling this transfer are contained in a new section 206 of the Act and a new Part VI to the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. All applica- tions for approval of transfers must be made before 1 January 1992. The emphasis for these transfers is that if the life insurer’s superannuation liabilities are to be trans- ferred to another entity, thereby relieving the in- surer of liability, then the amount of the liability must be carefully determined, and assets of value equivalent to this liability must be transferred con- temporaneously. Therefore the requirements are very strict as to certification from an actuary of the amount of the liability and an independent valua- tion of the property to be transferred to fund the liability. In general terms the legislation to effect the transfers provides that no Gift Duty, Stamp Duty or Goods and Services Tax liability arises from the transfer. For income tax purposes, the transfer is still taxable, however the life insurer is deemed to have sold the property at cost price (or book value in some cases) and therefore no assessable income arises. The super- annuation fund is deemed to have purchased the property on the same day as it was originally ac- quired by the life insurer and for the same price. There are provisions to ensure that the property is in effect subject to an unchanged taxation regime for the period to 1 April 1988 when the income of superannuation schemes became taxable. It is important to note that the enabling provisions do not allow any special exemptions from tax or duty in respect of indirect transfers of property. That is, the transfer of the property must be from a life insurer directly to a registered superannuation scheme and not through an intermediary entity. For instance, the transfer of an interest in a parcel of land may not be achieved by transferring ownership of the land to a company or unit trust and then distrib- uting the shares of the company or units of the trust to the life insurer and the superannuation scheme. 22.0 MECHANISM FOR THE TRANSFER OF SUPERANNUATION ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (Part VI Superan- nuation Schemes Act 1989) The new Part VI of the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 which allows for the transfer of superannuation assets and liabilities is inserted by section 5 of the Superannuation Schemes Amendment Act 1990. 22.1 APPLICATION FOR APPROVAL OF THE TRANSFER As noted above, Part VI of the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 provides the framework for the actual transfer of superannuation assets and liabili- ties to occur. Where a life insurer proposes to trans- fer property to a superannuation scheme in consid- eration for the trustee of the scheme assuming super- annuation liabilities of the life insurer, the life in- surer may apply under section 68 of the Superannua- tion Schemes Act 1989, to the Government Actuary for approval of the transfer. An application under section 68 of the Superannua- tion Schemes Act 1989 must be accompanied by: A report from an actuary on behalf of the life insurer which states the assumptions and bases of calculation used in determining the value of the liabilities, together with a statement that these assumptions and bases of calcula- tion are appropriate for determining the lia- bilities; and An independent valuation of the property certified by a person approved by the Govern- ment Actuary; and A certificate from a solicitor stating that either: (i) That the trust deed of the superannuation scheme receiving the assets and liabilities does not contain any of the following pro- visions: Provisions necessary to ensure consis- tency with provisions implied or re- quired by the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989; or Provisions giving the trustee power to borrow money for the purposes of the superannuation scheme at the trustee’s discretion; or Subject to the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989, provisions giving the trustee the benefit of limited liability; or A provision giving a proportion of the beneficiaries the power to totally or partially wind up the scheme; or A provision giving the trustee the abil- ity to pay scheme management and administration expenses out of the prop- erty of the scheme; or (ii) A statement that the inclusion of any of the above provisions in the trust deed will not detrimentally affect any beneficiary in any material way. In terms of section 68(4) of the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989, the property which is transferred 19 to the superannuation scheme must be determined by an actuary who is required to have regard to the actuarial soundness of both the life insurer and the superannuation scheme before and after the pro- posed transfer. The actuary is also required to con- sider the terms and conditions determining the lia- bilities of the life insurer which are to be assumed by the scheme immediately before the proposed trans- fer and any allocation of assets made by the life insurer in the past against its superannuation liabili- ties. In addition the assets are required to be valued in a manner or by a person who is acceptable to the Government Actuary for the purposes of the inde- pendent valuation. In other words, an actuary is required to ensure that the transfer is equitable having regard to the previ- ous actions of the life insurer, and it does not im- pinge on the soundness of either the life insurer or the superannuation scheme. Also the property trans- ferred must have been the subject of an independent valuation which was acceptable to the Government Actuary. A transfer cannot be made to a trustee of a superan- nuation scheme which carries on the business of providing life insurance for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1976 (Section 68(4)). As discussed earlier at item 12.1, where a superannuation scheme provides any benefits contingent on human life, it is treated as carrying on the business of life insurance for tax purposes. The only way to avoid this is to enter into a reinsurance policy in New Zealand which fully reinsures the life insurance risk. This means that for the purposes of the transfer of assets and liabilities, if the superannuation scheme pro- vides benefits contingent on human life it must enter into a full reinsurance policy either before the trans- fer or contemporaneously with the transfer, so that section 204N of the Income Tax Act 1976 will apply (see item 10.0 above) and that the scheme is not treated as a life insurer. It is likely in practice that this reinsurance policy will be with the life insurer that transferred the superan- nuation business to the scheme. If this occurs then the transfer has completely separated the life in- surer’s business of providing life insurance and only pure superannuation business is carried on by the superannuation scheme. Therefore there is no ques- tion that the new life insurance taxation regime could apply to these superannuation schemes unless they commence this business after the transfer, hence they are not included in the exemptions from the life insurance regime discussed at item 12.1 above. 22.2 APPROVAL BY THE GOVERNMENT ACTUARY If the transfer is given the Government Actuary’s approval in terms of section 69 of the Superannua- tion Schemes Act 1989 then the various tax exemp- tions are available. However if this approval is either not sought or not obtained the transfer will attract no special tax concessions, and will be subject to the duties and taxes which would otherwise prevail. If an application has been made, it will be approved by the Government Actuary where the Government Actuary is satisfied that: The trust deed of the superannuation scheme incorporates terms and conditions so that the liability of the trustee to the beneficiaries will be the same as those of the life insurer trans- ferring the policy. Alternatively, the Govern- ment Actuary may treat the liabilities as being the same where they differ only because the trust deed incorporates one or more of the provisions that the solicitor’s statement re- ports on (see item 22.1 above), and the inclu- sion of those provisions will not detrimentally affect any beneficiary in any material way; and The trustee of the superannuation scheme which will be assuming the liabilities has been advised of the details of the proposed transfer and consents to it; and Where the consideration for accepting the assets is the assumption by the superannua- tion scheme of the liability to provide benefits to any specific beneficiary, then that benefici- ary consents to the transfer arrangement (al- though where the beneficiary is a superan- nuation scheme, it is only necessary to obtain the consent of the trustee of that scheme); and The property to be transferred has been deter- mined and an independent valuation has been obtained by an actuary, and the property and valuation are appropriate for the purposes of the transfer. Where the Government Actuary does give approval for the transfer, then the Government Actuary may also specify the property to be transferred as part of that arrangement, to ensure that property of an appropriate type, amount or value is transferred. If the approval of the Government Actuary has been obtained, the property must be transferred from the life insurer to the superannuation scheme within three months of the date of the approval. If the transfer occurs within this time frame it is deemed to 20 be lawful notwithstanding that it may be contrary to the trust deed of the scheme, or that the consent of all members or beneficiaries to the scheme has not been obtained. Provided that the arrangement is approved by the Government Actuary under section 69 of the Super- annuation Schemes Act 1989, and the property is transferred within three months of the Government Actuary’s approval, then section 71 of the Superan- nuation Schemes Act 1989 will apply to exempt the transfer from Stamp Duty and also provides that any Goods and Services Tax chargeable on the transfer is charged at the rate of zero percent. For Income Tax purposes, the new section 206 of the Income Tax Act 1976 is deemed to apply to the transfer. It should be noted that if the approval of the Government Actu- ary is not sought or obtained, or if the transfer is not effected within three months of the approval being granted, the concessionary provisions will not ap- ply, and the transfer will be subject to ordinary tax provisions. 23.0 INCOME TAX IMPLICATIONS OF TRANSFERS OF SUPERANNUA- TION ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (Section 206) The new section 206 provides the Income Tax conse- quences for property transferred pursuant to an arrangement approved by the Government Actu- ary. In general terms the provisions of section 206 of the Act serve to ensure that the transfer is tax neutral whilst maintaining the taxation regimes which ap- plied in past years to the gains and losses accruing over that time. The reason for this is to ensure that the selection of the property to be transferred is an arm’s length decision, and is not influenced by any tax considerations. The actual treatment afforded by section 206 depends on the type of property trans- ferred. 23.1 FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS The provisions of section 206(3) apply where the property transferred is a financial arrangement (to which the “accruals rules” contained in sections 64B to 64L of the Act apply). Briefly, the sale and pur- chase of the financial arrangement is deemed to take place on the date of the transfer. The price to be taken into account is, at the option of the life insurer, either: The market value of the financial arrange- ment on the date of the transfer; or The “Adjusted Base Price”, which means: (i) Where the life insurer is the issuer (debtor) under the financial arrangement, the Adjusted Base Price is the acquisition price plus all accrued expenditure incurred by the issuer, less all consideration paid by the issuer in relation to the financial arrangement before the date of transfer; and (ii) Where the life insurer is the holder (creditor) under the financial arrangement, The Ad- justed Base Price is the acquisition price of the financial arrangement plus all income accrued to the holder, less all consideration received by the holder in relation to the financial ar- rangement before the date of the transfer. Therefore, at the option of the life insurer, the prop- erty is either transferred at market value and there are tax implications accordingly, or at ‘present value’ which would mean that only income accrued up to the date of the transfer is taken into account in the life insurer’s tax return when the Base Price Adjustment (as per section 64F) is done for the financial arrange- ment. 23.2 TRADING STOCKS Section 206(4) provides that where a life insurer transfers property which is trading stock pursuant to the arrangement then the sale and purchase of that property is deemed to take place on the date of the transfer. The life insurer is deemed to sell the prop- erty at the opening value used in the life insurer’s return of income for that trading stock. This in effect provides for a direct transfer of the value in the life insurer’s accounts into the accounts of the superan- nuation fund at no tax cost to the life insurer. 23.3 OTHER PROPERTY In the case of all other property, the transfer is deemed to take place either on the first day of the income year in which the transfer actually takes place (bearing in mind that transfer applications must be made before 1 January 1992; see item 21.0 above), alternatively if an application for approval from the Government Actuary was made before 1 April 1991 or the last day of the life insurer’s 1991 income year (whichever is the later), then the trans- fer is deemed to take place at the beginning of the 1991 income year. This means that all income de- rived after the effective date of the transfer is to be accounted for by the trustee of the superannuation scheme, and this is specifically confirmed in section 206(2)(b) of the Act. However for the purposes of calculating the gain or loss on sale or other disposal of any property, the trustee of the superannuation scheme is deemed to have acquired the property on the same date as when the life insurer originally acquired it. The trustee is deemed to have acquired the property at a price equal to the “Specified Base Cost for 1983 21 Income Year Property” (as discussed at item 6.1 above) if the property was acquired on or before the last day of the 1983 income year. If the property was acquired after that date then section 206(2)(c) of the Act provides that the trustee is deemed to have acquired the property for a price equal to the total of any of the following items which have not previously been claimed as deductions by the life insurer: (i) The original purchase price of the property; and (ii) Any expenditure incurred in purchasing the property; and (iii) Any expenditure incurred in effecting re- pairs, alterations, or improvements to the property; and (iv) Any expenditure incurred in securing or im- proving the legal rights of the life insurer in relation to the property; In other words the trustee is deemed to have in- curred the same amounts of capital expenditure in acquiring the property as the life insurer incurred itself, and for which the life insurer was unable to claim a deduction. In addition, the trustee of the superannuation scheme is deemed to have been allowed all deductions previously claimed by the life insurer or an associated person of the life insurer for interest in relation to the property, or under sections 126, 127 or 128 of the Act for certain expen- diture incurred in relation to farming land, forestry land or aquaculture businesses. In respect of depreciation, the trustee is deemed by section 206(2)(d) of the Act to have been allowed the same deductions for depreciation as were allowed for the life insurer. Also, for the purposes of calculat- ing the depreciation allowances now available to the trustee of the superannuation scheme, the book value of the property is deemed to be the price at which the trustee of the superannuation scheme is deemed to have acquired the property (as discussed above) less the depreciation previously claimed by the life insurer which is now deemed to have been allowed to the trustee of the superannuation scheme. As with the gains and losses on the sale or other disposal of property as calculated for Life Insurer Income (refer to item 6.1 above), the taxation regime which applied over the period gains and losses were accruing on property held by a life insurer is main- tained in respect of that property transferred to a superannuation scheme pursuant to an approved transfer. Therefore where the property was acquired before 1 April 1988 an equivalent adjustment is made to apportion the accrued gains and losses for the superannuation business which was until that date exempt from tax. In other words, the same a x c adjustment is made b(refer to item 6.1) The life insurer is deemed at section 206(2)(h) to have sold the property on the same date and for the same price as the trustee of the superannuation fund is deemed to have acquired it. This means in practice that although the transfer is taxable in the hands of the life insurer, no gain should result as the property is transferred at a value equal to the capitalised cost of the property. In addition, the life insurer is deemed not to derive any assessable income from depreciation which would otherwise be recovered on the sale of the property. Section 206(2)(g) sets out the provisions which will apply if the trustee of the superannuation fund is not taxable on the gains and losses on the sale or other disposal of any property. It is expected that there will be few (if any) superannuation schemes which will fall into this category. If the provisions apply then the trustee of the superannuation scheme is taxable upon sale or other disposal of the property, only on the amount of the gain which accrued before 1 April 1988, and this calculation will be subject to the apportionment for superannuation business as per section 206(2)(f) discussed above. 24.0 TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS There are a number of provisions contained in sec- tion 206 to ensure that the transfer of property to a superannuation scheme does not have tax impact as regards the property or the superannuation scheme. Section 206(5) ensures that the transfer of shares from the life insurer to a superannuation scheme will be treated as being held by the same persons for the purposes of determining continuity of shareholding for losses carried forward, determining whether a specified group exists or for the holding of credits in the company’s Imputation Credit Account, With- holding Payment Account or Branch Equivalent Tax Account. Also, there is a provision at section 206(6) to ensure that the superannuation scheme is not subject to section 232B of the Act. The latter section provides for the taxation of gains or losses from investments made before 1 April 1988. As discussed above, there are specific rules in respect of superannuation schemes to which property is transferred pursuant to an approved transfer, and hence the provisions of section 232B are unnecessary. It is acknowledged that there may be some difficulty in estimating the assessable income derived by the superannuation scheme in the year in which the 22 transfer takes place. However overall the quantum of assessable income to be taken into account is unchanged in respect of the transfer, the question which arises is which entity, the life insurer or the superannuation scheme, is required to account for the income earned on the relevant property. Given that the superannuation scheme is required to esti- mate its provisional income by section 38(2) of the Amendment Act, the trustee of the scheme may be liable for penalties for underestimating its assess- able income. Section 206(7) provides that the life insurer may elect that any overpayment of provi- sional tax that it may have made can be treated as if it were provisional tax paid by the trustee of the superannuation scheme. This is only effective for determining whether any underestimation penal- ties will be payable by the trustee of the superannua- tion scheme. In other words, the life insurer may effectively trans- fer provisional tax overpaid by itself to the superan- nuation scheme so that the superannuation scheme would not be liable for underestimation penalties. It should be noted that this provision only applies if the life insurer has paid as provisional tax in excess of its own actual terminal tax liability, and this section does not give exemption from other penalties. There- fore, there may still be additional tax imposed if payments are made late for instance. The emphasis for this provision is that if the estimated global tax liability, that is for both the superannuation scheme and the life insurer, would not attract underestima- tion additional tax in terms of section 384 of the Act, then the separation of this estimate between the life insurer and superannuation scheme due to the trans- fer of property should not in itself attract underesti- mation penalties. Also section 206(8) provides that a life insurer or trustee of a superannuation scheme may be given an extension of time beyond usual limits to file a return of income for the year in which an application has been made to the Government Actuary to transfer property from a life insurer to a superannuation scheme. It should be noted that persons who wish to have an extension of time granted are required by section 17 of the Act to make this application in writing to the Commissioner before the due date for the return of income. 25.0 MISCELLANEOUS SUPERANNUA- TION PROVISIONS Incorporated amongst the provisions of the Amend- ment Act are several provisions which have an effect on the taxation of superannuation schemes. 25.1 RATE OF TAXATION As from 1 April 1990, all superannuation funds in existence are deemed to become Qualifying Trusts for tax purposes. Before this period there were a number of transitional provisions affecting superan- nuation funds, and in particular there was a provi- sion for superannuation funds which were previ- ously Category 1 Superannuation Schemes to be taxed at a rate of 25 cents from 17 December 1987 onwards. As from 1 April 1990 these superannua- tion schemes are to be taxed at the standard rate for Qualifying Trusts, namely 33 cents. It should be noted that this change in tax rate is on a particular day, not on an income year basis. Where a superannuation fund has a balance date other than 31 March, the income earned in the income year spanning 31 March 1990 is apportioned between the days before 31 March 1990 and the days after this date and the appropriate tax rate is applied. This is provided by a formula : Tax Payable = a x b x c + d x e x c 365365 where: a is the number of days in the accounting year before 1 April 1990; and b is the rate of tax which would have applied to the superannuation fund if the rate had not been changed to 33 cents by the Amendment Act; and c is the taxable income of the superannuation fund for that year; and d is the number of days from 31 March until the end of the accounting year; and e is the rate of tax specified in clause 9A of the First Schedule to the Act (33 cents). 25.2 DEDUCTIBILITY OF EXPENDITURE In the past, one superannuation scheme was unable to be a member of another superannuation scheme. However section 2 of the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 has been amended to allow superannuation schemes to be members of other schemes. This is to cater for easier administration of schemes so that there can be a ‘master’ superannuation scheme which administers investments on behalf of a number of other schemes. These other schemes have access to the investments, and thus are able to pay their own beneficiaries, by way of rights to the benefits of the master scheme. Therefore it is likely that many smaller schemes will derive no income in their own right, all investment 23 income being derived by the master scheme, but the smaller schemes will still incur various administra- tion expenses which in the absence of assessable income will not be deductible. To allow for this contingency, section 228(2C) of the Act has been inserted to provide that where the funds of one superannuation fund are invested in another super- annuation fund, and the first superannuation fund incurs expenditure in respect of marketing the scheme or administering the scheme which is not the pur- chase of assets, or expenditure which is not income in the hands of the recipient then this expenditure may be treated as if it were incurred by the other superannuation scheme. In other words, the expenditure which may other- wise not be deductible to the member scheme, is allowed as a deduction to the master scheme. For this provision to apply, the member scheme must elect with its return of income that the expenditure should be transferred, and the master scheme is deemed to incur the expenditure at the same time as when it was incurred by the member scheme. 25.3 UNIT TRUST ANTI AVOIDANCE In order to protect a possible difficulty as between the superannuation tax regime and the regime ap- plying to unit trusts, section 226(10A) has been inserted to provide that where a trust which is a company (a unit trust is a trust which is deemed to be a company for tax purposes) becomes a superan- nuation fund, the trust shall be deemed to have been wound up on the date it becomes a superannuation fund. The deemed winding up has a number of tax implications, the main effect is that most distribu- tions are deemed to be dividends and may be taxable in the hands of the recipient. This provision is to ensure that if the earnings of a unit trust are sheltered by grouping its income against tax losses of other companies, then the income cannot be distributed free from tax by converting the status of the trust to a superannuation fund.
