This promise should be upheld. Revenue neutrality Where new taxes and tax hikes are recommended by the Working Group, they should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. Company taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. If the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate. This is preferable to the Background Paper’s proposal of just cutting rates just for smaller businesses, creating a two-tier business tax regime with the associated complexities and incentives for business to stay small. Expensing of capital The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. The Working Group should recommend allowing business' full capital expensing within the first year of capital purchase. This would increase incentives for business to invest in capital (accelerating productivity growth) and increase wages (productivity growth is the most relevant factor in determining income growth). Maori Authorities and charities New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages. The 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities should be abolished – so that Maori Authorities are not provided with a cash flow advantage over non-Maori competitors. Companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction for profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. Capital gains tax A tax on capital gains would discourage investment, stifling wage growth and distorting the economy. It would also cause a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments. The Government should not implement such a tax. Taxes on savings We should not allow the tax system to discourage saving. Savers (namely those with retirement funds and investment schemes) currently pay tax on ‘interest’ that, in practice, partially just reflects the effects of inflation. We should allow taxpayers to deduct inflation from taxable income earned via long term saving. Environmental taxes -Any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. Any taxes on water should operate in a similar way to water rights pricing and be sector neutral – politicians should avoid targeting specific industries or uses of water. \[1\] 2 As an alternative to recommending specific environmental taxes, I suggest the Working Group develop an objective framework for future proposed environmental taxes to be measured against. Lifestyle taxes I suggest that the Working Group recommend against the expansion of behavioural taxes, and instead outline the regressive financial damage they inflict on our most vulnerable communities. Specifically: I oppose the introduction of a sugar tax, or any other form of additional tax on food products. I oppose varying GST for different products. I oppose increases to tobacco excise. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union. Although the above points are relevant the following is more important - Large multinational corporations should be paying their fair share - not escaping their taxes - it is abhorrent what they pay at the moment. This should change immediately. Tax dodging is on a truly epic scale and putting it in the too hard basket is not acceptable - take it out and deal with it, not target some beneficiary who takes more than their fair share. Take back ACC'S $30 billion in stolen taxes. The govt could do whatever they liked with that money and not go adding fuel taxes or any other stupid tax they are thinking of doing - focus on what should be done now. The top 1% treat taxes as a voluntary activity whereas it is mandatory for the rest of us. Official IRD figures show that less than half the people with $50million in wealth pay a marginal tax rate for declared income. The whole system is radically unfair and penalises working people and favours the rich - this creates the widening gap in inequality we see here today. Taxing people who have two or more jobs to make ends meet with secondary taxes is criminal. If people have to work two to three jobs to survive why penalise them with more taxes?? End this now. Reward them for production, don't penalise them. People on benefits who earn approximately $80 extra a week get their benefits lowered by WINZ - another foolish idea. Let them work and earn a living wage so they get the idea to get off their benefit and earn instead of penalising them so they stay on a benefit. There should be no taxes on the first $17,000 - is that such a novel idea for this group to consider. We don't need any regional or fuel taxes or any other taxes to penalise working people. Mischele Rhodes \[1\] 3 From:John Milne Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 11:15 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to Tax Working Group Dear Sir Michael and members of the Tax Working Group (TWG), This is a submission on the future of tax in New Zealand, with particular reference to the proposals and questions set out in the TWG's Background Paper. Sir Michael has said that the TWG is not about how to raise more revenue for the Government. I submit and strongly recommend that this promise should be upheld. The headings below are not ranked in order of precedence, rather each in their own way will i mprove the tax system in New Zealand A. Revenue neutrality Where new taxes and tax hikes are recommended by the TWG, I submit that the TWG should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. However, I recommend below a possibility for consideration for an additional alternative tax to offset the declining tax revenues from an existing tax that also has hit unintended consequence barriers. B. Bracket creep / fiscal drag The effect of inflation pushing taxpayers into higher income tax brackets is a dishonest policy that allows politicians to tax New Zealanders harder, without ever having campaigned on it, nor had that increased taxation formally approved by legislation. Without inflation such legislation is unnecessary, but with inflation it becomes necessary. I submit that the TWG recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. I note that many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. C. Company taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. One result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. I submit that if Government wishes to encourage greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate as other countries are already doing. This is preferable to the Background Paper’s proposal of cutting rates just for smaller businesses. The latter creates a two-tier business tax regime with the associated administrative and perverse economic complexities and incentives for a business to stay small. I submit the TWG should recommend legislation to maintain New Zealand's company tax rate at a comparable level to that of our O ECD peers, and competitive ASEAN neighbours, by being no higher than at least the average of either group so as not to incentivise investors to invest elsewhere for tax \[1\] 4 reasons. As a result this will assist the prospect for New Zealand as an attractive investment destination for investible funds. D. Expensing of capital The Government must, and should be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes and employment.. I submit that the TWG recommend allowing businesses full capital expensing within the first year of capital purchase for new productive assets....but not for non-productive assets like cars, furniture, etc. This would increase incentives for business to invest in capital (accelerating productivity growth) and increase wages (since productivity growth is the most relevant factor in determining income growth and employment). E. Charities and Maori Authorities New Zealand’s company tax system should not include egregious loopholes that give certain groups competitive fiscal advantages.....given also that company taxes are not any longer significant contributors to Government revenue. Freeing up the company tax regime may well provide opportunities for increased revenues beneficial to the economy and corporate investors. I submit that a company owned by a registered charity should not be permitted to have the charitable tax deduction against its own profits, but dividends actually distributed and streamed back to the registered parent charity should be eligible for charitable tax deduction on meeting defined Charitable criteria. The registered parent charity would then be responsible for claiming the benefits of donations to its beneficiaries with full auditability via the Charities Commission. I also submit that the tax rate should provide no incentives favouring one investor over another. Thus, for instance, the 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities should be abolished. Maori Authorities should not be provided with a cash flow or tendering advantage over its non-Maori Authority competitors by a favourable differential tax rate. The TWG should also take the opportunity to consider New Zealand's dividend imputation system vs. Australia's franking credit system. At present investors on either side of The Tasman are in effect double-taxed on dividends derived in the other country thereby, at the margin, reducing the incentive for inwards overseas investment - in either direction. History suggests the Australians are unlikely to change their franking credit regime - so, should New Zealand 'bite-the-bullet' and consider departing onto the (inferior?) Australian regime by mutual recognition. This matter is exacerbated if tax rates diverge as is presently the case for New Zealand vs Australia. It is possible that this may be a factor behind the recent departure of Xero's business (and listing) to Australia absent an appropriate mutual recognition arrangement. F. Capital gains taxes Taxes on capital gains discourage investment, stifling wage growth and distorting the economy - unless and without annual inflation adjustments relative to original purchase or construction cost. It is likely otherwise to cause a ‘lock-in’ effect deferring realisation, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments. I submit that in any event Government should not implement such a tax without proper and appropriate inflation adjustment/s and allowing the quid- pro-quo of off-setting capital losses. 5 G. Taxes on savings The tax system should not discourage saving. Savers (namely those with retirement funds and investment schemes) currently pay tax on ‘interest’ that, in practice, partially reflects the effects of inflation. Invariably also, such savings are funded from prior tax-paid income.....thereby causing a double tax disincentive to savers in those kinds of assets. I submit that if savings are to be taxed, taxpayers should be allowed to adjust for inflation on the taxable income earned via long term saving. E. Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. I submit that any taxes on water should operate in a similar way to water rights pricing and be sector neutral – politicians should avoid targeting specific industries or uses of water. As an alternative to recommending specific environmental taxes, I submit that the TWG develop an objective framework for future proposed environmental taxes to be measured against. F. Lifestyle and 'sin' taxes I submit that the TWG recommend against the expansion of behavioural taxes, and instead outline the regressive financial damage they inflict on our most vulnerable communities. Specifically: I oppose the introduction of such life-style taxs as a sugar tax, a fat tax, or any other form of additional tax on food products. I oppose suggestions to vary GST for different products. One of the most beneficial features of New Zealand's GST system is there a now virtually no exemptions. It is envied by many jurisdictions overseas which grapple with the costs, time and definitional efforts to administer differential GST (or VAT) taxes. I oppose increases to tobacco excise. However, there is the opportunity for the TWG to consider recommending a tax (and regulation) on recreational marijuana sales as the alternative to continual increase to cigarette taxes which are now becoming counter-productive in societal terms. Already Canada is in the process of implenting this tax. In the USA seven States have implemented tax on recreational marijuana (with more in the pipeline) with appreciable generation of new tax revenues. G. Zero-base tax revenue and expenditures. The TWG has the opportunity to research and compare alternative tax regimes with equivalent sized countries to New Zealand. If these countries were Ireland, Switzerland and Singapore vs New Zealand evaluation can occur on the alternative regimes in respective countries: their different types and levels of tax revenues and how those revenues are deployed across Governmnt expenditures. I submit this could present useful research and bases for establishing any of the above Discussion elements to ensure for the future the TWG's recommendations are well grounded in prevailing best or better practice. H. Government Tax as a % of GDP. 6 The implied target is 30%. The present Government is talking about targets in the low 20%s. However this is a partial objective. The target should be additively referenced to BOTH Central and Local Governments (distinguishing between capital and operation expenditures). Past history has seen Central Government shift expenditures and responsibilities by legislation to Local Government to remove such items from the Central Government budgetary responsibility. This (and deemed competence) has caused the rapid disproportionate increases in Local Government rates with the concomitant call for new forms of sharing tax revenues between Central and Local Government (like sharing GST for specific activities). I submit focus on a partial target (of solely Central Government) misses the bigger picture in the Economy at large. This 'total Government' target should be complemented by the recommendation for a legislated operational net budget deficit of (say 2%) to help ensure inter-generational equity (IGE) from current operations. Although IGE is legislated in the Local Government Act it is not adhered to - aided and abetted by conflicting options in the presr=cribed Local Accounting Standards eg for interest capitalisation. I. Conclusion Thank you for the opportunity for making this Submission. I would be pleased to make a further submission or provide further ideas on the next TWG iteration.

Revenue neutrality Where new taxes and tax hikes are recommended by the Working Group, I submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers.

Yours sincerely, L For 11 From:Grant Tyrrell Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 10:55 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to Tax Working Group Dear Sir Michael and members of the Tax Working Group, Revenue neutrality Although I support a tax review I believe that it should be revenue neutral. Eg a tax on capital should be offset with a reduction in taxes on productivity (income). Bracket creep / fiscal drag Adjustments for bracket creep in regards income taxes should occur automatically at, say, three yearly intervals. Governments can increase taxes (and should campaign to that effect) but that should be an open debate not a product of increasing wages. Company taxation This must remain competitive with the world. Maori Authorities and charities New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages. The 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities should be abolished – so that Maori Authorities are not provided with a cash flow advantage over non-Maori competitors. This is not to say that genuine charitable activities undertaken by ma h isi should not be tax deductible. Charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction for profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. A bright line test should be applied to charities seeking to obtain tax free status. Political activity and advocacy, for example (although important), should not be tax deductible. Capital gains tax I support broadening the tax base. It is inconceivable that we tax productivity yet not capital. Subject to the essential quid pro quo of a reduction in income tax I support a broad based capital gains tax. It should not have exceptions to ensure simplicity for collection and understanding by taxpayers. It should only be tax on capital gains therefore there are no grounds for exceptions. Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral and only based on neutral cost benefit analysis. \[1\] 12 There should be an objective basis upon which the success or otherwise of such taxes to be assessed. GST I oppose any ‘fiddling’ with GST. The strength of GST in this country is the lack of exceptions making it a simple and effective consumption tax. Specialist taxes I do not support new taxes however I do support transparency in taxation and would encourage politicians to campaign on specific taxes linked to specific projects. Yours sincerely Grant Tyrrell 13 From:Roger Turner Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 10:44 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to Tax Working Group Dear Sir Michael and members of the Tax Working Group, This is a submission on the future of tax in New Zealand, with particular reference to the proposals and questions set out in the Working Group’s Background Paper.

I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. I note that many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Company taxation Reducing company tax is somewhat disingenuous as company tax is in reality a withholding tax, merely deferring tax until the profits are passed to the shareholders. If company tax is reduced, the liability for the tax foregone is simply passed on to the shareholders who then pay the tax that would have been paid by the company. The imputation credit regime was introduced as a fair way to prevent unfair tax liability on shareholders. Reductions in company tax without some corresponding reduction in shareholder tax liability has negated the fairness of this arrangement. This unfairness is a disincentive to investing in productive businesses and encourages investment in unproductive housing with its many tax advantages. I submit the Background Paper’s proposal of just cutting rates just for smaller businesses, will create a two- tier business tax regime with the associated complexities and incentives for business to stay small. Financial Arrangement taxation The interest Accruals Regime on Financial Arrangements is a considerable complication and disincentive for non-commercial investors to invest in productive bonds and other fixed interest investments. It serves little purpose but if required at all the thresholds should be raised to at least $10,000,000 capital and $1,000,000 in interest. Expensing of capital \[1\] 14 The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. I submit that the Working Group recommend allowing businesses full capital expensing within the first year of capital purchase.

Capital gains tax A tax on capital gains would be a further complication for investors in productive assets such as shares and a disincentive to saving. A tax on capital gains would discourage investment, stifling wage growth and distorting the economy.

I submit that we should allow taxpayers to deduct inflation from taxable income earned via long term saving. Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. I submit that any taxes on water should reflect a fair value for the resource. For large commercial users, it would not be difficult to calculate a value for the water based on the area of catchment necessary to collect the amount of water used and apply a notional rental for the use of that catchment area of land. As an alternative to recommending specific environmental taxes, I submit that the Working Group develop an objective framework for future proposed environmental taxes to be measured against.

Maori Authorities and charities \[1\] 19 New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages. I submit that the 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities should be abolished – so that Maori Authorities are not provided with a cash flow advantage over non-Maori competitors. I submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction for profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. Capital gains tax A tax on capital gains would discourage investment, stifling wage growth and distorting the economy. It would also cause a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments. I submit that the Government should not implement such a tax. Taxes on savings We should not allow the tax system to discourage saving. Savers (namely those with retirement funds and investment schemes) currently pay tax on ‘interest’ that, in practice, partially just reflects the effects of inflation. I submit that we should allow taxpayers to deduct inflation from taxable income earned via long term saving. Wealth taxes I submit that taxes on assets and wealth are unfair and disincentivise individual effort and hard work to provide for one’s own future self-sufficiency. They would also be distortionary if applied selectively on certain assets. Tax on investments should be limited to the income derived from it. In the same context, I also submit that the fair dividend rate method of taxing overseas investments is also unfair and distortionary. Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. I submit that any taxes on water should operate in a similar way to water rights pricing and be sector neutral – politicians should avoid targeting specific industries or uses of water. As an alternative to recommending specific environmental taxes, I submit that the Working Group develop an objective framework for future proposed environmental taxes to be measured against. Lifestyle taxes I submit that the Working Group recommend against the expansion of behavioural taxes, and instead outline the regressive financial damage they inflict on our most vulnerable communities. Specifically: I oppose the introduction of a sugar tax, a fat tax, or any other form of additional tax on food products. I oppose varying GST for different products. I oppose increases to tobacco excise. 20 Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union.

Sir Michael has said that the Tax Working Group is not about how to raise more revenue for the Government. I submit that this promise should be upheld.

The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. I submit that if the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate.

A Degree of Revenue neutrality Where new taxes and tax hikes are recommended by the Working Group, I submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. However, there must also be the balance with increased investment in New Zealand's infrastructure (e.g. public transport and roading) and minimum, necessary but targetted boosts in social spending. The commitment to reduce the government debt must also be upheld. Bracket creep / fiscal drag The effect of inflation pushing taxpayers into higher income tax brackets is a dishonest policy that allows politicians to tax New Zealanders harder, without ever having campaigned on it. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. I note that many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Company taxation I submit that if the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should trim ut the headline business rate, relative to any new taxes that will affect businesses. This is preferable to the Background Paper’s proposal of just cutting rates just for smaller businesses, creating a two-tier business tax regime with the associated complexities and incentives for business to stay small. Expensing of capital The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. I submit that the Working Group recommend allowing businesses full capital expensing within the first year of capital purchase. This would increase incentives for business to invest in capital (accelerating productivity growth) and increase wages (productivity growth is the most relevant factor in determining income growth). Tax loopholes New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages. \[1\] 30 I submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction for profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. I also submit that exemption of any religious organisations from paying tax should end, as these are not productive in terms of economic, social or metaphysical output. Capital taxes I submit that the Government should not implement a capital gains tax as it has only been successfully implemented as a revenue gathering measure, with little other socio-economic effect from the experience of other countries. Instead, an outright tax on capital on assets should be considered specifically on non- depreciating assets with a minimum threshold. The company tax and personal income taxes should be decreased to compensate, with first focus on the lowest person income tax bracket as these are typically people who do not yet have significant (or any) capital. Owner-occupied homes should not be exempt as otherwise this may incentivise business from running more as a home office to avoid aspects of the tax. I suggest the only consideration is perhaps exempting registered Kiwisaver schemes. A capital tax would disincentivise investment in non-productive housing investment and compel investment into productive capital, such as shares and funds, which have a higher net yield and boost investment in the private sector. Taxes on savings We should not allow the tax system to discourage saving. Savers (namely those with retirement funds and investment schemes) currently pay tax on ‘interest’ that, in practice, partially just reflects the effects of inflation. I submit that we should allow taxpayers to deduct inflation from taxable income earned via long term saving. This would in turn be offset by the capital tax suggested above. Lifestyle taxes I submit that the Working Group take caution on taxes that are to disincentivise unhealthy diets such as tax and fat. The experience of the consistent tobacco tax hikes is a prime example. Taxes on sugar and processed fats, as examples, may have merit at face value but may skew towards subsitutes that are even worse (e.g, aspartame). Strict research and ongoing revisions over the years to such a set of taxes would be required.

Yours sincerely, 42 From:Chris Steadman Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 9:05 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to Tax Working Group Dear Sir Michael and members of the Tax Working Group, This is a submission on the future of tax in New Zealand, with particular reference to the proposals and questions set out in the Working Group’s Background Paper. Sir Michael has said that the Tax Working Group is not about how to raise more revenue for the Government. I submit that this promise should be upheld. Revenue neutrality Where new taxes and tax hikes are recommended by the Working Group, I submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. Bracket creep / fiscal drag The effect of inflation pushing taxpayers into higher income tax brackets is a dishonest policy that allows politicians to tax New Zealanders harder, without ever having campaigned on it. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. I note that many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Company taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. I submit that if the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate. This is preferable to the Background Paper’s proposal of just cutting rates just for smaller businesses, creating a two-tier business tax regime with the associated complexities and incentives for business to stay small. Expensing of capital The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. I submit that the Working G roup recommend allowing businesses full capital expensing within the first year of capital purchase. This would increase incentives for business to invest in capital (accelerating productivity growth) and increase wages (productivity growth is the most relevant factor in determining income growth). Maori Authorities and charities \[1\] 43 New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages. I submit that the 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities should be abolished – so that Maori Authorities are not provided with a cash flow advantage over non-Maori competitors. I submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction for profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. Capital gains tax A tax on capital gains would discourage investment, stifling wage growth and distorting the economy. It would also cause a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments. I submit that the Government should not implement such a tax. Taxes on savings We should not allow the tax system to discourage saving. Savers (namely those with retirement funds and investment schemes) currently pay tax on ‘interest’ that, in practice, partially just reflects the effects of inflation. I submit that we should allow taxpayers to deduct inflation from taxable income earned via long term saving. Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral.

Revenue neutrality Where new taxes and tax hikes are recommended by the Working Group, I submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. Bracket creep / fiscal drag The effect of inflation pushing taxpayers into higher income tax brackets is a dishonest policy that allows politicians to tax New Zealanders harder, without ever having campaigned on it. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. I note that many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Company taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. I submit that if the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate. This is preferable to the Background Paper’s proposal of just cutting rates just for smaller businesses, creating a two-tier business tax regime with the associated complexities and incentives for business to stay small. Expensing of capital The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. I submit that the Working G roup recommend allowing businesses full capital expensing within the first year of capital purchase. This would increase incentives for business to invest in capital (accelerating productivity growth) and increase wages (productivity growth is the most relevant factor in determining income growth). Maori Authorities and charities \[1\] 63 New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages. I submit that the 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities should be abolished – so that Maori Authorities are not provided with a cash flow advantage over non-Maori competitors. I submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction for profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. Capital gains tax A tax on capital gains would discourage investment, stifling wage growth and distorting the economy. It would also cause a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments. I submit that the Government should not implement such a tax. Taxes on savings We should not allow the tax system to discourage saving. Savers (namely those with retirement funds and investment schemes) currently pay tax on ‘interest’ that, in practice, partially just reflects the effects of inflation. I submit that we should allow taxpayers to deduct inflation from taxable income earned via long term saving. Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. I submit that any taxes on water should operate in a similar way to water rights pricing and be sector neutral – politicians should avoid targeting specific industries or uses of water. As an alternative to recommending specific environmental taxes, I submit that the Working Group develop an objective framework for future proposed environmental taxes to be measured against. Lifestyle taxes I submit that the Working Group recommend against the expansion of behavioural taxes, and instead outline the regressive financial damage they inflict on our most vulnerable communities. Specifically: I oppose the introduction of a sugar tax, a fat tax, or any other form of additional tax on food products. I oppose varying GST for different products. I oppose increases to tobacco excise. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union.

This would increase incentives for business to invest in capital (accelerating productivity growth) and increase wages (productivity growth is the most relevant factor in determining income growth). Maori Authorities and charities \[1\] 81 New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages. I submit that the 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities should be abolished – so that Maori Authorities are not provided with a cash flow advantage over non-Maori competitors. I submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction for profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. Capital gains tax A tax on capital gains would discourage investment, stifling wage growth and distorting the economy. It would also cause a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments. I submit that the Government should not implement such a tax. Taxes on savings We should not allow the tax system to discourage saving. Savers (namely those with retirement funds and investment schemes) currently pay tax on ‘interest’ that, in practice, partially just reflects the effects of inflation. I submit that we should allow taxpayers to deduct inflation from taxable income earned via long term saving. Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. I submit that any taxes on water should operate in a similar way to water rights pricing and be sector neutral – politicians should avoid targeting specific industries or uses of water. As an alternative to recommending specific environmental taxes, I submit that the Working Group develop an objective framework for future proposed environmental taxes to be measured against. Lifestyle taxes I submit that the Working Group recommend against the expansion of behavioural taxes, and instead outline the regressive financial damage they inflict on our most vulnerable communities. Specifically: I oppose the introduction of a sugar tax, a fat tax, or any other form of additional tax on food products. I oppose varying GST for different products. I oppose increases to tobacco excise. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union.

Revenue neutrality Where new taxes and tax hikes are recommended by the Working Group, I submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers.

"I am favor of cutting taxes under any circumstances and for any excuse, for any reason, whenever it's possible." - Milton Friedman. My question is: "How much tax is necessary to achieve the governments goals?" Why do we need money taken away from us to be returned as someone else sees fit? This can only be to achieve the goal of a population that isunreasonably reliant on the Government for their livelihood. This is not freedom, and it is not good for any kiwi now, or in the future.

Revenue neutrality Where new taxes and tax hikes are recommended by the Working Group, I submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. Actually it would be much, much better if government expenditure were reduced significantly to allow taxation to be reduced. This would not only stimulate the economy, but give people greater freedom of choice. Taxed enough already. Bracket creep / fiscal drag The effect of inflation pushing taxpayers into higher income tax brackets is a dishonest policy that allows politicians to tax New Zealanders harder, without ever having campaigned on it. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. I note that many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Company taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. I submit that if the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate. This is preferable to the Background Paper’s proposal of just cutting rates just for smaller businesses, creating a two-tier business tax regime with the associated complexities and incentives for business to stay small. Expensing of capital The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. I submit that the Working Group recommend allowing businesses full capital expensing within the first year of capital purchase. This would increase incentives for business to invest in capital (accelerating productivity growth) and increase wages (productivity growth is the most relevant factor in determining income growth). \[1\] 103 Maori Authorities and charities New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages. I submit that the 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities should be abolished – so that Maori Authorities are not provided with a cash flow advantage over non-Maori competitors. I submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction for profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. Capital gains tax A tax on capital gains would discourage investment, stifling wage growth and distorting the economy. It would also cause a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments. I submit that the Government should not implement such a tax. Taxes on savings We should not allow the tax system to discourage saving. Savers (namely those with retirement funds and investment schemes) currently pay tax on ‘interest’ that, in practice, partially just reflects the effects of inflation. I submit that we should allow taxpayers to deduct inflation from taxable income earned via long term saving. Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. I submit that any taxes on water should operate in a similar way to water rights pricing and be sector neutral – politicians should avoid targeting specific industries or uses of water. As an alternative to recommending specific environmental taxes, I submit that the Working Group develop an objective framework for future proposed environmental taxes to be measured against. Lifestyle taxes I submit that the Working Group recommend against the expansion of behavioural taxes, and instead outline the regressive financial damage they inflict on our most vulnerable communities. Specifically: I oppose the introduction of a sugar tax, a fat tax, or any other form of additional tax on food products. I oppose varying GST for different products. I oppose increases to tobacco excise. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union. Yours sincerely, 104 105 From:Dean Sole Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 6:45 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to Tax Working Group Dear Tax Working Group - No to capital gains taxes other than the existing ones on short-term capital sales that are in the nature of income. They distort and delay the proper economic (re)allocation of captial. - If captial gains taxes are introduced on real estate then they should apply across-the-board, including the family home. - Goods and Services Tax should apply as it presently does, i.e., on all categories, across-the-board. - All taxpayers to be taxed equally with comparable entities by type, not by size. So (e.g.) all trusts should be taxed at the same rate(s). - No body should be exempted from income tax (e.g., charitable trusts, churches). - Income tax to be assessed on income after Kiwisaver contributions are deducted, not before. - Matching employer contributions to Kiwisaver to be tax-free. - All off-shore spending on credit cards, debit cards, etc. to be assessed for GST as if the goods or service was purchased in New Zealand. If it can be demonstrated the expense was expended off-shore the GST can be claimed back. - The commission of transactions that banks collect on credit card expenditure over 0.5% should be taxed at 100% - i.e., any commission over 0.5% of purchases should be payable to the Crown. - Air travel from New Zealand should attract a climate change levy that must be applied to climate change projects. - Tourists should attract a tourist levy which must be applied to tourist-infrastructure projects. - Landlords should have the same depreciation allowances on their assets that all other businesses enjoy. - Tax changes should be revenue-neutral except where their purpose is to change environmentally suboptimal behaviours. - Where a new tax is introduced, other taxes should be adjusted to return to revenue neutrality (other than environmental behavioural-change taxes.) - I oppose any new tax that aims to change personal behaviours other than those that are presently in place. No sugar tax, no fat tax, no additional food taxes, for example. - Income tax brackets should automatically be adjusted to reflect changes in the consumers price index. \[1\] 106 - Resource taxes if introduced should be revenue-neutral and apply across-the-board, not sector-by-sector. - All state health care supplied to non-New Zealand citizens should attract cost-recovery charges. Other than the suggestions made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union.

Sir Michael has said that the Tax Working Group is not about how to raise more revenue for the Government. I submit that this promise should be upheld and stated front and centre.

This is preferable to the Background Paper’s proposal of just cutting rates just for smaller businesses, creating a two-tier business tax regime with the associated complexities and incentives for business to stay small. This will undoubtedly lead to tax based restructuring of existing businesses to capture the benefit of the low "small business" tax rate. Maori Authorities and charities New Zealand’s company and business tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages. I submit that the 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities should be abolished – so that Maori Authorities are not provided with a cash flow advantage over non-Maori competitors.

It would also cause a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments as they might be presented with a significant capital tax bill. Capital gains tax is also touted as a remedy for high real estate prices - if that was true countries such as Australia, Canada and the UK which have capital gains taxes should have lower relative property prices. This is not the case. The overwhelming cause of high real estate prices are low building rates due to land use regulatory hurdles, high building costs again in part due to regulations and the historically very low interest rates on mortgages. My view is that capital gains taxes will tend to "lock in" rental and holiday home properties into family trust structures for much longer than might be the case nowadays. Any sellers will be disadvantaged and have less money to put to other purposes eg starting a business. Capital Gains tax media attention and political commentary has been focused on property - but the main thrust of property "flipping" has been reasonably well dealt with by the bright line test and an active investigation regime by the IRD. The exemption for the family home will undoubtedly encourage "investment" in upgrading family homes based on higher priced neighbourhoods. State school zoning also has significant impact on property prices and should arguably be abolished as it excludes less well off students from the better schools and shepherds the wealthy into premium state schools esp in Auckland. Attention should also be focussed in public statements and in the final report on the capital gains tax impacts on assets other than property such as listed shares, private businesses, works of art and other long lasting assets (eg precious metals and classic cars) that can be sold for more their original cost. The impact of capital gains tax on Kiwisaver funds and savings in general will be to move more savings towards interest-bearing assets, long-term-hold "safe" equities and possibly also offshore for more sophisticated investors. I consider the Working Group should be fully transparent about the full impact of a capital gains tax system on all asset classes in its final report. The capital gains tax exclusion for family homes may also be troublesome in its application for some property types eg family holiday homes and "lifestyle" farmlets or properties which are used for both residential and business purposes. Such a tax would encourage pigeonholing of property into multi- generational legal structures such as trusts or companies. There would be extended professional debate as to proper tax accounting for various types of property and other deadweight costs on the economy. It is also idle to simply wrap up the whole capital gains tax debate as a form of class warfare by "soaking the rich". The reality, as has been experienced in Australia and Canada, is that the current well off population will continue to be well off and the difficulty will be experienced by those aiming to increase their weath and access lifestyle assets such as holiday homes. The tax will in effect lock out aspiring and younger people starting to grow wealth unless t heir parents can provide assets via family trusts and the like. There is also a proposal to introduce an annual land tax as a form of wealth tax. NZ already has such an tax, commonly referred to as local authority rates, which are universally levied by Local Authorities on Capital Values of property with some relief provided by fixed value special levies and a Fixed Rate component. There is no moral or ethical justification for local bodies funding activities based on the value of a property where rates over different parts of a city, such as Auckland, can vary from $1,500 for a basic house to $10,000 for a basic house in a more expensive area. The rating structure is an historical relic that needs at some point to be restructured to a more user pays system. In addition the value of a property is not a measure of household "wealth" as the amount of associated mortgage funding is excluded from the calculation and the number of working aged occupants is not taken into account. Such a tax would hit hard the asset rich, income poor citizens (eg pensioners) or aspiring couples who have borrowed heavily to acquire a property - for example to move into a prestigious school zone. If the family home was excluded from an annual Land Tax impost then the tax would be nothing more than a focussed impost on the rural community and tenants in rental property and another deadweight cost on commercial property occupants. 117 Capital gains taxes also tend to be sporadic due to the swings in the economy giving rise to varying levels of realisation of assets on which to levy the tax. If there is an inflation allowance to shelter some capital gains then that would also substantially reduce the potential tax take from this source. I submit that the Government should not implement either a capital gains or land tax regime. Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. I submit that any taxes on water should operate in a similar way to water rights pricing and be sector neutral – politicians should avoid targeting specific industries or uses of water. As an alternative to recommending specific environmental taxes, I submit that the Working Group develop an objective framework for future proposed environmental taxes to be measured against. Lifestyle taxes I submit that the Working Group recommend against the expansion of behavioural taxes, and instead outline the regressive financial damage they inflict on our most vulnerable communities. Specifically: I oppose the introduction of a sugar tax, a fat tax, or any other form of additional tax on food products. The bad outcomes from using these products is invariably caused by prolonged and excessive consumption. Health education and more selective medical treatments would be more appropriate methods of fixing the problems. Regrettably people will make bad and somewhat addictive choices in a number of areas and trying to tax things out of existence simply doesn't work except at the margins. The effect is to impoverish users and open the door to illicit activity. I oppose varying GST for different products which would create significant confusion and definitional issues in the retail trade - the UK and European retail trade would be a good source of material to the deadweight costs arising from such a proposal. I oppose the high level of tobacco excise. The significant growth in violent criminal activity arising from "high priced" cigarettes is self evident. There is also the less well known smuggling operations from the Pacific Islands and unofficial growing operations which are strongly incentivised by tobacco taxes. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union.

This would increase incentives for business to invest in capital (accelerating productivity growth) and increase wages (productivity growth is the most relevant factor in determining income growth). \[1\] 122 Maori Authorities and charities New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages. I submit that the 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities should be abolished – so that Maori Authorities are not provided with a cash flow advantage over non-Maori competitors. I submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction for profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. Capital gains tax A tax on capital gains would discourage investment, stifling wage growth and distorting the economy. It would also cause a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments. I submit that the Government should not implement such a tax. Taxes on savings We should not allow the tax system to discourage saving. Savers (namely those with retirement funds and investment schemes) currently pay tax on ‘interest’ that, in practice, partially just reflects the effects of inflation. I submit that we should allow taxpayers to deduct inflation from taxable income earned via long term saving. Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. I submit that any taxes on water should operate in a similar way to water rights pricing and be sector neutral – politicians should avoid targeting specific industries or uses of water. As an alternative to recommending specific environmental taxes, I submit that the Working Group develop an objective framework for future proposed environmental taxes to be measured against. Lifestyle taxes I submit that the Working Group recommend against the expansion of behavioural taxes, and instead outline the regressive financial damage they inflict on our most vulnerable communities. Specifically: I oppose the introduction of a sugar tax, a fat tax, or any other form of additional tax on food products. I oppose varying GST for different products. I oppose increases to tobacco excise. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union.

Revenue neutrality Where new taxes and tax hikes are recommended by the Working Group, I submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers.

Bracket creep / fiscal drag The effect of inflation pushing taxpayers into higher income tax brackets is a dishonest policy that allows politicians to tax New Zealanders harder, without ever having campaigned on it. I submit that after an initial adjustment of an increase in the threshold of each income step of say $10,000... that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. I note that many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Company taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD.

This is preferable to the Background Paper’s proposal of just cutting rates just for smaller businesses, creating a two-tier business tax regime with the associated complexities and incentives for business to stay small. Trust Taxation I submit that Trust Taxation be set at the same level as Company Taxation in order to create a level playing field for income derived by Trust investment. Maori Authorities and charities New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages. I submit that the 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities should be abolished – so that Maori Authorities are not provided with a cash flow advantage over non-Maori competitors. \[1\] 129 I submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction for profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. Capital gains tax A tax on capital gains would discourage investment, stifle wage growth and distort the economy. It would also cause a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments. Many capital gains are the result of inflation. Many capital gains produce no more purchasing power with the advent of time as a result of inflation.. Taxpayers should not be taxed on these gains which would result in the Taxpayer suffering a reduction in the "value" or purchasing power of their capital sum. I submit that the Government should not implement such a tax. Tourist Tax It has become abundantly clear that the provision of roading, accident compensation, medical services and infrastructure associated with tourism have become a burden on both central and local government. I therefore submit that a tax of say $25 per day that the tourist spends in NZ, be collected at the boarder on departure. Also that an appropriate portion of this revenue be distributed to local governments. Taxes on savings We should not allow the tax system to discourage saving. Savers (namely those with retirement funds and investment schemes) currently pay tax on ‘interest’ that, in practice, partially just reflects the effects of inflation. I submit that we should allow taxpayers to deduct inflation from taxable income earned via long term saving. Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. Water Taxes I submit that there be no taxes applied to water used by NZ citizens for whatever reason, with the exception of water used for export purposes, either as purewater or the water content of water containing products. Exported Water Taxes In order for the Government to benefit from the export of a valuable NZ Crown resource which has originated from the natural precipitation of rainfall, I submit that in the case of NZ Citizens, or non NZ Citizens who are residents, or Companies/Trusts either NZ owned or foreign owned, that pure water exports, or the water content of products containing more than say 25% water be taxed at an amount of say 20 c per litre. I further submit that this taxation revenue belongs to the Crown rather than to any other party. Lifestyle taxes 130 I submit that the Working Group recommend against the expansion of behavioural taxes, and instead outline the regressive financial damage they inflict on our most vulnerable communities. Specifically: I oppose the introduction of a sugar tax, a fat tax, or any other form of additional tax on food products. I oppose varying GST for different products. Ioppose increases to tobacco excise. Deductions from Taxable Income Due to the inability of the Public Hospital Service to provide first class treatment to all of the population, private hospitals have been developed to fill the gap and also provide a better service. This must reduce the load on the Public Health sector and therefore the taxpayer. The private patients mainly fund this service by subscribing to Health Insurance Providers. I submit that both direct private hospital patient charges to private patients be deductable from taxable income, or if the costs are met by a Health Insurance Provider, that the Health Insurance annual premiums be made deductable from taxable Income. The private Health patient would not effectively be paying twice for the service. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union.

Although the above points are relevant the following is more important - Large multinational corporations should be paying their fair share - not dodging their taxes - it is scandalous what they pay at the moment. This should change immediately. Tax dodging is on a truly epic scale and 139 putting it in the too hard basket is not acceptable - take it out and deal with it, not target some beneficiary who takes more than their fair share. Take back ACC'S $30 billion in stolen taxes. The govt could do whatever they liked with that money and not go adding fuel taxes or any other stupid tax they are thinking of doing - focus on what should be done now. The top 1% treat taxes as a voluntary activity whereas it is mandatory for the rest of us. Official IRD figures show that less than half the people with $50million in wealth pay a marginal tax rate for declared income. The whole system is radically unfair and penalises working people and favours the rich - this creates the widening gap in inequality we see here today. Taxing people who have two or more jobs to make ends meet with secondary taxes is criminal. If people have to work two to three jobs to survive why penalise them with more taxes?? End this now. Reward them for production, don't penalise them. People on benefits who earn approximately $80 extra a week get their benefits lowered by WINZ - another foolish idea. Let them work and earn a living age so they get the idea to get off their benefit and earn instead of penalising them so they stay on a benefit. How about no taxes on the first $17,000 - is that such a novel idea for this group to consider. We don't need any regional or fuel taxes or any other taxes to penalise working people. Take the money from where it should be taken, transnational corporations, the 1% dodgers and leave the worker alone.

Sir Michael has said that the Tax Working Group is not about how to raise more revenue for the Government. I submit that this promise should be upheld. Future of tax & Purpose of tax Liberal myth, government spending more and doing more is best. Conservative myth, govenment doing less and spending less is best. Business myth, running government like a business is best. People myth, hiring better people is best - its not the people its the system... Actual answer is to increase effectivness, adaptability, and capacity to innovate. Achieved by changing their purpose, incentives and accountability, power strucuture and culture within government department. Presently NZ is too high in taxpayers and companies who are publically funded. For the country to flourish the portion of private companies, and taxpayers needs to increase as these are the ones who bring profit to the country. Presently (at least locally) there is a view to selling off capital/ natural resources to gain profit - this is a best a short term fix and longterm disaster. This model needs to be stopped. "Banishing Bureauocracy, The Five Strategies for Reinventing Government, which details how to permanently change public administrations to increase their effectiveness, efficiency, and capacity for innovation. " Presently NZ has many opportunities, if a clear clean way forward is enabled. With Britain leaving the EU, the commonwealth could become the "powerhouse". Overwhelming taxation and regulations have caused startups, businesses and investment have flooded to London and ignored Paris and other European capitals. I propose NZ engage in a free speech, "low, but strict regulation" and reasonable taxation. Lets encourage start ups, innovations and free thinkers to start here. Why the commonwealth could become the new superpower https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN9Tn1QRBTc Why Macron will destroy the EU https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScTjRlbsgQ \[1\] 141 Exports Suggest Government supports innovators and sustainable producers via brand and high industry standards - NOT subsidising, accidentally supporting bad practices (see below -environmental ) NZ organic and food quality is not up to UK standards. Last year Russia dropped our beef due to contamination with a chemical/growth hormone often added to pork feed. We have the tracking technology to identify where this came from but no MPI effort bothered. We need to start now breaking apart failed MPI and reintroducing the high standards and infrastruture our imports and exports had previously. Sustainable permiculture advocated by"intergrity soils" removing pollutants of nitrogen fertiliser, roundup and restoring toilsoil/humus and soil microbes and reducing depandance on irrigation are perfect commercial alternatives to organic and implementation of these measures now would lead to a higher demand for our exports and the specialised products demanding higher cost. It would address water quality issues where effective by rural contaimination of nitrogen fertiliser. Additionally NZ and Australia lamb and beef export to one another push each others prices down - this seems like a complete waste of time. Rigour and high standard governement testing vital, a strong brand - beef raised on organic pasture/ beef raised on organic silvopasture/ organic grass feed - Allowing a clear strictly controlled dairy. beef & lamb both locally and internationally, requiring industry to pay producers a higher price and process brand separately allows consumers to choose well produced humane products (Labelling ritually slaughter meat has been suggested - so I may choose not to buy it as I think its inhumane, just like I don’t buy tested on animal products.) taxing right things & housing more affordable & matters most Revenue neutrality Where new taxes and tax hikes are recommended by the Working Group, I submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. The failure of government departments to meet goals/obligations results in more money and extension of the departments, in the marketplace - companies fail when they fail to meet obigations. We need to set up a new mentality within government departments with a new set of obligations - with clear economic analysis to stem tide of fiscal irresponsibility. Additionally a surgeon may spend less than 25% of their time in surgery - 75% paperwork. That is an inefficient use of human resource - yet every layer of bureauocracy with the health system creates a new report/ health & safetly the surgeonn must complete. It is vital we strip back these wasteful bureauocratic layers. The same can be said for teachers and many other productive vs bureauocratic/health and safety layers. It seems fairly straightforward that electing members of the public to run a hospital - does not work and its very expensive. Board members are so entrenched now ... I say we get rid of elected boards and put surgeons, doctors and nurses back in charge of hospitals .... Under the governance of state run services with a yearly audit/warrant of fitness. Then hospitals only get access to full budget if they improve their ratings. Its no point throwing money at the health system till we fix the systems that enabled the problem. So overloaded with bureaucratic paperwork/ health and safety that they missed the building rotting around them. .... examples of waste 142 this year my partner recieved a glossy full color survey to complete for governemt funded "sport NZ" ... he had at least three reminders to complete the intrusive 20 page Orwellian study, with a $500 lucky dip reward - what is the cost to taxpayer of this department. Additionally our local Horowhenua council has employed at least one nutritionist full time - to advise on local health ... Meanwhile in another expensive bureauocratic layer - an advisory board to local council is trying to sell off local parks and community halls because of lack of funding .... all these layers of bureauocracy for national to local are removing the actual resources from the local community, which is the worst possible outcome for the health and well being of community and financial resources are being misapplied. Why is the government spending funds on anti- smoking campaigns still, speeding campaigns ... Nannys and nudgers, government agents engaging in proganda about how individuals should spend their lives, smoking is just one example. It is an offense to individual liberty and personal responsibility and those funds could be far better spent elsewhere. How much per taxpayer is spent on advertising propaganda? $50? $100?Wouldn't people rather have that in their pocket? Company taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. (I submit that if the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate. This is preferable to the Background Paper’s proposal of just cutting rates just for smaller businesses, creating a two-tier business tax regime with the associated complexities and incentives for business to stay small.) Professor Mark Blythe discusses how the tax department is the favourite department in Sweden, because they make it transparent where taxes go and make it easy to meet obligations. In NZ we are blocked from understanding where taxes go. How much welfare goes to the poor and how much is spent on mantaining staff and offices? Would waste go down if departments were more transparent about spending and had a clear economic analysis of spending/results. Funding outcomes, not imputs. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vnr7GN5T\_tg I have pondered whether NZ would be best to implement 20% flat tax rate, income, company and gst. (First $10,000 tax free personal) Close off loopholes and offsets for high income earners or overseas investers. Easy implementation, transparency and same across every class and avoidance prosecuted harshly. ACC - the hidden tax Rework ACC/health , I would simplify $800 fee for a builder. $600 for a plumber a set fee for each employee of each job. With a 10% discount for no serious workplace injuries in laast 2 years. The billing for acc is confusing and tries to fleece based on profit, not on a good safety record .. it should not cost extra for profitable business, it should reward safety and it should be utterly easy for small business to factor cost of new staff. I would dissolve the ACC case managers etc. and reassign this funding to health. Would start a traffic light system for surgery treatment eliminating acc approvals etc. Lets take this funding for treatment and put it fully into the health system for treatment. Maybe still it over charges - which it currently does, but everything covered - whether that be an accident or cancer or appendicitis. So funds go to health treatment rather than a pseudo insurance agency - disguised as a no fault insurer. Urgent and accident - Red, Accident, and mixed origin with good change of recovery back to work - orange, Mid to longterm problem - significant improvement to life - yellow 143 Longterm problem - green. Non urgent waiting list - blue (Additionally acc and health & safety are trying to manage for the average in so doing they have become obstructive for the competant and profoundly clever - have you seen Parkour or freerunning, it does not make sense to to and dumb these people down, for the help of the most clumsey. Health and safety was started so companies had to provide safe environments and not require undue risk taking for staff to cut costs. Nowadays the biggest bully in a company will be a workplace health and safety officer. We need to dial this back and encourage individual competence and freedom, accepting accidents will always happen. My brother knocked a light bulb as he was removing from a display cabinet and it shattered left him with a small cut. That required a lengthly from filled out and a safety protocol to be developed by manager and health and safety officer and then introduced. Very time consuming and ridiculous overkill for just an accident. Its a similar thing I noticed in my teacher training, failure to allow kids to flourish in their own ways according to their strengths, the goal was to keep everyone average. ) Expensing of capital The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. I submit that the Working Group recommend allowing businesses full capital expensing within the first year of capital purchase. This would increase incentives for business to invest in capital (accelerating productivity growth) and increase wages (productivity growth is the most relevant factor in determining income growth). Charities New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages. I submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction for profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. Additionally charties should be obligated to provide a public breakdown of dollar distribtution. I should know what percentage of my of donation reaches the end user and how much goes to sustain the charity or on advertising/propganda. This way public will be able to support charities that are fulfilling their stated purpose and hopefully those that squander will fail. (I am sure greenpeace functions in such a way, where funding goes to advertising/campaigns and very little goes into research and development or supporting green causes on the ground. ) Capital gains tax - Housing 144 A tax on capital gains would discourage investment, stifling wage growth and distorting the economy. It would also cause a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments. I submit that the Government should not implement such a tax. Should the government - could the capital gains tax only apply to foreign investors/foreign companies and not to local people and local companies. (We have seen this implemented in other countries and it most negatively effects family farms and working class families who inherit a home.) I would suggest at most, should a productive farm or inherited farm be subdivided into lifestyle blocks or a subdivision, that a capital gains tax of some form may be applicable ... I would also look at these http://www.johnsimpsonarchitects.com/pa/Swindon.html and http://www.benpentreath.com/architectu re/masterplanning-development/poundbury-residential/ both of which are new high density housing estates but built in sympathetic traditional ways. Five minutes walk to a green space and close to local shops/ facilities encourage walking rather than driving ... Its a way of introducing entry level apartment living close to town for smaller families/couples. And while these appear more as apartment conversions of old homesteads - for some reason people like conversions of 1900- 1940s buildings. They last repurposed, so their original cost is offset because they remain in use. Whereas buildings from 70-90s are torn down and replaced which is an unwise use of resources and more expensive over time. Urban sprawl is a problem as is high cost of land. Housing - local body costs I would suggest that local councils that receive excessive substantial complaints, increases rates over the costs of inflation, refuses transparency needs to automatically have audit and oversight. Increase the powers ombudsman and IG to require audits/ transparency and individuals to step down for non compliance or conflicts of interest. We need to urgently close local body government - these are expensive to run. They are creating several layers of bureaucracy to avoid dealing with the public and public concerns and protecting their own interests. Boards and advisory boards are being mismanaged, participants are selected based on thinking the same as the aims of organiser - not have a variety of innovators and diverse industries. They are bullies in how they are being implemented, . Additionally government / environmental and ratepayers should be able to put an injunction on councils to granting any new resource consents/new builds if the infrasture of water and sewage is struggling to cope. Mandatory Upgrade of water and sewage in growth areas or repeated polluters As an option, central government to fund the design costs and a supply a project manager to oversea correct implementation of water and sewage plant with green/sustainable design. (Perhaps in new locations - such as Horowhenua waste is it still going in lake for over 20years - relocation priority). This would allow a cheaper design cost by government funding in bulk to proven successful green designers/engineers, but also demand a high standard and better quality outcomes than any individual small council can obtain on its own ... This is a company that has worked in NZ before and indicates the ideal, while a cost it and provides benefits in employment, tourism, environmentalism, and cultural - NZ part starts about halfway through. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VlY- 3V63yI&t=0s&list=PL4tNPdK4jtOxHIm1Hy5eQqHbbEBNqWxDW&index=6 145 Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. I submit that any taxes on water should operate only on irrigation, (drip irrigation should be excluded). And commerical industries. As an alternative to recommending specific environmental taxes, I submit that the Working Group develop an objective framework for future proposed environmental taxes to be measured against. The paris accord is a top down measure/ creating a swap rather than change or innovation - these don’t work https://www.roger-scruton.com/articles/281-conservatism-and-the- environment .... https://www.roger-scruton.com/articles/239-conservationism-you-can-believe-in Is water a commodity like oil or a right, like air. I have researched this extensively for a submission on Te Waikoropupū Springs and Associated Waterbodies. Without Iwi rights many of our natural resou rces would have already been sold to China and now we are still seeing individuals trying to profiteer off a natural resource in water exports and councils granting irrigation with no understanding. Implications are nitrogen application Farming and water in NZ is suffering the “tragedy of the commons” - an economic theory of a situation within a shared-resource system where individual users acting independently according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or spoiling that resource through their collective action. The average annual rainfall in Takaka (where springs are)is 2019mm. My partner, a second generation farmer, suggested that the farmer unable to farm with this rainfall, displays a competence level is so low, they shouldn’t be allowed to farm. To qualify - family have farmed in Manakau, Levin since 1980s. Their annual rainfall is 1141mm, Nitrogen/Urea fertiliser free and no irrigation farming at 1.4 stocking units. Cambridge/Waikato - dairy farm country annual rainfall average 1214mm per annum. Flawed Farming Methods - Farming is in a diasterous spot. In 2007 Richard Mulvaney, Saeed Khan, and Tim Ellsworth of the University of Illinois announced the disaster of Synthetic Nitrogen fertiliser. The Marrow Plots, the oldest experimental fields studying soil fertility est. in 1876. Synthetic Nitrogen fertiliser, used on the plot since 1967, had significantly reduced the organic soil matter and nitrogen - the opposite of what its thought to do. A German grassland study (begun 2002) found as species diversity increases so does annual biomass - more than using fertiliser. Even when nitrogen rates increased to 200kg/ha, plant diversity trumped biomass production. Biomass production kept doubling with pasture plots up to 60 species. As species increased so did soil carbon whereas soil carbon declined with monocultures. Current farming practices include a problematic monoculture of rye and clover, this has transitioned to further problematic annuals that require yearly tilling and replanting - further increasing loss of carbon. There is an insistence of farmers (agricultural and horticultural) to grab surface water, then aquifers. For some reason - nz has not identified farming practices are requiring irrigation - where none should be needed. Due to the synthetic nitrogen, there is a loss of carbon in soil. Therefore the soil no longer has any structure and the soil water holding capacity is significantly reduced. Precious topsoil is washed away in rain and the soil soaked with inorganic nitrogen provides plant and algae structure in the water the same “growth burst” as the do the plant on land - explaining the massive algae blooms. The plants may look fine but the edifice that supports them is crumbling. (This is particularly problematic with forestry.) \[1\] 146 Nestle produces in three days what Fonterra produces in a year. China has built the worlds biggest dairy farm on the Russian border and since this time NZ milk prices have dropped. Fonterra has been satisfied to push farmers to intensification, increasing yield and reducing payouts for short term and unsustainable gain. Whether Fonterra will still exist in ten years time is questionable if milk powder to china is aim. Instead of innovation, A2/allergenic and grassfeed, grass finished, hormone and antibiotic free, permaculture, regenerative products into higher end markets is not pursued and lowering processing cost and increasing farmer payouts. NZ Farmers today have been satisfied to haemorrhage their profits to fertiliser, irrigation companies and other associated chemicals & gadgets ... they have lost touch with the health of the land and with the desire of the consumer for low pollution organic produce. (The regenerative farming model mixes organic style land practices based on ancient prairie grazing with modern treatment of the cow. )It further supports the health of local and demands for our high quality exports.

The second option is a far better use of resources, but on the market looks like a failure because the number of fridges sold, drops. How can we use transparency to support companies that are using resources better ? I am an artist just outside Otaki, living with a second generation farmer.Between us, we have encountered bureauocratic bullying and with too much time have tried to think clearly about the structural changes both coming from anti authoritarian, but opposing left/right view point. Our communiity is struggling with a corrupt council, that has numerous complaints, cost overruns and lack of transparency and individual blocking outside voices to protect their own interests- blocking competition as one only can in small conservative communities. English common law works so well, because it is bottom up - but the last few years ignorance of economics and overload of self interested politicians and government funded "non profits" and companies have caused a more french "top down" attitude from all levels of governement. This has impedied individual freedom and grass roots actions. And may well be contributing to overuse of resources in farming... lets get back to a country where our independance and innovation is not blocked by overburdened tax and regulation.

I submit that if the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate. This is preferable to the Background Paper’s proposal of just cutting rates just for smaller businesses, creating a two-tier business tax regime with the associated complexities and incentives for business to stay small. Expensing of capital The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. I submit that the Working G roup recommend allowing businesses full capital expensing within the first year of capital purchase. This would increase incentives for business to invest in capital (accelerating productivity growth) and increase wages (productivity growth is the most relevant factor in determining income growth). Maori Authorities and charities \[1\] 158 New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages. I submit that the 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities should be abolished – so that Maori Authorities are not provided with a cash flow advantage over non-Maori competitors. I submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction for profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. Capital gains tax A tax on capital gains would discourage investment, stifling wage growth and distorting the economy. It would also cause a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments. I submit that the Government should not implement such a tax. Taxes on savings We should not allow the tax system to discourage saving. Savers (namely those with retirement funds and investment schemes) currently pay tax on ‘interest’ that, in practice, partially just reflects the effects of inflation. I submit that we should allow taxpayers to deduct inflation from taxable income earned via long term saving. Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. I submit that any taxes on water should operate in a similar way to water rights pricing and be sector neutral – politicians should avoid targeting specific industries or uses of water. As an alternative to recommending specific environmental taxes, I submit that the Working Group develop an objective framework for future proposed environmental taxes to be measured against. Lifestyle taxes I submit that the Working Group recommend against the expansion of behavioural taxes, and instead outline the regressive financial damage they inflict on our most vulnerable communities. Specifically: I oppose the introduction of a sugar tax, a fat tax, or any other form of additional tax on food products. I oppose varying GST for different products. I oppose increases to tobacco excise. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union.

This will, in time, effectively stop the rich/non- New Zealanders from buying houses and renting, opening up opportunites for NZ first home buyers to secure a home in NZ. I submit that instead of Capital Gains Tax, persons who are not NZ Citizens are not able to purchase land, houses, appartments, or any related living area/s that would take homes away from New Zealanders. This would result in a possible short-term finicial change (downward), but would be securing the future of New Zealanders, and effectivly make buying a home a possible prospect for many.

Sir Michael has said that the Tax Working Group is not about how to raise more revenue for the Government. I submit that this promise should be upheld as a matter of Sir Michael's credibity. Revenue neutrality Where new taxes and further tax hikes are recommended by the Working Group, I submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers with a view to making sure all New Zealanders share the burden of tax, and not just the few. This is the basis of equity and equality. Bracket creep / fiscal drag The effect of inflation pushing taxpayers into higher income tax brackets is a policy that allows politicians to tax New Zealanders further and harder, without ever having campaigned on it and obtained a mandate from the elecorate. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. It is note-worthy that many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Company taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. Countries with low company tax rates see company-driven investment, profits for the community, and an increased overall company tax-take due to an increase in business activty. I submit that if the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate.

Lifestyle taxes I submit that the Working Group carefully consider the expansion of behavioural taxes and the likely impact on our most vulnerable communities. However, there should be disincentives to consume some foods that have been proven to have an adverse health impact. The consequences of some foods such as sugar have a cost to all New Zealanders who make a conscious effort to manage their weight and health. revenue gathered from such taxes should be used to target education campaigns to reduce the health impact of such foods as sugar. Specifically: I support the introduction of a sugar tax, but oppose at this time any other form of additional tax on food products. I oppose varying GST for different products. I support the increases to tobacco excise. 178 Generally I support the review of the New Zealand tax system but strongly recommend that all New Zealanders be treated equally, specifically that Maori be not given any special treatment and that businesses operating through a charitable trust structure be taxed the same as all other businesses and only exempted tromp tax for income distributed for charitable purposes to genuine beneficiaries.

Sir Michael has said that the Tax Working Group is not about how to raise more revenue for the Government. I submit that this promise should be upheld. As a Government employee working in the education sector, my salary has not kept up with inflation. Living costs have increased but my pay has remained the same for the last 4 years. I have a mortgage in Auckland and I am barely scraping by each month. If I have $3 left to my name at the end of each pay fortnight, I consider myself lucky. Now Phil Goff wants to add additional unnecessary taxes in addition to a rates increase. In fact, Aucklanders may soon be paying more tax per litre of petrol, than actually paying for the petrol itself! Auckland Council is management heavy, all receiving fat bonuses and pay increases despite regularly falling short on set goals. They need to trim the fat in Council to find the additional funds, not go digging in my back pocket for more money! Especially when they are discussing REDUCING essential services like waste collection. It frightens me to hear Sir Michael discussing capital gains taxes, taxing MY hard earned savings etc. There are other ways to raise funds, taxing the hard working portion of the population into poverty SHOULD NOT BE YOUR FIRST CHOICE! Revenue neutrality Where new taxes and tax hikes are recommended by the Working Group, I submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. Bracket creep / fiscal drag The effect of inflation pushing taxpayers into higher income tax brackets is a dishonest policy that allows politicians to tax New Zealanders harder, without ever having campaigned on it. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation.

Yours sincerely, 192 From:Rex Nicholls Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 11:48 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to Tax Working Group Dear Sir Michael and members of the Tax Working Group, I am making this submission as an individual but using and adapting the Taxpayer Union submission. First, I wish to make three points of principle: 1. This Tax Working Group wais not set up to raise more revenue for the Government and Sir Michael has said as much. the promise that there will be no increase in total tax take should be upheld.That is, where new taxes and tax hikes are recommended by the Working Group, the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. 2. Humans react to incentives and disincentives; that is a basic animal behaviour set into our genes. Tax on income is a disincentive on productivity. Why earn more money once you have enough to support your family if you only get to keep 2/3 of it...? 3. Taxes should be taken at source. Overseas companies should pay tax on the income they earn in NZ in a fair manner. There shoudl be GST charged on all purchases, in an equal manner, be they at a shop in NZ or on-line. The system should be as simple as possible and fair. Bracket creep / fiscal drag The effect of inflation pushing taxpayers into higher income tax brackets is negative to tax payer motivation. It also allows higher tax take without the same removal of tax elsewhere. I ask that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to the general CPI. Many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Company taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. I submit that if the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate. This is preferable to the Background Paper’s proposal of just cutting rates just for smaller businesses, creating a two-tier business tax regime with the associated complexities and incentives for business to stay small. I suggest it is better to tax unproductive capital. Expensing of capital The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. \[1\] 193 I submit that the Working Group recommend allowing businesses full capital expensing within the first year of productive-capital purchases. This would increase incentives for business to invest in capital (accelerating productivity growth) and increase wages (productivity growth is the most relevant factor in determining income growth). Maori Authorities and charities New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages. As soon as Maori land claims have all been settled, which should occur soon after your Tax Working Group reports back and Governement begins to implement new tax policy, the 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Commercial Authorities should be abolished to make them equal to normal businesses. This will allow Maori to consider themselves equals. They were once a very commenrcial people and Ngai Tahu prove they can be again once they re-gain that confidence. All companies and money making ventures owned by charities including, religious bodies, should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction for profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically and transarently applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. Capital gains tax A tax on commercial capital gains discourages investment. It stifles wage growth and distorts the economy. It also causes a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors are discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments into more productive ones, particularly in the area of property. I recommend, however, that there needs to be a capital gains tax on unproductive assets. All houses, non- government land not including productive farms, and unproductive assets need a yearly capital tax applied. This would be tiny but would incentivise older people to move to smaller homes freeing up larger homes for families, etc. There is no shortage of rooms in NZ, just too many unused rooms in large houses. Personal effects are probably too hard to tax. In Denmark this leads to the rich investing in art etc, but this is a negligable cost against the rest of the population and they will already be paying a considerable amount of tax. Taxes on savings The tax system should not discourage saving. Savers (namely those with retirement funds and investment schemes) currently pay tax on ‘interest’ that, in practice, partially just reflects the effects of inflation. Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. I submit that any taxes on water should operate in a similar way to water rights pricing and be sector neutral – politicians should avoid targeting specific industries or uses of water. Exported water is negligable and the income derived from wages and export earnings outweigh the 'jealousy' effect. Lifestyle taxes I submit that the Working Group recommend against the expansion of behavioural taxes, and instead outline the regressive financial damage they inflict on our most vulnerable communities. 194 Specifically: I oppose the introduction of a sugar tax, a fat tax, or any other form of additional tax on food products. I oppose varying GST for different products. I oppose increases to tobacco excise. Already the tobacco tax covers far more than the cost of the health effects of tobacco. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union.

I note that many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Company taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. I submit that if the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate. This is preferable to the Background Paper’s proposal of just cutting rates just for smaller businesses, creating a two-tier business tax regime with the associated complexities and incentives for business to stay small. Expensing of capital The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. I submit that the Working G roup recommend allowing businesses full capital expensing within the first year of capital purchase. This would increase incentives for business to invest in capital (accelerating productivity growth) and increase wages (productivity growth is the most relevant factor in determining income growth). Maori Authorities and charities \[1\] 201 New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages. I submit that the 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities should be abolished – so that Maori Authorities are not provided with a cash flow advantage over non-Maori competitors. I submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction for profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. Capital gains tax A tax on capital gains would discourage investment, stifling wage growth and distorting the economy. It would also cause a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments. I submit that the Government should not implement such a tax. Taxes on savings We should not allow the tax system to discourage saving. Savers (namely those with retirement funds and investment schemes) currently pay tax on ‘interest’ that, in practice, partially just reflects the effects of inflation. I submit that we should allow taxpayers to deduct inflation from taxable income earned via long term saving. Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. I submit that any taxes on water should operate in a similar way to water rights pricing and be sector neutral – politicians should avoid targeting specific industries or uses of water. As an alternative to recommending specific environmental taxes, I submit that the Working Group develop an objective framework for future proposed environmental taxes to be measured against. Lifestyle taxes I submit that the Working Group recommend against the expansion of behavioural taxes, and instead outline the regressive financial damage they inflict on our most vulnerable communities. Specifically: I oppose the introduction of a sugar tax, a fat tax, or any other form of additional tax on food products. I oppose varying GST for different products. I oppose increases to tobacco excise. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union.

Sir Michael has said that the Tax Working Group is not about how to raise more revenue for the Government. I submit that this promise should be upheld. Further, it should be noted that New Zealanders make many future decisions on how to structure their lives based on the rules that the government sets. Any changes to those rules (of which tax is one such rule with a disproportionate effect) should not be taken lightly. Your decisions have the ability to significantly disrupt hardworking New Zealanders (who have acted prudently and within the rules and structures dictated by the government) lives and undermine plans that can be decades in preparation and execution. Tinkering to create a 'perfect' tax system (which is unobtainable) should be avoided given the significant costs and disruption it will give to hard working and prudent New Zealanders. Changes will undermine the stability of those people who work hard to keep New Zealand prosperous and stable. Revenue neutrality Where new taxes and tax hikes are recommended by the Working Group, I submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. As far as possible the tax burden on individuals should remain neutral and not be used to increase the burdens on one group. Bracket creep / fiscal drag The effect of inflation pushing taxpayers into higher income tax brackets is a dishonest policy that allows politicians to tax New Zealanders harder, without ever having campaigned on it. Further it provides a perverse incentive to politicians to undermine the monetary system to increase tax (thus becoming an incredibly distructive tax increase) I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. I note that many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Company taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD.

Savers (namely those with retirement funds and investment schemes) currently pay tax on ‘interest’ that, in practice, partially just reflects the effects of inflation. I submit that we should allow taxpayers to deduct inflation from taxable income earned via saving or investing. Taxes on accruals Taxes should only be levied on actual gains (in income or capital, noting that I submit that no capital gains tax be recommended). Any taxes on deemed gains or accruals is arbitrary - as no gain is actually made until a transaction occurs - and is merely the tax authority forcing what they believe the value of an asset is in place of the actual owner of the asset. Without an underlying income flow, taxes on accruals could also force sale on anyone subject to the tax in order to meet tax obligations. This is distortionary and unfair and would affect those who are asset rich / income poor significantly. Further any such tax on an accrual will significantly complicate the tax system. I submit all taxes should only be levied on actual income flows and not on accruals or accounting gains or losses. Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. I submit that any taxes on water should operate in a similar way to water rights pricing and be sector neutral – politicians should avoid targeting specific industries or uses of water.

Specifically: I oppose the introduction of a sugar tax, a fat tax, or any other form of additional tax on food products. I oppose varying GST for different products. I oppose increases to tobacco excise. Such taxes will needlessly complicate a simple tax system. Simplicity Ordinary people and businesses must be able to understand and follow the tax rules without specialist help. Changes should not create complicated rules that force ordinary people to rely on specialist advice (particularly given the penalties for non-compliance with tax law are severe).

Dear Sir Michael and members of the Tax Working Group, Previously send via taxpayers union - but it was unclear whether it was directed to taxpayer group or taxpayer union - so I have reworked and resubmitted directly - apologies This is a submission on the future of tax in New Zealand, with particular reference to the proposals and questions set out in the Working Group’s Background Paper. Sir Michael has said that the Tax Working Group is not about how to raise more revenue for the Government. I submit that this promise should be upheld. Future of tax & Purpose of tax Liberal myth, government spending more and doing more is best. Conservative myth, govenment doing less and spending less is best. Business myth, running government like a business is best. People myth, hiring better people is best - its not the people its the system... Actual answer is to increase effectivness, adaptability, and capacity to innovate. Achieved by changing their purpose, incentives and accountability, power strucuture and culture within department. Presently NZ is too high in taxpayers and companies who are publically funded. For the country to flourish the portion of private companies, and taxpayers needs to increase as these are the ones who bring profit to the country. Presently (at least locally) there is a view to selling off capital/ natural resources to gain profit - this is a best a short term fix and longterm disaster. This model needs to be stopped. "Banishing Bureauocracy, The Five Strategies for Reinventing Government, which details how to permanently change public administrations to increase their effectiveness, efficiency, and capacity for innovation. " Presently NZ has many opportunities, if a clear clean way forward is enabled. With Britain leaving the EU, the commonwealth could become the "powerhouse". Overwhelming taxation and regulations have caused startups, businesses and investment have flooded to London and ignored Paris and other European capitals. I propose NZ engage in a free speech, "low, but strict regulation" and reasonable taxation. Lets encourage start ups, innovations and free thinkers to start here. Why the commonwealth could become the new superpower https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN9Tn1QRBTc Why Macron will destroy the EU https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScTjRlbsgQ \[1\] 219 Exports NZ organic and food quality is not up to UK standards. Last year Russia dropped our beef due to contamination with a chemical often added to pork feed. We have the tracking technology to identify where this came from but no MPI effort bothered. We need to start now breaking apart failed MPI and reintroducing the high standards and infrastruture our imports and exports had previously. Sustainable permiculture advocated by"intergrity soils" removing pollutants of nitrogen fertiliser, roundup and restoring toilsoil/humus and soil microbes and reducing depandance on irrigation are perfect commercial alternatives to organic and implementation of these measures now would lead to a higher demand for our exports and the specialised products demanding higher cost. It would address water quality issues where effective by rural contaimination of nitrogen fertiliser. Additionally NZ and Australia lamb and beef export to one another push each others prices down - this seems like a complete waste of time. Rigour and high standard governement testing vital, a strong brand - beef raised on organic pasture/ beef raised on organic silvopasture/ organic grass feed - Allowing a clear strictly controlled dairy. beef & lamb both locally and internationally, requiring industry to pay producers a higher price and process brand separately allows consumers to choose well produced humane products (Labelling ritually slaughter meat has been suggested - so I may choose not to buy it as I think its inhumane, just like I don’t buy tested on animal products.) taxing right things & housing more affordable & matters most Revenue neutrality Where new taxes and tax hikes are recommended by the Working Group, I submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. The failure of government departments to meet goals/obligations results in more money and extension of the departments, in the marketplace - companies fail when they fail to meet obigations. We need to set up a new mentality within government departments with a new set of obligations - with clear economic analysis to stem tide of fiscal irresponsibility. Additionally a surgeon may spend less than 25% of their time in surgery - 75% paperwork. That is an inefficient use of human resource - yet every layer of bureauocracy with the health system creates a new report/ health & safetly the surgeonn must complete. It is vital we strip back these wasteful bureauocratic layers. The same can be said for teachers and many other productive vs bureauocratic/health and safety layers. It seems fairly straightforward that electing members of the public to run a hospital - does not work and its very expensive. Board members are so entrenched now ... I say we get rid of elected boards and put surgeons, doctors and nurses back in charge of hospitals .... Under the governance of state run services with a yearly audit/warrant of fitness. Then hospitals only get access to full budget if they improve their ratings. Its no point throwing money at the health system till we fix the systems that enabled the problem. So overloaded with bureaucratic paperwork/ health and safety that they missed the building rotting around them. .... For example, this year my partner recieved a glossy full color survey to complete for governemt funded "sport NZ" ... he had at least three reminders to complete the intrusive 20 page Orwellian study, with a $500 lucky dip reward - what is the cost to taxpayer of this department. Additionally our local Horowhenua 220 council has employed at least one nutritionist full time - to advise on local health ... Meanwhile in another expensive bureauocratic layer - an advisory board to local council is trying to sell off local parks and community halls because of lack of funding .... all these layers of bureauocracy for national to local are removing the actual resources from the local community, which is the worst possible outcome for the health and well being of community and financial resources are being misapplied. Why is the government spending funds on anti- smoking campaigns still, speeding campaigns ... Nannys and nudgers, government agents engaging in proganda about how individuals should spend their lives, smoking is just one example. It is an offense to individual liberty and personal responsibility and those funds could be far better spent elsewhere. How much per taxpayer is spent on advertising propaganda? $50? $100?Wouldn't people rather have that in their pocket ? Company taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. (I submit that if the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate. This is preferable to the Background Paper’s proposal of just cutting rates just for smaller businesses, creating a two-tier business tax regime with the associated complexities and incentives for business to stay small.) Professor Mark Blythe discusses how the tax department is the favourite department in Sweden, because they make it transparent where taxes go and make it easy to meet obligations. In NZ we are blocked from understanding where taxes go. How much welfare goes to the poor and how much is spent on mantaining staff and offices? Would waste go down if departments were more transparent about spending and had a clear economic analysis of spending/results. Funding outcomes, not imputs. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vnr7GN5T\_tg I have pondered whether NZ would be best to implement 20% flat tax rate, income, company and gst. (First $10,000 tax free personal) Close off loopholes and offsets for high income earners or overseas investers. Easy implementation, transparency and same across every class and avoidance prosecuted harshly. I have idea how to rework ACC/health which is not suited here but in terms of charging, I would simplify $800 fee for a builder. $600 for a plumber a set fee for each employee of each job. With a 10% discount for no serious workplace injuries in laast 2 years. The billing for acc is confusing and tries to fleece based on profit, not on a good safety record .. it should not cost extra for profitable business, it should reward safety and it should be utterly easy for small business to factor cost of new staff. I would dissolve the ACC case managers etc. and reassign this funding to health. Would start a traffic light system for surgery treatment eliminating acc approvals etc. Lets take this funding for treatment and put it fully into the health system for treatment. Maybe still it over charges - which it currently does, but having a no/minimal wait time for treatment - whether that be an accident or cancer or appendicitis. Urgent and accident - Red, Accident, and mixed origin with good change of recovery back to work - orange, Mid to longterm problem - significant improvement to life - yellow Longterm problem - green. Non urgent waiting list - blue 221 (Additionally acc and health & safety are trying to manage for the average in so doing they have become obstructive for the competant and profoundly clever - have you seen Parkour or freerunning, it does not make sense to to and dumb these people down, for the help of the most clumsey. Health and safety was started so companies had to provide safe environments and not require undue risk taking for staff to cut costs. Nowadays the biggest bully in a company will be a workplace health and safety officer. We need to dial this back and encourage individual competence and freedom, realising accidents will always happen. Its a similar thing I noticed in my teacher training, failure to allow kids to flourish in their own ways according to their strengths, the goal was to keep everyone average. ) Expensing of capital The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. I submit that the Working Group recommend allowing businesses full capital expensing within the first year of capital purchase. This would increase incentives for business to invest in capital (accelerating productivity growth) and increase wages (productivity growth is the most relevant factor in determining income growth). Charities New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages. I submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction for profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. Additionally charties should be obligated to provide a public breakdown of dollar distribtution. I should know what percentage of my of donation reaches the end user and how much goes to sustain the charity or on advertising/propganda. This way public will be able to support charities that are fulfilling their stated purpose and hopefully those that squander will fail. (I am sure greenpeace functions in such a way, where funding goes to advertising/campaigns and very little goes into research and development or supporting green causes on the ground. ) Capital gains tax - Housing A tax on capital gains would discourage investment, stifling wage growth and distorting the economy. It would also cause a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments. I submit that the Government should not implement such a tax. Should the government - could the capital gains tax only apply to foreign investors/foreign companies and not to local people and local companies. (We have seen this implemented in other countries and it most negatively effects family farms and working class families who inherit a home.) I would suggest at most, should a productive farm or inherited farm be subdivided into lifestyle blocks or a subdivision, that a capital gains tax of some form may be applicable ... 222 ... I would suggest that local councils that receive excessive substantial complaints, increases rates over the costs of inflation, refuses transparency needs to automatically have audit and oversight. We need to urgently close local body government - these are expensive to run. They are creating several layers of bureaucracy to avoid dealing with the public and public concerns and protecting their own interests. Boards and advisory boards are being mismanaged, participants are selected based on thinking the same as the aims of organiser - not have a variety of innovators and diverse industries. They are bullies in how they are being implemented. Additionally government / environmental and ratepayers should be able to put an injunction on councils to granting any new resource consents/new builds if the infrasture of water and sewage is struggling to cope. As an option, I as a a government option to councils to fund the design and a project manager to oversea correct implementation of water and sewage plant with green/sustainable design. Perhaps in new locations - such as Horowhenua waste is it still going in lake for over 20years - relocation priority. This would allow a cheaper design cost buy government funding in bulk, but also demand a high standard and better quality than any individual small council can obtain on its own ... This is a company that has worked in NZ before and indicates the ideal, while a cost it and provides benefits in employment, tourism, environmentalism, and cultural - NZ part starts about halfway through. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VlY- 3V63yI&t=0s&list=PL4tNPdK4jtOxHIm1Hy5eQqHbbEBNqWxDW&index=6 Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. Is water a commodity like oil or a right, like air. I have researched this extensively for a submission on Te Waikoropupū Springs and Associated Waterbodies. Without Iwi rights many of our natural resources would have already been sold to China and now we are still seeing individuals trying to profiteer off a natural resource in water exports and councils granting irrigation with no understanding. Implications are nitrogen application Farming and water in NZ is suffering the “tragedy of the commons” - an economic theory of a situation within a shared-resource system where individual users acting independently according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or spoiling that resource through their collective action. The average annual rainfall in Takaka (where springs are)is 2019mm. My partner, a second generation farmer, suggested that the farmer unable to farm with this rainfall, displays a competence level is so low, they shouldn’t be allowed to farm. To qualify - Michaels family have farmed in Manakau, Levin since 1980s. Their annual rainfall is 1141mm, Nitrogen/Urea fertiliser free and no irrigation farming at 1.4 stocking units. Cambridge/Waikato - dairy farm country annual rainfall average 1214mm per annum. Farming is in a diasterous spot. Flawed Farming Methods - In 2007 Richard Mulvaney, Saeed Khan, and Tim Ellsworth of the University of Illinois announced the disaster of Synthetic Nitrogen fertiliser. The Marrow Plots, the oldest experimental fields studying soil fertility est. in 1876. Synthetic Nitrogen fertiliser, used on the plot since 1967, had significantly reduced the organic soil matter and nitrogen - the opposite of what its thought to do. A German grassland study (begun 2002) found as species diversity increases so does annual biomass - more than using fertiliser. Even when nitrogen rates increased to 200kg/ha, plant diversity trumped biomass production. Biomass production kept doubling with pasture plots up to 60 species. As species increased so did soil carbon whereas soil carbon declined with monocultures. 223 Current farming practices include a problematic monoculture of rye and clover, this has transitioned to further problematic annuals that require yearly tilling and replanting - further increasing loss of carbon. There is an insistence of farmers (agricultural and horticultural) to grab surface water, then aquifers. For some reason - nz has not identified farming practices are requiring irrigation - where none should be needed. Due to the synthetic nitrogen, there is a loss of carbon in soil. Therefore the soil no longer has any structure and the soil water holding capacity is significantly reduced. Precious topsoil is washed away in rain and the soil soaked with inorganic nitrogen provides plant and algae structure in the water the same “growth burst” as the do the plant on land - explaining the massive algae blooms. The plants may look fine but the edifice that supports them is crumbling. (This is particularly problematic with forestry.) Nestle produces in three days what Fonterra produces in a year. China has built the worlds biggest dairy farm on the Russian border and since this time NZ milk prices have dropped. Fonterra has been satisfied to push farmers to intensification, increasing yield and reducing payouts for short term and unsustainable gain. Whether Fonterra will still exist in ten years time is questionable if milk powder to china is aim. Instead of innovation, A2/allergenic and grassfeed, grass finished, hormone and antibiotic free, permaculture, regenerative products into higher end markets is not pursued and lowering processing cost and increasing farmer payouts. NZ Farmers today have been satisfied to haemorrhage their profits to fertiliser, irrigation companies and other associated chemicals & gadgets ... they have lost touch with the health of the land and with the desire of the consumer for low pollution organic produce. (The regenerative farming model mixes organic style land practices based on ancient prairie grazing with modern treatment of the cow. ) I submit that any taxes on water should operate only on irrigation, (drip irrigation should be excluded). And commerical industries. As an alternative to recommending specific environmental taxes, I submit that the Working Group develop an objective framework for future proposed environmental taxes to be measured against.

Savers (namely those with retirement funds and investment schemes) currently pay tax on ‘interest’ that, in practice, partially just reflects the effects of inflation. I submit that we should allow taxpayers to deduct inflation from taxable income earned via long term saving. 224 Lifestyle taxes I submit that the Working Group recommend against the expansion of behavioural taxes, and instead outline the regressive financial damage they inflict on our most vulnerable communities. Specifically: I oppose the introduction of a sugar tax, a fat tax, or any other form of additional tax on food products. I oppose varying GST for different products. I oppose increases to tobacco excise. ....

The second option is a far better use of resources, but on the market looks like a failure because the number of fridges sold, drops. How can we use transparency to support companies that are using resources better? I am an artist just outside Otaki, living with a second generation farmer.Between us, we have encountered bureauocratic bullying and with too much time have tried to think clearly about the structural changes both coming from anti authoritarian, but opposing left/right view point. Our communiity is struggling with a corrupt council, that has numerous complaints, cost overruns and lack of transparency and individual blocking outside voices to protect their own interests- blocking competition as one only can in small conservative communities. English common law works so well, because it is bottom up - but the last few years ignorance of economics and overload of self interested politicians and government funded "non profits" and companies have caused a more french "top down" attitude from all levels of governement. This has impedied individual freedom and grass roots actions. And may well be contributing to overuse of resources in farming... lets get back to a country where our independance and innovation is not blocked by overburdened tax and regulation.

Sir Michael has said that the Tax Working Group is not about how to raise more revenue for the Government. I submit that this promise should be upheld. Unfortunately however we know only too well that the so called Tax Working Groups " raison d'etre" is to dream up as many new taxes as their imaginations will allow.It's a clever ploy by the Government to devolve responsibility for the tax hikes that are to come because they (the Goverment)will only be implementing the recommendations of theTWG.We have already seen the PM renege on her promise of no new tax in this Parliament.This whole process of consultation is a complete sham; the decisions to recommend a raft of new taxes have already been made.I really don't know why I am wasting my time making this submission. Revenue neutrality Where new taxes and tax hikes are recommended by the Working Group, I submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers.Wouldn't that be amazing....revenue neutrality but it will never happen fot the reasons I have already indicated. Bracket creep / fiscal drag The effect of inflation pushing taxpayers into higher income tax brackets is a dishonest policy that allows politicians to tax New Zealanders harder, without ever having campaigned on it.NZ must be one of the few "civilized" countries world wide to get away with this outrageous scam.Not only that taxing the first dollar of everyones income (even children!) is an absolute disgrace! I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. I note that many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different.I will go further and say that low income families should be taken out of the income tax loop completely as is the norm in societies that do more than just pay lip service to eradicating child poverty and actively encourage the work ethic. Company taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. I submit that if the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate. This is preferable to the Background Paper’s proposal of just cutting rates just for smaller businesses, creating a two-tier business tax regime with the associated complexities and incentives for business to stay small.The plan of course with a two tier system is to deliberately make it more complicated and expensive to administer....more non productive jobs for civil servants,less transparency and the propagation of tax hikes for all business disguised as tax incentives! \[1\] 226 Expensing of capital The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. I submit that the Working Group recommend allowing businesses full capital expensing within the first year of capital purchase. This would increase incentives for business to invest in capital (accelerating productivity growth) and increase wages (productivity growth is the most relevant factor in determining income growth). Maori Authorities and charities New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages. I submit that the 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities should be abolished – so that Maori Authorities are not provided with a cash flow advantage over non-Maori competitors.I only very recently discovered this discriminatory approach;it's racist and quite deplorable I submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction for profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent and not be siphoned off to line the pockets of individuals or promote pet projects. Capital gains tax A tax on capital gains would discourage investment, stifling wage growth and distorting the economy. It would also cause a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments. I submit that the Government should not implement such a tax'it's divisive and introduces unwelcome artificial skewing of the economy.

I submit that we should allow taxpayers to deduct inflation from taxable income earned via long term saving. Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. I submit that any taxes on water should operate in a similar way to water rights pricing and be sector neutral – politicians should avoid targeting specific industries or uses of water. As an alternative to recommending specific environmental taxes, I submit that the Working Group develop an objective framework for future proposed environmental taxes to be measured against. 227 Protection of the environment is a core resposibility of both National and local government if that responsibility is as we know not being properly discharged then either step down or learn to manage the public purse properly and stop wasting taxpayers money on empire building,junkets and ludicrous projects. Lifestyle taxes I submit that the Working Group recommend against the expansion of behavioural taxes, and instead outline the regressive financial damage they inflict on our most vulnerable communities. Specifically: I oppose the introduction of a sugar tax, a fat tax, or any other form of additional tax on food products. I oppose varying GST for different products. I oppose increases to tobacco excise.This is big brother saying we know what's best for the "populace" but experience should have told us tax hikes are not an effective tool and impact on the poorer members of our society.What's needed here is for Government to actually SPEND MONEY wisely on education but when was common sense ever likely to win the day........regretfully sometime NEVER!

Yours sincerely, 236 From:Al Armiger Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 9:54 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to Tax Working Group Dear Sir Michael and members of the Tax Working Group, This is a submission on the future of tax in New Zealand, with particular reference to the proposals and questions set out in the Working Group’s Background Paper. Sir Michael has said that the Tax Working Group is not about how to raise more revenue for the Government. I submit that this promise should be upheld. Revenue neutrality Where new taxes and tax hikes are recommended by the Working Group, I submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. Bracket creep / fiscal drag The effect of inflation pushing taxpayers into higher income tax brackets is a dishonest policy that allows politicians to tax New Zealanders harder, without ever having campaigned on it. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. I note that many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Company taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. I submit that if the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate. This is preferable to the Background Paper’s proposal of just cutting rates just for smaller businesses, creating a two-tier business tax regime with the associated complexities and incentives for business to stay small. Expensing of capital The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. I submit that the Working G roup recommend allowing businesses full capital expensing within the first year of capital purchase. This would increase incentives for business to invest in capital (accelerating productivity growth) and increase wages (productivity growth is the most relevant factor in determining income growth). Maori Authorities and charities \[1\] 237 New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages. I submit that the 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities should be abolished – so that Maori Authorities are not provided with a cash flow advantage over non-Maori competitors. I submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction for profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. Capital gains tax A tax on capital gains would discourage investment, stifling wage growth and distorting the economy. It would also cause a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments. I submit that the Government should not implement such a tax. Taxes on savings We should not allow the tax system to discourage saving. Savers (namely those with retirement funds and investment schemes) currently pay tax on ‘interest’ that, in practice, partially just reflects the effects of inflation. I submit that we should allow taxpayers to deduct inflation from taxable income earned via long term saving. Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. I submit that any taxes on water should operate in a similar way to water rights pricing and be sector neutral – politicians should avoid targeting specific industries or uses of water. As an alternative to recommending specific environmental taxes, I submit that the Working Group develop an objective framework for future proposed environmental taxes to be measured against. Lifestyle taxes I submit that the Working Group recommend against the expansion of behavioural taxes, and instead outline the regressive financial damage they inflict on our most vulnerable communities. Specifically: I oppose the introduction of a sugar tax, a fat tax, or any other form of additional tax on food products. I oppose varying GST for different products. I oppose increases to tobacco excise. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union.

Sir Michael has said that the Tax Working Group is not about how to raise more revenue for the Government. I submit that this promise should be upheld. Presently NZ has many opportunities, if a clear clean way forward is enabled. With Britain leaving the EU, the commonwealth could become the "powerhouse". Overwhelming taxation and regulations have caused startups, businesses and investment have flooded to London and ignored Paris and other European capitals. I propose NZ engage in a free speech, "low, but strict regulation" and reasonable taxation. Lets encourage start ups, innovations and free thinkers to start here. Why the commonwealth could become the new superpower https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN9Tn1QRBTc Why Macron will destroy the EU https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScTjRlbsgQ (NZ organic and food quality is not up to UK standards. Last year Russia dropped our beef due to contamination with a chemical often added to pork feed. We have the tracking technology to identify where this came from but no MPI effort bothered. We need to start now breaking apart failed MPI and reintroducing the high standards and infrastruture our imports and exports had previously. Sustainable permiculture advocated by"intergrity soils" removing pollutants of nitrogen fertiliser, roundup and restoring toilsoil/humus and soil microbes and reducing depandance on irrigation are perfect commercial alternatives to organic and implementation of these measures now would lead to a higher demand for our exports and the specialised products demanding higher cost. It would address water quality issues where effective by rural contaimination of nitrogen fertiliser. Rigour and high standard governement testing vital, a strong brand - beef raised on organic pasture/ beef raised on organic silvopasture/ organic grass feed ) Revenue neutrality Where new taxes and tax hikes are recommended by the Working Group, I submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. The failure of government departments to meet goals/obligations results in more money and extension of the departments, in the marketplace - companies fail when they fail to meet obigations. We need to set up a new mentality within government departments with a new set of obligations - with clear economic analysis to stem tide of fiscal irresponsibility. Additionally a surgeon may spend less than 25% of their time in surgery - 75% paperwork. That is an inefficient use of human resource - yet every layer of bureauocracy with the health system creates a new report/ health & safetly the surgeonn must complete. It is \[1\] 265 vital we strip back these wasteful bureauocratic layers. The same can be said for teachers and many other productive vs bureauocratic/health and safety layers. It seems fairly straightforward that electing members of the public to run a hospital - does not work and its very expensive. Board members are so entrenched now ... I say we get rid of elected boards and put surgeons, doctors and nurses back in charge of hospitals. Under the governance of state run services with a yearly audit/warrant of fitness. Then hospitals only get access to full budget if they improve their ratings. Its no point throwing money at the health system till we fix the systems that enabled the problem. So overloaded with bureaucratic paperwork/ health and safety that they missed the building rotting around them. "Banishing Bureauocracy, The Five Strategies for Reinventing Government, which details how to permanently change public administrations to increase their effectiveness, efficiency, and capacity for innovation. " .... For example, this year my partner recieved a glossy full color survey to complete for governemt funded "sport NZ" ... he had at least three reminders to complete the intrusive 20 page Orwellian study, with a $500 lucky dip reward - what is the cost to taxpayer of this department. Additionally our local Horowhenua council has employed at least one nutritionist full time - to advise on local health ... Meanwhile in another expensive bureauocratic layer - an advisory board to local council is trying to sell off local parks and community halls because of lack of funding .... all these layers of bureauocracy for national to local are removing the actual resources from the local community, which is the worst possible outcome for the health and well being of community and financial resources are being misapplied. Why is the government spending funds on anti- smoking campaigns still, speeding campaigns ... Nannys and nudgers, government agents engaging in proganda about how individuals should spend their lives, smoking is just one example. It is an offense to individual liberty and personal responsibility and those funds could be far better spent elsewhere. How much per taxpayer is spent on advertising propaganda? $50? $100?Wouldn't people rather have that in their pocket? ..... Liberal myth, government spending more and doing more is best. Conservative myth, govenment doing less and spending less is best. Business myth, running government like a business is best. People myth, hiring better people is best - its not the people its the system... Actual answer is to increase effectivness, adaptability, and capacity to innovate. Achieved by changing their purpose, incentives and accountability, power strucuture and culture within department. Presently NZ is too high in taxpayers and companies who are publically funded. For the country to flourish the portion of private companies, and taxpayers needs to increase as these are the ones who bring profit to the country. Presently (at least locally) there is a view to selling off capital/ natural resources to gain profit - this is a best a short term fix and longterm disaster. This model needs to be stopped. Company taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. I submit that if the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate. This is preferable to the Background Paper’s proposal of just cutting rates just for smaller businesses, creating a two-tier business tax regime with the associated complexities and incentives for business to stay small. 266 Professor Mark Blythe discusses how the tax department is the favourite department in Sweden, because they make it transparent where taxes go and make it easy to meet obligations. In NZ we are blocked from understanding where taxes go. How much welfare goes to the poor and how much is spent on mantaining staff and offices? Would waste go down if departments were more transparent about spending and had a clear economic analysis of spending/results. Funding outcomes, not imputs. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vnr7GN5T\_tg I have pondered whether NZ would be best to implement 20% flat tax rate, income, company and gst. (First $10,000 tax free personal) Close off loopholes and offsets for high income earners or overseas investers. Easy implementation, transparency and same across every class. I have idea how to rework ACC/health which is not suited here but in terms of charging, I would simplify $800 fee for a builder. $600 for a plumber a set fee for each employee of each job. With a 10% discount for no serious workplace injuries in laast 2 years. The billing for acc is confusing and tries to fleece based on profit, not on a good safety record .. it should not cost extra for profitable business, it should reward safety and it should be utterly easy for small business to factor cost of new staff. (Additionally acc and health & safety are trying to manage for the average in so doing they have become obstructive for the competant and profoundly clever - have you seen Parkour or freerunning, it does not make sense to to and dumb these people down, for the help of the most clumsey. Health and safety was started so companies had to provide safe environments and not require undue risk taking for staff to cut costs. Nowadays the biggest bully in a company will be a workplace health and safety officer. We need to dial this back and encourage individual competence and freedom, realising accidents will always happen. Its a similar thing I noticed in my teacher training, failure to allow kids to flourish in their own ways according to their strengths, the goal was to keep everyone average. ) Expensing of capital The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. I submit that the Working Group recommend allowing businesses full capital expensing within the first year of capital purchase. This would increase incentives for business to invest in capital (accelerating productivity growth) and increase wages (productivity growth is the most relevant factor in determining income growth). Charities New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages. I submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction for profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. Additionally charties should be obligated to provide a public breakdown of dollar distribtution. I should know what percentage of my of donation reaches the end user and how much goes to sustain the charity or on advertising/propganda. This way public will be able to support charities that are fulfilling their stated purpose and hopefully those that squander will fail. I am sure greenpeace functions in such a way, where funding goes to advertising/campaigns and very little goes into research and development or supporting green causes on the ground. 267 Capital gains tax A tax on capital gains would discourage investment, stifling wage growth and distorting the economy. It would also cause a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments. I submit that the Government should not implement such a tax. Should the government - could the capital gains tax only apply to foreign investors/foreign companies and not to local people and local companies. (We have seen this implemented in other countries and it most negatively effects family farms and working class families who inherit a home.) I would suggest at most, should a productive farm or inherited farm be subdivided into lifestyle blocks or a subdivision, that a capital gains tax of some form may be applicable ... Taxes on savings We should not allow the tax system to discourage saving. Savers (namely those with retirement funds and investment schemes) currently pay tax on ‘interest’ that, in practice, partially just reflects the effects of inflation. I submit that we should allow taxpayers to deduct inflation from taxable income earned via long term saving. Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. Is water a commodity like oil or a right, like air. I have researched this extensively for a submission on Te Waikoropupū Springs and Associated Waterbodies. Without Iwi rights many of our natural resources would have already been sold to China and now we are still seeing individuals trying to profiteer off a natural resource in water exports and councils granting irrigation with no understanding. Implications are nitrogen application Farming and water in NZ is suffering the “tragedy of the commons” - an economic theory of a situation within a shared-resource system where individual users acting independently according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or spoiling that resource through their collective action. The average annual rainfall in Takaka (where springs are)is 2019mm. My partner, a second generation farmer, suggested that the farmer unable to farm with this rainfall, displays a competence level is so low, they shouldn’t be allowed to farm. To qualify - Michaels family have farmed in Manakau, Levin since 1980s. Their annual rainfall is 1141mm, Nitrogen/Urea fertiliser free and no irrigation farming at 1.4 stocking units. Cambridge/Waikato - dairy farm country annual rainfall average 1214mm per annum. Farming is in a diasterous spot. Flawed Farming Methods - In 2007 Richard Mulvaney, Saeed Khan, and Tim Ellsworth of the University of Illinois announced the disaster of Synthetic Nitrogen fertiliser. The Marrow Plots, the oldest experimental fields studying soil fertility est. in 1876. Synthetic Nitrogen fertiliser, used on the plot since 1967, had significantly reduced the organic soil matter and nitrogen - the opposite of what its thought to do. A German grassland study (begun 2002) found as species diversity increases so does annual biomass - more than using fertiliser. Even when nitrogen rates increased to 200kg/ha, plant diversity trumped 268 biomass production. Biomass production kept doubling with pasture plots up to 60 species. As species increased so did soil carbon whereas soil carbon declined with monocultures. Current farming practices include a problematic monoculture of rye and clover, this has transitioned to further problematic annuals that require yearly tilling and replanting - further increasing loss of carbon. There is an insistence of farmers (agricultural and horticultural) to grab surface water, then aquifers. For some reason - nz has not identified farming practices are requiring irrigation - where none should be needed. Due to the synthetic nitrogen, there is a loss of carbon in soil. Therefore the soil no longer has any structure and the soil water holding capacity is significantly reduced. Precious topsoil is washed away in rain and the soil soaked with inorganic nitrogen provides plant and algae structure in the water the same “growth burst” as the do the plant on land - explaining the massive algae blooms. The plants may look fine but the edifice that supports them is crumbling. (This is particularly problematic with forestry.) Nestle produces in three days what Fonterra produces in a year. China has built the worlds biggest dairy farm on the Russian border and since this time NZ milk prices have dropped. Fonterra has been satisfied to push farmers to intensification, increasing yield and reducing payouts for short term and unsustainable gain. Whether Fonterra will still exist in ten years time is questionable if milk powder to china is aim. Instead of innovation, A2/allergenic and grassfeed, grass finished, hormone and antibiotic free, permaculture, regenerative products into higher end markets is not pursued and lowering processing cost and increasing farmer payouts. NZ Farmers today have been satisfied to haemorrhage their profits to fertiliser, irrigation companies and other associated chemicals & gadgets ... they have lost touch with the health of the land and with the desire of the consumer for low pollution organic produce. (The regenerative farming model mixes organic style land practices based on ancient prairie grazing with modern treatment of the cow. ) I submit that any taxes on water should operate only on irrigation, drip irrigation should be excluded. And commerical industries. As an alternative to recommending specific environmental taxes, I submit that the Working Group develop an objective framework for future proposed environmental taxes to be measured against.

Our communiity is struggling with a corrupt council, that has numerous complaints, cost overruns and lack of transparency and individual blocking outside voices to protect their own interests- blocking competition as one only can in small conservative communities. English common law works so well, because it is bottom up - but the last few years ignorance of economics and overload of self interested politicians and government funded "non profits" and companies have caused a more french "top down" attitude from all levels of governement. This has impedied individual freedom and grass roots actions. And may well be contributing to overuse of resources in farming... lets get back to a country where our independance and innovation is not blocked by overburdened tax and regulation.

I submit that if the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate. This is preferable to the Background Paper’s proposal of just cutting rates just for smaller businesses, creating a two-tier business tax regime with the associated complexities and incentives for business to stay small. Expensing of capital The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. I submit that the Working G roup recommend allowing businesses full capital expensing within the first year of capital purchase. This would increase incentives for business to invest in capital (accelerating productivity growth) and increase wages (productivity growth is the most relevant factor in determining income growth). Maori Authorities and charities \[1\] 274 New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages. I submit that the 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities should be abolished – so that Maori Authorities are not provided with a cash flow advantage over non-Maori competitors. I submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction for profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. Capital gains tax A tax on capital gains would discourage investment, stifling wage growth and distorting the economy. It would also cause a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments. I submit that the Government should not implement such a tax. Taxes on savings We should not allow the tax system to discourage saving. Savers (namely those with retirement funds and investment schemes) currently pay tax on ‘interest’ that, in practice, partially just reflects the effects of inflation. I submit that we should allow taxpayers to deduct inflation from taxable income earned via long term saving. Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. I submit that any taxes on water should operate in a similar way to water rights pricing and be sector neutral – politicians should avoid targeting specific industries or uses of water. As an alternative to recommending specific environmental taxes, I submit that the Working Group develop an objective framework for future proposed environmental taxes to be measured against. Lifestyle taxes I submit that the Working Group recommend against the expansion of behavioural taxes, and instead outline the regressive financial damage they inflict on our most vulnerable communities. Specifically: I oppose the introduction of a sugar tax, a fat tax, or any other form of additional tax on food products. I oppose varying GST for different products. I oppose increases to tobacco excise. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union.

Yours sincerely, 294 From:Michael McCook Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 7:49 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to Tax Working Group Dear Sir Michael and members of the Tax Working Group, This is a submission on the future of tax in New Zealand, with particular reference to the proposals and questions set out in the Working Group’s Background Paper. Sir Michael has said that the Tax Working Group is not about how to raise more revenue for the Government. I submit that this promise should be upheld. Revenue neutrality Where new taxes and tax hikes are recommended by the Working Group, I submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. Bracket creep / fiscal drag The effect of inflation pushing taxpayers into higher income tax brackets is a dishonest policy that allows politicians to tax New Zealanders harder, without ever having campaigned on it. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. I note that many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Company taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. I submit that if the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate. This is preferable to the Background Paper’s proposal of just cutting rates just for smaller businesses, creating a two-tier business tax regime with the associated complexities and incentives for business to stay small. Expensing of capital The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. I submit that the Working G roup recommend allowing businesses full capital expensing within the first year of capital purchase. This would increase incentives for business to invest in capital (accelerating productivity growth) and increase wages (productivity growth is the most relevant factor in determining income growth). Maori Authorities and charities \[1\] 295 New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages. I submit that the 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities should be abolished – so that Maori Authorities are not provided with a cash flow advantage over non-Maori competitors. I submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction for profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. Capital gains tax A tax on capital gains would discourage investment, stifling wage growth and distorting the economy. It would also cause a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments. I submit that the Government should not implement such a tax.

Yours sincerely, 312 From:Lauren James Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 6:35 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to Tax Working Group Dear Sir Michael and members of the Tax Working Group, This is a submission on the future of tax in New Zealand, with particular reference to the proposals and questions set out in the Working Group’s Background Paper. Sir Michael has said that the Tax Working Group is not about how to raise more revenue for the Government. I submit that this promise should be upheld. Revenue neutrality Where new taxes and tax hikes are recommended by the Working Group, I submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. Bracket creep / fiscal drag The effect of inflation pushing taxpayers into higher income tax brackets is a dishonest policy that allows politicians to tax New Zealanders harder, without ever having campaigned on it. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. I note that many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Company taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. I submit that if the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate. This is preferable to the Background Paper’s proposal of just cutting rates just for smaller businesses, creating a two-tier business tax regime with the associated complexities and incentives for business to stay small. Expensing of capital The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. I submit that the Working G roup recommend allowing businesses full capital expensing within the first year of capital purchase. This would increase incentives for business to invest in capital (accelerating productivity growth) and increase wages (productivity growth is the most relevant factor in determining income growth). Maori Authorities and charities \[1\] 313 New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages. I submit that the 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities should be abolished – so that Maori Authorities are not provided with a cash flow advantage over non-Maori competitors. I submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction for profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. Capital gains tax A tax on capital gains would discourage investment, stifling wage growth and distorting the economy. It would also cause a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments. I submit that the Government should not implement such a tax. Taxes on savings We should not allow the tax system to discourage saving. Savers (namely those with retirement funds and investment schemes) currently pay tax on ‘interest’ that, in practice, partially just reflects the effects of inflation. I submit that we should allow taxpayers to deduct inflation from taxable income earned via long term saving. Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. I submit that any taxes on water should operate in a similar way to water rights pricing and be sector neutral – politicians should avoid targeting specific industries or uses of water. As an alternative to recommending specific environmental taxes, I submit that the Working Group develop an objective framework for future proposed environmental taxes to be measured against. Lifestyle taxes I submit that the Working Group recommend against the expansion of behavioural taxes, and instead outline the regressive financial damage they inflict on our most vulnerable communities. Specifically: I oppose the introduction of a sugar tax, a fat tax, or any other form of additional tax on food products. I oppose varying GST for different products. I oppose increases to tobacco excise. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union.

Sir Michael has said that the Tax Working Group is not about how to raise more revenue for the Government. I submit that this promise should be upheld. No mandate The leading party of the government coalition which set up this working group received less than 37% of the vote. This government has no moral mandate to make sweeping changes to the tax system. This government would have no political mandate if it weren't for MMP, which as a system is a disgrace. The reason you will ignore the issue of mandate is that you are rabid Socialists intent on wealth re- distribution at all costs and pandering to the United Nations. You have no interest in promoting self-sufficiency or individual liberty. You are mainly interested in boosting your voter base by providing 'free' and undeserved income and other benefits to those who haven't earned them.

I do not wish to appear before the Working Group. Sir Michael has said that the Tax Working Group is not about how to raise more revenue for the Government. I submit that this promise should be upheld. Revenue neutrality Where new taxes, tax hikes or tax rebalancing are recommended by the Working Group, I submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. Bracket creep / fiscal drag The effect of inflation pushing taxpayers into higher income tax brackets is a dishonest policy that allows politicians to tax New Zealanders harder, without ever having campaigned on it. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. I note that many government benefits and entitlements are indexed; income tax thresholds should be treated no differently. Company taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy, and with a higher than necessary dependence on foreign capital. I submit that if the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate. This is preferable to the Background Paper’s proposal of just cutting rates just for smaller businesses, creating a two-tier business tax regime with the associated complexities and additional running costs, and incentives for business to stay small. Expensing of capital The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. I submit that the Working Group recommend allowing all businesses full capital expensing within the first year of capital purchase. This would increase incentives for business to invest in capital (accelerating productivity growth) and increase wages (productivity growth is the most relevant factor in determining income growth). Maori Authorities and Charities \[1\] 329 New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantage. I submit that the 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities be abolished, so that Maori Authorities are not provided with a cash flow advantage over non-Maori competitors. I submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction for profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. Capital gains tax A tax on capital gains would discourage investment, stifling wage growth and distorting the economy. It would also cause a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments. The low-investment, low-productivity economy would not improve and savers would not feel secure in their posessions. I submit that the Government should not implement taxes of this nature, and should repeal existing taxes on (unrealised and realised) capital gains. Land tax The implementation of tax on land (no different to savers' other accumulated capital), purchased with after tax savings, could well be confiscatory in nature. Low productivity land or land used for investments such as forestry may have a low or negative cashflow for extended periods, yet a land tax will no doubt be continuous in nature. It's inherently unreasonable, and landowners large or small are hardly going to view a policy that allows the State to facilitate other people seizing those assets, potentially at a distressed price, favourably. Taxes on savings We should not allow the tax system to discourage saving. Savings form the capital needed for investment in the future and more productive economy. Savers' savings (capital) has already been taxed at source and savers (namely those with retirement funds, investment schemes, deposits for a house, or accumulated capital to start a business) currently pay tax on ‘interest’ that, in practice, partially just reflects the effects of inflation. I submit that we should allow taxpayers to deduct inflation from taxable income earned via saving, and that the Government should not implement any taxes on citizens' capital. Environmental taxes As an alternative to recommending specific environmental taxes, I submit that the Working Group develop an objective framework for future proposed environmental taxes to be measured against. Such framework to have a clear and demonstrable scientific basis, and respecting property rights. Lifestyle taxes I submit that the Working Group recommend against the expansion of behavioural taxes, and instead outline the regressive financial damage they inflict on our most vulnerable communities. Specifically: I oppose the introduction of a sugar tax, a fat tax, or any other form of additional tax on food products. I oppose varying GST for different products. I oppose increases to tobacco excise. 330 Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union with the exclusion of sections 132-139 inclusive, concerning a Land Tax Yours sincerely, Martin Scott.

Founded in 2013 by David Farrar and Jordan Williams, the Taxpayers’ Union is New Zealand's largest taxpayer advocacy group, with more than 35,000 subscribed members and supporters. 6. The Taxpayers' Union's vision is a prosperous New Zealand, with efficient, transparent, and accountable Government. Our mission is: Lower Taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency. 7. The Taxpayers' Union is a member of World Taxpayers Associations: the global network of more than 55 taxpayer protection groups representing more than two million supporters in some 40 countries working together for lower taxes, limited and accountable government, and taxpayer rights. 8. A copy of the submitter’s most recent Annual Review is enclosed with the hard copy of this submission. Overview and objectives of reform 9. We largely support the Government's objectives outlined in the Terms of Reference for the Working Group. These are: (a) a tax system that is efficient, fair, simple and collected (sic); (b) a system that promotes the long-term sustainability and productivity of the economy; (c) a system that supports a sustainable revenue base to fund government operating; expenditure around its historical level of 30 percent of GDP; (d) a system that treats all income and assets in a fair, balanced and efficient manner, having special regard to housing affordability; (e) a progressive tax and transfer system for individuals and families; and, (f) an overall tax system that operates in a simple and coherent manner. (g) The Paper encourages submitters to consider which of the principles and frameworks listed on page five 1 of the Paper are "the most important" criteria for assessing the costs and benefits of any proposed reforms. Any proposal will require trade-offs in achieving these criteria. (h) Ranking these priorities in order of preference can aid in making those trade-offs, we submit they are in order of importance: 1 We respectfully submit that it would be helpful if the Working Group's future publications included paragraph numbering, especially if the future papers pose questions within the body, in addition to listed questions submitters are asked to address. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 5 (i) Efficiency: minimise impediments to economic growth and avoid distortions to the use of resources; (ii) Compliance and administrative costs; (iii) Revenue integrity; (iv) Coherence: ensure that individual reform options make sense in the context of the entire tax system; (v) Fiscal adequacy; and finally, (vi) Equity and fairness. 2 10. Equity and fairness should be ranked last because of the inherently subjective value claims required in making assessments, while the other criteria can be judged more easily on an objective basis. 11. If the Working Group are to go wider in their assessment criteria, we would support adding one more criterion: ‘Honesty and Transparency’ as a seventh criterion. 12. ‘Honesty and Transparency’ in a tax system means that taxes should avoid being artificially increased due to factors outside taxpayers' control – specifically price and wage inflation – and similarly taxpayers should not be required to pay tax on adjustments caused solely by inflation. 13. We provide further comments on this in our submissions on fiscal drag and taxes on savings and investment in sections two and four. Objectives of the Working Group 14. In our view, based on the very broad Paper and associated communications, public calls for submissions and advertising, we think there are three broad objectives the Working Group will need to decide between three possible objectives. Possible objective one: changes to the tax system to tax New Zealanders more (raise more revenue) 15. To date, most of the public comments by the Working Group’s Chair have related to new taxes, or taxing more, particularly in relation to the anticipated increase in the burden of New Zealand Superannuation, with little identification or public discussion about what taxes could be reduced (or eliminated) to achieve fiscal neutrality. 16. With the Government's guidance in the Terms of Reference for tax revenue to remain at approximately 30% of GDP, we invite the Working Group to reject this objective. 2 We note the Paper lumps procedural fairness in the broader equity and fairness category. While procedural fairness is an essential requirement for the tax system, we think this is largely about tax administration rather than the group's work in weighing up the broad objectives. We have therefore ignored this sub-criterion. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 6 Possible objective two: make tax system "fairer" (more equitable) 17. Any proposed changes to make our tax system more equitable require a pre-determined notion of how to measure fairness. Evaluating how 'fair' our tax system is, or could be, is subjective and depends on the values of those making assessments. 18. Given different people have different values and different ideas about what constitutes fairness, we submit that as an appointed, rather than elected body, the Working Group is not well placed to make judgment calls about how the tax system could be changed to improve fairness in an income equality / redistribution sense. 19. Nevertheless, where the Working Group finds procedural unfairness; inequality between taxpayers in the same, or substantially the same position, or find that the tax system is not honest and transparent (and therefore not ‘fair’) the Working Group should not hesitate in making recommendations. 20. We recommend that objective two be secondary to objective three. Possible objective three: make tax system "better" (more efficient) We submit that the primary objective of the Working Group should be to recommend changes in the tax system that make it better – i.e. less damaging to the economy, society, and individual liberties; and more efficient. What is a "better" tax system? 21. A better tax system is one that imposes fewer distortions and puts less pressure on the fundamental levers of economic growth. When we tax incomes and investment we clamp down on the incentive structures that provide for more productive jobs and higher incomes through time. 22. Based on the Paper and issues raised, there needs to be a much stronger focus from the Working Group on being ambitious and growing the economy in a meaningful way. Some households and business sectors could be made better off through changing the way we distribute the economy ("dividing the pie"), but only in a limited way. 23. By being ambitious (aiming to "grow the pie") the Working Group could improve levels of prosperity, without making value judgments about the pre-conditions for a more equitable society. We submit that all changes considered and recommended by the Working Group identify whether they are likely to result in less dead weight loss, fewer economic distortions, and more incentives for economic, wage and income growth. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 7 24. At a minimum, the Working Group should specifically take into account how new forms of taxation could impact productivity growth. 25. It has been widely acknowledged (and is discussed at length in this submission) that New Zealand suffers from poor productivity performance, contributing to a low wage environment. 26. Introducing new taxes (especially on production, or capital investment) without reducing tax in other areas could further damage New Zealand’s ability to transition to a high-wage economy. 27. The Working Group’s Chair has made clear that the Government needs to investigate new revenue streams in order to maintain social services in the presence of an aging population. 28. Leaving entitlements unchanged, an older population pushes up superannuation and health costs and shifts household income streams away from labour and towards capital, with the effect of reducing revenue streams for the Government. 29. But the Government should not implement tax policy changes today on the basis that additional revenue will be required in several years and should carefully examine re- structuring superannuation and healthcare to limit the fiscal damage of an aging population. 30. Similarly, we urge caution on making changes on the basis of anticipated technological change. For the last decade public policy makers have feared widespread job losses due to artificial intelligence and robotic technologies. So far that fear has not materialised – in fact the United States (a jurisdiction with much higher rates of capital investment, and therefore somewhere we would expect to be a precursor to these issues in New Zealand) has recently experienced record job growth. 31. While we do not object to the Working Group considering the impact of technological changes on the tax system, we submit that the baby should not be thrown out with the bathwater for the sake of preparing for a ‘tomorrow’ which might not come, or be much further away than assumed. This is particularly so if the proposed changes impose a real economic cost now. Revenue neutrality 32. We believe that new taxes should only be introduced when there are equal decreases in other taxes - i.e. reforms should be 'fiscally neutral'. 33. Revenue neutrality should be a necessary pre-condition for the introduction of new taxation. All forms of taxation cause distortions, so the introduction of new taxes in absence of reducing existing taxes imposes an additional burden on taxpayers and introduces new economic distortions. 34. We have closely followed the public comments by the Working Group's Chair, the Minister of Finance, and the Prime Minister, in relation to whether reforms adopted by the Government from the Working Group are likely to be fiscally neutral. 35. Accepting those media comments on their face value, implicit to all of the analysis in this submission is that any proposed increase in taxation will be offset by tax cuts in other areas, such that the final change will be revenue neutral. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 8 36. Nevertheless: Where new taxes (including reforms to existing taxes which are likely to increase the overall burden of the tax system) are recommended by the Working Group, we submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. 37. This submission is consistent with the Government's third objective listed in the Working Group’s Terms of Reference. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 9 Section two: Income taxation Fiscal drag: the under-arm bowling of our tax system 38. The current failure to index income tax thresholds see tax increases every year without any discussion in Parliament or the public sphere. It is, we submit, a sneaky and pervasive rust in our tax system. It raises taxes over time. 39. Fiscal drag or "bracket creep" is the result where, because of inflation - the value of money decreasing over time - individuals' incomes increase to compensate, pushing them into higher marginal tax brackets. 40. Inflations sees taxpayers' nominal-incomes, but not real-incomes, increase. Because income tax thresholds are fixed, taxpayers face a higher proportion of their income lost to income tax, without any corresponding increase to their real income. 41. Similarly, average increases in income have the same effect: over time the average tax rate increases for every cohort. 42. We believe the current approach is dishonest - it's an underarm bowl by politicians to hike taxes without having to legislate for doing so. If the Government wishes to increase taxes, it should be forced to pass legislation in Parliament, with public consultation. 43. We note that the costs of bracket creep have been significant, even in the recent low inflation environment. If inflation increases in the future, the costs of bracket creep to households will be much larger. 44. In our 2017 report, Five Options for Tax Relief 3 , we highlighted the cost of fiscal drag/bracket creep on four 'example taxpayers': (a) an 'average worker' earning $57,000; (b) a family with two children with parents earning $70,000 and $30,000 respectively; (c) a low income working earning $35,000; and (d) A professional earning $120,000. 45. As the table below illustrates, the average income earner is paying close to $10 extra per week, or $480 per year, because the Government did not adjust tax thresholds to allow for inflation since 2010. These inflationary costs are even more significant for our couple and our professional, who lose $551 and $628 a year, respectively. 3 A copy is attached. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 10 46. Ideally, the Government should go beyond indexing to inflation, and income tax thresholds should be adjusted to the growth in average earnings. This would have the effect of keeping the marginal and average tax rates faced by average income earners constant over time. No income earner who has experienced a growth in incomes equivalent to average wage growth will be pushed into a higher tax bracket. 47. Additionally, those income earners who do not see their wages grow relative to the average wage will be fairly compensated with lower average tax rates. 48. The savings this policy would create for New Zealand households are significant. As shown below, if thresholds had been indexed annually since 2010, our average income earner would now pay $1,361 a year less in tax; our professional $2,186 a year; our couple $1,916 a year; and our low-income earner $236 a year. 49. Fiscal drag has a regressive effect. As middle- and low-income earners have their nominal incomes increase through inflation, they are pushed into higher brackets. However, those already earning above the top threshold cannot be pushed into any higher bracket. The tax system effectively 'flattens', with those on lower and middle incomes pushed into higher marginal tax brackets through time. 50. Indexing income tax thresholds to inflation would ensure households do not have their tax obligations increase year-on-year purely because of inflation. That would ensure that unless the Government chose to pass legislation to increase taxes, the average rate of income tax to households would be consistent over time. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 11 51. In addition to being fair, income tax indexation should be attractive to a centre-left government for political reasons: it avoids centre-right parties being able to offer 'tax cuts' which are illusionary i.e. no more than make up for fiscal drag. 4 Adjusting for inflation would require politicians offering true tax relief to identify cuts in services. 52. Finally, income tax threshold indexation is consistent with the Government's objective to keep tax revenue at 30% of GDP over the long term. We recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. Experience in Canada: No taxation without indexation 53. In the mid-1980s the cash-strapped Mulroney Government of Canada (a Government led by the Progressive Conservative Party Government 5 ) de-indexed personal credits and tax brackets. That saw government tax revenues increase over time from 1986, without having the political difficulty of having to raise income tax rates. 54. It became a left-right issue. In 1999 a study authored by Ken Battle of the left-leaning Caledon Institute called bracket creep an "insidious virus" that had "pulled more than a million low- wage workers into the income tax net, pushed 1.9 million taxpayers from the bottom to the middle tax bracket and 600,000 taxpayers from the middle to the top bracket" and that ""eliminating bracket creep is good fiscal policy and good social policy." 6 55. The Liberals 7 under the leadership of Prime Minister Chrétien, reintroduced indexation as part of the 2000 budget 8 , and it remains in place. 9 56. We would be happy to provide the Working Group, or its support staff, with further information in relation to the workings of Canada's federal income tax indexation model. Company taxation 57. New Zealand has very high corporate taxation compared to our international competitors. As a percentage of GDP, corporate income tax revenue was the highest of any OECD country in 2015. Since 1992, corporate tax as a share of GDP has exceeded the OECD average every year. 4 Indeed, this is effectively what the Budget 2017 tax relief package was. 5 Now the Conservative Party of Canada. 6 Lanigan (2015) Fighting for taxpayers; battles fought & battles ahead.

Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 12 58. The result of high corporate taxation is a low-investment, low-productivity economy. The OECD noted in their 2017 Economic Survey of New Zealand 10 : “A higher cost of capital than in most other advanced economies contributes to low capital investment. Also, owing in part to its small size, New Zealand has thin venture capital, stock and bond markets.” “Low rates of capital investment depress wages, with negative consequences for income distribution and inclusiveness.” 59. New Zealand’s low productivity levels have been in the spotlight for the last decade. In 2008, the Government commissioned an investigation into how the per capita income levels could catch up to Australia by 2025. 60. The 2025 Taskforce highlighted low productivity levels and made a series of recommendations, including cuts to corporate taxation 11 . The recommendations were largely ignored by the Government, and low productivity growth has persisted. 61. The impact of company tax rates on business investment and productivity have been widely discussed. Earlier this year Michael Reddell, former Head of Financial Markets at the Reserve Bank, noted 12 : “And our company tax rates really matters when firms are thinking about whether or not to invest here at all. And our company tax rates are high, our company tax take is high – and our rates of business investment are low. “Tax isn’t likely to be the only factor, or probably even the most important – see my other discussions about real interest and exchange rates – but it might be worth the TWG thinking harder as to whether there is not some connection.” 62. In the rest of the world, corporate taxation is trending downwards. The OECD has recently acknowledged that there has been significant downward pressure on corporate tax rates. 13 Progressive company tax rates 63. Progressive tax rates on corporate income are being specifically floated by the Working Group. The idea is that companies would face staggered income tax rates such that as income increases their marginal tax rate would also increase, with the effect that ‘small’ businesses would face lower tax rates. 64. While the idea of taxing small businesses at a lower rate sounds desirable in purely political terms there are four major issues with the policy. (a) Firstly, New Zealand’s dividend imputation system means that for companies that are domestically held, individuals pay their effective marginal tax rate on any dividends. Any 10 OECD (2017) Economic Survey of New Zealand, Page 35 11 2025 Taskforce (2009) Answering the $64,000 Question: Closing the Income Gap with Australia: First Report and Recommendations 12 Reddell (2018) https://croakingcassandra.com/2018/03/22/so-much-company-tax-so-little-investment/ 13 OECD (2017) Tax Policy Reforms 2017; OECD (2016) Tax Policy Reforms 2016 Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 13 change in the company tax rate is unlikely to substantially change the tax profile for individuals who rely on company profit streams as their main source of income. While any retained earnings would be subject to a lower rate, note that companies typically retain earnings when the additional capital is required to grow the organisation and become larger. If any retained earnings fuels capital investment sufficient to push the business into a higher tax bracket, then that capital investment is determined subject to the higher marginal tax rate, not the lower rate. The result is that for domestic business owners, lower marginal corporate tax rates may not induce additional income streams or encourage greater capital investment from retained earnings. (b) Secondly, while international investors do not receive the benefits of dividend imputation and would therefore benefit from lower corporate taxes, it’s unlikely that international capital is flowing into small businesses. International investment is subject to transaction costs (legal costs, language and communication costs, foreign exchange costs) and in the presence of non-zero fixed transaction costs, foreign investment in larger companies makes more sense than smaller companies. To the extent that international investors might purchase smaller companies, growing those companies quickly is typically the aim. The data indicates this is true. Only two percent of firms have foreign investment, while 47 percent of firms with more than 100 employees have foreign investment. 14 Employment growth is also stronger in firms with foreign investment compared to domestically held companies. 15 The result is that international investors (who, unlike domestic investors do not receive the benefits of imputation and therefore fully pay corporate tax) are unlikely to significantly increase their New Zealand holdings in the presence of lower corporate taxation for small businesses because international investment in small firms is fundamentally undesirable. To the extent that international investors do invest capital into small business, if the goal is to grow those businesses then the investment decisions are subject to the prospective corporate tax rate, not the rate the business faces at its pre-purchase size. (c) Thirdly, if for reasons of revenue neutrality, larger businesses are subject to a higher rate of corporate tax, then we should expect to see less economic growth. As demonstrated earlier, international investors prefer investing in larger firms. Placing a higher rate of tax on those investments would reduce firms’ international 14 Doan (2012) Industry Destinations of Inward Foreign Direct Investment in New Zealand, MBIE Economic Development Group 15 Fabling, Richard and Sanderson (2013) Foreign acquisition and the performance of New Zealand firms, New Zealand Economic Papers Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 14 attractiveness (and exposure) and undermine growth. Firms with foreign investment tend to be more productive and pay higher wages 16 . 65. Finally, the existing look-through company structure already provide the benefits a two-tier company tax mechanism. We recommend that if the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate, rather than cutting rates just for smaller businesses Company tax cuts: international literature suggests wage earners benefit most 66. Low productivity growth has contributed to low income levels compared other countries otherwise similar to New Zealand. If the Government is able to improve productivity growth, the result would be higher income levels, reducing financial pressure on households and social services. 67. Cutting corporate taxes, would make New Zealand a more attractive destination for foreign investment. Projects and investments which previously looked undesirable with a 28 percent tax-rate would become economic when subject to a lower rate. The result would be greater foreign direct investment. 68. That’s desirable because greater access to capital lifts productivity levels and therefore grows incomes across the economy. Hassett and Mathur (2006) 17 find that "a one per cent increase in Corporation Tax rates is associated with a nearly one per cent drop in wage rates." 69. Additionally, as previously noted, exposure to foreign investor pressures drives firms to become more productive than organisations with purely domestic shareholding accountability. 70. It is also important to note the global trend of falling company tax rates. By failing to cut our headline corporate tax rate, we won’t just fail to become more competitive, but may actually become less competitive over time as investors channel projects into jurisdictions which are friendlier to investors. Full expensing of capital investment: the best idea in tax no one's heard of 71. We recognise that the Working Group may be reluctant to substantially decouple New Zealand’s company tax rate with the top personal income tax rate. 72. We submit that there are other ways to lower the effective tax rate on companies and achieve the economic gains, without creating the incentives for individual taxpayers to allocate income into a corporate structure to benefit from a lower company rate. 16 Treasury (2015) International Investment for Growth 17 Hasset and Mathur (2006) Taxes and Wages, American Enterprise Institute Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 15 73. The most obvious way to do this is to allow full capital expensing. This would increase incentives for business to invest in capital (accelerating productivity growth) and increase wages (productivity growth being the most relevant factor in determining income growth). 74. Full capital expensing was one of the major components of the recent United States tax reform legislation where many businesses can now fully expense some purchases of equipment and capital investment in the year of purchase. 75. The literature indicates that full expensing of capital investment encourages businesses to bring forward planned investment as a result of receiving a tax advantage with substantial evidence indicating that full expensing of capital spending encourages businesses to bring forward investment. (a) Ohrn 18 finds that adoption of 100 percent bonus depreciation increased investment activity by 17.5%, and over a five-year period, increased employment by 7.7%. “These results suggest that accelerated depreciation policies had and will continue to have substantial impacts on the U.S. manufacturing sector.” (b) Maffini et al. 19 find that firms eligible for first-year depreciation allowances have an 11% increased rate of investment. 76. The fiscal impact is largely temporal. Full expensing pulls forward any existing tax benefits into a single year, rather than increasing the total value of any tax benefits. 77. The effect is that the Government simply delays some tax revenue to the future, and forgoes a small level of interest of the value of the delayed revenue. We submit that the Working Group recommend full capital expensing to increase incentives for business to invest in capital, productivity and increase wages. Thin Capitalisation rules 78. In order to maintain revenue flows, there have been a series of recent changes to how foreign investors can use debt to fund ventures in New Zealand. Using debt rather than equity can give foreign investors a tax advantage because interest payments (unlike dividends paid to holders of equity) are tax deductible. 79. Reducing the degree to which foreign investors can fund their New Zealand investments with debt has the effect of increasing investors’ tax-adjusted cost of capital, which makes investing in New Zealand look less attractive. 18 Ohrn (2017) The Effect of Tax Incentives on U.S. Manufacturing: Evidence from State Accelerated Depreciation Policies 19 Maffini et al.

Currently, overseas investors can fund their New Zealand-based investments with debt up to 60 percent of the value of gross assets of the venture. Under previous rules, overseas investors were able to fund up to 75 percent of gross assets with debt. 81. Changes being proposed include caps to interest rates on loans between non-resident investors and their New Zealand operations and changes to the eligibility of liabilities for the purpose of calculating the relevant debt ratio. 82. Increasing tax liabilities on foreign investors disincentivises investment into New Zealand for reasons previously discussed in this submission. The Working Group should be careful not to recommend any drastic changes to the thin capitalization rules before any analysis is performed on the costs of reduced investment. We submit that the Working Group recommend loosen thin capitalisation rules in order to encourage greater foreign investment into New Zealand businesses, growth in the economy and wages. Businesses owned by charities and Maori Authorities – removing the loopholes Commercial business deemed ‘tax charitable’ 83. Companies owned by charities and Maori Authorities have a tax advantage over their competitors which the Tax Working Group should recommend be closed. 84. Under the current law companies owned by registered charities are liable to pay zero income tax, even if only a portion (or none) of their income is distributed to the parent charity and the business’ activity has no connection to the charitable purpose. 85. We submit that now all businesses are able to deduct for charitable giving up to 100 percent of their taxable income, the blanket exemption applying to commercial organisations owned by charities should be abolished. 86. The competitive advantage that companies owned by charities receive is that they receive a tax exemption on all of their earnings, not just the portion distributed to the charitable cause. 87. There is a risk that charities may reinvest any distributed earnings from the companies they own and therefore avoid their tax obligations. However, rules can be created to net any capital contributions from the parent charity across the tax year, and therefore avoid these concerns. We submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction to the extent of companies profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 17 Race-based tax: Maori Authorisation 88. Maori Authorities are liable to pay 17.5% income tax, rather than the usual 28%. 89. The effect of these loopholes is that some companies (for example, Sanitarium and GoBus) are able to: (a) build large cash reserves from either un-taxed or under-taxed reinvested income streams, giving them competitive advantages over other firms in their sector; and (b) face a lower cost of capital, and therefore maintain uncompetitive prices, that other firms (who don’t receive the same regulatory benefit) cannot match. 90. Closing the loopholes would ensure a more competitive environment in the sectors where these companies operate. Every firm would be subject to the same regulatory burden, ensuring they face similar costs of capital. 91. The advantage that Maori Authorities receive is fundamentally arbitrary. No business should receive a competitive advantage on the basis of blood or race. We submit that the 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities should be abolished – so that Maori Authorities are not provided with a cash flow advantage over non-Maori competitors.

The tax treatment of capital is raised regularly in the media, primarily by people who are concerned that wage earners pay a disproportionate level of tax compared to the owners of capital. 93. The most prominent policy proposal in this space has been a capital gains tax, although smaller political parties have proposed alternative forms of capital taxation. 94. The Working Group has been tasked with investigating the introduction of a capital gains tax. 95. This submission will consider capital taxation as a broader issue across a variety of methods of capital taxation. 96. We submit that taxing capital should be approached with great caution in the specific New Zealand context. As addressed earlier, New Zealand’s economy suffers from shallow capital markets and low productivity, contributing towards a low wage environment. A capital gains tax would likely make that worse. 97. While a redistribution of tax burden from capital owners to income earners would have an income improving effect for low wage earners in the first order, there is a danger in disincentivising the capital accumulation which will be required to sustainably improve wages over the long run. Why tax capital? 98. In Capital, Pikkety argues that capital has a tendency to snowball. As a result, the owners of capital would find their net asset position accelerate through time, with the effect of growing inequality. 99. Notwithstanding the public perceptions and political claims, historical data indicates income inequality has not grown in New Zealand since the early 1990s 20 . Most of the variation over the period has been a product of housing-related costs. 100. Capital taxation proponents argue that effective taxation can limit inequality, while providing revenue for state services. 101. To the extent that we view inequality as undesirable, tax system changes that provide an improvement in wealth distribution with zero cost in economic growth might be effective public policy. 102. However almost all policies that seek to address inequality impose economic distortions that would damage economic growth. 20 Creedy, Gemmell and Nguyen (2017) Income Inequality in New Zealand, 1935 – 2014, Victoria University of Wellington - Public Finance Working Paper 07/2017 Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 19 103. To determine whether reducing inequality would be desirable, we need to firstly consider how combatting inequality might impact economic growth, and whether that trade-off would be acceptable. Inequality as a justification 104. Inequality measures the gap in income or wealth between strata in society. Those in favour of reducing inequality often use the lens of poverty reduction, but this is incorrect. 105. While inequality is often associated with poverty, improvements in absolute levels of poverty over time are not always associated with reductions in inequality. 106. In fact, as economies grow and individuals are pulled out of poverty, inequality often increases as a product of greater profit streams to investors. 107. Moving to other justifications, those in favour of reducing inequality often argue that inequality promotes societal divisions and reduces individuals’ faith in public institutions. 108. While there might be some benefits in reduced inequality if that was the result of increases in incomes of all households through time (a "pareto" improvement), this is not the typical public policy approach. 109. Public policies to address inequality typically transfer income from wealthier households to poorer households, which because it makes some households worse off, does not represent a ‘pareto’ improvement in wellbeing. 110. These policies tend to have second order effects (economic distortions, or ‘deadweight losses’) that manifest as dampened growth and therefore comparatively lower wages for all earners through time. 111. Wilkinson and Pickett 21 makes the case for reducing inequality in order to foster improved social outcomes in The Spirit Level. They claim that inequality is a major factor in determining life expectancy and health outcomes, crime rates, and educational outcomes. 112. However, many of the claims made by the authors are attributable to unjustified data selection and cherry picking. Their conclusions are strongly rebutted by Sanandaji et al. (2010). 22 113. To the extent that inequality doesn’t create negative social outcomes, tax changes shouldn’t be assessed through the lens of effects on income inequality, but rather their impacts on income strata in absolute terms. 114. Incomes at all levels are a result of productivity growth and the labour share of national income. According to the Productivity Commission, the labour share of national income hasn’t experienced a significant decline, even in the presence of structural changes to the tax system over the last 35 years. 21 Wilkinson and Pickett (2009) The Spirit Level 22 Sanandaji et al. (2010) The Spirit Illusion Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 20 115. To the extent that tax changes don’t impact the labour share of national income, the appropriate lens for examining the effect of tax changes on incomes is productivity growth. 116. Based on that, this submission will therefore specifically consider how proposed capital tax changes impact the determinants of productivity, alongside any financial impacts on households. Capital gains tax Summary 117. Explicit capital gains taxes are typically justified as a mechanism to make the tax system more progressive. Those who own assets subject to capital gains taxes tend to be wealthier, so using any revenue gained to cut other taxes or increase spending would have the effect of reducing inequality levels. 118. But as explained above, inequality should not be the primary lens for examining substantive tax changes and we will therefore consider the effects of a capital gains tax on economic growth and any flow on financial impacts on households. 119. Capital gains taxes can either be imposed on realised gains or accrual gains. In summary, the former would impose significant productivity costs, while the latter would be administratively burdensome, and a dishonest rebuke of existing principles of tax. 120. Additionally, we believe the Working Group cannot reasonably recommend a capital gains tax, given the required primary residence exclusion. Primary Residence Exclusion 121. The terms of reference require the Working Group to exclude the family home (and land under) from proposed new taxes. 122. The exclusion of the family home would materially distort any proposed capital gains tax. Any capital gain in the primary residence would be untaxed, compared to other capital gains. That provides a comparative incentive to invest in the primary residence rather than other kinds of investment. 123. That would have two undesirable effects: (a) Firstly, it encourages households to invest disproportionate amounts of capital into their primary residence. The result would be larger and more grandiose homes with reduced investment in rental properties. (b) The result of reduced rental property supply would be increased financial pressure for renters. While the data is still unclear on this effect, Coleman has shown that the effect of a capital gains tax would, in general, increase rents. 23 23 Coleman (2009) The long term effects of capital gains taxes in New Zealand, Motu Working Paper 09-13 Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 21 (c) Secondly, tax-distorted investment into primary residences would have the effect of pushing up house prices, which may reduce the ability of first-home-buyers to purchase their first house. 124. In summary, if the objective is to increase the affordability of home ownership introducing taxes on all other capital investment except the family - and thereby creating a tax incentive for New Zealanders to stash money in housing - is the very last thing which should be recommended. Investment Effects 125. Imposing a capital gains tax also discourages investment in companies which tend to deliver value to shareholders by improving their capital value, rather than distributing consistent dividends early in the organisation’s growth cycle. 126. Those companies tend to be tech focused, or more generally, tend to have a thirst for capital. Imposing a capital gains tax would disincentivise investment in these kinds of companies compared to those that pay a reliable dividend. 127. Capital-reallocation requires a liquidation of an investor’s position. Any gain in asset value over the period it has been owned would be taxed. Effectively, capital re-allocation is now subject to transaction costs as a proportion of the previous success of the stock. 128. That disincentivises re-allocation of capital to more productive investments, reducing investor returns and economic growth. This is described in the literature as the ‘lock-in’ effect. 24 Accrual or realisation? 129. One of the key issues that the Working Group will need to grapple with, if it chooses to recommend a capital gains tax, is whether it should recommend the tax based on accrual capital gains or a tax at the time of capital gain realisation. 130. Using an accrual system largely removes the problems associated with a lock-in effect. Tax would be owed whether an investor liquidated their position or not, and therefore there exists no disincentive for the reallocation of capital from investments which are expected to be low yield through to investments which are expected to have a higher yield. 131. An accrual-based capital gains tax would also provide capital loss credits to investors in the event of a decline in asset price values even if investors wanted to hold their positions, rather than liquidate their investments. 132. Any capital gains tax provides a level of counter-cyclical smoothing; however, an accrual capital gains tax more fully smooths investor positions for the reasons illustrated above. 133. However, accrual capital gains taxes are much more complex to administer than realisation taxes. Tracking capital valuations over the financial year, often pro-rata, is viewed by many as more complicated than the simple change in value of an asset from when it is bought to when it is sold. 24 Burman and White (2009) Taxing Capital Gains in New Zealand: Assessment and Recommendations Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 22 134. While the value of publicly traded assets (stocks and bonds, for example) is easy to measure across the tax year, private equity and housing, given the lack of information on a market price in absence of sale, is more difficult to assess. 135. Some difficulty would stem from individuals having an incentive to underrepresent the true value of their assets. The result would be an ineffective system where significant resources would be required to monitor households and audit a selection of taxpayers in order to provide accountability to the system. 136. One solution would be for IRD to set up a regime where investors would have the right to buy any asset reported to the state at its listed price. Individuals then have a strong incentive to report assets at a fair valuation so that any purchase at that price would not leave them materially worse off. 137. While that would offer an efficient solution to price assessment, it would likely be extremely unpopular. People often have emotional attachments to their assets (their family home, an expensive heirloom, a boat or car) and are unlikely to view a policy that allows the State to facilitate other people seizing those assets, even with financial compensation, favourably. 138. We consider accrual capital gains taxes are not honest and transparent, as defined in section one. Until an asset is liquidated, the owner has not earned any income for any appreciation in value. Punishing taxpayers for holding on to art they may have inherited, or a family home they have lived in for many years should not be part of the tax system. Sustainable revenue base: Capital gains taxes perform poorly 139. Finally, we note that one of the reasons the New Zealand Crown accounts got through the Global Financial Crisis so well, particularly in comparison to Australia, is that our Government’s tax revenues are far less tied to asset prices. To borrow finance’s measure of volatility, the beta of capital gains taxes is much higher, and makes the tax system more vulnerable to shocks. Land tax 140. Land taxes have been floated as an option to broaden the base of tax revenue. 141. Taxes on the unimproved value of land impose very few economic distortions. As land has a fixed supply and land taxes do not scale with improvements, there would be no disincentive effect on land improvements or capital investment on land. 142. That is an important benefit of land taxes: almost all forms of taxation have distortionary economic effects. Using revenue streams that don’t distort economic outcomes in order to fund cuts to distortionary taxes would be a useful tool to improve productivity growth. 143. Some sectors of society would be hurt more than others from the imposition of a land tax. Coleman and Grimes 25 (2009) note the distributional impacts of land taxes. Households and industry sectors that own disproportionate amounts of land relative to their income (for 25 Coleman and Grimes (2009) Fiscal, Distributional and Efficiency Impacts of Land and Property Taxes, Motu Working Paper 09-14 Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 23 example, retirees, agriculture, forestry) would suffer more from the tax than other groups. Land owners facing constraints on the use of land, such as heritage buildings, are also potentially unfairly hit. Nevertheless, so long as the tax base (land valuation) is measured with an understanding that the land cannot be developed in certain ways so has reduced economic value, we believe those concerns can be addressed. 144. In general, while those purchasing land after the tax wouldn’t be any worse off as a result of the tax (land prices would adjust by the present value of future tax liabilities), current holders of land would be hit both by: (a) future tax liabilities; and (b) a fall in the value of their land equal to the present value of future tax liabilities. 145. In a technical sense, the economic value of the tax can be treated as a one-off transfer of wealth from current land owners to the Crown. This is likely to cause some short-term negative economic consequences, in particular: (a) for highly leveraged households and businesses, a fall in the value of their land pushes them into a position of negative equity; and (b) transferring substantial quantities of wealth from the private to the public sector may result in a short term economic downturn as households feel poorer and adjust their spending patterns for a period of time. 146. While that might prove politically unpopular among existing land-owners, using the revenue gains to fund cuts to distortionary taxes would have the effect of lifting incomes through time. 147. In our view, a land tax should be implemented, with the proceeds used to fund cuts to distortionary taxes, like company taxation and taxation on savings However, the Terms of Reference specifically exclude any tax imposed on an individual's primary residence, including the land on which their house sits. This imposes an artificial distortion on any proposed land tax, undermining the useful non-distortionary attributes of land taxes. Without further work, it is difficult to assess whether a land tax excluding residential property (and possibly other classes of land) would have more economically distortionary effects than it would solve, even if the revenue was used to reduce other taxes. We submit that the Working Group note in its report that had they not been constrained by the primary residence exclusion, then they would have recommended a land tax to the Government with all proceeds used to reduce more economically damaging taxes, such as that on income. Imputed income taxation 148. If the Working Group wants to broaden the base by taxing capital, an alternative to a capital gains tax would be a tax on the imputed income of home-owner equity. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 24 149. Some economists claim that owner-occupied homes provide a form of income to the owner equivalent to the amount of rent they would otherwise be required to pay to live in that home and that this 'imputed income' is not currently taxed. 150. Submitters have been asked to specifically consider how the tax system impacts housing affordability. The current failure to appropriately tax home-owner equity imposes a distortion in the housing market leading homes to become more opulent and less affordable. 151. If the Government wanted to take housing affordability seriously, they shouldn't have imposed the primary residence exclusion. The current favourable tax treatment of owner- occupied property exacerbates the problem of housing affordability. 152. While this is not an option available to the Working Group as a formal recommendation to the Government (given the primary residence exclusion), but it should nevertheless be included in the Group's reports. 153. Not taxing imputed income imposes a distortion on the tax system, encouraging individuals to invest disproportionate levels of capital into the home in which they live 26 . 154. Coleman notes that this may have contributed to a trend of ever-increasing house size, although the data is still unclear 27 . Incentivizing larger and more opulent homes distorts home quality distribution. 155. This policy was advanced by the Opportunities Party 28 at the most recent election. The Party’s argument was that capital taxation can be used to fund income tax cuts, and therefore shift the national tax burden from income earners to home owners on the margins. 156. Increased capital taxation to fund income tax cuts would likely have a progressive distributional effect: those who earn income but do not have high levels of equity would receive a tax advantage. 157. Funding cuts to more distortionary taxes would also be productivity growth improving, which would then fuel income growth through time, as demonstrated earlier in our submission. 158. Much of this effect would be temporal: young people tend to have few assets compared to their income level and so would receive an advantage from moving to this system of taxation, whereas the retired elderly tend to have very little income compared to the value of their assets. We submit that the Working Group should not recommend a capital gains tax. A capital gains tax would hurt productivity growth and discourage 26 Page 40 of the Paper demonstrates the different rates of marginal taxation on savings, and correctly notes that home owner equity is taxed at a much lower rate than other forms of savings. 27 Coleman (2017) Housing, the ‘Great Income Tax Experiment’, and the intergenerational consequences of the lease Motu Working Paper 17-09 28 Available at https://www.top.org.nz/top1 Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 25 investment, without providing a secure revenue stream to the Government. We submit that the Working Group’s Terms of Reference mean that it cannot recommend a comprehensive capital gains tax, due to the distortionary effect this would have in worsening housing affordability. If the Working Group does not accept this submission, we submit that in preference to an Australian-style complex capital gains tax, a comprehensive land tax, or failing that, a tax on the imputed income of home-owner equity, is preferable. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 26 Section four: Taxes on savings and investments for retirement 159. When savings earn interest income, that interest income is taxed at the individual’s marginal income tax rate. The tax is applied to the nominal interest income (which includes inflation) rather than their after-inflation real interest income. 160. The result is that the effective marginal tax rate on interest income is much higher than the headline statutory rate. The size of the tax distortion depends on the rate of inflation. As inflation creeps higher, the tax adjusted real return on savings falls. This has two effects: (a) those saving for retirement are required to commit a higher proportion of their income to their savings in order to ensure a comfortable standard of living when they retire; and, (b) a significant contribution to New Zealand’s low savings rate. When domestic savings are insufficient to fund investment, we borrow from abroad which increases our international debt exposure. 161. We submit that the Working Group should recommend an inflation exemption for interest income, so that only the real return to savers is taxed. 162. This change would significantly increase the returns of long term savers. For example, an individual who put $10,000 into a savings account with a nominal interest rate of 5.5 percent per annum, of which 2 percentage points is inflation (a) Over a period of ten years, if the Government chose not to tax the inflation component of any interest earned, that individual would have approximately $900 more in savings than had the Government taxed the full amount of nominal interest. (b) That represents a 22% increase on the saver’s ten-year return. (c) As inflation increases, the distortionary effect of taxing the inflation component of nominal interest income increases. Holding all other variables constant, increasing inflation to 4% would increase the difference in returns to a saver to 35.5% under the two alternative tax treatments. 163. If an individual is saving regularly for the retirement over a very long period of time, there is an even larger difference. For example, an individual who saves $10,000 a year, for 40 years, deposited monthly into a savings account. As above, they earn a nominal interest rate of 5.5 percent per annum, of which 2 percentage points. (a) After the 40-year period, the individual taxed only on their real return has approximately $1,079,000, while an individual taxed on their nominal return has $165,000 less – only $914,000. That's equivalent to a 18% difference in retirement savings after 40 years. (b) If inflation is higher at 4% over the same savings period, then the individual taxed on their real returns is better off by 42.6%. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 27 164. Taxing nominal returns can have a significant impact on long-term savings. Given that many retirees depend on long-term savings to live on when they retire, a move to taxing only real returns would improve the wellbeing of many retirees. 165. Reducing taxes on long-term savings also helps working families before they retire, as better post-tax returns mean households are able to save less while maintaining the same level of long-run savings. Families with tight budgets would have more room to meet their financial needs while continuing to save enough for a comfortable retirement. 166. The net result of this change in the tax treatment of savings is a higher domestic savings rate. Higher domestic savings rates driven by tax cuts would have the effect of lifting long-run living standards. 167. Despite typical economic models not showing increased domestic savings levels in a small open economy driving significant increases in investment 29 a Treasury review of international evidence in 2011 30 found that increased domestic savings levels would put some downward pressure on real interest rates, leading to increased levels of investment, driving economic growth. 168. Additionally, a 2012 review of possible tax changes by Inland Revenue and Treasury 31 found that reducing the tax on interest income would lift savings rates and provide modest increases to GDP. 169. Further, increases in domestic savings results in less international finance being required to fund domestic investment. That would have the effect of putting downward pressure on the foreign exchange rate and increasing net exports. 170. The Treasury review mentioned above indicates there is substantial evidence for productivity- enhancing growth and innovation as a product of increased export levels. As industries become more successful exporting internationally, there are knowledge and supply-chain development spillover effects which flow through to other businesses and sectors. 171. Additionally, as we reduce our international debt exposure, interest payments overseas will fall, leading to an effective improvement in domestic income levels. 172. The net effect of these changes according to Treasury “would most likely permanently lift MFP growth rates.” The result of higher productivity growth would be higher income growth through time. We submit that the Working Group recommend that savers should only pay tax on their real interest income – inflation doesn’t make savers better off so it should not be taxed 29 Claus et al. (2001) Saving and growth in an open economy 30 Treasury (2011) Will higher national saving lead to higher GDP growth or income levels in New Zealand? A review of the literature 31 Inland Revenue and Treasury (2012) Taxation of Savings and Investment Income Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 28 Section five: Environmental taxes 173. The Working Group is investigating the effects of additional environmental taxes. The specific concerns focus on water quality and greenhouse gas emissions. 174. While reduced climate change and improved water quality would improve the wellbeing of a large number of people, policies designed to combat these problems are accompanied by significant economic costs, particularly for rural areas. 175. We submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. 176. Revenue neutrality would limit the scope of economic harm from any environmental taxation, although there would still be significant distributional impact on rural areas. If environmental taxes were accompanied with cuts to other distortionary taxes, there would likely be a shift in economic output from rural to urban areas. 177. While there are significant social and economic costs associated with climate change, the degree to which New Zealand is able to make a meaningful impact may be limited. Climate change is a globally determined phenomenon, and while domestic changes may make a small impact, the cost of doing so would rest solely on the domestic economy. 178. There are other good reasons to engage in efforts to combat climate change (purely moral considerations, or concerns for international political capital), but it should be acknowledged that the economic case suffers from international collective action problems manifesting as reduced welfare for New Zealand residents (both today and into the future). We submit that any new environmental tax or water tax proposal should be subject to disciplined and transparent cost-benefit analysis. Economic impact 179. Agriculture is exposed to risks distinct from other sectors. While water pricing and emissions pricing would damage urban commerce to some degree, the agricultural sector could face widespread financial damage. Water taxation 180. Water taxes have been proposed as a tool to reduce farming intensification and improve water quality. The aim of the policy is to impose a per/litre price on the use of water, particularly for irrigation purposes and bottling for sale. Our submission will focus on the impact of a water tax on irrigation. 181. Proponents of water taxes are concerned that the intensification of dairy farming coupled with widespread irrigation use is harming the water quality of rivers, lakes and streams. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 29 182. Irrigation can increase the scope of harms to river quality from the use of nitrogen and phosphorous based fertiliser 32 . 183. While improved water quality would have some impact on wellbeing, the Working Group should carefully consider the economic consequences of reducing the scope of irrigation in rural areas. 184. The agricultural sector heavily relies on irrigation to ensure otherwise dry land is productive. (a) A paper published by NZIER and AgFirst in November 2014 33 indicated that the total value of irrigation was approximately 2.4% of GDP, or $4.8 billion in total output per annum. The same report finds that 71.3% ($1.39 billion) of net farm gate value in Canterbury can be attributed solely to irrigation. (b) The effect of a water tax would be to reduce the scope of irrigation and dampen productivity of farm land. While advocates for water taxation have tried to downplay the financial effect of any proposed tax, it should be acknowledged that the tax would only achieve improved environmental outcomes to the extent that it reduced the scope of irrigation. (c) More productive arable land provides greater opportunities for on-farm employment and off-farm employment in adjacent service towns and communities. Correspondingly, reducing agricultural productivity would have negative flow on effects for regional communities. 185. Given any tax reform should be revenue neutral, many of the economic costs from a water tax would be recouped across the broader economy. (a) Lower personal income taxes and/or lower corporate taxes to make up for a water tax may cause a net substitutive effect from rural areas to urban areas but comparing the economic costs of reduced irrigation to the any economic benefits from tax cuts in other areas is complicated. (b) Given the complicated nature of these trade-offs, as expressed earlier, any proposed water tax should be subject to a formal cost-benefit analysis. 186. We were concerned to see during the election campaign water tax proposals focusing on specific uses of water, or industries. For example, taxing water bottling appears to us unjustified, where other often more damaging uses (such as intensive dairy farming) use much more, for less economic gain to New Zealand. We submit that any taxes on water should operate in a similar way to water rights pricing and be sector neutral – politicians should refrain from 32 Ministry for the Environment (2017) Our Fresh Water 2017 33 NZIER & AgFirst (2014) Value of Irrigation in New Zealand Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 30 targeting specific industries or uses of water, unless the environmental externalities of the particular use are materially different Emissions taxation 187. In relation to emissions taxation, we submit that policies should be able to demonstrate genuine reductions in world emissions, and/or increases in productivity (in terms of output per emissions unit). New Zealand should avoid imposing economic costs on itself, if emissions are simply going to be exported and any environment gain lost. 188. The agricultural sector produces significant methane emissions, which contributes towards climate change. Climate change policy experts typically advocate for either bringing agricultural emissions into the emissions trading scheme or introducing a specific emissions tax for methane. 189. Emissions taxation is only effective if it reduces the scope of domestic agricultural emissions. This could be achieved in two ways, each of which would impose significant costs on the agricultural sector: (a) Firstly, to the extent that innovation is possible, farmers may investigate breeding programmes, vaccines, and other changes in order to reduce methane emissions without changing their herd size. (b) Secondly, to the extent that innovation isn’t available or only available in limited ways farmers may choose to exit the industry or reduce herd size if their profit margins are sufficiently thin. Households finances 190. The effect of a carbon tax would be to increase fuel costs and therefore transportation costs, both for households and the business sector. 191. Increasing transportation costs would cause regressive economic effects. (a) Low socio-economic status households tend to live further out from their workplaces, drive cars which are less fuel efficient, and tend to have a larger number of children. (b) The result is that a relatively higher proportion of their income is spent on fuel, and so a fuel tax would force a relatively higher financial burden on low income families and communities. 192. Transportation costs are a significant factor in determining the total cost of producing goods and services. Increased transportation costs would be transferred through to consumers in the form of higher prices for food, clothing, and other consumer goods. 193. Much of the damage to households could be recovered by reducing income taxation, although for low income households who pay little income tax but also consume most of their income, any tax cuts may fail to sufficiently compensate any losses. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 31 194. In a consultation document published in 2015 34 , the Ministry for the Environment calculated that the cost to an average household of achieving an emissions target of 5% below 1990 emissions levels would be approximately $1270 per annum. 195. Imposing costs on low income households may be desirable if there are sufficiently large future welfare gains related to the prevention of climate change. Again though, these costs and benefits should be assessed, and taxes not imposed for moralistic, ideological, or virtuous generalisations. Benefits of environmental action 196. It is non-trivial that all policies designed to combat climate change would result in welfare improvements for current and/or future generations of New Zealanders. 197. The typical economic justification for imposing emissions taxes is that market transactions fail to account for costs incurred by parties who are external to the transaction. In the instance of emissions, the social cost manifests as climate change induced by the emission of green-house gases. Note that the social costs of greenhouses gases should be attributed globally rather than domestically. 198. New Zealand’s emissions make up 0.17% of total global emissions, while the top five emitters contribute 54% of global emissions. 199. Even major reductions in our emissions profile would create very small wellbeing improvements, given wellbeing is determined by global emissions levels. 200. However domestic efforts may not translate into global improvements. (a) Imposing emissions costs and sanctions on local industry may shift production to other states with more relaxed environmental regulation. (b) The New Zealand regulatory environment is too small to shift global demand for agricultural products or fuel. (c) The result is that as we reduce domestic production in agriculture and fuel, foreign markets will respond to global demands and expand production. (d) This result (carbon leakage) could significantly reduce the scope of any reductions in global emissions from domestic policy settings. As an alternative to recommending specific environmental taxes, we submit that the Working Group develop an objective framework for future proposed environmental taxes to be measured against. 34 Ministry for the Environment (2015) New Zealand’s Climate Change Target Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 32 Section six: Behavioural taxes 201. The Working Group has signalled an interest expanding the scope of behavioural taxes. We oppose an expansion of the use of behavioural taxes. They are generally poor in achieving their stated aims and impose significant financial costs on low income households. We submit the Working Group recommend against the expansion of behavioural taxes, and instead outline the regressive financial damage they inflict on our most vulnerable communities. 202. Specifically: (a) We oppose the introduction of a sugar tax, a fat tax, or any other form of additional tax on food products. (b) We oppose increases to tobacco excise. Sugar taxes 203. We submit that the Working Group should recommend against implementing a sugar tax. 204. International evidence shows that sugar taxes (specifically taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages) are not effective in achieving their stated health goals. 205. In 2015, we released a report, Fizzed Out, which demonstrated the failure of a sugary drinks tax to reduce consumption levels in Mexico. The Nielsen sales data we released showed that the sugar tax only induced a 0.2% reduction in consumption. A copy of the report is appended to this submission. 206. NZIER prepared a literature review for the Ministry of Health in 2017 which showed that “the evidence that sugar taxes improve health is weak.” The authors clearly articulate the problem in making public policy based on weak evidence in the conclusion of their report “If taxes did not have economic costs, through deadweight losses and implementation costs, then even a slight causal link between a tax and an improvement in health outcomes might be justified. That, however, is not the case.” 207. Andalon and Gibson (2017) 35 found the own-price elasticity of quantity demand for sugar sweetened beverages in Mexico was much lower (-0.2 to -0.3) than had been expected (-1.0 to -1.2) when the Mexican sugar tax was implemented. (a) A lower price elasticity of demand implies consumers respond less strongly to the imposed tax, and therefore the tax induces weaker health outcomes than expected. 35 Andalon and Gibson (2017) The ‘Soda Tax’ is Unlikely to Make Mexicans Lighter, Institute of Labour Economics Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 33 (b) The authors find that the tax would cause an average weight loss of 400 grams per person. 208. To the extent that sugar taxes don’t deliver good health outcomes, we should avoid imposing additional costs on taxpayers, especially low socio-economic status households. (a) Consumption taxes tend to be regressive because low socio-economic status families tend to consume a higher proportion of their income compared to wealthier families. (b) Additionally, low socio-economic status families tend to spend a higher proportion of their income on foodstuffs than wealthier families. (c) The result is that sugar taxes put more financial pressure on the families who are least able to afford them. Tobacco excise 209. We submit that the Working Group should recommend that the Government halts all increases to tobacco excise and instead legalise nicotine fluid for e-cigarettes and other non- smoke alternatives. These technologies provide an alternative for smokers and have far reduced negative health effects. 210. Tobacco excise imposes significant financial burdens on the communities least able to afford tax increases, while failing to achieve its principal goal of reducing smoking prevalence. 211. In our report, Up in Smoke, released on 1 January 2018, updated our earlier report, Passive Income: How the Government users smokers as cash cows. In the reports we demonstrated the significant social costs of increasing tobacco excise. Copies of both reports are attached to this submission. (a) Despite tobacco excise increasing by more than 60% since 2012, only one in ten adult smokers quit. Among Maori and Pasifika there has been no statistically significant change in smoking rates over the last decade. (b) A pack-a-day smoker is worse off by nearly $3,000 a year in real terms compared to 2010. Given smoking is more prevalent in low socio-economic communities, tobacco excise increases have the effect of hollowing out the budgets of the most vulnerable families. (c) Tobacco excise increases have been associated with significant growth in targeted robberies of dairies and convenience stores. (i) While the Police haven’t recorded statistics on any relationship between the targeting of tobacco and burglaries or robberies, robberies in general have increased 26.6% since 2014. (ii) There has been significant media coverage of the relationship between excise increases and robberies, causing the Government to fund security measures for dairy and convenience store owners concerned for their safety.

If the sale of e-cigarettes and other alternatives were legalised, addicted smokers would be able to move to an alternative that causes them far reduced negative health effects. Instead, with no alternatives available, addicted smokers suffer under the financial burden of ever- increasing tobacco excise, causing many to rely on the black market. We submit the Working Group recommend the legalisation of smokeless nicotine alternatives to cigarettes, in preference to continued tobacco tax hikes. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 35 Section seven: Varying GST 213. Just as some groups advocate for increased excise taxes and expanding behavioural taxes to sugar and fat, other groups advocate for removing or reducing GST on some goods and services. We submit the Working Group should acknowledge that our system of GST is the envy of the world and recommend against any changes to our broadly applied and uniform rate of GST. 214. There is very little justification for changing the nature of GST. (a) Our GST system is simple, and easy to collect and administer. (b) While it’s appealing to choose to tax ‘merit’ goods less, and ‘demerit’ goods more, GST is an inefficient vehicle for enacting market or social changes. (i) Varying GST for different goods would create significant administrative burdens for IRD and businesses. (ii) Removing GST on fruit and vegetables, for example, would require IRD to classify what a fruit or vegetable is (“Are frozen chips vegetables? If not, what about other frozen vegetables?”), then audit businesses according to their classifications. (iii) Businesses who sell goods with different rates of GST would be faced with increased administrative burden in calculating their tax obligations. (iv) Any change in GST classifications over time would force businesses to spend time changing their accounting systems. (c) Eric Crampton of the New Zealand Initiative notes 36 : “Under the current beautiful broad-base, low-rate system, companies gather all their receipts for everything they purchased when making things and claim the GST on them. They then charge GST on the full value of their final product. Their net GST is on the value they added to their inputs along the way, since they netted out the GST from the inputs. Nice, clean and easy.” “There are worthy causes innumerable. But if government is to fund them, it is almost always best to do it from general tax revenues. The overall tax system is already designed to balance equity and efficiency – to place the burden where it can most easily be borne.” 36 Crampton (2017) Outside the Asylum Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 36 215. While we don’t support them, even direct subsidies of goods and services would be preferable to making changes to our GST system in order to favour some goods and services over others. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 37 Section eight: Tax treatment of cryptocurrencies 216. We submit that IRD guidance on cryptocurrencies needs to be rewritten to reflect the true nature of technology and the Working Group should recommend this. Current IRD guidance incorrectly treats cryptocurrency as property. 217. The Working Group should recommend IRD conduct a review of their current tax guidance. 218. The current tax guidance of cryptocurrency is as follows: (a) IRD treats cryptocurrencies as property, not currency, for the purposes of tax. (b) If a business receives payment in a cryptocurrency, it is liable to pay tax on that income stream in equivalent NZD. (c) If an individual has bought cryptocurrency with the intent to dispose at a later date (for example, speculating on future price increases with an expectation of a future sale) then they will be liable to pay tax on any realised capital gain. 219. The major problem is related to how IRD views those who purchase cryptocurrency. IRD assumes that cryptocurrency does not provide benefits outside of its disposal, and therefore treats holders of cryptocurrency as speculators. The specific language is as follows: “Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies generally don’t produce an income stream or provide any benefits, except when they’re sold or exchanged. This strongly suggests that cryptocurrencies are generally acquired with the purpose to sell or exchange them.” 220. This is an incorrect interpretation of the use of cryptocurrencies as there are a variety of cryptocurrencies which do either produce income streams or provide other useful benefits. 221. For example, proof-of-stake currencies reward holders of coins with a form of interest. While bitcoin employs a ‘mining’ approach, where the solution of complex computational problems earns ‘miners’ additional coins, some cryptocurrencies simply reward those who hold coins with additional coins, scaled to the number of coins they hold. 222. Cryptocurrencies are increasingly used for purposes other than alternative currency use. 223. Golem 37 , a cryptocurrency founded in Poland, is a tool for allocating computing power from those who have spare computational capacity, to those who need greater computing power. An individual who purchases coins with the intention of accessing greater computing power for a project should not be assumed to be a speculator. 224. Another cryptocurrency, Augur 38 is prediction market software which employs ‘reputation tokens’ (REP, a form of cryptocurrency) in order to authenticate events. An individual who 37 https://golem.network/ 38 http://www.augur.net/ Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 38 chooses to hold REP in order to authenticate events on Augur prediction markets is not holding REP with speculative intent and should not be taxed as such. 225. We submit that the tax treatment of cryptocurrency should reflect the true nature of each cryptocurrency, rather than a one-treatment-fits -all approach. The tax treatment should be a fair reflection of the use of the assets. 226. A failure to do so may discourage uptake of cryptocurrencies as useful tools in distributed computing, prediction markets, and an array of other instances where blockchain authentication would be valuable. We submit that the Working Group should recommend IRD guidance on cryptocurrencies be rewritten to reflect the true nature of technology and avoid deeming all cryptocurrency as property.

The Working Group has asked submitters to specifically answer the following five questions: (a) What does the future of tax look like to you? (b) What is the purpose of tax? (c) Are we taxing the right things? (d) Can tax make housing more affordable? (e) What tax issues matter most to you? 2. We believe we have answered these questions in the main part of our submission, however, we will offer brief, specific remarks below. 3. “What does the future of tax look like to you?” (a) We submit that our tax system needs to be more ambitious. The future of tax is a system where our specific mix of taxes is tailored towards encouraging higher levels of growth and investment. (b) The current system overtaxes corporate earnings and investment. That makes it more difficult for businesses to invest and grow, with then inevitable result that productivity and incomes in New Zealand are much lower than other countries with similar historical experiences. (c) The future of tax includes the following specific submissions to the Working Group: (i) indexation of income tax thresholds to growth in average earnings (or at minimum, inflation); (ii) allowing full expensing of capital investment in the year of purchase; (iii) an end to the favourable tax status of companies owned by charities and Maori Authorities; (iv) no capital gains tax; (v) an inflation tax exemption on interest earnings so that savers are only taxed on their real interest income; and, (vi) an end to tobacco excise increases, and no new lifestyle taxes. 4. “What is the purpose of tax?” Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 40 (a) To raise enough revenue to provide efficient and effective public services, with as few economic distortions as possible. 5. “Are we taxing the right things?” (a) Our submission covers the major changes we would like to see to the tax system. (b) We have included these changes in our answer to the first question. 6. “Can tax make housing more affordable?” (a) Some tax changes can improve housing affordability, although some tax changes will make it more difficult to buy a house. (b) A capital gains tax would not make housing more affordable – in fact for renters, their cost of housing would likely increase with any form of capital gains tax. (i) Any capital gains tax with a primary residence exemption would distort the housing quality distribution and increase housing costs, as outlined in the main portion of our submission. (ii) We submit that the Working Group should refrain from recommending a capital gains tax. Not only would a capital gains tax worsen housing affordability, but it would damage productivity growth, and therefore income growth for all households. (c) Any tax changes that increase incomes through time will make housing more affordable by lifting the income available to families to buy a house. (d) Tax system changes that undermine future income growth will make it comparatively more difficult for families to enter the housing market. 7. “What tax issues matter to you the most?” (a) Firstly, as outlined in our main submission, our tax system should always seek to be as ‘Honest and Transparent’ as possible. (i) Fiscal drag and the inflation tax on savings and investment both have the effect of squeezing more out of the pocket of New Zealanders when they haven’t been made any better off. (ii) This is a dishonest and opaque approach to tax increases. If the Government wants to tax families more, they should have to pass legislation and consult with the public. (b) Secondly, our tax system should seek to be as efficient as possible and impose as few economic distortions as possible. (i) The Working Group should carefully consider our woeful track record in productivity growth when they recommend any changes to the Government. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 41 (ii) As outlined in our submission, there is plenty of room to make our tax system more efficient and encourage investment and growth. (iii) However, many changes being considered would also make our tax system less efficient. (iv) Capital gains taxes (especially with a primary residence exclusion), progressive business tax rates, varying rates of GST, and certain forms of environmental taxation all create significant distortions that would further undermine our productivity performance. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 42 Appendix 2: Key submissions 1. We submit that the primary objective of the Working Group should be to recommend changes in the tax system that make it better – i.e. less damaging to the economy, society, and individual liberties; and more efficient. 2. We submit that all changes considered and recommended by the Working Group identify whether they are likely to result in less dead weight loss, fewer economic distortions, and more incentives for economic, wage and income growth. 3. Where new taxes (including reforms to existing taxes which are likely to increase the overall burden of the tax system) are recommended by the Working Group, we submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. 4. We recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. 5. We recommend that if the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate, rather than cutting rates just for smaller businesses 6. We submit that the Working Group recommend full capital expensing to increase incentives for business to invest in capital, productivity and increase wages. 7. We submit that the Working Group recommend loosen thin capitalisation rules in order to encourage greater foreign investment into New Zealand businesses, growth in the economy and wages. 8. We submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction to the extent of companies profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. 9. We submit that the 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities should be abolished – so that Maori Authorities are not provided with a cash flow advantage over non-Maori competitors. 10. We submit that the Working Group note in its report that had they not been constrained by the primary residence exclusion, then they would have recommended a land tax to the Government with all proceeds used to reduce more economically damaging taxes, such as that on income. 11. We submit that the Working Group should not recommend a capital gains tax. A capital gains tax would hurt productivity growth and discourage investment, without providing a secure revenue stream to the Government. 12. We submit that the Working Group’s Terms of Reference mean that it cannot recommend a comprehensive capital gains tax, due to the distortionary effect this would have in worsening housing affordability. If the Working Group does not accept this submission, we submit that in preference to an Australian-style complex capital gains tax, a comprehensive land tax, or failing that, a tax on the imputed income of home-owner equity, is preferable. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 43 13. We submit that the Working Group recommend that savers should only pay tax on their real interest income – inflation doesn’t make savers better off so it should not be taxed 14. We submit that any new environmental tax or water tax proposal should be subject to disciplined and transparent cost-benefit analysis. 15. We submit that any taxes on water should operate in a similar way to water rights pricing and be sector neutral – politicians should refrain from targeting specific industries or uses of water, unless the environmental externalities of the particular use are materially different. 16. As an alternative to recommending specific environmental taxes, we submit that the Working Group develop an objective framework for future proposed environmental taxes to be measured against. 17. We submit the Working Group recommend against the expansion of behavioural taxes, and instead outline the regressive financial damage they inflict on our most vulnerable communities. 18. We submit the Working Group recommend the legalisation of smokeless nicotine alternatives to cigarettes, in preference to continued tobacco tax hikes. 19. We submit the Working Group should acknowledge that our system of GST is the envy of the world and recommend against any changes to our broadly applied and uniform rate of GST. 20. We submit that the Working Group should recommend IRD guidance on cryptocurrencies be rewritten to reflect the true nature of technology and avoid deeming all cryptocurrency as property.

Budget allocations since 2008 1 Tax Cuts $415 Million New Spending $10.36 Billion 2 CONTENTS Conclusions 3 Foreword by Matthew Hooton 4 Foreword by Jordan Williams 5 Our example taxpayers 7 Effects of bracket creep 8 Option 1 - Tax free threshold of $13,000 9 Option 2 - Eliminate 30% bracket and increase first bracket threshold to $24,000 11 Option 3 - Eliminate top bracket and cap rates at 26% 13 Option 4 - Increase tax brackets across the board 15 Option 5 - Cut Company Tax 17 Methodology & Acknowledgements 18 In the coming weeks, Cabinet will be making decisions on Budget 2017 and its tax relief package. This discussion paper sets out five options for tax relief - a basis for taxpayers, members of the media, and political parties to assess options. FIVE OPTIONS FOR TAX RELIEF 3 A taxpayer friendly Budget 2017 will: 1. fully compensate taxpayers for increasing taxes paid because higher wages have pushed wage and salary earners into higher tax brackets; 2. legislate for annual CPI indexation of tax thresholds, so that this extra taxation by stealth doesn’t ever happen again. WE SAY: “It is becoming obvious even to the National Party that it must fix the inequities caused by its seven years of tax hikes.” - Matthew Hooton Since 2010 the government has taken an additional $2.41 billion due to bracket creep. In the 2017/18 financial year alone, the cost to taxpayers is forecast to be $527 million. 4 The discussion about tax cuts is one we shouldn’t even be having. As the Taxpayers’ Union outlines in this excellent publication, through ‘fiscal drag’ or ‘bracket creep’ John Key and Bill English have been increasing our taxes by stealth every year since 2010. The cumulative effect of these annual Key-English tax hikes has been to take an extra $483 a year – or $9.29 a week – out of the pay cheque of the average income earner. For the median two-parent household with two children $10.60 a week extra is taken from them by the annual Key-English tax hikes. Overall, in the 2017/18 financial year, the National-led government will take an extra $527 million out of family incomes as a result of bracket creep. Were it not for this cynical ploy, that year’s surplus would be only $170 million, not the $700 million advertised in the Treasury’s last Economic and Fiscal Update. We would not have been talking about tax cuts because it would be obvious that almost all of that real surplus should be used for debt repayment. As well as being cynical, the annual Key-English tax hikes are also ultimately poor politics. The government’s political opponents have spent nine years crying that it has somehow “borrowed for tax cuts”, whatever that could possibly mean. In fact, the value of the so-called 2010 tax-cut package in the 2017/17 financial year is just $415 million, according to the Taxpayers’ Union analysis. This is dwarfed by the $527 million a year of new taxation imposed by bracket creep. There has been no borrowing for tax cuts because in net terms there haven’t been any. Worse, now that it is becoming obvious even to the National Party that it must fix the inequities caused by its seven years of tax hikes, it will again open itself up to accusations it is somehow reducing the overall burden of taxation at the expense of other priorities such as repaying the earthquake debt and strengthening the police. In fact, any fiscal package in this year’s Budget worth less than $527 million a year will be nothing more than a reset back to 2010 levels. All of this means that it is quite obvious that tax thresholds must be adjusted to reverse the entirety of the seven years of Key- English tax hikes and that they must thereafter be indexed to either inflation or, better, wages. Only then can the government legitimately begin to talk about genuine tax cuts – and other parties either praise or criticise Bill English and Steven Joyce for offering tax relief. It is extremely unlikely any of the recommendations in this excellent report will be adopted. The government has said it will not cut tax before the election, yet afterwards it will be beholden to New Zealand First and the Maori Party, both of which have other plans for spending the $527 million now being raised annually from the Key-English tax hikes. Nevertheless, if this report is successful in at least correcting the language of the so-called tax-cut debate among the media and politicians over the next six months, the Taxpayers’ Union will have once again earned your subscription. Matthew Hooton Political commentator FOREWORD BY MATTHEW HOOTON \[1\] 5 Despite National-led governments, effective tax rates are increasing thanks to bracket creep – where inflation and average income growth pushes workers into high marginal tax brackets. Taxpayers are now carrying a much heavier burden than when the National Party last adjusted rates in 2010. In 2017, the average income earner pays $483 more per year because of inflation alone. If income tax thresholds had been adjusted with average changes in earnings (so the average rate of tax paid stayed the same), they would be paying $1,361 per year (or $26 per week) less in tax. In assessing the options contained in this paper, the above figures should be the starting point. Any ‘tax cut’ up until that amount, is simply a catch up to what was the status quo in 2010. Last year John Key told Newstalk ZB that for ‘meaningful’ tax cuts the Government would need to set aside $3 billion. We agree. $3 billion is affordable and that is the figure used to produce the options in this paper. To put $3 billion into perspective, since the National Party was elected in 2008, $10.3billion – or $6,015 per household – have been budgeted as new spending initiatives. Only 4% of that amount – $415 million – has been delivered in tax relief. This from the centre-right party that according to Mr Key “philosophically believe\[s\] in lower taxes and smaller government”. Tax relief is not spending... The media often describe tax cuts as a ‘bribe’, as if they should be treated as an area of public spending. Sadly, in the political realm public money is for the elite to bestow magnanimously on the people. In reality, tax cuts are nothing more than a commitment from the school bully to take less lunch money. They are not government spending. ...and it’s morally right to let people keep more. While it is moral for the rich to pay more — to cover the social safety net and ensure public services and the good infrastructure which the government is in the best position to provide — it is morally wrong for the government to take even a dollar more than is needed. As taxes increase, more and more transactions that would otherwise result in benefits to both parties are foregone. This shifting of economic activity from higher to lower value uses costs between $13 to $17 billion — roughly the FOREWORD BY JORDAN WILLIAMS 6 amounts spent by government on education ($13.5 billion) and superannuation ($12.9 billion). As the shining of the light on government waste by the Taxpayers’ Union demonstrates, there is plenty more to do before anyone would accept that every dollar being collected is well spent. Until that happens, the Government should be making every effort possible to reduce the tax burden. Are tax cuts always tomorrow under National? Treasury’s 2016 Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update shows economic growth is expected to average around 3% over the next five years. Surpluses are projected to rise to $8.5 billion by 2020. In addition, the financial accounts for the seven months to January show the tax take is tracking even higher than expected. In 2010 the Government cancelled its promised tax cuts. Prior to the 2014 election Bill English committed to reduce taxes “when conditions allow it”. If the current conditions aren’t that, what are? Budget 2017 is a chance for a major tax reset to set a course for economic prosperity. Tax cuts incentivise wealth creation and hard work. They fuel economic aspiration and growth. Bill English should grab the opportunity. Jordan Williams Executive Director New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union FOREWORD BY JORDAN WILLIAMS “For the average income earner a $26 per week tax cut is simply a catch up to what was the status quo in 2010.” - Jordan Williams \[1\] 7 OUR EXAMPLE TAXPAYERS Average worker earning $57,000 Family with two children (both parents working) with combined earnings of $100,000 The first scenario is based on Statistics New Zealand data for the average weekly earnings for those in paid employment ($1,086 for 2016). We annualized the figure and rounded it to $57,000. Low income worker earning $35,000 Professional earning $120,000 Statistics New Zealand data for households described as ‘couple with two dependent children’ shows a median weekly income of $1,911 for 2016. We have annualized this figure and rounded to $100,000. For the purposes of analysis we assumed the earnings are attributable to a 70:30 split, i.e. the primary income earner has annual income of $70,000, and the secondary earner $30,000. We have based this scenario on an individual on a full time hourly wage of approximately $16.80 (the minimum wage is currently $15.25). This figure is based on a mid-tier salary for a lawyer, accountant or similar professional. To illustrate the effect of bracket creep, and the options for tax relief contained in this paper, we have taken the following four taxpayers and calculated the annual and weekly financial implications for each. We also model a fifth option: cutting company tax to offer a comparison to the other options. 8 EFFECTS OF BRACKET CREEP Personal income tax thresholds have remained constant since 2010. Due to inflation – where general wages and prices across the economy increase – income earners are pushed into higher marginal tax brackets, even when their real incomes remain the same. This is known as ‘fiscal drag’ or ‘bracket creep’. As the table below illustrates, the average income earner is paying close to $10 extra per week, or $480 per year, because the Government has not adjusted tax thresholds to allow for inflation. These inflationary costs are even more significant for our couple and our professional, who lose $551 and $628 a year, respectively. Annual Tax Paid Weekly Tax Paid Current Fiscal Drag Adjusted Annual Effect Current Fiscal Drag Adjusted Weekly Effect % Of Earnings Average Earner $10,120$9,637$483$194.62$185.33$9.290.8% Couple$18,290$17,739$551$351.73$341.13$10.600.6% Low Income$5,145$5,077$68$98.94$97.63$1.310.2% Professional$30,520$29,892$628$586.92$574.85$12.080.5% Indexing thresholds to growth in average earnings Ideally, income tax thresholds should be indexed to the growth in average earnings. This would have the effect of keeping the marginal and average tax rates faced by average income earners constant over time. No income earner who has experienced a growth in incomes equivalent to average wage growth will be pushed into a higher tax bracket. Additionally, those income earners who do not see their wages grow relative to the average wage will be fairly compensated with lower average tax rates. The weekly/annual savings this policy would create for New Zealand households are significant. As shown below, if thresholds had been indexed annually since 2010, our average income earner would now pay $1,361 a year less in tax; our professional $2,186 a year; our couple $1,916 a year; and our low-income earner $236 a year.

Because low-income earners tend to consume relatively more of their disposable income, a targeted tax cut at this group will do the most to induce consumption. • Will reduce income inequality as the greatest gains are for low-earners (as a proportion of income). • Will incentivise low-income individuals to work. • All income earners will experience some tax relief. Pros • Low-income earners are already paying the smallest proportion of their income in tax, so it may be inequitable to reduce their relative tax burden further. In general, low-income earners also consume the greatest share in government services, whilst contributing the least to their provision.

Top earners pay the largest share of their income in tax but also the largest absolute levels of tax. Only around 34% of working age people earn more than $48,000, however, they pay more than 78% of total income tax. The top 2%, earning more than $150,000, pay 22% of the total. Our professional is the biggest winner under this option, saving more than $80 a week, or $4,380 a year. Considering that 17% of all taxpayers fall into the top income bracket, this would be a welcome tax saving to a large proportion of the population. Because of the targeted nature of this option, our low-income earner will not receive any tax relief; our average earner will save $360 a year; and our couple will save $880 a year. 15 OPTION 4 - INCREASE TAX BRACKETS ACROSS THE BOARD CurrentOption 4 0 - $14,00010.5%0 - $25,00010.5% $14,001 - $48,00017.5%$25,001 - $64,00017.5% $48,001 - $70,00030%$64,001 - $100,00030% $70,001+33%$100,001+33% Fiscal Impact: $2.84 billion This option is a balanced approach of increasing tax thresholds.

Lastly, our professional and couple will both save approximately $70 a week ($3,500 a year) equivalent to 3% and 3.5% of income, respectively. 17 OPTION 5 - CUT COMPANY TAX Fiscal Impact: $2.88 billion This option applies the full amount of the funds available to reducing the company tax rate from the current 28% (one of highest in the world) to 13% (making it one of the lowest). The company tax rate signals the openness of a country to entrepreneurship and business. The company tax rate can be viewed as an expense of doing business. To make New Zealand more globally tax competitive, this option proposes lowering the company tax rate to 13%. This proposed rate would make us the second most tax competitive country among the 35 OECD members, behind Ireland at 12.5%. At our current company tax rate of 28% we are ranked a modest 24th. Lower company taxes attract greater investment, stimulate the economy, and lift the income levels of society. Devereux, Griffith and Klemm (2002) examine the increased investment in Ireland as a result of the reduction in company tax rates from 45% to 10%. They also show that despite the trend of long-term reductions in company tax rates, company tax revenue as a share of GDP has remained constant over time. Their paper would suggest that many Australian companies would consider moving to New Zealand if our company tax rate were significantly lower than across the Tasman. There is also growing signs that other countries are moving to lower their company tax rates. UK Prime Minister, Theresa May, US President Donald Trump, and Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, have all signalled that the company rates in their respective countries will soon be lowered. This will make New Zealand’s company tax rate even less competitive, and reduce New Zealand’s relative attractiveness for foreign investment.

The changes in tax revenue were calculated using Treasury estimates which specify the total taxable income within given income bands. Up to incomes of $80,000, total taxable income is calculated within each $1,000 band. For incomes above $80,000, total taxable income is calculated within each $5,000 band. Changes in company tax revenue were calculated using Treasury estimates for the 2016/2017 year. For Option 3 we have used Treasury’s estimate of $375 million net reduction in tax for each percentage point change in the company tax rate. This figure takes into account taxes otherwise paid by Crown-owned companies and does not include any offset in personal tax (in this option the company tax and personal income tax move in tandem). For Option 5 we have used Treasury’s estimate of $240 million net reduction in tax for each percentage point change in the company tax rate excluding Crown-owned companies less personal tax offset. The value includes the offset in personal tax revenue due to personal income tax rates remaining constant. Dynamic effects Because tax changes affect decision-making in the labour, capital, and goods and services markets, our revenue-loss estimates account for a feedback effect. For example, when personal income tax rates are lowered there is an increased incentive to supply labour – hence the lowered income tax revenue will be partially offset by greater labour force participation/ hours worked. Likewise, individuals who generate additional income as a result of tax relief will consume some part of this extra income, resulting in increased GST revenue. Using the Mankiw and Weinzierl’ (2004) guide for dynamic scoring, we have attributed a tax revenue offset from a reduction in personal income tax and company tax as 0.15 and 0.2 respectively. For trustee income tax (Option 3) we have applied 0.1. These offsets are specific to the labour and capital market adjustments. These figures are relatively conservative estimates derived from the most cautious parameter values. For example, using alternative parameter values they find a company tax feedback of 0.5, which would greatly reduce the tax revenue loss from company tax cuts. In regard to the GST feedback loop, we use the default Treasury value of 0.15. This implies that for every dollar of tax revenue forgone in personal income tax cuts 15 cents will be recouped through greater consumption and therefore GST revenue. All of our estimates are independent of Working for Families as the scheme is based on before-tax income. In theory, Working for Families is unaffected by changes in the personal income tax structure. Fiscal Drag The inflation-adjusted income thresholds have been calculated using consumers’ price index (CPI). CPI data was sourced from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. Average and median earnings are sourced from the Household Labour Force Survey, and forecasted figures for 2017 are from Reserve Bank projections.

This is a simple truism, but beneath it lies a web of complexity. There are thousands of food products and thousands of ways to be physically active. People live under different circumstances, in different environments and have different tastes. It would be absurd to blame a single ingredient, let alone a single product category, for the rise in obesity that has been witnessed around the world. Nevertheless, that is what single issue pressure groups like FIZZ have sought to do. This excellent report shows why their campaign to use tax as a weapon against sugar is dangerous nonsense. The shipwreck of the Danish fat tax should be the world’s lighthouse in regard to health-related taxes on food and drink. All the unintended consequences associated with them were on display in the fifteen months of this ill-fated experiment. The impact on fat consumption was trivial and the effect on obesity was non-existent. Danish consumers switched to cheaper brands of the same products and bought them from cheaper stores, sometimes in cheaper countries. Inflation rose, jobs were lost and people on low incomes suffered most severely from the rising cost of living. Little wonder, then, that the tax was swiftly repealed by an overwhelming majority in the Danish parliament in 2012. There are important lessons here but if the ‘public health’ lobby has learned them it is only so they can repeat them exactly, this time with sugar. There is no reason to expect a different outcome. As numerous studies have shown, people tend to be flexible in how much they are prepared to pay for the food and drink they enjoy. They would sooner make sacrifices in other areas of the household budget than change their eating habits. The Danish experience is not unique in demonstrating this. The evidence from the USA, where a number of states have introduced soda taxes, tells the same story. Faced with a dismal record of failure in the real world, campaigners for food and drink taxes have retreated into a world of statistical models in order to prove that policies which don’t work in practice can be made to work in theory. But there is no running away from the facts outlined in this report. Taxing fat, sugar or soda is an effective method of raising government revenue precisely because people keep on buying them. A sugar tax is attractive to politicians because it allows them to engage in mass pick-pocketing with a sense of moral superiority. They need to be reminded that there is nothing moral about introducing a regressive stealth tax when you know that demand is inelastic. Taxing food and drink won’t make the poor healthier, but it will certainly help to ensure they stay poor. It is not good enough to say that anything is worth a try in the campaign against obesity. A policy that is known to incur significant costs without reaping any measurable rewards is a policy that should be rejected without a second thought. Christopher Snowdon is Director of Lifestyle Economics at Britain’s Institute of Economic Affairs. 4 Executive summary: In recent years calls for taxes on unhealthy foods have been growing. Newly established public health advocacy groups such as “FIZZ” are calling for a 20 per cent tax on sugar-sweetened beverages. Their aim is a “sugar free New Zealand by 2025.” 1 Such advocacy is prevalent 2 and has grown in line with New Zealanders’ expanding waistlines. While there is no doubt New Zealanders today are heavier than previous generations 3 this paper argues the causes are many and varied, including levels of physical activity, overall calorie intake and genetic predisposition. Proposing a 20 per cent tax on sugar as some groups have suggested appears to be more about value judgements on sugar than actually helping New Zealanders towards better health outcomes. Sucrose intake for New Zealanders fell between 1997 and 2008 while obesity rates continued to rise. This throws doubt on sugar’s perceived role as central villain in the battle of the bulge. Close consideration of the international experience casts further doubt on the case for such a tax suggesting it is unlikely to be effective, but may place a heavy burden on a nation’s economy. The risks of such a proposed tax are best illustrated by the experience of Denmark who enacted an excise tax on saturated fats in 2011 only to abolish the tax a year later. The tax resulted in a public infuriated by an abrogation of their choices, substitution to non taxed foods, negative economic impacts including job losses, and by one survey no reduction in consumption of the targeted foods by 90 per cent of consumers. 4 It also seems an odd time for such vociferous advocacy given active promotion by the food industry of lower sugar options driven by shifts in preferences by more health conscious consumers. As with the drive a decade ago for ‘low fat’ food options, consumers are voting with their mouths and demanding low sugar alternatives. The market is already responding to consumer demand. Aside from the draconian restrictions on personal choice a sugar tax would entail, there are several reasons why such a policy intervention is a bad idea: New Zealanders are consuming less added sugar Sucrose (the typical added sugar) 5 median daily intake by New Zealand males between 1997 and 2008/09 fell while obesity rates for males rose. Females showed a statistically insignificant decrease in sucrose intake while obesity rates rose. 6 1 http://www.fizz.org.nz/ accessed on 10 April 2015 2 See for example https://www.consumer.org.nz/articles/sugar 3 A recent Ministry of Health report found rates of obesity has increased for both men and women see A Focus on Nutrition: Key findings of the 2008/09 New Zealand Adult Nutrition Survey (2011 University of Otago and Ministry of Health) (hereafter New Zealand Adult Nutrition Survey) 4 “Fat Tax has little effect” Politiken November 23, 2011 data retrieved from http://politiken.dk/newsinenglish/ ECE1459080/fat-tax-has-little-effect/ on 6 July 2015 retrieved on 13 April 2015 5 Parnell, W; Wilson, N; Alexander, D; Wohlers, M; Williden, M; Mann, J and Gray, A “Exploring the relationship between sugars and obesity” in Public Health Nutrition: 11(8) pages 860-866 (2007) 6 New Zealand Adult Nutrition Survey Sucrose figures are on page 308. The change in obesity is summarised on page XXVI. This is in line with the English and Australian experience see for example Barclay, A. and Brand-Miller, J “The Australian Paradox: A substantial decline in Sugars intake over the same timeframe that overweight and obesity have increased” in Nutrients (2011) 5 Sugary drinks are a small proportion of total energy intake Of New Zealanders’ total energy intake only 1.6 per cent comes from the added sugar content of sugar-sweetened non-alcoholic beverages. The Danish fat tax did not work Denmark experimented by introducing a tax on saturated fats aimed at reducing the intake of fatty foods in 2011 which was subsequently repealed in 2012, just one year later, by the Danish government. It may not change behaviour Advocates hope an increase in price will lead people to eat less sugar. Unfortunately evidence suggests consumers may change their behaviour in response to food taxes less than advocates hope. Similar taxes in Mexico and Denmark have had little, if any, impact on overall consumption of the targeted product. Unintended consequences The Danish tax became very unpopular in part because compliance costs for Danish businesses became high and the tax made Danish producers less competitive. The economic situation reached such a point that the Danish Chamber of Commerce and two trade unions (HK Commerce and the Allied Workers Union) joined forces to place advertisements calling for the tax to be repealed. 7 Food taxes are regressive Lower income people spend more of their income on food so such taxation disproportionately affects the least well- off. Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption is falling globally Advocates of the tax are pushing for its introduction in the context of increased consumer preference for lower sugar options. 7 Snowdon “The Proof of the pudding: Denmark’s fat tax fiasco” Institute of Economic Affairs Current Controversies Paper No. 42 (2013) 6 New Zealanders are getting fatter The World Health Organisation defines obesity and overweight as “abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health.” 8 Individuals are considered overweight or obese when they have a body mass index (BMI) in excess of 25 or 30. The BMI is a calculation derived by dividing a person’s weight by the square of their height. Obesity rates have increased over the last three decades across the globe. New Zealanders have not escaped the fattening fate of our American, Australian or British cousins. The percentage of obese New Zealand females has risen from 20.6 per cent to 27.8 per cent and from 17.0 per cent to 27.7 per cent for males between 1997 and 2008/09. 9 Obesity is a problem because it puts people at risk of a range of debilitating illnesses such as diabetes, heart diseases and cancer. Obesity is a growing health problem in developed countries but has now also spread to some middle income developing countries. It represents a stark shift from the problems of earlier stages in human economic development when lack of food produced emaciation and its accompanying health risks. What are the causes? Obesity can be caused by a range of factors but weight gains in developing countries have been influenced in large part by economic changes as people have shifted from more active occupations such as manual or farm jobs to more sedentary ones such as service sector or office jobs. People shifted from the farm to the office because the wages were better and office jobs were less physically demanding. 10 These structural changes cannot be held responsible for more recent bulging waistlines. Obesity today can be caused by a combination of a lack of physical activity, genetic predisposition, an unbalanced diet and prenatal and postnatal influences. All of these factors have likely played some sort of role in New Zealand’s growing rate of obesity, but like many public policy issues it is difficult to divine a single cause responsible for negative outcomes. As Christopher Snowdon from the Institute of Economic Affairs has noted: “obesity is the result of consuming too many calories from any source” 11 ...which suggests a tax on sugar is unlikely to be a silver bullet for the health issue of obesity. 8 World Health Organisation website: http://www.who.int/topics/obesity/en/ accessed on 10 April 2015 9 Page XXVI of Adult Nutrition Survey 10 See “Supersize it” chapter 3 in Miller, Benjamin and North The Economics of Public Issues 17th edition (2012) 11 Snowdon, C The Proof of the Pudding: Denmark’s Fat Tax fiasco Institute of Economic Affairs Current Controversies paper No. 42 (May 2013) 7 Is sugar to blame? Between 1997 and 2009 median daily sugar intake for New Zealand males fell from 62 to 55 grams while females showed a statistically insignificant decrease from 45 to 42 grams. This occurred at the same time obesity rates increased in the country from 17 per cent of the population to 27.7 per cent for males and from 20.6 per cent to 27.8 per cent for females. 12 A decline in sugar intake matched with an increase in rates of obesity actually follows trends seen in both Britain and Australia. 13 Such a paradox casts doubt on the assertion of public health advocacy groups such as FIZZ that sugar is the demon chiefly responsible for the obesity of New Zealanders. Research from Otago University has also questioned the link between sugar intake and obesity. Parnell et al found “obese children had a significantly lower intake of sugars \[and energy percentage\] than normal weight children”. 14 Even if sugar is primarily to blame for obesity, the amount attributable to soft drinks – the product many are calling for a tax to target – is small. The New Zealand Adult Nutrition Survey shows that only 5.0 per cent of New Zealanders’ total energy intake comes from non-alcoholic beverages with 1.6 per cent of the total energy intake from just sucrose (a proxy for the added sugar content) of sugar-sweetened non-alcoholic beverages. It is unclear whether targeting sugar will deliver the desired improvements in public health, but international experience suggests there will be serious costs arising from such a policy that must be considered. 12 New Zealand Adult Nutrition Survey Sucrose figures are on page 308. The change in obesity is summarised on page XXVI. 13 Barclay, A and Brand-Miller, J “The Australian paradox: A Substantial decline in Sugars intake over the same timeframe that Overweight and Obesity have Increased” in Nutrients (2011) volume 3 pp491-504 14 Parnell, W; Wilson, N; Alexander, D; Wohlers, M; Williden, M; Mann, J and Gray, A “Exploring the relationship between sugars and obesity” in Public Health Nutrition: 11(8) pages 860-866 (2007) 8 The Danish experience In response to concern about levels of obesity, the Danish government introduced in 2011 an excise tax on products containing more than 2.3 per cent saturated fat. The tax was set at 16 Kroner (approximately 3NZD) per kilogram. Danish politicians had the best of intentions in introducing the tax reasoning that, all things being equal, an increase in the price of fatty foods should cause consumers to buy fewer fatty foods. In introducing the tax, the Danish government aspired to the laudable aim of increasing the average life expectancy of Danes by three years over the next ten years. Then Health Minister Jakob Axel Nielsen said when introducing the idea in 2009, “Higher fees on sugar, fat and tobacco is an important step on the way toward a higher average life expectancy in Denmark \[because\] saturated fats can cause cardiovascular disease and cancer.” 15 Unfortunately for advocates of excise taxes on so-called bad foods, the real world is often more complicated and policies do not occur in a vacuum. Just as policymakers intended, prices of fatty products rose as manufacturers passed on the additional costs to consumers. However, the ultimate price rise far exceeded expectations with some research suggesting the tax may have been responsible for price rises in excess of 20 per cent. 16 The tax led many Danes to switch their purchases to discount supermarkets yet “the prices in the discount stores increased more than what could be directly justified by the tax”. 17 The fact discount stores increased prices by more than the tax could justify suggests that consumers are less willing to change their consumption habits than public health advocates may have wished. Economists term consumers’ willingness to pay more, rather than consume less, when faced with higher prices “inelastic demand”. The Danish experience suggested the taxed foods fit that profile. This same piece of research also lent credence to anecdotal suggestions of hoarding by Danes prior to the introduction of the tax. Furthermore, the analysis points at some interesting structural effects in the food retailing sector, with some shifts in demand from high end supermarkets towards low-end discount stores a shift that seems to have been utilised by discount chains to raise the prices of butter and margarine by more than the pure tax increase, while still maintaining – and even improving the market share for butter. 18 The New Zealand Beverage Guidance Panel has argued “policy options are known to be highly cost-effective in terms of public health interventions” 19 but the Danish experience suggests there is dubious public health benefit to be had at real expense. 15 “Denmark imposes ‘fat tax’ on food to curb obesity” The Independent October 3, 2011 retrieved from http:// www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/denmark-imposes-fat-tax-on-food-to-curb-obesity-2364715. html on 18 May 2015 16 Jensen and Smed The Danish Tax on Saturated Fat: Short run effects on consumption and consumer prices of fats University of Copenhagen Institute of Food and Resource Economics (2012) 17 ibid at page 1 18 ibid at page 18 19 New Zealand Beverage Guidance Panel “Policy Brief: Options to Reduce Sugar Sweetened Beverage (SSB) Consumption in New Zealand” 19th June 2014 at page 1 9 The Mexican experience Mexico introduced an excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) of 1 peso per litre in January 2014. While the Mexican tax has resulted in a lot of hype, the data does not appear to offer any support in favour of a tax on sugar to reduce obesity rates. In New Zealand, activists and media commentators have claimed success of the Mexican sugar tax based on some preliminary findings (not peer-reviewed) of a study by the National Institute of Public Health of Mexico. The study was funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies - a charitable fund which financially supports sugar tax campaign groups around the world. The study was overseen by Professor Barry Popkin, a strong supporter of sugar taxes as well as an adviser to the Mexican government about the tax. The press conference to release these findings and pronounce the tax as a success was held by Alianza por la salud alimentaria, a collective of activist groups that includes Greenpeace. The report concludes that Mexico’s tax on SSBs resulted in a 12 per cent reduction in consumption across the population and a 17 per cent reduction among low socio-economic groups and has been widely reported in New Zealand media. Those findings do not match the actual sales data from the marketplace. People are paying more for the same Nielsen sales data 20 shows that there was no significant reduction in litres consumed in the twelve months to May 2013 (before the tax) and the twelve months to May 2015 (the first full year of data since the tax was introduced). Between these years, consumption of SSBs fell by 182 litres. 182 litres in a country that consumes over 11 billion litres of carbonated soft drinks is a flat result. The difference between what activists claim, and what the sales data shows, results from the study being based on panel data and interviews and not actual accurate sales data. Expressed preferences are often skewed because what people say they do and what they actually do are often quite different. For example, when asked how often they use local libraries, members of the public tend to inflate their actual use. It appears here that participants have told researchers they are reducing their consumption of sugary drinks when the national sales data shows that not to be the case. The lesson here is actions speak louder than words. Even among the greatest supporters of the tax, there is some acknowledgement of its failure. In March Professor Popkin was reported in the Washington Post as saying the Mexican sugar tax is too low “to meaningfully affect consumption”. 21 20 See appendix. 21 “Is a soda tax the solution to America’s obesity problem?” The Washington Post March 23, 2015 retrieved from http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/is-a-soda-tax-the-solution-to-americas- obesity-problem/2015/03/23/b6216864-ccf8-11e4-a2a7-9517a3a70506\_story.html on 5 July 2015 10 Will a tax change behaviour? The implied rationale behind introducing a sugar excise tax such as those on tobacco or fuel is ostensibly to reduce consumption. However, evidence on food and drink taxes suggests consumers may not behave as public health advocates would wish. 22 One report on the Danish experience found 90 per cent of Danes were consuming the same amount of targeted fatty foods of butter, cream and cheese a year after the introduction of the tax. 23 Unintended consequences There is a surprising lack of consideration by those campaigning for a sugar tax of the direct costs and potential unintended consequences of the policy measures they propose. Denmark’s experience with the fat tax shows the folly of the assumption that any given policy will have direct impact within a vacuum. Denmark’s fat tax was blamed for an increase in inflation to 4.7 per cent while real wages fell by 0.8 per cent. 24 The tax not only increased the costs of targeted foods (as was intended) but also raised administration costs for businesses who now had to figure out the saturated fat content of their products and how to adjust their prices accordingly. The perilous economic situation wrought by the tax became so bad in Denmark that it made for an unlikely union between the Danish Chamber of Commerce and two trade unions who joined forces in pushing for the abolition of the very unpopular tax. Substitution effects Obesity like many health ailments is a complex phenomenon contingent on many factors so it is hard to tease out direct correlation with any one potential contributor. When considering the case for a food tax it is important to look not solely at consumer behaviour with respect to the targeted food but also consumer behaviour with respect to “substitutes”. Calories do not solely come from sugar and a policy which taxed sugar may simply have the effect of substituting high sugar consumption for greater consumption of other high calorie foods. The substitute good for Coca-Cola may not be Pepsi or another sugary drink or food but instead some other high calorie item unlikely to improve health. This was the experience of a research experiment in the United States which found a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages had the effect of increasing purchases of beer in those beer purchasing households. 25 22 Powell, LM and Chaloupka, F.J. “Food prices and obesity: evidence and policy implications for taxes and subsidies” Milbank Q 2009; 87: pages 229-257 23 “Fat Tax has little effect” Politiken November 23, 2011 retrieved from http://politiken.dk/newsinenglish/ ECE1459080/fat-tax-has-little-effect/ on 6 July 2015 24 Snowdon, C “The Proof of the Pudding: Denmark’s Fat Tax fiasco” Institute of Economic Affairs Current Controversies paper No. 42 (May 2013) 25 Wansick, B; Hanks, A; Cawley, J and Just, D. “From Coke to Coors: A Field Study of a Fat Tax and its unintended consequences” (2014) 11 Food taxes are unfair Individuals on lower incomes spend proportionately more of their incomes on necessities such as food. A direct tax on food is therefore regressive, harming the poor more than higher income earners. According to figures from Statistics New Zealand’s Household Economic Survey of 2013, 18 per cent of total weekly expenditure for New Zealand’s lowest income earners was spent on food. 26 Falling global consumption A recent report by Business Insider highlighted the decline of brand Coca-Cola (a source of added sugars and a product often demonised by advocates of a sugar tax) with sales growth falling markedly in the last five years. 27 The article quotes Melbourne Business School Associate Professor of Marketing Mark Ritson who considers the value of cola is in decline: “the value of that cola category is set to plummet over the next 20 years. It’s no good \[for Coca- Cola\] being a big fish in an ever smaller pond”. Mr Ritson notes the decline is further due to more consumers making health conscious decisions: Natural products, organic ingredients, incredibly fresh origin, local provenance — these were initially the watchwords of small groups of maven consumers, but this movement has become more and more pronounced in the developed world in recent years. And it will only get stronger in the years to come. This report and other evidence suggests groups of consumers are already making choices to shift towards healthier options. The increasing availability of lower or no sugar options with artificial sweeteners such as Coke Zero, Just Juice 50% less sugar, Coca Cola Life and Pepsi Next, provides anecdotal support for Mr Ritson’s contention that the market for high sugar drinks is already declining. In spite of these changes advocates for the tax continue to view the industry in an antagonistic fashion. Writing in the Pacific Health Dialogue Professor Roby Beaglehole has argued that the greatest barrier to a sugar tax may be the sugar industry itself which he asserts “has vested interests in maintaining the status quo”. 28 The change in product focus for multi national corporations, Coca-Cola and Pepsi, simply reflect commercial realities in a dynamic market place. Professor Beaglehole is probably right to suggest the industry would prefer to maintain the status quo but in the real world of dynamic markets, the status quo doesn’t often last long. Changing preferences toward healthier options force companies like Coca-Cola to shift their production to best suit those healthy preferences or risk going out of business. 26 New Zealand Household Economic Survey 2013 data retrieved from http://nzdotstat.stats.govt.nz/wbos/ Index.aspx on 18 May 2015 27 “The End of the Coke era” Business Insider April 9, 2015 retrieved from http://www.businessinsider.com.au/ what-is-the-future-for-the-coca-cola-brand-soda-sales-decline-2015-4 on 14 April 2015 28 Beaglehole, R “Sugar Sweetened Beverages, obesity, diabetes and oral health” Pacific Health Dialog March 2014 Volume 20 Number 1 at page 41 12 Conclusion The evidence on excise food taxes suggests such policy interventions are ineffective.A tax on sugar would represent a sledgehammer one size fits all approach viewing a reduction in sugar intake as a panacea for the serious weight problems faced by some New Zealanders. In considering whether someone is healthy it is important to take a more holistic approach which considers their overall diet and physical activity instead of their consumption of so-called bad foods. The experience of Denmark suggests excise food taxes can have unfortunate unintended consequences when implemented in the real world. Sucrose intake for New Zealanders fell between 1997 and 2008 while obesity rates continued to raise throwing doubt on sugar’s perceived role as central villain in the battle of the bulge. At a time when consumer preferences globally and locally appear to be shifting toward lower sugar products the case for the tax is further weakened. Substitution from taxed sugar to untaxed high calorie food as has been the experience in Denmark and in a United States field study, which suggests a strong likelihood that a sugar tax would represent zero health gain but at a real cost to the New Zealand economy. 13 Appendix: Nielsen sales data Carbonated soft drinks sales in Mexico TOTAL MEXICOTotal sales (Pesos ‘000) Moving Annual TotalMay-13 May-14May-15 Carbonated soft drinks103354522.3 111,585,133.4122,501,542.6 % change 8.0% 9.8% TOTAL MEXICOLitres (‘000) Moving Annual TotalMay-13 May-14May-15 Carbonated soft drinks 11,092,531.211,120,041.811,092,349.4 % change0.2% -0.2% TOTAL MEXICOUnit Sales (‘000) Moving Annual TotalMay-13 May-14May-15 Carbonated soft drinks1,953,838.1 1,958,685.6 1,953,813.2 % change0.2% -0.2% Source: The Nielsen Company www.taxpayers.org.nz

UP IN SMOKE: THE SOCIAL COST OF TOBACCO EXCISE 1 UP IN SMOKE: THE SOCIAL COST OF TOBACCO EXCISE DECEMBER 2017 FOREWORD BY JORDAN WILLIAMS Since the publication two years ago of our first report looking at the issue of tobacco taxes, our predictions (and warnings) about the negative costs associated with continuing to hike taxes on smokers have come true. In the earlier report, we showed how smokers are being treated as cash cows — taxes then already covered three times of the health costs of the habit. We warned of the risks of a black market developing if tobacco excise continued to increase, and highlighted the Government’s failure to legalise e-cigarettes for vaping. Vaping is the first real alternative to traditional cigarettes, and are is considered to be at least 90 percent less harmful. They are the number one tool used in Britain to help smokers quit. Despite that, e-cigarette liquids containing nicotine are still technically illegal to sell in New Zealand (though importing it for personal use is not prohibited). Since our last report, New Zealanders have woken-up to the benefits of e-cigarettes, with vaping stores popping up around the country (and, technically, operating illegally). We say the Government should stop dragging the chain, and fully legalise the sale of e-cigarette liquids containing nicotine. That would allow New Zealanders to conveniently access international brands and products, and enable more smokers to make the switch. The goal of excise tax – to reduce smoking rates and prevent smoking-related illness – is a noble one. But it’s not enough to judge a policy by its intentions. This report evaluates tobacco excise tax based on its actual results, both intended and unintended. Counterintuitively it is the poor that have been the least responsive to recent tax hikes. That means smokers, and their families, are going without. Increasing taxes well in excess of the health costs of tobacco, knowing that they are being paid by those least able to afford it, is morally questionable, especially when the Government won’t legalise the safer alternative. Despite tobacco prices increasing by over 60 percent since 2012, only one in ten adult smokers have quit. And amongst Maori and Pasifika, there has been no statistically significant reduction in smoking rates over the last decade. In other words, the much higher taxes have completely failed to achieve the goal of reducing smoking rates in those communities where they are the highest. As detailed in this report, for someone on the average wage, smoking will see them pay 17.5 percent of their income on excise tax – about the same the same worker pays in PAYE. The underground markets we warned about have taken hold. The Police now back us up on this claim, with dairy owners and other tobacco retailers all too aware that high tobacco excise sees them targeted by criminals, eager to get their hands on stolen tobacco for profitable resale. The election of the Labour-led Government is an opportunity to halt the tobacco tax escalator and acknowledge that the current approach just isn’t working. Jordan Williams is the Executive Director of the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union. 2 UP IN SMOKE: THE SOCIAL COST OF TOBACCO EXCISE DECEMBER 2017 3 UP IN SMOKE: THE SOCIAL COST OF TOBACCO EXCISE DECEMBER 2017 Tobacco excise tax has increased by 10 percent a year since 2010. After adjusting for inflation, that’s caused the price of tobacco to more than double. At Treasury’s recommendation, tobacco excise will continue to increase by 10 percent a year for the next four years. Some health advocates have recommended 10 percent annual increases in excise through to 2025. There are three primary considerations for the Government when it comes to future decisions on tobacco excise. Firstly, the degree to which increases in excise reduces smoking prevalence. Secondly, how increases in tobacco excise financially impact households. Thirdly, any unintended consequences from higher taxes – specifically, does it incentivise (or is it already incentivising) crime? This report will consider each of these in order. Our analysis finds that excise increases have had mixed results on smoking prevalence. In spite of the huge increase in prices, the Ministry of Health found no statistically significant difference in the rates of smoking amongst Maori and Pasifika between 2006/07 and 2015/16. In the general INTRODUCTION population, only one in ten adults quit smoking between 2011/12 and 2015/16, during which period of time tobacco prices increased over 60 percent. For the vast majority of smokers who haven’t quit, in spite of the taxes, tobacco excise has significantly reduced their disposable income. A pack-a-day smoker is nearly $3,000 per year worse off in real terms than they were in 2010. Tobacco excise is legislated to increase by 10 percent annually (in real terms) until 2020, although with the ‘SmokeFree 2025’ goal in mind, public health officials advocate for tax increases many years beyond that. The consequences for public safety have also been apparent. The literature on the economics of crime notes that criminals act rationally in response to the expected returns from committing crime. This is exactly what appears to have happened in New Zealand - increasing tobacco prices has induced a wave of tobacco related burglaries and robberies because the potential illegal profits from doing so have skyrocketed. Detailed information on tobacco related crime isn’t recorded by Police, in spite of significant media coverage over tobacco related crime. We do know, however, that robberies, aggravated and otherwise, have increased by 26.6 percent since 2014 and the Police, particularly in the Counties Manukau District, have said that tobacco is the primary driver. While it is difficult to provide perfectly-informed policy advice in this area, given the lack of data, it is concerning then that there is a four-year plan in place to increase tobacco excise, without a good understanding of the associated costs. “A pack-a-day smoker is nearly $3000 per year worse off in real terms than they were in 2010” 4 UP IN SMOKE: THE SOCIAL COST OF TOBACCO EXCISE DECEMBER 2017 IMPACT ON SMOKING RATES The aim of tobacco excise is to reduce the rate of smoking in society. The mechanism is simple – tax increases are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, which reduces consumer demand for tobacco. The degree smoking rates change in response to price increases is crucial, because it impacts the size of any social benefits from excise tax. Economists measure price responsiveness by calculating the "price elasticity of demand". Typically, tobacco is classed as price inelastic, which means even large price increases will elicit a small change in demand. Treasury modelling assumes a price elasticity of between -0.3 and -0.5, which implies a reduction of between 3 percent and 5 percent in tobacco consumption for every 10 percent increase in price. Evidence gathered overseas indicates that’s a sensible estimate. The price elasticity of daily smoking prevalence is estimated equal to -0.25 by Treasury. That implies a 10 percent increase in price reduces smoking prevalence in society by 2.5 percent. That means very large tobacco excise increases will be required to have a significant impact on smoking rates. Modelling from the University of Otago’s Public Health department has estimated the national smoking rate under various tax scenarios (see table). In the absence of any tax increases from 2015, they estimate the smoking rate will be 9.9 percent of the general population in 2025. Annual 10 percent increases in tobacco excise from is estimated to only reduce that rate by 1.2 percentage points to 8.7 percent in 2025. Amongst Maori, the comparative improvement in smoking rates under the above scenario is only two percentage points for men and three percentage points for women. This indicates that smoking prevalence in an environment without additional increases in excise tax still falls substantially. Tobacco excise increases have had mixed results over the last decade. The Ministry of Health has found that between 2006/07 and 2015/16, smoking rates among Maori and Pasifika have not experienced a statistically significant change. Smoking rates in the general population have fallen 4 percentage points over this period, but it’s unclear what proportion of this change can be attributed to increases in excise taxes. The University of Otago forecast smoking rates falling, even in the absence of price increases. Treasury assume that smoking prevalence will fall by 1 percent per annum even in the absence of tax increases. If we applied that assumption, then excise tax increases are responsible for a reduction in the smoking rate of only 1.9 percentage points. Treasury notes in a Regulatory Impact Statement in 2016 that “ultimately some smokers will not cut back.” There is an obvious trade off in harming the wellbeing of that group, and price increases leading others to quit.

Modelling the implications of regular increases in tobac- co taxation in the tobacco endgame 5 UP IN SMOKE: THE SOCIAL COST OF TOBACCO EXCISE DECEMBER 2017 COST TO HOUSEHOLDS The cost to smokers from higher tobacco excise has been substantial. The Government has increased the excise in real terms by 94.8 percent between 2010 and 2017. Currently, a 20- pack of cigarette costing the consumer around $22, has taxes applied in excess of $17. In addition, the Government has legislated for an additional 10 percent annual increase (plus adjustments to reflect inflation) until 2020. Increases in tobacco excise has made a pack-a-day smoker worse off today by nearly $3,000 (in 2017 terms) a year compared to 2010. A smoker who buys a 50-gram pouch of tobacco a week is paying $25 extra in excise on every transaction - that adds up to $1,330 a year. If excise taxes increase at their current rate through 2025, as has been proposed in order to meet the goal of ‘SmokeFree 2025’, pack-a-day smokers will be worse off by an additional $7,024 a year – or $135 a week. For someone on the median wage of $959 a week, that represents approximately 17.5 percent of an individual’s after- tax income. Given the average earner pays 17.5 percent tax on most of their income, this level of tobacco excise effectively sees a smoker paying twice the level of tax in comparison to others on the average wage. Note that $135 is also the figure provided by New Zealand Immigration as an average spend on food and alcohol each week. Another way to consider increases in tobacco excise is the equivalent of making a pack- a-day smoker pay twice for all their groceries. If you buy a 50-gram pouch each week, you should expect to be worse off by $60 a week or over $3000 a year. That represents approximately 11 percent of a minimum wage worker’s after-tax income. In New Zealand, low income households have higher smoking rates than high income households, and Maori and Pasifika have higher smoking rates than the rest of society. In 2025, one in ten will still smoke, and one in five Maori will still smoke. If the current relationship between income and smoking status continues (which should be expected), smoking rates will be much higher than those numbers for low income households. Obviously for those who choose to stop smoking altogether, increases in tobacco excise won’t hurt their incomes, but many of those who choose to quit are still expected to quit even in the absence of those tax increases. Meanwhile the majority of current smokers who are expected to continue even in the presence of higher prices, will have their disposable incomes significantly reduced. Evidence from the United States confirms that cigarette taxes are regressive. Lower income households, although more sensitive to tobacco price changes, “... spend a disproportionate share of their income on cigarette taxes compared to smokers with greater incomes.” In a report from 2016, Treasury recommended that annual real increases in tobacco excise of 10 percent a year stop in 2020. “While increases of this magnitude would not, on their own, achieve the Smokefree 2025 goal, we believe they strike an appropriate balance between the drive to make further reductions in smoking with the recognition that ultimately some smokers will not cut back.” 6 UP IN SMOKE: THE SOCIAL COST OF TOBACCO EXCISE DECEMBER 2017 TOBACCO EXCISE DRIVING CRIME Increasing excise taxes on tobacco translates into higher prices. The aim is to reduce demand and therefore the prevalence of smoking in society, but higher prices have two important effects. Firstly, addicted smokers who struggle to quit are more willing to purchase tobacco on the black market. Higher prices from legitimate retailers can (as demonstrated earlier) can demonstrably impact the finances of households that often already struggle to balance their budget. The vast majority of society normally don’t want to associate with criminals or risk sanction from the justice system. However, as cigarette prices skyrocket, these costs are outstripped by the comparative savings available to smokers by purchasing illegally distributed tobacco. Higher prices therefore induce the willingness of smokers to purchase tobacco from the black market. Secondly, increasing tobacco excise tax incentivises illegal supply. In foreign jurisdictions, this encourages smuggling tobacco across borders, from low tax environments to high tax environments. Given New Zealand’s isolated location, smuggling tobacco illegally into the country is more difficult. Criminals have therefore pursued alternative methods of supply: burglaries and robberies. This result is predicted by substantial literature on the economics of crime. Gary Becker first wrote about how criminals rationally respond to changes in payoffs in 1968. The model presented in Crime and Punishment: An Economic Approach posits that the decision to commit crime depends on the pay-off from the crime; the risk of being caught; the punishment if caught; and the value of any alternative income. The model would predict that, holding all other variables constant, if the proceeds of crime materially increased, we should expect to see more people choosing to commit that crime. That claim has also been empirically tested. Evidence from a 2015 paper points to changes in the price of “loot” as a significant factor in crime trends in the United Kingdom. The authors note that changes in the prices of jewelry, fuel, and metals impact the way criminals target their offending. This is exactly the story we’ve seen at home, where burglaries and robberies have reportedly increased in line with cigarette prices. The New Zealand Police do not officially record the goods targeted in relation to burglaries and robberies, although a report from September 2016, referenced to in the New Zealand Herald in October, indicated a minimum of 490 robberies were attributable to criminals targeting tobacco products over 13 months. Police data also shows a significant increase in robberies, aggravated and otherwise, between 2014 and 2017. In 2014 there was an average of 180 robberies a month, whereas this has climbed to 229 robberies a month in 2017. According to Sunny Kaushal of the Crime Prevention Group (an organisation focused on representing the interests of dairies and convenience stores): “The Criminals appear to have taken over suburbs. On an average, this year there have been more than ten serious robberies of shop owners per week in NZ.” “The Government is going to hike the tax on cigarettes again in January. We are afraid this will only add more to the problems and put more shop owners’ and their workers’ lives in danger.”   7 UP IN SMOKE: THE SOCIAL COST OF TOBACCO EXCISE DECEMBER 2017 The previous National-led Government acknowledged that tobacco taxes were a problem in driving burglaries. In June 2017, then Minister of Police, Paula Bennett announced a total of $1.8 million in subsidies for security systems to be made available to dairy owners around the country. In total, each dairy is expected to receive $1,500 each. This only represents a tiny proportion of the revenue from tobacco excise: approximately 0.1% of the $2 billion the Government earns from tobacco excise. Responding to the policy, Mr Kaushal said: “$1.8 million was a good start, but it isn’t enough to address the situation. $1500 to a shop goes nowhere when the cost of installing effective measures like cigarette dispensers is approximately $20,000. Moreover, there are questions about its distribution and eligibility criteria, which we asked the Police authorities about, but they haven’t responded as yet.” Increasing tobacco excise is often treated as a no-brainer, but there are obvious trade-offs as demonstrated above. It’s important that the Police gather data on how tobacco may be related in burglaries and robberies so we can measure the impact of any further increases in tobacco excise. Tobacco excise increases of 10% per annum are already scheduled until 2020, although there will be significant pressure to continue the increases through to 2025. High quality data which measures the social costs of excise increases will enable a greater focus on evidence informed policy making. Farrelly MC, Nonnemaker JM, Watson KA (2012).

It causes coronary heart disease and produces a carcinogenic chemical, benzo(a)pyrene, which messes around with DNA and causes lung cancer. Of regular smokers, around seven percent will end up with lung cancer. 1 But once people know the facts, have support services made available for them to quit, and, from a taxpayers’ perspective, are covering the costs of their habit, what role is it for politicians to tell smokers that ‘we know better’? As uncovered in this report, New Zealand smokers are paying much more than their fair share in revenue for the government. According to the Ministry of Health, excise taxes on smoking far exceeds the additional costs imposed on the health system. As of 2014, tobacco excise and customs duty represented 1.4% of total government revenue. Here at the Taxpayers’ Union we are no defenders of ‘Big Tobacco’ or its lobbyists. But among our thousands of members and supporters there are people who smoke and pay considerable tax for the same. They resent politicians, officials and busy bodies treating them as cash cows and given the figures contained in this report, I don’t blame them. This is our first report on tobacco taxes. Our international equivalents have done a lot more work in this area. The Australian Taxpayers’ Alliance cites high excise taxes and plain packaging as the primary cause of Australia’s enormous illicit tobacco problem. According to KPMG around 14.5% of tobacco consumed across the Tasman is illicit – funding gangs and other criminal activity. Continued excise tax hikes risk replicating Australia’s black market tobacco problem here. As with sugar taxes, which we looked at in a report published last year, there is evidence that public health groups appear to have morphed into political campaign organisations. 2 Despite being publicly funded the groups ignore the usual quality safeguards of the scientific method and public sector neutrality. At a minimum the Government should be requiring those groups to provide the public with unbiased information and stop using taxpayer money to fund ‘sock puppetry’ – a practice where the Government funds agencies to lobby itself. 1 American Cancer Society.

Public health once meant vaccinations, sanitation and education. It was ‘public’ only in the sense that it protected people from contagious diseases carried by others. Increasingly this branch of medicine (and its funding) is used to promote the regulation of private behaviour and private property. When our health system needs every dollar it can get, money spent on television ads reminding Kiwis what we already know, we say, is money wasted. We note with sadness the unwillingness of New Zealand’s political establishment to seriously discuss John Stuart Mill’s harm principle and the morality of the government legislating to save people from themselves. More and more our members are contacting us about the sensibility (and the cost to taxpayers) of a raft of increasingly intrusive paternalist laws introduced ‘for our own good’. Sugar is now ‘addictive’, ‘toxic’ and must be banned near schools and hospitals. ‘Big Food’ is the new ‘Big Tobacco’. The anti-smoking blueprint of advertising bans, tax rises and ‘denormalisation’ provides a roadmap for action. When I was in Year Eight, my teacher, Miss Jenkins, showed our class two sets of model lungs. One, designed to demonstrate what a healthy lung looks like, the other blackened to show the effects of smoking. The graphic and disturbing models underlined a very memorable lesson drummed into all young New Zealanders: smoking is terrible for your health. Yet somehow, our Government insists on spending many millions on groups to advertise, lobby and remind us adults what we already know. Is that really the best use of the taxpayer money allocated to health? Who are these people getting the proceeds and what do they do? How much cash needs to be thrown at ‘teaching’ the effects of smoking before the government will get the message – just because you tell someone something is bad for them, doesn’t mean they’ll change their ways. 600,000 New Zealanders are choosing to smoke anyway. It is time to re-evaluate our healthcare spending priorities and direct tax dollars to where they are most needed. Front line workers like doctors and nurses should be able to find better uses for these millions than public health bureaucrats, advertising executives and lobbyists. Jordan Williams is the Executive Director of the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union Making people aware of the damage done by smoking, and letting people make an informed choice as to whether to smoke, has turned into efforts to make the decision for them. 5 Introduction Between 1983 and 2015 the percentage of smokers has been steadily falling with rates of smoking prevalence reducing by a third between 1983 and 2009. 3 Despite this trend, taxpayer funding of tobacco control continues to grow. Initially tobacco control initiatives were education campaigns, commissioned to warn the public about the damaging effects to health caused by smoking. Unfortunately, these educative campaigns have morphed into sophisticated lobbying operations for higher taxes and measures to bring about effective prohibition. Making people aware of the damage done by smoking, and letting people make an informed choice as to whether to smoke, has turned into efforts to make the decision for them. Despite decades of government advertising, some 600,000 New Zealanders still choose to consume tobacco products to varying degrees, despite the knowledge of the damaging effects. 4 In 2011 the National-led Government announced the goal of a “Smokefree New Zealand by 2025”. 5 The decision followed a Parliamentary inquiry by the Maori Affairs Select Committee into tobacco. The report of the Committee indicated that the term “smokefree” was to be regarded as achieving a rate of smoking prevalence and availability to minimal levels, but not to bring about an outright ban on the sale or consumption of tobacco products. Prohibition would outlaw the sale of tobacco and its consumption. The Government’s goal is to see effective, but not explicit, prohibition through legislative changes to increase the price, reduce the availability and complicate the retail of otherwise legal tobacco products. These measures are intended to continue until smoking prevalence drops to a point where New Zealand can be regarded as “essentially smokefree”. 6 3 The Treasury, Regulatory Impact Statement: Increase in Tobacco Excise and Equivalent Duties , 24 May 2012, page 2.

The pleasures with the slightest sniff of vice about them, including alcohol, tobacco and horse racing, have always been socially, and politically, acceptable sources of taxation revenue.” – New Zealand Official Yearbook, 1990. 6 While initially the “Smokefree New Zealand by 2025” goal was “aspirational” it is now the formal objective. Official policy advice, proposals and taxes reference the urgency imposed by the 2025 deadline. In addition to changes in public policy, government funded public health groups have used a strategy to demonise smokers. For example, in 2006 a Ministry of Health funded advertising campaign paid celebrities to state they would never date a smoker as smoking is unattractive. 7 The “Smoking – Not Our Future” campaign created a online game, Kiss Off, where players control an avatar with the aim being to find another avatar to kiss while avoiding all of the “disgusting, annoying smokers”. 8 Other campaigns have implied that smoking is inherently sinful, immoral and that smokers are of poor character and should be socially ostracised. Campaigners (including officials within the Ministry of Health) label these types of efforts as “denormalisation” of tobacco. It appears that under the guise of disseminating facts about the health trade-offs associated with tobacco consumption these groups are using public funds to promote views and a ‘cultural change’ which is entirely political in nature. These measures are nothing short of taxpayer-funded propaganda with the acknowledged purpose to stigmatise tobacco users and have them ostracised by the general public. While publicly funded groups operate “denormalisation” campaigns they also manage sophisticated, but largely closed- door, lobbying strategies to 7 Smoking Not Our Future, http://www.notourfuture.co.nz/ 8 Kiss Off: How to play, http://www.notourfuture.co.nz/kissoff 7 pressure politicians to increase taxes on tobacco and increase public funding to grow the anti-tobacco campaign organisations. This may explain the increases in funding of tobacco control despite the dramatic decrease in the percentage of New Zealanders smoking. This paper argues that New Zealand’s strategy of ‘denormalising’ tobacco, and increases in excise tax in particular, risk normalising the illicit tobacco trade. It treats legal consumers as cash cows under a misleading guise of recovering costs by the public health system. How many people are smokers? As the body of evidence, and awareness, of the negative health impacts of smoking has grown people have responded rationally. Between 1983 and 2009 the percentage of people consuming tobacco products fell by a third, from 33 percent to 19.7 percent. Smoking prevalence from 1983 to 2012 9 Data cited by the Ministry of Health tells a similar story: “In 1996/97, a quarter (25%) of the adult population reported being current smokers and by 2012/13 this rate had dropped to 18%, equating to around 600,000 people. 10 ” Because the passage draws upon percentages, the implication is that the number of smokers has decreased. However, the increase in New Zealand’s overall population has meant that while prevalence rate of smoking has decreased, the total number of smokers has been relatively constant. Nevertheless, the amount of tobacco consumed per person has decreased from its peak at 1953. 11 9 AC Nielsen & Census; Statistics New Zealand; Health Promotion Agency, Tobacco Control Data Repository, Smoking prevalence from 1983 to 2012.

A common misperception is that excise taxes on tobacco exist to offset the additional costs on the public health system for anticipated treatments costs imposed by smokers. Economists call these Pigouvian taxes: a term applied to a market activity that is generating negative externalities (costs for someone other than the person on whom the tax is imposed). In reality, New Zealand has decoupled the level of excise tax cigarettes from the additional health costs. These taxes are either being used to change behaviour (as a punitive measure against smoking), or as a revenue gathering tool for general government consumption. Smoking researchers in New Zealand and abroad find that smoking prevalence is correlated with socio-economic status, with the highest smoking prevalence seen amongst the lowest socio- economic quintiles. 12 Increases in tobacco excise tax are often held up as interventions that are effective at reducing consumption amongst low socio- economic groups. However the significant tax increases have coincided with an increase in the socio-economic smoking gradient. It appears that increases in excise taxation did not prevent smoking inequalities and have probably made them worse. 13 For reasons unknown smoking control measures, in particular the dramatic increase in tobacco taxes, have had the most effect on higher socio-economic groups. Increases in tobacco excise taxes disproportionately impact low- income earners, a group in which Maori and Pacifica are highly represented. This impact is due to a larger percentage of their disposable income being spent on products to consume such as food, housing expenses, petrol (and tobacco). It has been suggested that the counterintuitive correlation between lower socio-economic status and smoking prevalence is that financially stressed smokers are less likely to quit, while better educated people are less likely to begin smoking in the first place. 14 Just because a consumer base is poor, it does not mean that the Government is any more justified in making consumer health choices for them. Worse, increasing taxes well in excess of the health costs of tobacco, knowing that they are being paid by those least able to afford it, is morally questionable. The Government argues that increasing excise taxes is important as it is the most effective tool to reduce smoking rates. If that is really 12 Sarah Hill et al., Smoking Inequalities – Policies and patterns of tobacco use in New Zealand, 1981-1996 , University of Otago, October 2003, 9. 13 ibid. 59. 14 Christopher Snowdon, Aggressively Regressive – the ‘sin taxes’ that make the poor poorer, IEA Current Controversies Paper No. 47, Christopher Snowdon, October 2013, 16. Puritanical protection: “The main opposition to smoking, as expressed by the Anti-Nicotine Society, founded in 1883 was a social puritan view that smoking led to other vices such as drunkenness.” – Te Ara 9 the sole intention of the excises tax (and it is not also motivated by the Government’s desire for revenue) why are 600,000 Kiwis still choosing to smoke? Also, if the Government’s motives were purely health related, why would it continue to ban the sale of e-cigarettes and other nicotine based technological alternatives to smoking? Many in the public health field argue that these new generation of tobacco products and substitutes offer the greatest opportunity in harm reduction ever seen in this product category? 15 Public health studies in England have concluded that e-cigarettes have become the most popular aid to quit smoking and reduce the harm to consumers by around 95 percent when compared to traditional cigarettes. 16 How much is the tax on tobacco? Between 2000 and 2010 tobacco excise taxes were indexed to inflation. 17 Under the current National-led Government, the previous political consensus on tobacco was broken. Beginning with the first 10% excise tax increase in April 2010, the National Party, supported by the Maori Party legislated significant increases in tobacco tax. These tax increases have occurred in addition to the annual adjustments for inflation. The first increase in 2010 was followed by two subsequent 10% increases on 1 January of 2011 and on 1 January 2012. The increases resulted in prices for tobacco increasing by one third in just over two-years. 18 15 A McNeill et al, E-cigarettes: an evidence update, Public Health England , 2015, 6. 16 ibid. 45 17 Des O’Dea et al, Report on Tobacco Taxation in New Zealand, Volume 1, November 2007, 76. 18 Government increases tobacco excise tax, Stuff.co.nz, 29 April 2010, http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/3634098/Government- increases-tobacco-excise-tax 10 As of 1 January 2016, excise tax accounts for around 66 cents per cigarette. For a 20-pack of cigarettes which may retail for $20, excise tax accounts for $13.33. After adding the 15 percent GST to the total, it means for every $20 20-pack of cigarettes, the government takes $15.94. What does tobacco use cost the Government? When announcing a new round of tobacco excise increases on 24 May 2012, then-Associate Minister of Health, Tariana Turia, told media: “These measures will help improve the health of New Zealanders, reduce the long-term burden on the health system, and contribute to the Government’s goal of making New Zealand smoke-free by 2025.” 19 Ms Turia’s statement that the excise increases will “reduce the long- term burden on the health system” is curious given The Treasury’s Regulatory Impact Statement provided to the Minister to accompany the Bill. It stated: “On the narrow fiscal grounds of covering the costs smokers impose on government, further increases in tobacco excise may not be justified. At over $1.3 billion per year, tobacco excise revenues may already exceed the direct health system costs of smoking.” The passing in 2012 of the Customs and Excise (Tobacco Products – Budget Measures) Amendment Bill locked in four cumulative 10% price increases to the rate of tobacco excise, with the final scheduled for 1 January 2016. Just five days after Mrs Turia’s announcement the New Zealand Herald reported that, prior to the newly announced excise increases, smokers were already net contributors to the public purse. 20 Tobacco control lobbyists, seeking to impose higher taxes, point to figures showing that Government revenues fall as a result of the health effects of smoking. They often reference figures which factor in lost production due to smoking related health issues. O’Dea’s report, commissioned by anti-smoking campaign group Action Against Smoking (“ASH”) in 2007, established that the costs associated with tobacco consumption amounted to almost $1.7 billion. 21 This figure has been widely reported as having been the cost attributable to the taxpaying public. Dr Eric Crampton of the University of Canterbury contends that this 19 Tobacco excise rise part of wider programme, Budget 2012 Media Release, http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/tobacco-excise-rise-part- wider-programme 20 Smokers save Govt cash, says report, The New Zealand Herald, 29 May 2012, http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c\_ id=1&objectid=10809145 21 O’Dea, Report on Tobacco Taxation, 5. Excise taxes from tobacco are more than three times the costs imposed on the public health system. 11 Sinful smokers: Rodrigo de Jerez was introduced to the smoking of tobacco by Native Americans when he accompanied Columbus to the New World. Once back in Spain he was imprisoned by the Spanish Inquisition for seven years for being an unrepentant smoker. figure is mostly comprised of costs associated with individuals or private businesses bearing the majority of associated costs. 22 Even O’Dea acknowledges in his paper that excise taxes from tobacco are more than three times the costs imposed on the public health system as a result of tobacco consumption. If it is not about covering negative externalities, why is the tax increasing? Given Treasury’s 2012 advice, and the acknowledgement from tobacco control lobbyists that users are already more than covering the health costs associated with smoking, why is the Government increasing these taxes even further? The likely explanation is that the tobacco consumers are being used as cash cows – targeted by politicians to maximise revenue and fund areas of government spending completely unrelated to smoking. 22 Can’t kill a bad stat, Dr Eric Crampton, 30 April 2012, http:// offsettingbehaviour.blogspot.co.nz/2012/04/cant-kill-bad-stat.html 12 Ethics of health intervention Within the field of medical ethics, the principle of autonomy has established itself as the guiding value for any health intervention. This is why New Zealanders are able to enjoy a broad variety of legal activities that risk their health without being taxed or otherwise restricted by the state. Writing in the Journal of Medical Ethics, Feiring expressed the core underpinnings of the field of medical ethics as it pertains to public health intervention as: “Given that respect for the autonomous choices of patients runs deep in modern healthcare, there are strong reasons to value the claim that competent and well-informed individuals are the best interpreters of their own interest and that they should be free to make choices others would regard as non- beneficial to them.” 23 In determining when public health outcomes may justify over- riding the principle of autonomy, two criteria are commonly used by proponents of intervention: 1. that healthcare costs justify the intrusion; and 2. that individuals lack the capacity to choose. Neither of these conditions are satisfied. Smokers are already well covering their costs and there is no question that smokers choose to become such. Writing in the American Journal of Bioethics, Dr Michael Keane asked: What standard should be used when judging people’s competence to autonomously choose to consume a product? Electing to do something that may lead to a harmful outcome does not define a lack of understanding of the consequences. 24 Dr Keane further developed these thoughts in a submission to the Australian Government’s Public Consultation on Plain Packaging of Tobacco Products: In order to justify such proposals, it would need to be convincingly demonstrated that adult smokers to not have the capacity to understand the adverse effects of smoking. This is clearly not the case. Secondly, although some may believe the argument that smoking is due to a nicotine addiction and people, therefore, cannot make a voluntary decision, this is factually incorrect. While it may be difficult for persons to cease smoking, it is a decision that rests with the individual. All international psychiatric classifications come to the same agreement. If it was not ultimately a voluntary behaviour it would be classified as a psychotic condition. This is not the case. 23 Feiring, E. Lifestyle, responsibility and justice.

Volume 10, 2012, 37. Puritans in sheep’s clothing: Upon linking smoking to poor health outcomes in the 1940s, puritanical opposition to smoking ceased and medical opposition began. Surprisingly their messages were very similar. 13 What are the effects of excise tax increases? In advising on the 2011 Customs and Excise (Tobacco Products – Budget Measures) Amendment Bill Treasury advised that excise taxes have a diminishing effect on the decrease in consumption. 25 This indicates that the price elasticity of tobacco was already very low. The Treasury’s modelling suggested that every subsequent 10% tax increase yields a less significant decrease in consumption. Increase in tobacco excise Decrease in consumption 2013Q110%3.9% 2014Q110%3.8% 2015Q110%3.6% 2016Q110%3.5% Dr Crampton also notes that so-called sin taxes, such as the excise tax on tobacco, lead to a paradox: if excise taxes curb an addict’s consumption of tobacco, the tax is superfluous as the consumption of the product is likely to be rational in the first place. If the smoker is an irrational actor and requires help to reduce or stop their consumption, excise taxes won’t work to that end. 26 In this way excise taxes increase the financial burden on moderate, rational consumers, who will tend to reduce consumption rather than quit outright. As has previously been pointed out, tobacco consumption per person peaked over 50 years ago and has declined significantly since. 25 Page 7. 26 “Elasticity of sin,” Dr Eric Crampton, 15 July 2009, http:// offsettingbehaviour.blogspot.co.nz/2009/07/elasticity-of-sin.html 14 Illicit tobacco Excessive excise taxes create markets for illicit tobacco. In Australia, the Federal Government’s Crime Commission stated that organised crime was “entrenched” within the illegal tobacco market in Australia, which criminals perceive to be a low risk, high profit industry. 27 Illicit tobacco is now the fourth largest source of product when measured against the market share of tobacco companies. Here in New Zealand, we need to be aware that as the price of legal tobacco products increases, the potential price margins for criminal gangs dealing in illicit tobacco become attractive. The Treasury has already warned the Government that increasing tobacco excise creates a risk for shop owners, who may be more highly targeted for burglaries. 28 Illicit products are generally of a lower quality, are less safe and seldom conform to Government regulations. Illicit cigarettes are produced in illegal factories, often in squalid conditions. Experience from the UK indicates that illicit tobacco products can contain rat droppings, mould and even asbestos. 29 Illicit tobacco takes three forms: • Unbranded – crude tobacco sold as loose leaves or in tubes; • Counterfeit – copies of a legal tobacco product, using a registered trademark without permission and sold at a much lower price than the legal product upon which it is modelled; and • Contraband – tobacco products that are legal or counterfeit, which have been imported illegally and sold without the payment of the required duties. 30 Illicit tobacco consumption in Australia accounted for 14.5 percent of the country’s total tobacco consumption in 2014. 31 This tobacco was a combination of counterfeit, contraband and unbranded tobacco, which is estimated to be about 2.6 million kilograms. 27 Australian Crime Commission, Organised Crime in Australia 2015 Report , 2015, 68. 28 The Treasury, Regulatory Impact Statement: Customs and Excise (Tobacco Products – Budget Measures) Amendment Bill. 29 New effort to stop fake cigarettes filled with excrement, mould and asbestos, The Guardian, 23 August 2014, http://www.theguardian.com/ society/2014/aug/23/councils-crack-down-fake-cigarettes-excrement- mould-asbestos 30 ibid. 31 KPMG, Illicit tobacco in Australia 2014 Full Year Report, 30 March 2015, 6.

For their part, the Government provides funding for the activists and the cycle continues anew. Who is behind the push for tobacco tax increases? Tobacco control lobbyists have been pushing for substantial excise increases for many years. Many of these lobbyists are fully, or partially funded by the Government. In a bizarre spectacle, the Government provides money from taxpayers to fund lobbyists, who then lobby to guide the Government’s hand towards increasing the tax burden. Tobacco control lobbyists enable government to justify increasing taxes on New Zealanders. For their part, governments provide funding for the activists and the cycle continues anew. In the 2013/14 financial year, ASH recorded revenue of over $1 million, with almost $980,000 of that coming from contracts with public sector institutions. ASH has seen an increase in its government contract income by $350,000 from 2012/13 into 2013/14. The lobby group notes that it gained a “significant contract” in June 2013 to run a stop-smoking campaign each October. 32 Despite being a pressure group that is overwhelmingly funded by taxpayer money, ASH is also regarded as a charity. Given this status, the group is not required to pay income tax, nor are its activities subject to public scrutiny through the Official Information Act. In March ASH featured on the front page of the New Zealand Herald under the headline: Pressure to bring in tobacco plain-packaging. 33 The article began: Beehive urged to hurry final vote by MPs following success of measure in Australia. The Government is being lobbied to bring the tobacco plain- packaging bill back to Parliament for a final vote, now the policy has been found to work “almost like a vaccine against tobacco” in Australia. The health select committee last year supported the bill but the Government has delayed bringing it back to the House pending the outcome of the challenges against the Australian law by the tobacco industry. But National support partner the Maori Party and lobby group Action on Smoking on Health (Ash) now say the decline in smoking seen in Australia since its “standardised” packaging law came into force in 2013 means New Zealand can dally no longer. 32 ASH New Zealand Incorporated, 2014 Financial Statements, Charities Services, https://www.register.charities.govt.nz/ CharitiesRegister/ViewCharity?accountId=af8ebad6-462c-dd11-8f7f- 0015c5f3da29&searchId=8ef063e5-7563-4bce-ab45-fe6618304411 33 Pressure to bring in tobacco plain-packaging, New Zealand Herald, 2 March 2015, http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c\_ id=3&objectid=11410127 16 The statement attributed to ASH, show the problems with taxpayer money being directed to a group lacking the usual safeguards of political independence and transparency. Far from Plain Packaging of tobacco products “acting like a vaccine”, there is in fact compelling evidence that sales went up in the first year after the introduction of the measure in Australia. 34 Data released by the Australian Treasury suggests that 21,901,393,720 cigarettes were sold in Australian in the twelve months before plain packaging was introduced. In the next twelve months, 22,016,130,420 cigarettes were sold. This is a rise – a small rise but a remarkable one considering that sales had been consistently falling by around five percent per year for many years before the policy was introduced. At the time, the Taxpayers’ Union reacted strongly, calling on the Government to “stamp out” this sort of taxpayer funded lobbying: The Taxpayers’ Union believes that questions need to asked about why a lobby group, working with the Maori Party on a political campaign around tobacco plain packaging, is largely taxpayer funded. We made the distinction between services for taxpayers, and services to ‘lobby’ them: “We all support funding for front line and addiction services such as Quitline. What we don’t support is funding to political organisations to operate campaigns with taxpayer money.” “Here a taxpayer funded group is working with a political party to promote one of its key policies. If the shoe was on the other foot and the Government was funding property groups to campaign for RMA reform, the Maori Party would be justifiably outraged. This is no different.” “Taxpayer funded lobbying undermines democracy and should be stamped out.” In a March 2015 editorial, the Waikato Times picked up on the Maori Party and ASH working together and quoted the Taxpayers’ Union argument. It concluded: A thorough Government review of the extent of political lobbying with public funding is long overdue. 35 The Health Promotion Agency receives around $30 million dollars per year in taxpayer money for health promotion, including for tobacco control. 36 Like ASH, it interprets “Smokefree New Zealand by 2025”, literally, rather as an aspirational goal as initially envisioned. 37 34 Chrstopher Snowdon, New data confirm that tobacco sales rose after plain packaging , http://velvetgloveironfist.blogspot.co.uk/2015/08/new- data-confirm-that-tobacco-sales.html 35 Should we pay lobbyists?, Waikato Times, 4 March, 2015, http://www. stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/opinion/66910631/should-we-pay-lobbyists 36 Health Promotion Agency, Annual Report for the year ended 30 June 2015, 49. 37 ibid, 18. Questions need to asked about why a lobby group, working with the Maori Party on a political campaign around tobacco plain packaging, is largely taxpayer funded. 17 The taxpayer funded lobbying “Sock Puppet” process Government funds lobbyists Lobbyists influence the governement to increase excise taxes Taxpayers pay more for tobacco Revenue from taxpayers goes to the government 18 Recommendations Our recommendations are: 1. A moratorium on tobacco tax increases until reviews can be undertaken on: • the risks of an Australian style illicit tobacco problem developing in New Zealand; and • the potential harm reduction in lifting New Zealand’s blanket ban on the sale of e-cigarettes and other new generation tobacco products. 2. An independent review of Ministry of Health funding of tobacco lobby groups to ensure that taxpayers are receiving value for money. 3. Extending the Official Information Act to cover those not for profit organisations which are majority taxpayer funded. 19 Conclusion The Government should stop pretending that excise taxes on tobacco are anything other than a money grab. Smokers are more than covering their costs to the health system and pretending that consumers are not able to make their own decisions makes a mockery of the rights of citizens to make their own health choices. Few, if any, New Zealanders are not aware of the dangers of smoking. Every year millions of taxpayers’ dollars are awarded to anti-smoking lobby groups for the apparent purpose of reminding us what we already know. In reality, this money isn’t being used for education. It’s being used to stigmatise those who choose to smoke, and mount political pressure on politicians to tax more and provide even more money to the groups. New Zealand’s approach to smoking cessation is out of step with leading tobacco researchers. With a blanket ban on the sale of e-cigarettes, New Zealand is missing an opportunity to provide a 95% safer alternative to traditional tobacco smoking that is now the number one cessation tool for smokers in England. Those who smoke out of choice and enjoyment should not face further tax increases. As rational consumers of a legal product, taxes should be levied only to offset the negative externalities incurred as a result of their smoking. Rather than simply covering additional health costs, smokers are being treated as cash cows by the government. 20 www.taxpayers.org.nz

Horticulture New Zealand (“HortNZ”) appreciates the opportunity to make a submission to the Tax Working Group (“Tax WG”) on the Future of Tax Submissions Background paper. HortNZ are to conduct a short grower survey and ask to be able to present the results in person to the Tax Working Group along with our submission. The survey will be completed during May 2018. In making this submission reliance is placed on the attached NZIER report titled Taxing Times completed in March 2018. 2. This submission is endorsed and supported by the following named organisations: • Ettrick Fruit Growers Association Incorporated • Hawkes Bay Fruitgrowers Association Incorporated • Hawkes Bay Vegetable Growers Association Incorporated • Katikati Fruitgrowers Association Incorporated • New Zealand Apples & Pears Incorporated • New Zealand Buttercup Squash Council Incorporated • New Zealand Kiwifruit Growers Incorporated • New Zealand Passionfruit Growers Association Incorporated • Onions New Zealand Incorporated • Potatoes New Zealand Incorporated • Process Vegetable New Zealand Incorporated • Strawberry Growers New Zealand Incorporated • Summerfruit New Zealand Incorporated • Te Puke Fruitgrowers Association Incorporated • Tomatoes New Zealand Incorporated • Vegetables New Zealand Incorporated • Beef + Lamb New Zealand Limited 3. We have read and support the submissions made by: • Dairy New Zealand Limited • Federated Farmers of New Zealand Incorporated • Irrigation New Zealand Incorporated \[1\] 4. There are 5,000 commercial fruit, vegetable and berry fruit growers in New Zealand who employ over 60,000 workers. Due to the seasonal nature of horticulture our workers are a mixture of permanent and seasonal workers with many seasonal workers progressing to full time positions after a few seasons work and training. The growers in the industry are mostly small to medium sized businesses with a few larger corporates in some sectors. Therefore changes to tax law can have a dramatic effect on these businesses ability to remain profitable and continue to offer job opportunities to New Zealanders. Horticulture is therefore a significant employer and a key factor in the maintenance of provincial New Zealand’s cultural and social character. Principles 5. We believe that the principles upon which the tax system is based are an important starting point and central to the design of that system. The principles identified by the Tax WG are: • Efficiency where impediments to growth and distortions are avoided. • Equity and fairness including procedural fairness. • Revenue integrity minimising tax avoidance and arbitrage. • Fiscally raising enough funds for the Government’s requirements. • Minimised compliance and administration cost and give certainty to the taxpayer. • Coherence so that the individual reforms make sense in the context of the entire tax system. 6. We submit that these principles are appropriate and have stood the test of time. Therefore there is no reason to add or delete principles. But encapsulated within these principles are some core issues that are paramount to an efficient and effective tax system. In particular what is meant by equity and fairness and how the coherence of the entire tax system encourages compliance. There are many differences between individual and business tax payers and between the types of businesses including those in the primary sector. Out of this comes two important sub-principles in our submission: compliance costs being equal for small and large businesses and all tax payers being treated in the same way as further explained in the attached NZIER report at paragraph 1.3. We believe that all tax payers should have the same taxes and the same tax regime applied to them and that, no matter how big or small their operation, meeting the requirements of the tax system can be readily and cost effectively achieved. We are of the view that one category of tax payer should not be singled out and taxed in ways that all tax payers are not. Core Questions 7. In the following paragraphs, HortNZ will submit comments on each of the four core questions that the Tax WG asked. Does the current tax system operate fairly? 8. We believe that the current tax system has served and is serving New Zealand well. We do not believe that the Submissions Background Paper makes out a case for substantive change away from the current broad-based and low rate structure. We do however submit that there should be one comprehensive tax system that accounts for all taxes that businesses and individuals are subject to. We are therefore opposed to additional taxes outside of the core tax system such as the proposed fuel tax. Does the tax system have the right balance between production and speculation? 9. We believe that the critical advantage of the current tax system is that it uses the total economic income of individuals and organisations as the unit of comparison. We submit that to change that focus to what the source of that income is, and from what sort of assets that income has been generated, will not only make the tax system more complex but it will create unintended and uneven consequences. The progressive increasing rate of taxation provides the requisite fairness - the more you earn the more you pay. We do submit however that taxation of companies and trusts should be done on the same progressive basis. This is because in the rural sector many of the businesses are intergenerational family businesses that use trusts as their business structure. Unless both companies and trusts are taxed on the same progressive basis unfairness results and there is an inherent distortion in the overall tax system. Are there changes that could be made to the tax system to make it more fair, balanced and efficient? 10. We believe that any case for change will need to be carefully made out and needs to be based on the principles described earlier in this submission. While there may be some easy targets for increased and specific taxation it is our submission that land-based sectors should not be regarded as an “easy target” to bear a greater tax burden because they fit within the traditional scope of the income tax (producing goods from fixed locations). 11. We repeat our submission from above that taxes on companies and trusts should be levied on the same basis. 12. Local government in New Zealand currently uses land as the basis of tax, via rates, raising over $5 billion in revenue in the year ended 30 June 2016. In addition we submit that any introduction of central government land taxes needs to take account of the existing burden of rates imposed both by regional and central government and across all types of taxation, for example fuel and roading taxes. Could changes support the integrity of the income tax system? 13. We believe that overall, the current tax system serves New Zealand well. The case for radical change away from a broad-base, low rate structure has not been made and in our view would require considerable empirical evidence in support. We believe that the best way to address income inequality is to increase incomes (both pre-tax and transfer) at the bottom of the scale, not further increase taxes at the top. We submit that a tax system that promotes employment is therefore one of the best contributions the Government can make to addressing income inequality. 14. We also submit that using the tax system to drive behavioural changes first would need vigorous and careful analysis. The tax system should not be used to achieve outcomes outside of the core principles discussed above. We submit that using the tax system to create housing affordability, to reduce the cost of productive land and to drive environmental outcomes, is asking too much of the tax system and will result in distortions and create further unintended consequences. 1 Land Tax 15. As noted in paragraph 10, local government in New Zealand already imposes land tax on ratepayers to fund their operations. We therefore believe that any additional taxation on land first needs to take into account that existing taxation base. 16. The value of land that is used for primary production is the key ingredient for the lending of money to support that economic enterprise. Any reduction in the value of land will quickly translate into less funding being available to support growth and the financial viability of the enterprise. For that reason alone, we submit that a tax 1 This submission point is informed by the NZIER report “Taxing Times: Assessing proposed taxes on the primary sector,” March 2018, paras 2.2 – 2.4. on land will have a counterproductive effect that will reduce that overall taxation received by the Government. 17. If a land tax were to be introduced, then other taxation methods such as company and particularly trust tax would need to be greatly reduced and somehow equity maintained between those businesses with little or no land and those that rely on the land for their production. We also believe that there would need to be a very carefully managed transition to a land tax so as to avoid inequities. Environmental Tax 18. At this time it is difficult to put forward a submission on the possibility of an environmental tax as the detail of how it would operate, what is to be achieved by it and how it may be used have not been provided. It is doubtful that the tax will continue to be applied solely for the purposes it was introduced for as over time it is likely it will be used for other purposes. We refer to the NZIER report noting that their summary of assessment 2 shows that taxes of this nature do not meet the taxation principles. We submit that there should be no environmental taxation proposed by the Tax WG as it does not meet these principles. Progressive Company and Trust Tax 19. We support any measures that assist small businesses, including primary production, which lowers compliance costs or through lower tax rates through the tax system. In addition, what is regarded as a small business needs to be reassessed as many primary producers (although classed small business) have large turnovers but small margins when compared with other businesses. Alternatively we submit that all businesses, be they small or large, should reap the benefits of simplicity, reduced compliance costs and lower tax rates. As noted above this will drive growth and employment, increase the collection of other taxes and promote New Zealand’s economic prosperity. 20. Seasonal workers are a key component for successful horticultural production providing the extra labour needed for harvest and pruning. These are not permanent positions and in some cases employment may only last for a few weeks. We submit that determining whether a business is a small to medium sized enterprise (SME) should not, for horticulture, be based on full time equivalent employees (FTEs). This is because it is very difficult to determine how many FTEs there are in our businesses. Turnover is a preferable and more readily available measure provided its cut off point is set at a high enough level to accommodate our businesses. The survey we are to run will provide some empirical data to support this submission. Minimising Business Costs 21. We refer to the BusinessNZ and Deloitte tax survey of May 2017. 3 This survey developed 10 central themes that are in general supported by this submission, with a particular emphasis on: creating long term tax certainty, maintaining an internationally competitive rate (as New Zealand relies heavily on exports for its fi nancial viability and has the disadvantage of being a considerable distance from its offshore markets); encouraging research and development (as that is how New Zealand maintains its competitive advantage); and putting New Zealand’s interests first. To this end we believe tax credits for research and development need to be considered in terms of the overall tax system. GST exemptions for particular goods 2 2.1, Table 1 of NZIER report – Taxing times 3 https://www.businessnz.org.nz/\_\_data/assets/pdf\_file/0010/129187/170816-Major-companies-tax- survey-2017.pdf 22. We believe that the no exemptions policy for GST has created a fair and robust system of taxation. Removal of GST on categories of goods, such as fresh fruit and vegetables, however does have the advantage of promoting healthy eating and reducing the cost of diseases associated with different diets. Our membership is split on their support for such a proposal for the reasons noted above and we will survey members to ascertain their support for such a proposal. We believe that this option should be considered during the tax review but that any change should be based on the tax principles. 23. We believe, in line with the Business NZ submission, that of all of the various options for raising revenue and ensuring cost neutrality, increasing the GST rate should be viewed as a primary mechanism. Not only does GST reduce the taxation bias against savings and investment, it also means that any changes made are part of the existing tax structure, with no need to create another level of complexity in the system. Opportunity for Further Submissions 24. We acknowledge that this is the first step in this comprehensive review of New Zealand’s taxation system. We therefore ask for further opportunity to comment both in writing and in person. Mike Chapman Chief Executive Horticulture New Zealand ENDS

We look forward to engaging with the Working Group further on issues raised in our submission. If you wish to discuss any aspect of this submission please contact myself on or AN Z touches the lives of almost every New Zealander ANZ is one of New Zealand’s largest companies based on profit and assets. With this scale comes responsibility and we take that responsibility seriously. From individuals and family, to the farms and small businesses that are the life blood of our economy, to our largest institutions and corporations, we play a key part in helping New Zealanders achieve their financial aspirations. Our breadth and diversity is reflected in our people. We employ over 8,000 people throughout New Zealand. They come from a wide range of backgrounds, skills and specialisations and we value the richness that diversity brings to our business. ANZ is the largest financial institution in New Zealand. The ANZ group comprises brands such as ANZ, UDC Finance, ANZ Investments, ANZ New Zealand Securities, and Bonus Bonds. ANZ offers a full range of financial products and services including a significant range of financial advisory services, personal banking, institutional banking and wealth management services. ANZ Investments is New Zealand’s largest fund manager and manages over $25 billion for over 745,000 investors. It is also New Zealand’s largest and most-awarded KiwiSaver manager, with one in four New Zealanders in KiwiSaver investing their retirement savings with us. ANZ Investments is also one of the nine default KiwiSaver managers appointed by the government in 2014. \[1\]\[1\] A long-term focus on financial well-being ANZ believes that the Tax Working Group should focus not just on the current challenges New Zealand faces, but also on the economic environment of New Zealand beyond the next decade. When considering long term and inter-generational issues, the Living Standards Framework is a valuable lens for assessing tax policy, especially for our social capital. ANZ commits to improving the financial wellbeing of our people, customers and communities by equipping them to be more in control of their money throughout their lives. This means not only their present-day financial situation, but also their ability to achieve financial goals, to have meaningful choices about their future and to be financially stable in the long run. This affects not only our customers and employees but our whole community. Our submission primarily centres on the taxation of private savings but also briefly covers taxation in light of the changing dynamics of the future labour force. We cover these points briefly below and expand on them in the attached annexes. More support for private savings is essential In our view: • New Zealand has a private savings problem. New Zealanders do not save enough to finance their lifestyle and provide for future financial stability. • New Zealand does not currently have the correct balance between incentivising individuals to save for themselves and accumulating public savings to provide for those who are unable to save for themselves. We acknowledge any actions need to take account of the fiscal impact of any tax revenue spent or lost on encouraging private savings. • There is a case to shift New Zealand’s taxation policy away from its current TTE model (Tax – Tax – Exempt) towards a ttE model (tax – tax – Exempt). Taxes on individual savings accumulate to high rates over long periods of time, particularly when compared to other forms of investment such as owner-occupied or residential investment property. • To encourage long-term savings it may also be beneficial to shift towards a model which focuses more on taxing expenditure rather than income. • New Zealand currently has some concessionary treatment for gains made from savings (the middle T) but ANZ would like to see rates lowered further as this is where individuals can increase their savings the most over time. • The successful take-up of KiwiSaver shows encouragement is required to ensure that people act in their own long-term best interest. Taxation can provide that encouragement mechanism to change how people save and invest. • As a result, ANZ specifically supports focussed policies which would encourage long-term savings including: - Lower taxation of investment income for savings vehicles; - Special savings incentives for low income households particularly focussed on encouraging greater KiwiSaver contributions; and - Targeted compulsory KiwiSaver membership (ANZ recognises that there are New Zealanders who are not in a financial position to contribute to KiwiSaver without detrimental effect to their current wellbeing, which is why we would 2 only support KiwiSaver being compulsory for those over a certain income threshold, but also support other initiatives to assist those who struggle to financially support retirement savings). • ANZ understands that more work will be needed into the exact design of any measures arising to increase private savings and we would be happy to share further thoughts on these or any other areas. Different means to achieve private savings goals are possible. Overall, we support recommendations of the Tax Working Group that encourage greater private savings and diversification of investments. Changing work environment and tax obligations ANZ recognises that the development of technology and work flexibility is changing the nature of the work environment and, consequently, the labour force. As these working environments change so too will the need for management and compliance with tax obligations. ANZ sees a key role for banks to play in this future world, working alongside other innovators and Inland Revenue to collaboratively develop simple solutions to promote greater compliance with tax affairs for this changing work environment. Conclusion The Tax Working Group has a huge mandate. Your kaitiakitanga function as stewards and guardians of our tax system for future generations is vital. ANZ welcomes ongoing interaction with the Tax Working Group as your work develops, including making an oral submission to the Working Group. Yours sincerely Philip Leath General Manager Tax – New Zealand 3 \[1\] Annex 1: Private Savings 1.1. New Zealand has a private savings problem A financial well-being survey conducted by ANZ found that nearly a quarter of New Zealanders have no cash savings and only 23% of New Zealanders surveyed said they have no financial worries. i In New Zealand’s current climate this is extremely concerning. • Affordability: The current Government is committed to retaining universal superannuation over the age of 65. However, there are questions as to whether this will remain affordable over the very long-term. The New Zealand Superannuation Fund will cover only a small percentage of our future superannuation costs. Increasingly it appears realistic to assume there will be at least some expectation on New Zealanders to provide for their own retirement, particularly for those reaching retirement in the medium to long term. Most New Zealanders will need more private savings to support themselves in their retirement. • Lower socio-economic communities: Looking at financial well-being across our society, those in low socio-economic communities are less likely to have significant savings. These individuals are often unable to save because they have an immediate need for all of their available funds. However, we are concerned that our current regime, which does not provide the necessary support to save, is not preparing people for their future and long-term needs. ANZ believes that we need to adopt measures which specifically target these communities and provide incentives specifically for them to save more. • Macro-economic benefits: Private savings are also important from a macroeconomic perspective. Generally savings are reinvested in the economy in some form, meaning that capital is directed into areas where it is needed and can be most productive. Moreover, private savings levels are important because it means New Zealand is less reliant on foreign capital and this insulates the New Zealand economy from the full force of international shocks. 1.2. New Zealand needs to find the correct balance between private and public savings Ideally our private / public savings system should be sustainable, with public, private and voluntary pillars. Given New Zealand’s current situation it appears a sustainable system should encourage long-term private savings where possible but also have sufficient public savings to recognise some individuals have no or limited capacity to save and will be reliant on the government to provide for them. A recent study commissioned by New Zealand’s Financial Services Council found that nearly all older New Zealanders will be living on the New Zealand Superannuation pension alone after just 10 years. ii • Upfront fiscal cost: We acknowledge that many methods to encourage private savings (including those we support) have a fiscal cost, either in terms of less tax revenue collected or in real expenditure. This fiscal cost would be most significant in the short term. However, as savings behaviours change, the resulting build-up of funds put to productive use, including generating tax revenue, should offset this short term cost. 4 • Long-term fiscal savings: Further, in the long term it is likely that the fiscal cost would be offset by a lower need for public expenditure later on. Individuals with greater private savings are less likely to be reliant on government support, particularly in retirement. Moreover incentives to encourage saving have an effect on changing behaviours and habits. This means that over-time people are likely to save more than the incentive requires, as a result of a shift in the culture around saving. • Least regrets approach: A policy which favours private savings is justified on a ‘least regrets’ basis, as even if it does not achieve all its savings targets, it is the option available to New Zealand with the smallest downside. 1.3. The case for tax changes New Zealand’s current tax system is uniquely biased against long-term savings. • Globally unusual approach: New Zealand is unusual globally, in applying a TTE model to all retirement savings, whereas, most other countries internationally employ either a ttE or EET model. ANZ agrees with the Savings Working Group Report iii released in 2010 which considered that a shift away from a fully-taxed TTE model would have benefits for savings in New Zealand. • Multiple layers of tax discourage saving: Under the TTE model savings are effectively taxed three times – firstly when it is originally earned (first T) and secondly taxed on any returns from savings (second T). For long-term savings this gain is partly due to inflation, but is taxed as a nominal gain regardless. The savings are not subject to tax when they are withdrawn (E), but they are subject to GST when they are spent. This encourages people to spend more immediately rather than save long term, as if they spend money immediately it is only taxed when it is earned and when it is spent. • Housing relatively tax-preferred: The gap in the taxation of capital, particularly in favouring the residential housing market also encourages people towards investment in their family home or in investment property rather than other forms of savings. • Work towards ttE: Tax changes can have significant compliance implications, requiring major changes to financial systems. Structural changes to tax treatments (e.g., from TTE to TEE or EET) are not ANZ’s preferred approach. There are several ways in which incentives for private savings can be provided within the current framework. 1.4. KiwiSaver appears to be the cornerstone In terms of take-up, KiwiSaver has been a stunning success. Yet, despite an impressive 2.7 million members and over $40 billion in funds under management iv , we still have the lowest rate of retirement savings in the OECD v and a long way to go to ensure New Zealanders will live comfortably in retirement. We acknowledge some savings within KiwiSaver are in effect substituting other forms of saving which would have occurred in any event. This does not undermine the case for KiwiSaver: saving for retirement in a well-run diversified scheme is a more attractive model than many other options. 5 • Young people favour KiwiSaver: KiwiSaver is becoming a cornerstone for New Zealanders’ savings. More and more young people are starting to feel comfortable with KiwiSaver, have more trust in the industry and see KiwiSaver as the way they will fund both their home and their retirement. This means that getting the right KiwiSaver tax regime, without overcomplicating the system, will become increasingly important for the younger generation. • Ongoing government incentives: So long as KiwiSaver membership and contributions remain voluntary, retaining the existing incentives is necessary to maintain trust in KiwiSaver and ensure its success. • Increasing contributions to KiwiSaver: ANZ supports raising KiwiSaver contribution levels in small but consistent steps (e.g., half a percent per annum) towards a level more comparable to schemes operating in other parts of the world. There should be an option for members’ individual employee contributions to automatically increase by small increments up to a capped maximum rate, so that members can feel confident their savings will increase over time. ANZ cautions that too much tinkering won't help keep confidence in the scheme in the right way, but the right kind of tinkering that gives people the flexibility to be able to save through KiwiSaver to meet their retirement savings goals is encouraged. 1.5. Taxation of contributions to savings There are a number of policy changes which could be implemented to reduce the effective taxation rate applied to earnings that are contributed to long-term savings (i.e. a move from T to t). Arguably, this increases the incentive for individuals to save because if the money is saved rather than spent, they pay less tax on the savings amount. Even if this does not encourage people to save more in net terms, this does encourage a shift away from investment in the housing market and into more diversified investment products. Possible considerations for moving towards a smaller ‘first t’: 1. Reducing the tax rate on contributions to long term savings. 2. Reducing the rate of Employer Superannuation Contributions tax (ESCT) applying to employer contributions to KiwiSaver. 3. Targeted encouragement for lower income earners. These measures have more specific aims – i.e. increasing the percentage of income saved by low-income earners. These mechanisms specifically avoid the issue identified above – i.e. that people may not save more in aggregate, but may just switch between different types of investments. The fiscal cost of these targeted measures would also be less. However, more importantly these types of measures recognise that there is a specific savings problem amongst lower socio-economic communities and provide solutions specifically designed to address this issue. Possible ways of increasing savings for these vulnerable groups could include: 6 i. Reducing the rate of tax on savings contributions over a certain portion of income (for example if a person saves over 8% of their income that savings is taxed at a reduced rate); ii. Reducing the rate of tax on contributions to long-term savings specifically for low- income earners. 1.6. Taxation of income and gains from savings Moving towards a smaller ‘middle t’: • Maximum impact: Adjustments to the taxation of gains on savings would likely have the biggest impact on net amounts of savings overall. • Existing ‘middle t’: ANZ recognises that New Zealand does already have some concessionary taxation settings savings but we believe that there is further scope for concessionary tax treatment. In particular if a capital gains tax were to be introduced we would support an exemption or concession for gains on certain types of savings. ANZ supports the following policies to reduce the taxation of income and gains from savings: 1. Only taxing a portion of the income and investment gains on savings; 2. Greater concessionary treatment for long-term investment vehicles such as portfolio investment entities (“PIEs”). This could include reducing the prescribed investor rates (“PIR”) available, increasing the taxable income bands for lower PIR and reducing the PIR default rate from 28%. The majority of KiwiSaver funds in New Zealand are invested in PIEs and therefore a change to the taxation of PIE income would have a significant impact for many people. In particular, reduction of tax rates for PIEs could be targeted to those on lower incomes, e.g. reducing or removing PIR on the lowest taxable income bands. Overall, moving from TTE to ttE increases the overall amount of money people have available to save and increases the value of those savings, increasing both the incentive to save and the benefit from saving. 1.7. Making KiwiSaver compulsory Whether to move KiwiSaver towards compulsion has been under discussion for the last decade. ANZ believes KiwiSaver membership should be compulsory in a targeted way, in recognition of its role as the third pillar of New Zealand’s retirement savings framework. In the absence of compulsory membership, all those not currently enrolled in KiwiSaver should be automatically enrolled (with an opt-out provision) to capture those who are self-employed, contractors or unemployed. Rationale supporting this recommendation: • Public support: Research commissioned by ANZ, and conducted by UMR, showed that 60% of respondents say it should be compulsory to join. Of those who said joining should be compulsory, 88% also thought it should be compulsory to contribute if you are earning an income. Of the total population, 53% think 7 contributing should be compulsory. vi ANZ recognises that there are some people who are not in a financial position to contribute to KiwiSaver without a detrimental effect to their current wellbeing. This is why we would only support KiwiSaver membership being compulsory for those over a certain income threshold (e.g. some proportion relative to the median household or individual income). • Overcoming cognitive bias: Behavioural observations suggest encouragement is a requirement to ensure people act in their own long-term best interests. Most people suffer from short term bias. They prioritise their current needs and desires over the long term needs. They have overconfidence as to their future financial position, assuming that they will continue to be able to work, will have good health or will change their behaviours and save later on. People also discount the amount of savings they will need in retirement and don’t make realistic estimates of how much they need to save now in order to fund their future lifestyle. • Cultural shift: New Zealanders also need a shift in the culture around retirement savings. Compulsory KiwiSaver membership would shift the way people think about retirement savings and savings in general. Prior to KiwiSaver’s introduction, only 15% of the New Zealand workforce was enrolled in a workplace savings scheme. Now, there are 2.8 million members, and more than 75% of 18-64-year- olds are enrolled. vii • Signalling government support of additional voluntary savings: Positive saving habits mean people are more likely to recognise the long-term benefits of savings and, over time, voluntarily contribute more to their savings. This also means that there needs to be sufficient Government support for the KiwiSaver scheme. We note the change in enrolment numbers following the withdrawal of the kick-start benefit and loss of confidence in the scheme following changes to the member tax credit structure. If KiwiSaver membership and contributions were to remain voluntary, government incentives are crucial to get people to opt into the system and to continue to make contributions. As such, we caution against the removal of existing incentives in the current environment. However, if KiwiSaver were to become compulsory these could be retained or the incentives modified to encourage greater levels of contributions or benefit lower income earners. In addition, ANZ believes that KiwiSaver members under the age of 18 or over the age of 65 who are working and contributing should be entitled to the same benefits as other members, including the Government’s annual member tax credit and employer contributions. This encourages people to join KiwiSaver at a young age and to form good savings habits early and maintain these throughout their working life. 1.8. Tax treatment for investment in PIEs under a capital gains tax If New Zealand were to introduce a capital gains tax (CGT) ANZ believes that it should be designed to retain current concessionary treatment for gains made by PIEs, as part of encouraging retirement savings. In particular, the current tax exemption relating to capital gains on Australasian shares should be retained for all PIEs and extended to cover Global share gains. • PIEs are established savings vehicle: PIEs (and other similar investment vehicles) in particular, should be supported because they are a proven success in savings management. Professional fund managers have investment knowledge and financial literacy and can be held accountable for their decisions by investors. 8 Even where investors are financially literate enough to make sound investment decisions, they often prefer to invest in managed funds because they may not want to take the time and effort to make their own investment decisions. • Encouraging diversification: Although it does not guarantee against loss, diversification is the most important component of reaching long-range financial goals while minimising risk. Professional fund managers are more likely to invest in a diverse range of risk investments. The collective structure of a fund means that the fund manager is able to offset the overall risk to the fund with a mixture of different risk investments. Where an investment does not have the expected return, the collective nature of the investment vehicle means that individual investors are insulated from the full financial loss. • Balanced approach to risk: Individual investors are more likely to favour low or medium risk investments. Historically, New Zealanders have favoured property and, currently, 21% of all New Zealanders in KiwiSaver are in conservative funds, indicating that New Zealanders tend to be quite risk averse. viii However, from a macroeconomic perspective investment needs to be encouraged in a variety of different sectors and in variety of different risk type activities. 1.9. Inflation and Indexation Taxing nominal gains is an issue, especially in a low interest rate environment. In theory, tax should only be levied on real gains, not nominal gains so there is no taxation of gains which are solely attributable to inflation. • Indexation is too complex: This theoretical approach would suggest an indexation system, which has the benefit of removing the current detriment of inflation on long term investments / savings. Unfortunately, indexation is highly complex from a compliance perspective and has generally failed when applied to overseas CGTs. • Tapering: Instead, we suggest further investigation of a tapering approach as an approximation to inflation. Tapering is commonly applied in the CGT context, but many of the transactions subject to CGT overseas are within the scope of New Zealand’s income tax. Gains on share sales, options and many other financial transactions are all examples. • Approximating inflation: Taper systems can come in many forms, with overseas examples often appearing generous when compared to the inflationary component of a gain. An option approximating to inflation could be to design a taper system with a scale of different rates. For example, an asset held for five years might qualify for say a 10% discount CGT rate and an asset held for 10 years might qualify for say a 25% discount CGT rate. This would allow the taper to more accurately reflect the trend of inflation over time. The taper could be periodically reset approximating to inflation outturns over the holding period. 9 Annex 2: The changing nature of the working world ANZ recognises that the world is changing fast. The development of technology together with an increasing awareness by employers of work flexibility is changing how the labour force completes their tasks for New Zealand, and overseas, business. Such changes include the increase of contractors engaging with business in New Zealand (as opposed to the more traditional employee/ employer model) resulting in micro-business models. ANZ acknowledges that as working environments change so too will the need for management and compliance with tax obligations. This is particularly pertinent for New Zealand’s voluntary tax system where a younger generational set may have had very little connection to the New Zealand tax system. However, the obligation to comply with tax obligations remains a fundamental pillar of our society. ANZ is committed to meeting the needs of our customers and employees as their needs change and develop. However, ensuring tax obligations are complied with in a changing work environment requires a multi-faceted solution. • Flexibility: As the working environment changes we envisage that the tax system will have to become more flexible to deal with the different variety of working situations such as the gig economy and other innovative working arrangements. • Role for banks: ANZ sees a key role for banks to play in the future world, working alongside other innovators. ANZ has been simplifying its product suite to better meet the needs of the mass market in New Zealand. With the growth of accounting and tax technology innovators (such as Xero and MYOB) we consider their skill set may be best placed to ensure greater compliance of tax obligations in the changing work environment through partnership with Banks, rather than Banks becoming tax technology innovators themselves. • Solving for the hidden economy: While ANZ acknowledges that new solutions to promote greater tax compliance are required for the changing work environment, ANZ remains doubtful that this will solve the current non-compliance with tax obligations in the hidden economy. Put simply, people who actively play in the hidden economy simply ignore laws – hence any changes in tax laws and new tax compliance innovations alone will not solve this problem. • System changes take time: The future will likely bring about major systems changes and we look forward to the way ANZ can work alongside tax policy makers and other businesses to help those systems to grow. However, system and process changes at a transactional level will be highly complex (far more complex than any changes to balance flows such as withholding tax on interest). ANZ considers any changes designed to promote greater tax compliance in the changing work environment should be done in partnership with Inland Revenue, the banking industry and tax technology innovators. We would welcome working collaboratively with such parties to conduct thought processes on how to better promote tax compliance across our customer base. 10 REFERENCES i For further information refer to https://www.anz.co.nz/resources/3/6/360d5a90-085f-41c4-829b- 768568b91907/Financial-Wellbeing-Report.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CACHEID=360d5a90-085f-41c4-829b- 768568b91907 ii Financial Services Council (December 2017), Great Expectations: Retirement Realities for older New Zealanders.

Sharesies Limited 27th April 2018 Tax Working Group Secretariat Po Box 3724 Wellington, 6140, New Zealand About Sharesies Sharesies is a low cost investment platform. We give investors with $50 the same investment opportunities as someone with $50,000. We want to make this generation the most financially literate in history, starting with making investing easy. In the 10 months since launch, Sharesies has attracted over 14,000 investors (80% of who are under the age of 40) and had over $15m invested through our platform across 9 Smartshares ETFs (listed PIEs), and 2 Pathfinder Investment Funds (multi-rate PIEs). 3. Purposes and principles of a good tax system. How would you define ‘fairness’ in the context of the tax system? What would a fair tax system look like? Introduction: The Tax Working Group has asked what a fair tax system looks like, and at Sharesies we do not believe the current tax system is fair in its treatment of Listed PIE and multi-rate PIE (MRP) investments. We would like to bring the following to the Tax Working Group’s attention. A growing group of investors are paying too much tax on Listed PIEs because their effective tax rate is less than 28%. This group doesn’t have the same benefit as investors in a MRP who are able to receive cash refunds for excess imputation credits. Example: Sarah is 18 years old and earns less than $14,000 annually working holiday jobs while studying 1 at University. Her effective tax rate is 10.5%. She decides to invest $1,000 through Sharesies into a range of Listed PIEs and is subsequently taxed on income at a flat rate of 28%. Sarah ends up overpaying her tax by 17.5% and is unable to receive a cash refund. Instead she has to file personal income tax returns to obtain the benefit of excess imputation credits. Even then, the credit is offset against tax payable on other income and may not be realised until a later 1 Sarah is a fictional example of what a Sharesies investor could look like. 20180427 Tax Working Group Submission Sharesies Limited 1 \[1\] financial year. If Sarah had invested into a MRP then she would have used her prescribed investor rate (PIR) of 10.5%, paid the correct amount of tax and received a cash refund from Sharesies of excess imputation credits for that financial year. Discussion: Sarah’s example highlights a situation where investors who have previously been underserved and excluded from participating in the financial markets are being exposed to tax at a much higher rate and having to file an income tax return to arrive at their correct tax liability for the year. There is also potential for deadweight taxation cost where an investor on a low effective tax rate is induced into investing into a MRP over a Listed PIE because they are not in a situation where they overpay tax and receive cash refunds for excess imputations. This problem is amplified if a financial service provider was to offer investments for children as the majority of investors would have no income to offset excess imputation credits when investing in Listed PIEs. Sharesies strongly believes in making it as easy as possible to pay tax. We also believe that the tax system should be balanced and fair, and make it easy to claim refunds for our investors where tax has been overpaid. Before we started Sharesies, we interviewed over 5,000 people and asked them this question: “If I gave you $50 right now, and you had to do something with it in the next 5 minutes what would you do?” Bills, online shopping, coffees, vouchers, food, cigarettes and beers were all more popular options. None of them said invest it. Because investing isn’t something you could do with $50. For someone in this situation investing becomes even less attractive when you realise you’re paying tax at a higher rate and that investments are not treated similarly for your income level. In contrast people who are high income earners and pay tax at an effective tax rate of 33% receive benefit from the taxation of Listed PIE and multi-rate PIE investments which have the highest rate of 28%. Proposal Sharesies suggested solution to achieving fairness between investing in a Listed PIE and a MRP is to allow companies like us to act as a Portfolio Investor Proxy for Listed PIEs as well as MRPs. The benefit of this approach is that companies like Sharesies will perform tax calculations to facilitate cash refunds of excess imputation credits for investors in Listed PIEs for the year in which the excess imputation credits arise. This would remove the need for investors to file personal income tax returns to obtain the benefit of excess imputation credits. Why does this matter? The typical kiwi investing story is largely focused around ‘getting on the property ladder’. Saving enough for a deposit for your own home, and then investing in a second ‘rental’ property once you’ve knocked off a bigger chunk of the mortgage. But, with property prices rising, home ownership is becoming less attainable and affordable. The reality is most kiwi’s will be unable to 20180427 Tax Working Group Submission Sharesies Limited 2 own their own home (including people who earn really good money). Of the people we spoke with, the majority would choose to spend their money than put that $50 towards house savings — because homeownership just feels too far away. But without an alternative way to invest their money, people are struggling to get ahead. Historically there have always been investment options available, but they’re not accessible to people who don’t know anything about investing. Only 25% of people we spoke with said they knew where to go to start investing. They also felt like they needed a lot of money to get started, needed to know more, and there were too many hoops to jump through before they can get started. Traditional fund managers are focused on ‘wealth management’ not ‘wealth development’. But everyone we spoke with, wanted to be an investor. We saw this as an amazing opportunity and one that brings us to this point. At present, Sharesies must communicate the details of any excess imputation credits received from Listed PIEs to investors, for them to include in their yearly tax returns if they choose. If a tax credit applies, the excess is used to offset against tax on taxable income in that year or a future year. We know that we have investors paying to much tax in this scenario and believe that it is our responsibility to ensure they are served fairly by the New Zealand tax system. We remain open to contact from the Tax Working Group or Secretariat to discuss points raised.

PO Box 3277, Level 4 Woolstore Professional Centre 158 The Terrace Wellington, New Zealand teohu.maori.nz 30 April 2018 Tax Working Group Secretariat submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz Tēnā tatou Future of Tax – The Tax Working Group Thank you for the opportunity to contribute and provide our thoughts to the Tax Working Group on the future of New Zealand’s tax system. By way of background, Te Ohu Kaimoana is a statutory organisation dedicated to the future advancement of Māori interests in the marine environment. Te Ohu Kaimoana was established by the Māori Fisheries Act 2004 to allocate to mandated iwi organisations fisheries assets held in trust through the 1989 and 1992 Māori Fisheries Settlements and provide an advisory service to its iwi constituents. Our mission is to work for iwi to spearhead the growth and development of seafood in New Zealand while recognising the need to protect Māori fisheries assets for future generations. Additionally, Te Ohu Kaimoana undertakes a similar role in respect of commercial aquaculture assets to be provided to iwi pursuant to the Māori Commercial Aquaculture Claims Settlement Act 2004. Te Ohu Kaimoana is owned and run by Māori. It was created out of the agreement between Māori and the Crown for recognition of Māori fishing rights and the settlement of Māori commercial fishing claims. These fishing rights span the customary, recreational and commercial sectors. Te Ohu Kaimoana beneficiaries consist of a variety of members often being Māori authorities or charitable organisations. Our submission focusses on four key areas: 1.Taxation of Māori authorities 2.Charities tax regime 3.Capital gains tax 4.Environmental taxes We also comment briefly on the role of tīkanga Māori in the design of New Zealand’s tax system. Our key submission points are as follows: \[1\] Te Ohu Kaimoana 2 We consider the policy rationale for having a separate tax regime for Māori authorities remains sound and therefore we strongly support the continuance of the current regime. However, we consider a number of refinements can be made to the Māori authorities tax regime to make it more effective. Any enhancement to the regime will further support the continued growth of the Māori economy and the realisation of benefits to Māori communities, who we know continue to lag negatively in most socio- economic indicators vis a vis the general population. We are also supportive of the maintenance of the charities tax regime generally and note that care should be taken when considering any changes in this area to ensure that Māori organisations are not inadvertently adversely impacted. As noted in the Future of Tax paper, we consider that specific consideration should be given to Māori assets if a capital gains tax is to be introduced including the unique constraints that surrounds the transfer of Māori assets. Further work is required to better understand the role of environmental taxes in New Zealand including the effectiveness of such taxes as a mechanism to incentivise certain behaviours. Our comments are provided in more detail in the attached Appendix. Please feel free to contact us should you wish to discuss our comments further. Noho ora mai, rā Dion Tuuta CHIEF EXECUTIVE \[1\] Te Ohu Kaimoana 3 Appendix 1.Taxation of Māori authorities Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited (Te Ohu Kaimoana) is a Māori authority (being specifically included in the relevant definition in the Income Tax Act 2007). We strongly support the continuance of the current Māori authorities tax regime. This is on the basis that the policy rationale which supported the implementation of the current regime in the first place continues to be sound and relevant. Specifically, Māori authorities generally have unique structures and constraints which are applicable to Māori organisations and businesses only including restrictions on the ability of members of a Māori authority to sell their interests in the assets of the authority. Furthermore, Māori authorities are not homogenous and they can differ in a number of ways including their legal structure, size, types of activities undertaken, the range of benefits they provide, membership of the group and the mix of objectives. These wide-ranging characteristics mean that it would be impractical to require Māori authorities to be taxed in the same manner as other companies or trusts. For example, an iwi or hapū would generally not have a defined members list and as a result it would be near impossible for a Māori authority to apply the technical requirements of shareholder continuity (in the case of company taxation) or to attribute income to individual members (as the case under trust rules). As such, our view is that the current regime should remain in place as it continues to be the most efficient mechanism in ensuring members are tax appropriately. Specifically, the current regime achieves the following: Ensures that members who receive distributions are taxed on that income at their respective marginal rates. Minimises the costs for Māori authorities in complying with their tax requirements. Minimises the compliance costs for members who receive financial benefits from Māori authorities by reducing the need for them to file an income tax returns as a result of overpayment or underpayment of tax. Recognises the specific characteristics, structures and conditions of Māori authorities, and also the activities they undertake. While we support the continuation of the Māori authority regime, we consider there are some areas where refinement can be made to help ensure the regime better achieves its intended tax policy outcomes. In our view, any enhancement to the current regime will further support the continued growth of the Māori economy and the ability for them to benefit Māori communities. Wholly-owned subsidiaries of Māori authorities The current definition of a Māori authority is relatively prescriptive and largely relies on the company or trust having had the assets it holds and manages being transferred from the Crown. This means any subsidiary that is subsequently set up to hold or manage the assets by the initial company or trust which received the asset directly from the Crown (the Māori authority) will not be able to elect into the Māori authority tax regime. The result is that there is a mismatch between the tax rate applicable to that subsidiary (28%) and the Māori authority (17.5%). Te Ohu Kaimoana 4 This mismatch in tax rates means that the Māori authority accumulates excess imputation credits as a result of the subsidiary being taxed at 28% but the Māori authority is only able to effectively pass on 17.5% the benefit of those credits to its members (in the form of Māori authority tax credits). We note that although the excess imputation credits will convert to Māori authority tax credits, those tax credits are unable to be attached to a distribution by the Māori authority as the amount of Māori authority tax credits that can be attached is capped at 17.5%. This issue is exacerbated by the fact that there are various restrictions on the ability for Māori authorities to interact with other non-Māori authority entities in the tax regime. For example, Māori authorities are unable to offset losses with other companies, amalgamate with other companies or be members of a tax consolidated group with non-Māori authorities. In our view, this restriction undermines the basis of the Māori authority regime as it effectively results in the over-taxation of income of the Māori authority. In particular, as Māori authority and subsidiary is a single economic unit, there is no reason to have a different tax rate applying between the two if the policy rationale is to ensure any income derived through a Māori authority is to be effectively taxed at the members’ marginal tax rate. We consider there are two possible solutions which would resolved the issue outlined above: 1.Expanding the definition of Māori authority to include wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Māori authorities. We see no issue with expanding the definition in this manner as the subsidiary will effectively be subject to the same restrictions as its parent in relation to its assets. 2.Allowing a Māori authority to get a refund of imputation credits that are in excess of 17.5% rather than having them convert to Māori authority tax credits. This will eliminate the issue of the economic unit of the Māori authority bearing a 28% tax rate on its income due to it being unable to distribute excess Māori authority tax credits to its members. Either of these solutions would ensure consistent tax treatment across the entities in a Māori authorities’ wholly-owned group. It also removes any tax barriers that could prevent a Māori authority from dealing with its assets in the most appropriate commercial manner (e.g. it may make commercial sense for the Māori authority to limit its risk by setting up a subsidiary to manage a particular asset). We also consider there is merit in removing some of the current restrictions on the ability for Māori authorities to interact with other non-Māori authority entities in the tax regime. We are unclear of the policy rationale which support such current restrictions. Administrative simplification Our experience would suggest that the Māori authority regime is often not well understood by accountants or members of Māori authorities. This, in our view, also undermines the effectiveness of the regime and is also preventing it from fully achieving its intended purposes. For example, the fact that Māori authority tax credits are refundable and the process of how a refund may be obtained is not always well understood. We would recommend Inland Revenue provide further guidance to ensure those affected by the regime understand how the regime operates in a practical sense. Another administrative issue that often arises for Māori authorities is the requirement that a Māori authority must deduct resident withholding tax up to a rate of 33% if it does not know the IRD number of the recipient (an additional 15.5% if the Māori authority distribution has Māori authority tax credits attached at 17.5%). This provides a challenge for Māori authorities as it is not unusual that they are unable to identify every one Te Ohu Kaimoana 5 of its members. This results in over-taxation of the income if there is an acceptance that recipients of Māori authority distributions are generally taxed at 17.5%. We therefore submit that the requirement to withhold resident withholding tax at 33% is reduced to 17.5% even where the Māori authority does not know the IRD number of the recipient. Finally, the current refund process for obtaining refunds of Māori authority tax credits is cumbersome. We recommend that a Māori authority tax credit refund form that is similar to the resident withholding tax deducted in error form is developed so that non-taxable recipients of Māori authority distributions are able to quickly and efficiently obtain a refund of any Māori authority tax credits received. 2.Charities tax regime We understand that the Tax Working Group is considering how the tax regime applies to charities, particularly where the charity operates a business activity. Te Ohu Kaimoana is a registered charity and its profits are subject to the charitable tax exemption. We generally support the maintenance of the current charities tax regime. Specifically, we support the policy rationale that the tax system should support organisations that have a charitable purpose and assist in those organisations’ purposes of doing public good. We consider the business activity exemption supports the underlying policy of providing tax relief to charitable organisations, especially in the context of iwi. Furthermore, we continue to support the maintenance of a deduction for Māori authorities for donations made to donee organisations or to Māori associations. In the event where changes are to be made to the charities tax regime, we strongly recommend that specific consideration be given to Māori organisations as most iwi groups have charitable organisations that are members or are associated with them. Care should be taken to ensure any changes to the charities tax regime do not result in any adverse or unintended consequences for iwi, including any additional compliance costs that could result from such change. We understand that in addition to the Tax Working Group considering how charities operate within the tax environment, Government is also undertaking a broader review of the Charities Act 2005. The definition of 'charitable purpose' for income tax purposes draws heavily on general legal concepts of charities. That said there may be times when it is appropriate for the scope of what is considered to be charitable in the context of the tax exemption to be broadened (or narrowed) if there is a sound tax policy basis to do so. A good example of where this has occurred in the past is the broadening of the concept of 'charitable purpose' for income tax purposes by relaxing the 'blood ties' restriction, which was done in 2004, in parallel with a review of the Māori authorities tax regime. This was done with Māori organisations and iwi in mind which recognised that the previous definition was overly restrictive. This difference between common law and tax law concepts is important and in our view remains appropriate. Therefore, it is important to consider the impact of any changes to the legal concept of charity arising from the broader review and assess whether the changes affect the tax construct of what is appropriate for charities. 3.Capital gains tax We appreciate that fairness is a key focus for the Tax Working Group and capital gains tax is a specific area that is being considered. We support a tax system that is fair, balanced and equitable. Therefore we submit that if a capital gains tax is to be introduced, concessions should be made for ‘settlement assets’ to recognise their unique characteristics as, in our view, it would be inequitable for such assets to be subject to a capital gains tax. Our view is consistent with the sentiment conveyed in the Future of Tax paper which recognises the unique nature of settlement assets. Te Ohu Kaimoana 6 Specifically, we note that settlement assets represent compensation from the Crown to iwi to settle historic wrongs. It would be contrary to the sentiment of compensation if Māori authorities are required to pay tax on any future transfer of these special assets. Furthermore, settlement assets are already subject to significant legislative restrictions on how they may be transferred. Fisheries settlement assets for example are only able to be transferred between Mandated Iwi Organisations or Aotearoa Fisheries Limited (trading as Moana New Zealand). These settlement assets are therefore not subject to normal ‘market’ conditions which generally results in a negative impact on the value of those assets. Imposing a capital gain tax on those transfers will further dilute the value of those assets to iwi. Finally, practical issues can also arise if a capital gains tax is introduced and applied to settlement assets. For example, it would be difficult to ascertain the market value of such assets, especially taking into account the restrictions referred to above. It will also be difficult to determine the cost of such assets given they are a form of compensation to iwi and not purchased. We therefore strongly submit that settlement assets should be outside the scope of any capital gains tax and ‘settlement assets’ should be given a commercially relevant definition which for Te Ohu Kaimoana should include both settlement quota and shares in its subsidiaries (e.g. Moana New Zealand). Te Ohu Kaimoana 7 4.Environmental taxes We understand that the application of environmental taxes is a specific area that is being contemplated by the Tax Working Group. We note that New Zealand’s current tax system has generally adopted the approach of having minimum incentives or distortions and therefore the introduction of taxes to discourage certain behaviours would be relatively novel in the context of the current tax policy settings. On this basis, we urge the Tax Working Group to fully examine the policy rationale and potential impact of any environmental taxes. Specifically, issues that we consider should be addressed by the Tax Working Group include: Whether there is sufficient evidence to support that the environmental tax will affect behaviours in a way that will result in better outcomes for the environment on a holistic basis. Whether taxes are the most effective and cost efficient way to achieved the desired environmental outcome – for example, regulation such as New Zealand’s fisheries quota management system has been effective in helping manage New Zealand’s fisheries stocks in a sustainable manner for future generations. The key question is whether tax is the best mechanism in achieving the desired state. A clear framework should be established to provide clarity as to the purpose and outcome of any resulting environmental taxes. Specifically, we do not consider environmental taxes should be used as a mechanism to raise additional revenue for general government spending. Rather, any revenue raised must only be directed to achieving better environmental outcomes for New Zealand. 5.General comments We are pleased to see the Tax Working Group’s recognition of the importance of hearing the Māori voice in the design New Zealand’s future tax system. We also recognise the importance of ensuring the New Zealand tax system is one which supports the growth in the Māori economy and one that strives for more equality across all New Zealanders. We support the general direction of travel of incorporating a more diverse way of assessing what constitutes a good tax system for New Zealand. In particular, we can see elements of the Living Standards Framework resonating with te ao Māori and the recognition of the tīkanga Māori are important steps in ensuring New Zealand’s future tax system is more fit-for-purpose. Tīkanga is about doing the right things in the right way and keeping things in balance. If this is done then the right outcomes for everything else should follow including things such as intergenerational sustainability (kaitiakitanga) and how we can look after our people (manākitanga). Recognition of such tikanga would align with Te Ohu Kaimoana’s own values and vision which include protecting Māori fisheries assets for future generations.

Te Tumu Paeroa L3 Seabridge House, 110 Featherston Street, Wellington PO Box 5038, Wellington 6011 Aotearoa New Zealand Tax Working Group secretariat Via email: submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz 30 April 2018 Future of Tax: Māori collectives group submission E te rangatira, e Tā Michael, koutou mā hoki te Tax Working Group, tēnā koutou katoa On behalf of the following Māori land and iwi collectives, we welcome the opportunity to provide the following submission to the Tax Working Group (TWG) in this important review of the New Zealand tax regime. This submission is made on behalf of the following entities: ► Te Tumu Paeroa – the Māori Trustee ► Tūaropaki Trust ► Wakatū Incorporation ► Mangatū Blocks Incorporation ► Wi Pere Trust ► Ngāti Pāoa Group Investments Limited Our collective represents more than 200,000 beneficial owners, over $1Bn in assets and approximately 140,000 hectares of land. In addition, our members are involved in a number of major industries that range from farming, to forestry to food production and power generation to name a few. Our submission focusses on the following areas that we consider most relevant to our organisations and members, namely: 1. The Māori authority tax regime 2. Land tax 3. Capital gains tax 4. Environmental taxes We would welcome the opportunity to discuss our submission kanohi ki te kanohi, particularly given the short written submission timeframe (meaning for example, it has been very difficult for us to consult with our members). 1. The Māori authority tax regime 1.1 All of our submission group members are or have Māori authorities within their group structures. We strongly submit that key tenets of the current Māori authority tax regime remain. Submission 1 A separate Māori authority tax regime should be maintained and the tax rate should continue to match the marginal tax rate of the majority of individual Māori taxpayers. The regime in this respect works well, is fair and efficient. 2 1.2 The separate tax rules for Māori authorities is based on the unique way that Māori freehold land and other tribal assets are administered and owned, including communal ownership and restrictions on the ability to sell. It is highly unlikely that these unique structures and constraints will ever change or be removed. We consider that it would be inappropriate for Māori authorities to be taxed as general companies or trusts. As an example, it is difficult for many of our long-established Māori land entities in particular, to maintain accurate ownership registers across an ever-increasing number of owners, who are required to undertake a legal process to formally succeed to their interests. Therefore, compliance with technical requirements such as shareholder continuity (under the company tax regime) or income attribution to individual members (under the trust rules) is practically impossible. 1.3 The lower tax rate of 17.5% reflects the marginal tax rate that the majority of the underlying members of a Māori authority are subject to, which we understand was estimated at over 80% of the Māori population at the time of the regime was introduced. We predict that this proportion will unfortunately not improve significantly in the near future. However, we note that all of our submission group members vehemently hope and strive to improve this situation – we want our people and our organisations to be in economic positions that mean they should be subject to higher marginal tax rates! In the meantime, we consider that the Māori authority rate should match the marginal tax rate of the vast majority of our members (currently 17.5%). 1.4 On the basis of the above, we submit that the policy rationale for the retention of a separate Māori authority tax regime and the current tax rate remains sound. The model in practice works well and we endorse its retention. This will continue to recognise the unique characteristics and obligations of Māori authorities, ensure that distributions to members are generally taxed at their respective marginal rates, and minimise administrative and compliance costs for members (by removing the need for members to file a tax return in order to square up their final tax liability). 1.5 The ability to elect Māori authority status is restricted, broadly to companies or trusts that ‘receive’ Treaty settlement assets (fisheries or land), or ‘own’ Māori land. Generally, wholly owned or controlled subsidiaries established to hold or manage the assets or commercial activities of the parent are not able to elect Māori authority status. 1.6 We understand that in the lead up to the introduction of the current Māori authority regime, officials had recommended that wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries be included in the Māori authority definition. However, the eventual exclusion was a response to lobbying and concerns that the lower tax rate for subsidiaries would confer a competitive advantage and distort competitive neutrality. 1 1.7 The inability for subsidiaries to elect Māori authority status means that the subsidiary will often be subject to the company tax rate of 28% and not 17.5%. One implication of denying Māori authority status to wholly-owned subsidiaries is that a Māori authority will end up with excess imputation credits from the subsidiary being taxed at 28% but the Māori authority is only able to pass on 17.5% of the benefit of those credits to its members. This problem is exacerbated by the inability of Māori authorities to offset tax losses or profits against non-Māori authority entities in their group. Many of our submission members have been in situations where their wholly-owned group is in a tax loss position but has had to pay tax. 1 Taxation (Annual Rates, Māori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill as reported from the Finance Expenditure Committee – Commentary. Submission 2 Wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries of Māori authorities should be eligible to elect Māori authority status. It will remove the over taxation and complication of Māori authority groups, and aligns with the policy of the Māori authority regime. 3 1.8 The above issues have led most if not all of our members to either conduct commercial activities directly, or engage tax advisors and lawyers to establish look-through company or limited partnership structures (to achieve a 17.5% tax rate with look through treatment). We consider it inefficient to unnecessarily structure ourselves in a manner to achieve a sensible tax outcome rather than according to commercial merit. For less mature or resourced Māori authorities, the difference in rates may mean that they lose the ability to quarantine commercial risk or access more efficient commercial structures. 1.9 We consider that the above issues inevitably lead to the over taxation or over complication of Māori authorities. Wholly-owned subsidiaries of Māori authorities face constraints on their activities due to the restrictions placed on their parent entity, which are not faced by competitors who do not have a Māori authority parent entity. As the Māori authority and its wholly-owned or controlled subsidiaries are a single economic unit, there is no reasonable justification for their income to be taxed differently when the policy of the Māori authority regime is to tax the income of that unit at the members’ marginal tax rate. We submit therefore that subsidiaries of Māori authorities should also be able to access the same tax rate as its ultimate economic owners. 2. Land tax 2.1 Taxes can be imposed on a number of bases, and these bases change over time and across jurisdictions. Some of the most common tax bases are income, consumption and wealth. Land taxes (or any tax that taxes based on the value of an asset, rather than the income it produces) are a form of wealth tax. Since 1992, with the abolition of land tax (which was collecting immaterial amounts of revenue at the time), New Zealand has relied principally on income and consumption taxes. This is a mix that we consider continues to work well for Aotearoa New Zealand. 2.2 The merits of introducing a wealth tax – and a land tax as a particular form of wealth tax – were canvased by the 2001 Tax Working Group (“the McLeod Review”). They considered that wealth taxes would likely lead to over-taxation of certain assets (like land, where any rental income was already taxed) and concluded at paragraph 2.77 of the Issues Paper: A case can, however, be made for considering taxes on wealth where they would fill in gaps in the income tax base. To the extent that wealth is acquired by reinvesting after tax income, it has already been recognised by the income tax system and there is no gap to fill. This suggests there is no need to pursue the idea of a general wealth tax. 2.3 The Victoria University Tax Working Group of 2010, which saw merit in further consideration of a land tax, also noted the equity issues of imposing a land tax, noting: The equity impacts of a land tax are also unclear. Firstly, it taxes only one component of wealth, and therefore mainly impacts those people and organisations holding their wealth in that form. Retirees, Māori authorities and farmers could be particularly affected. \[Emphasis added\] 2.4 While no tax is without issues, land taxes pose a series of problems that make them difficult to support in the absence of some other obvious hole in the tax base. We have seen no compelling argument put forward for such a hole in the base. Submission 3 We do not support a land tax. It is likely to lead to over taxation, cash flow difficulties and increased inequity. Māori, where land is often collectively owned, would be amongst the groups hardest hit by a land tax. 4 2.5 In particular, because a land tax is not linked to the income produced by an asset, there may be difficulty in funding the tax payments. For our Māori land owners, this can be a particular problem. Land held collectively may not generate significant cash flows, either as the land is held for its cultural significance and cannot (or will not) be developed or sold, or because of the constraints imposed by the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 our collective owners have difficulty borrowing against the land, developing the land or disposing of it. The imposition of an annual charge against the land, even at a relatively low rate, is likely to have a disproportionate impact on our Māori land owners – possibly forcing the sale of land which may once again alienate our people from our whenua; in some cases land which may have been recently returned as part of a Treaty settlement. 2.6 For the majority of our Māori land, used in forestry or farming, there are limited alternative uses for the land. In these situations, it is not the case that imposing a tax on the land could or will drive a more productive use of the land. Even where alternative uses may be available, some of our Māori land owners still lack the access to capital needed to convert land to those uses. The imposition of a land tax will make that problem worse. 2.7 If a land tax was introduced, certain design aspects would be necessary to minimise these adverse impacts. These measures could include: 2.7.1 For the reasons outlined above, excluding Māori collectively owned land, or at a minimum, culturally significant Māori land from a land tax. 2.7.2 Applying the tax only to land that exceeded a certain threshold (such as $70,000/ha). If the concern driving a land tax is that land bankers in high value urban fringe areas and property speculators are being undertaxed, excluding land below a certain dollar limit may exclude most Māori collectively owned land (and farms – the other obvious pressure point for a land tax). 2.7.3 Providing land owners the opportunity to defer any tax liabilities until the sale of the land. While this would address some of the cash flow issues related to the tax, the effect of the accumulating liability over time (particularly if there was an imputed interest charge to reflect the deferral), could have a significant impact over time. If land was held for multiple generations, the tax liability would grow to the point where it swallowed the whole value of the land on its eventual sale. Put simply, a 1% per annum land tax rolled-up over land owned for 100 years equals 100% of the land value. 3. Capital gains tax 3.1 We do not see the need for a capital gains tax to be introduced. However, if there is to be one, it needs to be comprehensive with as few exceptions as possible. Our particular concerns relate to capital losses and the potential unintended impact on the housing market. Losses 3.2 As you are aware, the Māori economy is in a state of substantial growth as we regain access to our resources and successfully grow our asset base. This means many Māori businesses and ventures (both collectively and individually owned) are in a start-up phase and not all will be successful. If capital gains are to be taxed, in the interests of both efficiency and equity, there needs to be a meaningful way for start-up businesses and their owners to access the losses where the business is Submission 4 We do not support a capital gains tax. It is possible that a tax on investment properties would simply be passed on to renters, which would disproportionately impact on Māori. If there is going to be a capital gains tax, there needs to be a practical mechanism for owners of unsuccessful businesses to access capital losses. 5 unsuccessful. While we are aware that most jurisdictions have differing treatment of capital gains and losses, these differences need to be minimised. Unsuccessful Māori businesses need to be able to access the capital losses (ideally through a cash-out mechanism) to allow us to start again. Housing 3.3 We are concerned that any capital gains tax considered by the TWG has had owner-occupied housing already ruled out. Māori are significantly under-represented in house ownership statistics and over-represented as renters. Any capital gains tax will fall only on rental properties. Almost any house in New Zealand can move freely between being a rental property or being owner-occupied. The dynamics of house price setting means that it is not clear who sets house prices in New Zealand: owner-occupiers or investors. It is, therefore, not clear how any capital gains tax would impact house prices – if untaxed owner-occupiers are the marginal buyer and set the prices. A capital gains tax would not make entry into the housing market any more affordable for Māori. 3.4 Equally it is unclear whether the cost of the tax would be borne by the landlords. If landlords are currently ‘subsidising’ rents on the basis they can earn a tax-free capital gain on the eventual disposal of the property, any tax on the gain may simply be passed on to renters in the form of higher rents. These rent increases would disproportionately impact our people, who are more likely to rent. 4. Environmental taxes 4.1 We are kaitiaki of our land and natural resources. The sustainable management of our resources and care for our environment is of the upmost importance to our organisations. Therefore, we support the consideration of any environmental taxes that result in better outcomes for our environment and organisations. 4.2 At 1.3% of GDP New Zealand’s revenue from environmentally related taxes is among the lowest in the OECD 2 . However, we do not consider environmental taxes should be used as a mechanism to raise additional revenue for general government spending. In fact, by definition if they succeed in changing behaviour, the direct revenue raised should be small. Any revenue raised should be directed to achieving better environmental outcomes for Aotearoa New Zealand. 4.3 We consider that a key challenge lies in determining whether environmental taxes will affect behaviours in a way that will result in better outcomes for the environment on a holistic basis. And whether tax reform can achieve a given level of environmental protection at lower cost than non-tax alternatives such as trading schemes or regulation. Given the limited time available to us, we do not have a specific view on these issues. However, we urge the TWG to fully examine these particular aspects and potential impact of any environmental taxes on our organisations. 2 OECD Environmental Statistics Database (OECD average is 1.6%). See https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/data/oecd- environment-statistics/environmental-policy-instruments\_data-00696- en?parentId=http%3A%2F%2Finstance.metastore.ingenta.com%2Fcontent%2Fthematicgrouping%2Fd77d7b93-en (as at 19 April 2018). Submission 5 We support the development of effective environmental taxes that result in better outcomes for our environment and organisations. The challenge is whether and what tax is the most effective and cost efficient way to achieve these outcomes. 6 We appreciate the opportunity for our group of Māori collectives to be able to contribute our submissions to the TWG on the future of New Zealand’s tax system. Please feel free to contact us should you wish to discuss our comments further. Nāku noa, nā Jamie Tuuta Māori Trustee (on behalf of the organisations listed on page one) \[1\]

Having reviewed the briefing documents and discussed the questions raised at the senior levels of Temperzone I am pleased to submit our views below. 1.What does the future of tax look like? There are many good things about the New Zealand tax system that should be maintained and built upon. The focus on a few but high return tax categories is the correct approach. The lack of exception, exclusion and thereby loopholes to avoid tax leads to a clean and easy to comply with regime. This “keeping it simple” approach to tax compliance is one of the few advantages New Zealand business have over international competitors who generally have the upper hand. Previous generations have been permitted to live beyond their means and have not adequately provided for their retirements. This should not continue. Tax incentives should be introduced to encourage retirement savings. The ongoing development and growth of retirement funds will also promote depth and liquidity in New Zealand financial markets. Properly managed funds will steer financial resources into long term and higher return assets. This would hopefully aid the transfer of retirement savings away from residential property and assist with the affordability of housing. - 2 - 2.What is the purpose of tax? The purpose of tax is to allow the government to provide the country with core services and ensure a minimum standard of living for all New Zealanders. These standards are measured by quality of life not just income levels. The tax system needs to incentivise all levels of society to contribute to the national economy. It should not place a ceiling on individuals and organisations earning potential or create diminishing returns with success. It should not create the situation where welfare is a better option than working for a living. 3.Are we taxing the right things? Company Income Tax Company tax is appropriate, but we need to consider the international trend to lower company tax rates and whether ignoring this trend will ultimately see productive businesses move offshore. A progressive company tax rate would seem to be an unnecessary and complicating addition to company tax. This would create opportunity for company structures to avoid tax. Goods and Services Tax As it stands the GST regime works well and is easy to administer. The introduction of further exemptions is unnecessary and complicating. Keep it simple. Personal Income Tax Again, the tax system in this area is relatively straight forward particularly for those who are taxed at source. This could be improved with the introduction of a tax-free threshold eliminating the need to tax and pay low income earners. Consideration should be given to the introduction of income splitting to assist single income families. This is particularly relevant where a caregiver is staying at home to care for family members. - 3 - Fringe Benefit Tax FBT hits the key items at the right level. The government should avoid the temptation of taxing insignificant items such as parking and phones. This is unnecessary and would over complicate the regime. Land Tax May be an option to prevent land banking and or speculation in the property markets. Capital Gains Tax If the current tax rules are enforced adequately a capital gains tax should be unnecessary. Capital gains for those in the business of buying and selling for gain are already subject to tax. Taxing capital gains will be a very complicated exercise. What types of assets will be taxed. Property, shares, art, KiwiSaver funds? What if it's jointly owned and one person dies? What if it's left to you in a will? What if it's in a family trust? When will it be payable? On realised or unrealised gains. Establishing market values for assets that are not publicly traded will be expensive and unreliable. When is a gain realised. When it’s sold?, inherited?, gifted? Tax simplicity is one of New Zealand’s few competitive advantages. Such a tax will require complex rules for compliance and administration, will raise little tax and have little to no effect on the housing market. Estate and Gift Tax These forms of taxes should not be reintroduced. It is not equitable to put a tax on assets which have most likely already been taxed multiple times in their generation. The worldwide trend away from such taxes supports the fact that they are ineffective, generate little revenue, have options to be avoided and will likely tempt affluent New Zealanders to retire offshore, taking their fortunes with them. Targeted Tax Environmental tax is appropriate but can disadvantage local business by creating challenges that can’t be fixed domestically. Government needs to consider parallel measures that ensure issues are actually addressed and not simply shipped offshore to countries that don’t set the same standards. - 4 - Fuel, alcohol and tobacco excise are appropriate, but taxes need to be spent on addressing issues within the area they target. Other Taxes Payroll tax, sales tax, cheque duty etc... should not be introduced. 4.Can tax make housing more affordable? The housing issue comes down to supply and demand. The rapid population growth primarily through immigration has increased demand. Supply has been constrained by a slow and costly consent process, lack of trades people, lack of funding with new immigrants needing immediate access to infrastructure without having contributed to its development. Developers, bankers and home buyers must now be seeing high risk in entering a market at what could be the peak. In a Catch 22; housing in the most effected regions is now unaffordable to the very trades people needed to address the issue. Central and local government need to address these supply issues. Christchurch achieved a burst of new housing supply that has flattened prices, but only because the usual rules around consenting were relaxed and the central Government poured cash into build infrastructure. While these fundamental issues are being addressed taxation can assist in minimising the problem by removing the opportunity to gain from the imbalance through speculation. The government could impose land tax or targeted rates on the land approved for new developments, so councils have some extra funding for supporting infrastructure (roads, railways, parks and pipelines). It would encourage land bankers to develop new homes sooner. A stamp duty on foreign buyers would also address offshore funds focused on speculation. As with Christchurch the establishment of short-term worker accommodation would aid supply of trades to key regions like Auckland. Tax incentives for apprentices training would also be of value. - 5 - 5.What tax issues matter most to you? As a company we are often faced with competitors based in countries with lower standards of environmental care, ethical practices, employee health, respect for intellectual property rights and taxation advantages. Their advantage is more about their ability to exploit the environment, people, payless tax and utilise non- trade barriers, than a true competitive advantage. Changes in the tax system should not compound this issue but should attempt to level the playing field. At 28% the company tax is above the average for the OECD. This is compounded further by international earnings being double taxed in the hands of New Zealand shareholders. For example, profits from Australian subsidiaries are taxed in Australia at 30%. Due to the lack of recognition of Australian franking credits in New Zealand these profits are taxed again at 33% upon distribution to New Zealand shareholders. The result is an effective tax rate of 53%. In our view the company tax rate needs to reduce, and credit be given for foreign tax payments. This will encourage reinvestment in productive and income generating assets. In contrast, our normally much larger competitors tend to avoid paying tax in New Zealand and other markets through structures designed to achieve this outcome and repatriate the profits to a tax-free\\low jurisdiction like Ireland and pay little tax. Hopefully the BEPS laws will start to address this. Speculation and manipulation of the New Zealand dollar has resulted in an artificially high exchange rate and impacted the export sectors competitiveness, earnings and tax payments. Taxation of these activities may see them reduce. The government may need to introduce rules requiring settlement on genuine transactions only. Preventing the use of financial instruments designed to allow traders to take positions on the New Zealand currency and or commodities. Representatives of Temperzone would be happy to discuss the matters raised above in more detail should the working group see value in doing so. Kind regards Tony McIntosh Group Chief Financial Officer Temperzone

Page 1 of 12 The Future of Tax: Submission to the Tax Working Group: Te Awheahe Take The Salvation Army New Zealand Fiji, Tonga Territory with Samoa BACKGROUND: 1. The Salvation Army (The Army) is an international Christian and social services organisation that has worked in New Zealand for over one hundred and thirty years. The Army provides a wide-range of practical social, community and faith-based services, particularly for those who are suffering, facing injustice or those who have been forgotten and marginalised by mainstream society. We have over 90 Community Ministry centres and Churches (Corps) across the nation, serving local families and communities. The Army’s Addiction, Supportive Accommodation & Reintegration Services (ASARS) provide services at more than 30 locations throughout the country. ASARS support people seeking help with alcohol, other drugs, and gambling related problems, emergency housing options and assisting people transitioning from prison into the community. We are passionately committed to our communities as we aim to fulfil our mission of caring for people, transforming lives and reforming society through God in Christ by the Holy Spirit’s power i . 2. This submission has been prepared by the Social Policy and Parliamentary Unit of The Salvation Army. This Unit works towards the eradication of poverty by encouraging policies and practices that strengthen the social framework of New Zealand. 3. This submission has been approved by Commissioner Andrew Westrupp, Territorial Commander of The Salvation Army’s New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga Territory. OUTLINE OF THE SALVATION ARMY’S SUBMISSION: 4. The Salvation Army is keen to be involved in the work of the Tax Working Group (TWG) and welcomes the publication of its background paper The Future of Tax. This background paper usefully frames some of the issues we face as a nation around tax and most likely remains true to the TWG’s brief and terms of reference. The Army believes however the failure of this review to include income transfers such as working age benefits and New Zealand Superannuation (NZS) as at least a related issue is a significant shortcoming. We believe that this shortcoming should be addressed and will make reference to this in the topics we consider in this submission. This shortcoming, in our opinion arises around the interface between taxation and income support for those receiving working age benefits, supplementary benefits and Working for Families (WFF) payments. The myriad and complex ways in which these payments interact with income and income tax mean that low income people can face very high effective marginal tax rates (EMTR) and this in turn can become a poverty trap. Page 2 of 12 5. The Salvation Army will be addressing this matter in its submission. In addition The Army will be making comments on the following areas. a. The overall intent and structure of New Zealand’s tax system. b. Taxation of charities. c. The taxation of wealth and the proposal for a capital gains tax. d. GST exemptions. e. Environmental and resource taxes. f. Taxes to shift behaviours g. Hypothecating taxes THE OVERALL INTENT & STRUCTURE OF NEW ZEALAND’S TAX SYSTEM 6. The Salvation Army supports the overall intent of New Zealand’s tax policies which is to provide a ‘broad-based, low-rate system which succeeds at raising relatively high amounts of revenue with relatively low rates’ (p.5). Our system appears to be relatively straightforward in terms of its base relying as it does mainly on personal income tax and general consumption through GST. This is not to suggest that a broader tax base is not desirable, as we believe it is, but that a tax levied comprehensively and transparently across whichever base is chosen is a desirable approach for tax policy. Such an approach, as the TWG will be aware, achieves some level of horizontal equity and is efficient to a degree since it is less likely to distort peoples’ decisions around how they earn income and spend their money. 7. While we note the comments in the background paper that New Zealand has a relatively high rate of company tax by international standards (p.13), we note also the comments around our imputation regime which we believe is entirely fair. This regime means of course that where the owners of companies are New Zealand residents this income is taxed at the top marginal tax rate paid by these owners. These income tax rates are acknowledged in the paper as low by international standards. The paper acknowledges too that there is a problem around multi-national companies engaging in practices such as transfer pricing in order to avoid paying taxes in New Zealand. Given this it would be good if the TWG could spend some time investigating the extent of such practices in order to determine what the effective tax rate being paid by foreign owned companies actually is. 8. The Salvation Army accepts that any set of public policies which aim to fulfil a number of sometimes conflicting, or at least inconsistent objectives, can generate inefficient and sometimes perverse outcomes. This constraint notwithstanding, we believe that tax policy is sufficiently broad in its application and that the impacts of this application are sufficiently well researched that we can realistically expect that our tax policies can efficiently and effectively work towards a range of objectives. 9. The primary objective of our current tax policies appears to be that of raising revenue for Government in a way which is economically and administratively efficient. In this respect our system can probably be seen as being quite successful. However the other potential objectives which can be sought from tax policies, and particularly those of re-distribution Page 3 of 12 and changing behaviour, may also be achieved efficiently if sufficient imagination and care is brought to the task. It is The Salvation Army’s submission that these additional objectives of re-distribution and behaviour modification should also be pursed to a greater degree than they are at present. The basis of our submission supports this idea. TAXATION OF CHARITIES: 10. The TWG background paper acknowledges that the not-for-profit sector plays an important role in both New Zealand society and its economy and The Salvation Army as a leading NGO concurs with this assessment. The charitable sector is both a significant employer and provider of services. These services are often provided on behalf of (or in conjunction with) Government agencies, for the betterment of society. 11. The current taxation concessions that the sector receives are vital in enabling Charities to provide the services to the community that they do. In addition to these concessions the charitable sector relies heavily on the kind support of the donating public. The current tax credit for donations that the Government provides is a generous encouragement to the public to support the community through the work of charities. This partnership between charities, the public and the Government ensures that New Zealand benefits as a whole for the best value. 12. As well as the generous donations of money, charities also receive support in the form of goods and services and many hours of volunteer time for which there are no tax benefits to the provider but which benefit the community. These donated goods, services and time mean that charities provide a very cost efficient service that is a great tangible benefit to society, often supporting Government initiatives and aims. 13. The current tax concessions are appropriate to supporting the mission of charities. Any surpluses produced by a charity’s business enterprises are used in the provision of the mission of the charity. Also, these business enterprises are an opportunity to benefit society through the provision of goods and/or services and also to provide employment, rehabilitation and training in the community. 14. While charities are grateful for the tax concessions that they receive, these don’t come without a cost. There are numerous rules and regulations to be aware of, often requiring levels of judgement to determine if they apply or how to apply them. This can lead to considerable compliance costs to ensure that charitable entities operate within the boundaries and spirit of the law. 15. The Salvation Army is a large and diverse charitable organisation. Its diversity is one of its strengths as it is able to address many of the issues it is presented with in a seamless way. This diversity also presents challenges, amongst which are the varying rules regarding taxation on various activities. For example The Salvation Army currently has to consider carefully the appropriate GST treatment of all transactions because its operations include Page 4 of 12 various accommodation situations where GST may be applied in different ways; overseas transactions, including those where we may need to assess GST on imported services under the reverse charge mechanism; various exempt activities including the sale of donated goods and services; donations (which are not subject to GST) as well as taxable activities where GST is applied in a more standard way. In assessing changes to the tax system our plea would be to keep things simple. THE INTERFACE BETWEEN INCOME SUPPORT & TAXATION POLICIES: 16. As discussed above, The Salvation Army is concerned about the omission of income support programmes and policies such as Working for Families, the working age benefits and New Zealand Superannuation from the background paper. We accept that this omission is because it is outside the TWG’s brief and that on any account a process which considered both tax policies and income support policies would be even more extended than the present work of the TWG and probably not workable. While such an expanded brief may not have been feasible, we believe that it is still incumbent on the TWG to consider the impact of the interface between income support programmes and taxation. The need for such a consideration is based the potential inefficiencies and likely perverse incentives set up by the current income tax/income support regimes. 17. A most obvious inefficiency arises around the need for Working for Families payments to compensate families with children for the taxes they pay. For example a single family household with two children only starts to receive a net income from the state where its annual income falls below $50,000. For incomes just above this threshold the value of WFF payments are less than the taxes such a household would pay so of course there is a targeting of assistance which may have some policy value. Such targeting however creates higher EMTR’s so acts as a disincentive to working more. Such an effective disincentive was noticeable in the case of two income households which may be a good thing when considering the choices families make around time and effort spent working for wages and that spent caring for children ii . As a policy WFF has given families with children more choices around how they spend their time and effort although it costs perhaps $50 million per year to administer iii and involves time and effort for households to comply with entitlement rules and processes. 18. The TWG will be well aware of the stark differences between Australia and New Zealand around how reported personal income is taxed at very low levels. A person receiving wages of $18,200 per annum in Australia pays no income tax while an equivalent person in New Zealand pays $2500 in income tax. iv This difference is significant across the interface between work and benefits and contributes to the relative poverty experienced by 15 to 24 year olds as well. 19. At the interface between work and benefit dependency a person receiving a working age benefit faces a complex array of abatements and so very high EMRT’s. For example as a person attempts to work part-time on a benefit, their principal benefit will abate along with Page 5 of 12 any supplementary assistance they receive through the Accommodation Supplement and special supplement assistance they may also receive. On top of this they will pay income tax at 15% for the first dollar they earn. This can mean that such people face EMTR’s of more than 50% v . While the bulk of such a high EMRT is due to benefit rules rather than tax policies, the present taxation of very low levels of personal income does not assist. The Salvation Army believes that this matter should be considered by the TWG in its reconsideration of income tax policy settings. 20. Related to the taxation of the very low personal incomes is the relative poverty experienced by people earning and trying to live on such incomes. Most of the single people earning low personal incomes from wages will be young workers who are perhaps also trying to study and/or have casual entry-level jobs. It is notable that these people experience the highest and most persistent levels of relative poverty vi yet are seldom considered by poverty reduction programmes and often fall outside of most income support and housing support programmes. The lack of access to such programmes impacts on their poverty but so too does the fact that they pay income tax on such low incomes. THE TAXATION OF WEALTH & A CAPITAL GAINS TAX: 21. The Salvation Army does not support the idea of a capital gains tax as such a tax is only a partial remedy to the problems we have around growing wealth inequalities. As well we believe that a capital gains tax will most likely not raise much revenue for the foreseeable future given that we appear to be at the top of an extended property price boom. 22. The Army notes the comments made in the background paper that wealth is distributed much less equally than income (p.36) and that the maldistribution of income has on any account got substantially worse since the 1980’s and marginally worse since the mid 2000’s. These trends are of course not entirely due to our tax system and will not be addressed entirely by our tax system either. However, there is scope to address both wealth and income inequalities through our tax and income transfer systems. The Salvation Army believes that such opportunities should be considered by the TWG. 23. Wealth inequality is, in The Salvation Army’s opinion, a serious and growing problem for New Zealand. It is a serious problem in part because this inequality is a source of poverty, in part because this poverty undermines the potentials of those impacted by it and in part because this in turn undermines social cohesion. The data offered below demonstrates how wealth inequality is getting worse. 24. The 2015 Household Economic Survey showed the 52% of the wealth was owned by less than 9% of households while 51% of households owned less than 9% of the wealth vii . Tenant households which at that time made up 35% of households owned less than 8% of the wealth. Reserve Bank data on household wealth shows that the total net wealth of New Zealand households rose 46% in nominal terms or by $454 billion between 2012 and 2017 to $1440 billion. Of this increase, 86% or $396 billion was gained from increases in the value of Page 6 of 12 housing and land viii . While there is no data available on the distribution of these wealth gains, it seems likely that half or more went to the wealthiest 10% of households. In other words the wealthiest 10% of households saw their wealth grow by an average of $1.35 million between 2012 and 2017 while the poorest 90% saw their wealth grow by an average of around $150,000. Much of these gains would have been untaxed given that they have come from escalating land values. 25. To address growing wealth inequalities- such as these, it is The Salvation Army’s view that wealth should be taxed as suggested by the French economist Tomas Piketty in his 2013 text Capital in the 21 st Century. How such a capital tax might work should be investigated by the TWG although we recommend that some attention is given to re-considering the advice offered by the 2001 Tax Review which suggested applying a tax based on the risk free rate of return and on all wealth above a certain threshold ix . EXEMPTION OF SOME GOODS FROM GST: 26. The Salvation Army does not support the exemption of some preferred goods or services from the GST tax net. We believe that the present comprehensiveness of GST is one of its strengths and that this approach should be maintained. While some parties which are concerned about the cost of healthy foods to low-income groups argue for the exemption of such goods from GST this argument on balance has little merit we believe. 27. The exemption of fresh and healthy foods from GST is likely to generate odd and perhaps unexpected outcomes, would be difficult to administer and perhaps to comply with and would likely benefit higher income households more than the low-income households on whose behalf such an argument is often advanced. There is as well a moral standard being applied here on what is a good or service which deserves exemption and which don’t. This moral standard may be based on where something is purchased rather than what is purchased. An example may be that food purchased in supermarkets is worthy while that purchased from takeaways is not. 28. The Salvation Army is concerned both with the absolute poverty faced by many poor New Zealanders and with the quality of the nutrition these people receive. The Army operates a network of 65 food banks across New Zealand and presently is providing 1200 food parcels each week to needy families and individuals. Many of whom have exhausted their supplementary assistance entitlements from MSD. During 2017 we experienced an unexpected and unprecedented 12% growth in demand for food parcels which we attribute to rising rents and an increase in housing related poverty x . 29. The Army is concerned with this increase in demand for food aid, or with the underlying and persistent demand for such assistance and we work with families through such measures as budgeting advice to address this. This persistence and recent growth in such assistance however points to a need to re-consider state run income support programmes as well as housing support measures and controls on predatory lending and other social hazards. In Page 7 of 12 short if we are concerned about the well-being of the poorest New Zealanders we believe that we should address these concerns through better income and housing support programmes, stricter controls on social hazards and perhaps through a lower income tax burden on the poorest paid New Zealanders. ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE TAXES: 30. Future of Tax correctly identifies the pressure our natural resources are under (pp 14-15, 40) and in our opinion usefully focuses on natural capital and its value to human wellbeing (p.18). The Salvation Army supports in principle the idea that we should have a wider and more comprehensive range of environmental taxes in order to reduce environmental harms and resource depletions and to ensure that our resource uses are efficient and respectful. 31. The Army believes that a strong case can be made for imposing taxes on both air and water emissions, water use and perhaps carbon use. We believe that the current emissions control regime has too many exemptions to be effective and that what amounts to free access to resources such as water does not encourage their wise and efficient use. 32. However it is important not to see environmental taxes as entirely new sources of Government revenue but as an opportunity to either undertake mitigation measures – such as the reduction of transport emissions through emission free transport options, or to offset other tax burdens. Taxes on some resource uses while encouraging more efficient use are also a form of royalty which can generate significant sources of revenue for Government. These new revenue sources offer the opportunity to offset the taxes paid on other activities such as work or R&D. The Salvation Army believes that such a comprehensive approach to environmental taxes should be taken in order to maximise their value to the whole society and not just to the natural environment. TAXES TO SHIFT BEHAVIOURS: 33. We note the comments made in Future of Tax that ‘(U)nlike many other countries New Zealand does not use the tax system to deliberately modify behaviour – with the notable exceptions of alcohol and tobacco excise taxes which are intended to discourage drinking and smoking’ (p.5). The Salvation Army believes in general that such an approach is reasonable but that a case could be made for extending the use of taxation to modify behaviours (either of consumers or producers) around gambling and sugar consumption to name just two other social hazards. The Army however disputes that current excise taxes on alcohol actually modify drinking behaviours significantly and ask the TWG to reconsider current forms and levels of excise taxation on alcohol in order to modify harmful and risky drinking behaviours. 34. The Salvation Army has a long history in New Zealand and overseas for advocacy and treatment on alcohol related harm and issues. The Army itself promotes an abstinence policy for our Corps or church members based on our history as a Church, as well as on the Page 8 of 12 harmful effects of alcohol abuse for communities, families and individuals. xi We are also a leading provider addictions treatment, providing services to those facing alcohol and other drug addictions (Bridge services), or treatment to those suffering from gambling harm (Oasis services). Our abstinence policy does not limit or discriminate against our provision of these treatment services. The Bridge programme operates throughout New Zealand, Fiji, Tonga and now Samoa. Our residential programmes are run in six cities across New Zealand. Therefore, we have first-hand knowledge of the hugely damaging effects of alcohol abuse and addiction on New Zealand society, particularly on specific groups in society. For example, thirty-nine per cent of our Bridge clients in 2017 were of Maori descent. xii 35. The effects of alcohol harm and addiction are also evident as people use other services we provide. The needs and issues our clients face are becoming progressively more complex. For example, people often present to our service centres with a food welfare need (i.e. requiring food assistance or a food parcel). But their needs can be connected to an addiction to alcohol, other drugs or gambling, or to other multifaceted social issues like housing need (e.g. homelessness) or social disconnection. Alcohol harm, abuse and addiction can thus cause these other social issues, or be a result of these wider social issues. 36. In our 2018 State of the Nation report, Kei a tatou, we reported that even though alcohol consumption continues to decline on a per capita basis in New Zealand, problem or hazardous drinking has remained stable, particularly since the 2012 liquor law reforms. xiii The table below reports on hazardous drinking behaviours in our nation. xiv 37. The Salvation Army sees the harmful effects of this kind of drinking in various parts of our Corps/Church and social services across the country. Kei a tatou also reported that thirty- seven percent of Maori over 50 engage in hazardous drinking behaviours. xv This is almost in line with our own Salvation Army statistics wherein thirty-nine percent of our Bridge clients in 2017 were Maori. xvi Hazardous drinking is clearly detrimental to our communities, and especially to specific parts of our society. More specifically, alcohol harm is usually very prevalent for the communities we often work closely with in the lower socioeconomic areas of our country. Most of our Bridge services working with those with alcohol addictions and issues work primarily with the individual themselves. However, there are aspects of our services that work with or are open to the individual’s whanau and social connections, such as our Recovery Church services. Page 9 of 12 38. Other groups in New Zealand civil society have effectively quantified the various costs of alcohol-related harm and abuse for our nation, particularly for people other than the drinker themselves. For example the New Zealand Medical Association (NZMA), in 2015, published a policy briefing paper titled Reducing Alcohol-related Harm. xvii In this paper, the NZMA plainly noted that alcohol-related health and social harms constitute a significant burden in New Zealand. These harms are incurred by individual drinkers, those around them, as well as the wider society. Alcohol related harms are disproportionately high in selected population groups, particularly Māori and the most socio-economically deprived. xviii The NZMA then published a powerful pictorial representation of some of the very damaging effects of alcohol on the wider community: xix 39. In 2009, The Salvation Army released Excising Excess: Options for using alcohol taxes to reduce New Zealanders’ harmful drinking. xx This report contended that alcohol excise tax should be focussed on reducing alcohol-related harm, rather than just collecting tax revenue for the Government. 40. For the purposes of the TWG’s Inquiry, we recommend that alcohol excise tax rates should increase by at least 25 to 50 per cent. This is in line with our recommendations from 2009 in Excising Excess. But this approach is also based on: 41. Increasing the price of alcohol – Any increase in excise tax will logically result in an increase in the price of alcohol. Consumers are price sensitive and there is a clear link between price and alcohol consumption and also alcohol related harm. The Law Commission states that \[p\]utting up the price of alcohol will reduce alcohol-related harm. It will also help to pay for the costs to society of those harms. The widespread availability of cheap alcohol products Page 10 of 12 has encouraged excessive and harmful consumption of alcohol. It is cheap products that are most favoured by heavy, harmful and young drinkers. xxi 42. Reducing alcohol-related harm – This should be the focus of the alcohol excise tax regime. The Law Commission advocated for 50 per cent increase in alcohol excise tax as a key method of reducing alcohol-related harm in New Zealand. xxii Ideally, these alcoholic beverages should be taxed on their alcohol content because it is the alcoholic content that leads to the various harms we see daily in our work across New Zealand. 43. Ensuring the excise regime is fair – The excise regime is fractured and could potentially be leading to missed tax revenue being collected because there is little consistency across the regime. In Excising Excess, we noted the discrepancy between wine and other alcoholic beverages which could lead to lost tax revenue. We support a review of this regime, particularly to ensure the fairness of collecting and enforcing this tax. 44. Combatting myths – There are some arguments that alcohol taxes are bad for the economy and would cause a decrease in economic growth. We contend that people who would not purchase alcohol, or buy less alcohol, because of price sensitivity would still have that money to use and therefore continue to purchase other products in the economy. Additionally, there will be other economic benefits from this increase in price, including greater employee productivity, less resources being committed to addressing alcohol-related harm, less stress on hospitals, police and emergency services, and so on. 45. Financial and physical capital – As mentioned earlier, the financial costs of alcohol related harm are approximately $5 billion per year for our nation. This harm has a massive impact on the physical and financial capital of our nation, especially since the cost of this harm is usually significantly more than the excise collected on alcohol, and the huge stress alcohol-related harm places on our infrastructure, most notably hospitals. 46. Natural capital – Foreseeably, increased taxes would lead to reduced consumption and therefore production of alcohol. This would impact the water supply and other natural resources involved in the production process. 47. Social capital – Increased taxes will definitely affect our nation and society. Alcohol-related harm disproportionately impacts on Maori and Pacific communities, thereby disturbing their development as strong communities. Furthermore, there has been a lot of attention by the media, researchers and the wider public on the drinking culture, or binge drinking culture, in our nation. Increasing the tax excise on alcohol would signal to our nation that the severe influence of alcohol-related harm will no longer be tolerated and accepted, and that change is clearly needed. 48. Human capital – We have already stated above the impacts this harm has on people, particularly those from lower socioeconomic groups, and the more marginalised and vulnerable of society. Increasing alcohol tax excise should, in our opinion, lead to greater investment on Page 11 of 12 funding alcohol treatment and addictions services to ensure all of our citizens and communities are as strong as possible. HYPOTHECATING TAXES: 49. The Salvation Army supports the idea of hypothecating taxes where such taxes are collected against specific goods as excise taxes. The most obvious examples presently are around fuel, gambling, tobacco and alcohol. 50. The Army supports the continuation of the Health Promotion Agency (HPA) and Problem Gambling levies. The HPA levy is vital to ensure that quality information and data, principally around reducing personal, social and economic harm, is provided for the public to endorse health and wellbeing in our communities. If the tax excise on alcohol is increased and also based on alcohol or ethanol content, then this HPA levy will also increase, meaning that their important work can continue. 51. However, we submit that increases in this tax regime should also lead to funding services and programmes working directly on alcohol-related harm issues. We have mentioned in Paragraph 40 the cancellation of funding for our Hauora programme with the Mongrel Mob. Such taxes as alcohol excise tax revenue should be directed to treatment and addictions services, in order to improve on the wellbeing of those facing these alcohol-related issues and addictions. CONCLUSIONS: 52. The Salvation Army welcomes this opportunity to comment on the preliminary work of the TWG and will take part in further rounds of the Group’s consultation and review. The Army believes that tax policies are a powerful tool to achieving a New Zealand which is more prosperous, fairer and safer. We believe that New Zealand will be a more prosperous country if we can change the focus of our taxation away from income, effort and production and toward wealth, consumption and resource use. We believe that a shift in emphasis away from taxing low incomes earned from wages and toward the benefits of owning significant wealth will make New Zealand a fairer society. We believe too that taxing social hazards and using these taxes to educate and in some cases treat those most afflicted by these social hazards will make New Zealand a safer place. Additionally, we submit that a tax system that is as simple and easily understood by New Zealanders is the most beneficial type of system. This type of system would also be cheaper to administer for the Government, and easier to manoeuver for the tax payer. We ask the TWG to cast its attention to these broader goals rather than just to the mechanisms of or barriers to collecting taxes.
