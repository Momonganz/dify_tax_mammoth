The proposed amendments give effect to reforms outlined in the government discussion document GST and financial services, which was released in October 2002. Registered persons that do not want to incur the compliance costs associated with the new amendments may elect to treat the supply of financial services as exempt. Application date The amendments will apply from a date to be set by Order in Council which will be no earlier than 12 months after the enactment of the legislation introduced in the bill. This will allow sufficient time for implementation of the changes. Key features • Section 11A(1)(q) allows financial service providers that are registered for GST to zero-rate supplies of financial services to customers that are registered for GST if the level of taxable supplies made by the customer, 1 in a given 12-month period, is equal to or exceeds 75 percent their total supplies for the period. • Section 11A(1)(r) allows zero-rating of financial services that are supplied by financial service providers to customers that may not meet the 75 percent threshold but are part of a group that does meet the threshold in a given 12 month period – for example, the treasury or finance function of a group of companies. • Financial services supplied to customers that have a significant activity of making exempt supplies (more than 25 percent of their total supplies) or supplied to customers that are not registered for GST will not be able to be zero- rated. • Section 11D allows taxpayers to zero-rate supplies of financial services under sections 11A(1)(q) and/or (r) based on either actual figures for their customers’ levels of taxable supplies or by estimating their customers’ level of taxable supplies using a method approved by the Commissioner. • New section 11C allows registered persons to elect to treat supplies of financial services as exempt if they give written notice of their election to the Commissioner. 1 Excluding supplies of financial services zero-rated under sections 11A(1)(q) and/or (r). 4 • Section 20C allows for an additional deduction from output tax for supplies of financial services made by a financial service provider to another financial service provider, which in turn makes supplies to a business that qualifies to receive zero-rated financial services. The amount that the first financial service provider can deduct will be determined by the ratio of taxable to non-taxable supplies made by the recipient financial services provider. • Section 26B will require adjustments to input tax or output tax if there is an error in determining whether a customer is eligible to receive zero-rated financial services. • Sections 21G and 21H are amended to disallow one-off input tax adjustments for assets that are applied principally for the purpose of making taxable supplies as a result of the new zero-rating rules. • Section 3A(2)(c) is amended to disallow second-hand goods input tax credits for goods purchased to make supplies which are zero-rated under either section 11A(1)(q) and/or (r). Background The term “financial services” covers a wide range of transactions including the provision of loans, the taking of deposits, trading in financial securities such as shares and debentures, the provision of life insurance and charging interest on goods sold on credit. Businesses involved in the supply of financial services are also varied and include banking institutions, credit unions, financiers, life insurers, and, to a lesser degree, retailers and other businesses that sell goods on credit. For GST purposes the term “financial services” is broadly defined by section 3 of the GST Act. It is this definition, without any further amendment, that will apply for the purposes of the zero-rating proposals. Since 1 October 1986, the date that GST first applied to goods and services supplied in New Zealand, supplies of financial services have been exempt from GST. 2 This means that GST is not charged on the supply of financial services and the supplier is unable to recover any GST paid on purchases used in making the supply. Exemption is used in a GST system as a substitute for taxing supplies of goods and services when the usual method for taxing those goods and services is impractical. Instead of directly taxing the supply of financial services, tax is collected when a financial service provider purchases goods and services to produce financial services. This departs from the usual operation of GST, which ensures that each time tax is paid in the supply chain businesses receive a credit (input tax credit) to offset the tax. Input tax credits allow GST to roll forward until the goods and services are purchased by a consumer that is unable to recover the GST. As it is the financial services provider that bears the GST cost instead of the private consumer, exemption creates the following problems: 2 Financial services that are supplied to non-residents that are outside New Zealand at the time of supply are treated as exports and are eligible for zero-rating. 5 • Tax cascades: When a supplier of financial services cannot recover the GST paid on purchased goods and services, the irrecoverable GST forms part of the cost of production. The financial service provider faces a choice: raise the price of the services or absorb the GST cost. If it passes the cost on to businesses through higher prices, those businesses face the same choice: pass on or absorb the tax cost. The result of these choices along the supply chain to the final consumer may be increased prices or reduced profits. This effect is known as “tax cascading” and is illustrated in figure 1. Figure 1: How tax cascades arise As the GST cannot be recovered from the transaction between Business A and the financial intermediary, the GST is included in the cost of the financial service supplied by the financial intermediary to Business B. This higher cost may then be passed through to the products sold by Business B to its customers. • Self-supply bias: Rather than make the decision to absorb or pass on the cost of GST, the financial services provider may attempt to minimise the impact of GST by “self-supplying” essential activities rather than acquiring those same goods and services from third parties (which would be subject to GST). These identified problems could be removed by taxing all financial services. This, however, has proven to be problematic as overseas studies, such as that undertaken in the European Union in relation to cash flow taxation, have shown. This is because financial services can either be charged for directly (for example, through bank fees) or indirectly through the inclusion of the intermediation costs of the service in the suppliers’ margins (for example, in the interest rate margin). In the case of interest rate margins, the value of the financial intermediation fee is difficult to determine. If the policy decision were made just to tax fee-based income, a high degree of substitutability between direct and indirect charges would remain and would undermine the ability to apply GST successfully to financial services. Given this constraint, the government outlined in the discussion document GST and financial services, released in October 2002, proposals to zero-rate financial services supplied between financial services providers and other businesses. Zero-rating business-to-business supplies has the advantage of removing the potential for tax cascades to arise while dealing with the valuation and identification problems that make the application of GST to financial transactions difficult. It also means that financial supplies to businesses will be treated in much the same way for GST purposes as non-financial transactions, as illustrated in figure 2. The treatment of Financial intermediary Business A Business B Final consumer GST Exempt GST No input tax credit No input tax credit No input tax credit as GST is not charged 6 financial services supplied to final consumers will remain unchanged in that such supplies will remain exempt from GST. Zero-rating means that GST at the rate of zero-percent is charged rather than the standard rate of 12.5 percent. By charging GST, albeit at the rate of zero-percent, the supply of financial services will be treated as a taxable supply (rather than as an exempt supply, as is currently the case) and the supplier will be able to claim back GST paid on purchases used in supplying the financial services. Figure 2: Comparison of the treatment of taxable supplies and exempt supplies under current and proposed legislation Current treatment 1. Supply of taxable goods and services by Business B 2. Supply of financial services by financial intermediary Proposed treatment 3. Supply of financial services by financial intermediary Under the proposal, the supply of financial services by the financial intermediary to Business C is equivalent to a supply of standard-rated goods and services. Financial intermediary Business A Business C Final consumer GST Zero-rated GST Business B Business A Business C GST Input tax credit GST GST Final consumer Input tax credit No input tax credit Financial intermediary Business A Business C GST No input tax credit Exempt GST Final consumer No input tax credit No input tax credit as supply is exempt Input tax credit allowed No input tax credit as GST is charged at the rate of zero percent No input tax credit 7 Detailed analysis Overview The purpose of the proposed amendments is therefore to address concerns with the current exempt treatment of financial services. The potential for overtaxation in the business sector has led to the proposal to zero-rate business-to-business supplies. The aim, however, is not to remove the problems caused by exemption entirely, as exemption plays an important role in ensuring that the consumption of financial services by final consumers is at least taxed in part, even if indirectly by not allowing financial services providers full recovery of their GST costs. The proposed amendments are directed at setting out the general conditions under which supplies of financial services may be zero-rated. The GST Act provides comprehensive rules for the deduction of input tax. In conjunction with administrative guidelines these are considered adequate to address how input tax may be recovered from zero-rating financial services. General application New section 11A(1)(q) provides that the supply of financial services from financial services providers to business customers may be zero-rated if the customer is a GST- registered person who has an activity of making taxable supplies 3 that equal or exceed 75 percent of their total supplies in a 12-month period. Financial services will not be zero-rated if: • The services are supplied to businesses that have more than an incidental activity of making exempt supplies of financial services and other non-financial exempt supplies, that is, exempt supplies exceed 25 percent of total supplies; or • The services are supplied to non-registered persons (or final consumers). When determining whether a supply of financial services may be zero-rated the financial services provider will need to know whether the customer is GST registered and the customer’s ratio of taxable supplies to total supplies. The determination of the taxable status of a customer will be made by the financial services provider. New section 11D will allow registered persons to zero-rate supplies of financial services based on either actual figures for their customers’ levels of taxable supplies or on estimations of their customers’ total level of taxable supplies that are obtained using a method approved by the Commissioner. The reason for this is that the difference between zero-rating and exemption can generally be described as the respective ability or inability of financial services providers to claim input tax credits. The deduction of input tax credits is a matter for the financial services provider to determine – not the recipient. As far as the recipient of a financial service is concerned, GST does not currently apply to the receipt of financial services, and this position will remain with zero-rating. 3 Excluding supplies of financial services zero-rated under sections 11A(1)(q) and/or (r). 8 New section 11C allows registered persons to elect to treat supplies of financial services as exempt if they give written notice of their election to the Commissioner. This allows financial services providers to assess, in less straightforward situations, the trade-off between the benefits of zero-rating and the compliance costs associated with identifying the customer and determining the customer’s mix of taxable and non- taxable supplies. Figure 3 illustrates the questions that should be considered when determining whether a supply of financial services should be zero-rated. Guidelines are being prepared by Inland Revenue to assist taxpayers in determining when supplies of financial services may be zero-rated. Figure 3: Applying the proposed zero-rating of domestic business-to-business supplies of financial services \* Administrative rules are being developed by Inland Revenue to assist in determining whether customers are appropriately categorised as businesses that are entitled to receive zero-rated financial supplies. The main determinant should be the nature of the customer’s business. Thus: – A customer that is a financial intermediary or a supplier of residential accommodation would not generally be categorised as entitled to receive zero-rated supplies as it is reasonable to expect that the volume of exempt supplies and zero-rated financial services would exceed 25 percent of its total turnover. – Most manufacturers, primary producers and retailers, on the other hand, would be expected to be entitled to receive zero-rated supplies. – Businesses that make a mixture of taxable and exempt supplies such as general and life insurers will need to be categorised on a case-by-case basis. Is the supply a supply of financial services as defined in section 3 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985? Zero-rating does not apply Yes Yes No Is the recipient a registered person or reasonably expected to be a registered person? Is the recipient a person who makes, or is estimated to make, taxable supplies that represent 75% or more of their total supplies?\* Zero-rating applies Yes No No 9 Supplies of financial services to special purpose vehicles or group finance operations The application of new section 11A(1)(q) could mean that some financial services supplied to businesses would not be zero-rated because they are received by: • an entity that is not registered for GST but is part of a group of which some or all of the members are GST registered; or • an entity of this nature that is primarily concerned with the financial activities of the group. In either case, the entity itself may not be entitled to receive zero-rated supplies but might be if the total activities of the group were taken into account. To address this issue new section 11A(1)(r) allows a registered person to “look through” the entity that contractually receives the financial services to the wider group. Provided that the wider group is a group for the purposes of section IG 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and meets the 75 percent test, the supply of financial services to the recipient entity may be treated as zero-rated. Treatment of supplies of financial services between financial institutions Financial services supplied by a financial institution to another financial institution would not be zero-rated under new section 11A(1)(q) as it is expected that most financial institutions will not satisfy the requirement that 75 percent of their supplies are taxable supplies. However, it is recognised that denying the benefits of zero- rating in this situation will mean that the objective of removing the overtaxation of businesses is not met in the instance of the second financial institution supplying financial services to a business customer. To address this, new sections 20(3)(h) and 20C provide an additional deduction to the first financial institution to the extent that the second financial institution makes supplies to taxable businesses. This level of relief will be calculated according to the formula: x b x d c e where― a. is the total input tax that the registered person would be able to deduct, other than under new section 20(3)(h), in respect of the taxable period if all supplies of financial services by the registered person were taxable supplies: b. is the total value of exempt supplies of financial services by the registered person to the recipient financial services provider in respect of the taxable period: c. is the total value of supplies by the registered person in respect of the taxable period: d. is the total value of taxable supplies the recipient financial services provider in respect of the taxable period: e. is the total value of supplies by the direct supplier in respect of the taxable period. a 10 The formula provides a deduction that is proportional to the total deduction that would be allowed if all supplies of financial services were taxable supplies. The proportion is found by multiplying two fractions. The first fraction is the proportion of the total value of supplies made by the registered person that consists of exempt supplies of financial services to a recipient financial services provider. The second fraction is the proportion of the total value of supplies made by the recipient financial services provider that consists of taxable supplies. For practical reasons, the formula is limited to the activities of the second financial services provider. Consideration was given as to whether the formula should be extended for financial services provided to taxable businesses further down the chain. As a result of consultation, however, it was considered that any analysis of the potential tax cascade that would arise in these circumstances would be too difficult and would very likely in any event give rise to substantial compliance costs for limited benefit. The proposed treatment of supplies of financial services between financial intermediaries is illustrated in figure 4. Figure 4: Supplies of financial services between financial services providers 1. Standard-rated supply by Financial intermediary B 2. Zero-rated supply of financial services by financial intermediary B Supplies of financial services from Financial intermediary A to Financial intermediary B are treated as exempt supplies. Financial intermediary B is unable to recover any input tax in respect of these supplies of financial services from Financial intermediary A, as GST is not charged. To recognise the standard-rated taxable supplies made by Business A, Financial intermediary A is able to claim a proportional input tax credit, provided that Financial intermediary B provides the required information to Financial intermediary A. Financial intermediary B Financial intermediary A Business A Final consumer Exempt GST GST No input tax credit No input tax credit (as exempt supplies received) Input tax credit as GST at 12.5% charged Proportional input tax credit Financial intermediary B Financial intermediary A Business A Final consumer Exempt Zero-rated GST No input tax credit No input tax credit (as exempt supplies received) No Input tax credit as GST at 0% charged Proportional input tax credit 11 Deduction of input tax and apportionment The main tax effect of the proposed zero-rating of financial services supplied to businesses will be an increased recovery of input tax for financial service providers. The current section 21A sets out the methods of allocating input tax credits to making taxable and other (including exempt) supplies. Actual use: This method of allocation requires the taxpayer to directly attribute the use of the goods and services to the extent that those goods and services are used for a purpose of making taxable supplies. Turnover method: This method is used in cases where the actual use method it is too difficult to apply – for example, in the case of overhead expenses. The formula as shown in the legislation, is: Total value of exempt supplies for taxable period Total value of all supplies for taxable period An alternative (or special) method: This method is available, provided that the Commissioner approves it, if its use results in allocated amounts that are fair and reasonable in comparison with actual use. In all cases, section 21A requires that the method of allocation used must result in a fair and reasonable allocation of input tax credits between taxable and other supplies. To address specific issues with apportioning input tax credits, Inland Revenue is working on guidelines to assist with the implementation of the proposed legislation. Adjustments It is expected that differences will arise in the level of input tax recovery that is claimed for a given period based on the registered person’s determination of its customer base and the level of recovery that should actually have been made for the period. New section 26B addresses this by requiring an adjustment to be made if a registered person has made a return based on an amount relating to supplies made by another person and an inaccuracy in the figure for the amount has affected the accuracy of the return. If this has resulted in an excessive input tax credit recovery output tax is payable in respect of the excess. If the result is an under-recovery of input tax credits then further input tax credits are allowed. The Commissioner can relieve the taxpayer from making an adjustment if satisfied that the taxpayer’s estimated result gives an overall result for zero-rated supplies under sections 11A(1)(q) and/or (r) and/or deductions under section 20C that is not significantly greater than the result that would arise if actual rather than estimated figures were used. 12 New section 26B requires the adjustment to be made either in the taxable period in which the inaccuracy becomes apparent or in a later period that is acceptable to the Commissioner. It is expected that Inland Revenue is preparing guidelines for what later period or periods are acceptable. Other matters Exported financial services The proposals do not affect the current treatment of exported financial services. One-off change in use adjustments Remedial changes are proposed to sections 21G and 21H to preclude one-off changes in the use of assets held at the time that sections 11A(1)(q) and 11A(1)(r) take effect. These changes in use must instead be made on a period-by-period basis, even if there has been a change in the principal purpose from one of making non-taxable supplies to one of making taxable supplies. This is intended to mitigate the revenue loss of the proposals. Second-hand goods input tax credits Changes are proposed to the definition of “input tax” in section 3A(1)(c) to preclude second-hand goods input tax credits being claimed for purchases of goods which are used to make zero-rated supplies of financial services under sections 11A(1)(q) and (r). This is intended to mitigate the revenue loss of the proposals. Tax invoices For the purposes of zero-rating supplies of financial services it will not be necessary to issue a tax invoice. The purpose of the tax invoice is to provide verification that tax has been charged on a supply of goods and services received by the recipient especially in the case when a supply is charged with GST at the standard rate of 12.5% and the recipient would be entitled to claim an input tax credit. For a supply of financial services the amount of input tax that could be claimed by a recipient is nil, whether the supply is treated as exempt or zero-rated. To require financial services providers to issue a tax invoice under these conditions would needlessly increase compliance costs. 13 GST ON IMPORTED SERVICES: INTRODUCING A REVERSE CHARGE (Clauses 101, 102, 104(1), 105, 106, 107, 108, 109(1), (3) & (4), 110, 113(1)-(4) & (6), 117, 118, 121, 122, 123 and 124) Summary of proposed amendments The amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act) will introduce a “reverse charge” mechanism to tax certain imports of services. The reverse charge will require GST registered recipients of supplies of imported services to self-assess GST on the value of the services if: • the services are not acquired by a person who makes taxable supplies that represent 95 percent or more of total supplies; and • the supply of those services, if made in New Zealand by a registered person, would be a taxable supply. This means that if a registered person acquires services that would be subject to GST if supplied in New Zealand and for which the recipient would not have received a full, 4 or any, input tax credit, the recipient will be required to add GST to the price of the services and return the GST to Inland Revenue. The recipient of a supply of imported services will be treated as the person who made the supply for the purpose of imposing and enforcing the reverse charge and for determining whether the GST registration threshold is exceeded. For all other purposes in the GST Act the recipient of a supply of imported services will remain the recipient, rather than the supplier, of the services. Amendments are also being made for the purpose of applying the reverse charge to related party internal charges. Such charges will exclude amounts relating to salaries and interest. Application date The amendments introducing the reverse charge will apply from a date to be set by Order in Council. It is expected that the amendments will come into effect no earlier than 12 months after the enactment of the legislation introduced in the bill, to allow sufficient time for implementation of the changes. 4 I.e. An input tax credit is received and no adjustments are required for non-taxable use under sections 21 – 21D. 14 Key features The approach adopted in the legislation is based on treating certain imported services as being supplied in New Zealand and deeming the recipient of those services to be their supplier rather than on a separate code for imported services. The two key provisions are: Section 8(4B): This contains a new place of supply rule for imported services. It provides that there will be a supply of services in New Zealand if: • services are supplied by a non-resident supplier to a recipient who is a New Zealand resident; • the services are acquired by a person who, in a 12-month period which includes the date the services are supplied, makes supplies of which less than 95 percent in total value are taxable supplies; and • the supply of the services would be a taxable supply if it were made in New Zealand by a registered person in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity. Section 5B: This treats the supply of imported services to which section 8(4B) applies as having been made by the recipient of those services for the purposes of certain sections. It also treats the services as having been supplied by the recipient in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the recipient. Therefore the value of imported services supplied to a person will be included in the total value of supplies made by that person for the purposes of determining liability to register for GST under section 51. Although businesses making exempt supplies in New Zealand will usually be registered for GST in any event, the reverse charge may require others to register – in particular, any person importing services exceeding $40,000 in value in a 12-month period as a private consumer. In addition to these key sections, other features of the legislation are: • Section 55(7A), which, for the purposes of supplies subject to section 8(4B), disregards the GST effects of grouping (overriding section 55(7)) for supplies made by a non-resident member of a group to a New Zealand resident member of a group. • Section 56B, which, for the purposes of supplies subject to section 8(4B) and in relation to a person deems the following: – a branch or division outside New Zealand to be a separate person and a non-resident; – activities carried on by that non-resident person to be carried on independently by that person; – a branch or division inside New Zealand to be a separate person and resident in New Zealand; – activities carried on by that person resident in New Zealand to be carried on independently by that person; and 15 – a head office to be a branch or division. • Section 9(2)(a)(iv), which ensures that the time of supply for a supply of services between associated parties which is subject to section 8(4B) will be the earliest of: – when an invoice is issued; – when payment is made in respect of the supply; or – the end of the taxable period that includes the date which is two months after the recipient’s balance date for the year the service was performed. • Section 10(2A), which provides that, for the purpose of a supply to which section 8(4B) applies, the value of the supply is equal to the consideration for the supply. This amendment ensures that section 8(1) charges GST on the amount of the consideration for the supply, meaning the consideration for the supply is GST-exclusive in the same way as for imported goods. • Section 10(3B), which provides that, for the purposes of a supply between associated parties to which section 8(4B) applies, the recipient does not value supplies at market value when the payment for those services is an allowable deduction to the recipient. This is similar to section GD 13 of the Income Tax Act 1994. • Sections 10(15C), which provides that the value of related party internal charges that are to be subject to the reverse charge under section 8(4B) is reduced by the value of any salary or interest component in the internal charge. Background The current GST treatment of imported services Unlike imported goods, most services imported into New Zealand are not subject to GST. When GST was introduced in 1986 it was decided that the tax would not apply to imports of services, even though both imports of goods and services are generally included in the GST base. This treatment was adopted as most services were consumed in the jurisdictions in which they were produced. Legal and technological constraints either prevented international trade in services altogether or made it uneconomic. The volume of services imported into New Zealand at the time was low, and the exclusion of imported services from the GST base was therefore seen to be relatively non- distortionary. The compliance and administration costs associated with imposing GST on imported services at the time outweighed the revenue gain and the benefits from removing the distortions that non-taxation would create. The need for reform The review of the GST treatment of imported services was included in the government’s tax policy work programme for 2001-2002, prompted by increased volumes of imported services. Deregulation of the telecommunications and financial services markets in New Zealand, coupled with the rapid advances in communication and computer technology driving electronic commerce, have increased the ability to 16 consume in New Zealand at a reduced cost a wide range of services that have been produced offshore. The government’s electronic commerce strategy, as set out in the strategy paper E- Commerce: Building the Strategy for New Zealand, also identified addressing the GST treatment of imported services as a key part of ensuring that New Zealand’s regulatory environment takes into account electronic commerce. 5 The growth in the volume of imported services exacerbates the distortions caused by the non-taxation of imported services and undermines the competitiveness of New Zealand service industries. It also has the potential to undermine the GST base. The competitive distortions arise because New Zealand service providers making supplies in New Zealand are required to charge GST, while non-resident service providers in the same situation are not. New Zealand service providers are therefore currently at a disadvantage compared to non-resident service providers. The price differential that the differing tax treatment causes may distort consumption decisions. The majority of other countries with a GST/VAT system have a tax on imported services. There are benefits to be gained from having a tax treatment of cross-border supplies of goods and services similar to that of our trading partners. By not taxing imports of services the New Zealand GST system allows those services to avoid any impost of consumption tax, as such supplies would not have been taxed when exported from the jurisdiction in which they originated. The increasing mobility of the supply of services and advances in electronic commerce mean that purchasing services supplied offshore will become more common. Although the tax base is not threatened at present by the fact that GST is not applied to imported services, a significant revenue risk may arise in the future. 6 Discussion document – GST and imported services: a challenge in an electronic commerce environment On 27 June 2001 the Government released a tax policy discussion document addressing the GST treatment of imported services – GST and imported services: a challenge in an electronic commerce environment. This document proposed the introduction of a “reverse charge” mechanism to tax imports of services by businesses. The reverse charge would require businesses acquiring services from offshore to self-assess and return GST on the value of supplies they have received. To minimise compliance and administrative costs for businesses, the reverse charge would apply only to those businesses which acquire services for other than taxable purposes (mainly financial institutions). The reverse charge is intended to alleviate the current distortion in favour of imported services created by the non-taxation of imported services compared to the taxation of domestically supplied services. It also aligns New Zealand’s GST system with that of 5 E-Commerce: Building the Strategy for New Zealand, November 2000, page 15. 6 For example, globally, electronic commerce is predicted to reach approximately US$ 600 billion in trade by 2004-05, or roughly eight percent of all global trade (OECD Presentation: Electronic Commerce - Answering the Taxation Challenges, Tokyo OECD / Pacific Island Forum Conference, February 2001). 17 most other countries with a VAT or GST system and the treatment of services with that of goods. Detailed analysis The place of supply rule General scheme The proposed imported services legislation has been integrated as far as possible with the general GST provisions. The approach is based on treating certain imported services as being supplied in New Zealand and deeming the recipient of those services to be their supplier. This is in contrast to introducing a separate code, which would require far more detailed legislation as many existing provisions of the Act would need to be replicated. The key provisions of the proposed legislation are new section 8(4B), containing the place of supply rule for imported services, and new section 5B, which treats the supply of imported services to which new section 8(4B) applies as having been made by the natural recipient of those services for the purposes of certain sections. This commentary uses the terms “natural supplier”, “natural recipient” and “deemed supplier”: the first term refers to the non-resident supplier and the second and third terms refer to the New Zealand resident recipient of the imported services, who is required to apply the reverse charge. Application of section 8(4B) Section 8(4B) treats a supply as being made in New Zealand if: • the services are supplied by a non-resident supplier to a recipient who is a resident; • the services are not acquired by a person who makes taxable supplies that, in a 12-month period that includes the date the supply is made, represent 95 percent or more of total supplies; and • the supply of the services would be a taxable supply if it were made in New Zealand by a registered person in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity. Therefore supplies of services that would be exempt supplies if made in New Zealand will not be subject to the reverse charge. It is important to note that, as explained below, section 8(4B) refers to the natural supplier and recipient of services, not the deemed supplier. Section 8(1), which imposes the liability to GST does, however, refer to the deemed supplier so that the liability to return GST is imposed on the New Zealand resident natural recipient of the supply. 18 Application of section 5B Section 5B deems the natural recipient of services to be the deemed supplier of those services in certain circumstances. For the purposes of certain listed sections in the GST Act, section 5B treats a supply of services to which section 8(4B) applies as having been made by the recipient of those services in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the recipient. Therefore the value of imported services supplied to a person will be included in the total value of supplies made by that person for the purposes of determining liability to register for GST. A person who makes no other taxable supplies in New Zealand may be required to register as a result of importing in excess of $40,000 of services in a 12-month period. For the purposes of sections not listed in section 5B, a supply of services to which section 8(4B) applies continues to be treated as having been made by the natural supplier of those services. It is therefore important to note that for the purposes of the sections not listed in new section 5B, references to “supplier” (and a supply being made by a person) and “recipient” will refer only to the natural supplier and natural recipient. The most important provisions when the supplier (and recipient) references are to the natural supplier (and natural recipient) are sections 9 and 10. The time and value of supply provisions would not work if the supplier references did not refer to the natural supplier because, even though there may be a deemed supplier for the purposes of certain provisions, there is still only the one supply of imported services. The sections for which section 5B applies to treat the natural recipient as the deemed supplier are: Section Topic 8(1) Imposition of tax. 15 Taxable periods. 15A Change in registered person’s taxable period. 19A Requirements for accounting on payments basis. 20(4) Calculation of tax payable: output tax. 20B Allocation of taxable supplies following investigation by Commissioner. 25AA Adjustments if contract for supply of imported services changed. 51 Persons making supplies in course of taxable activity to be registered. 52 Cancellation of registration. 57 Unincorporated bodies. 75 Keeping of records. 76(6) Avoidance: 12-month period. 78 Effect of imposition or alteration of tax. 78B Adjustments to tax payable for persons furnishing returns on payments basis following change in rate of tax. 78BA Adjustments to tax payable in relation to credit and debit notes following change in rate of tax. 78C Change in accounting basis coinciding with or occurring after change in rate of tax. 19 Most provisions do not require any amendment to cater for the reverse charge. For example, Parts VI and VII of the GST Act, dealing with recovery of tax and refunds and relief from tax, are not based on the concept of a supply and therefore can be applied unchanged to the reverse charge. Figure 1: Example of the operation of the reverse charge Offshore Computer Company NZ Life Insurance Company NZ$1 million NZ Inland Revenue Computer Programming Services New ZealandOffshore NZ$125,000 GST Example 1: The application of sections 8(4B) and 5B An offshore computer company makes a supply of programming services to a NZ life insurance company (see diagram 1 above). NZ life insurance company makes solely exempt supplies of services. The NZ life insurance company is charged $1 million for the services, which it pays on receipt of the services. An invoice is provided after payment is made. The two companies are not associated persons. Applying sections 8(4B) and 5B to the simple example in figure 1: • The services are supplied by a non-resident supplier to a resident recipient. • The services are not acquired by a person making taxable supplies amounting to 95 percent or more of total supplies. • The supply of the services would be a taxable supply if it were made in New Zealand by a registered person in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity. Therefore section 8(4B) treats the supply as having been made in New Zealand, and section 8(1), in conjunction with section 5B, treats the natural recipient as the deemed supplier of the services. This requires the New Zealand life insurer to add GST to the value of the supply and return the GST to Inland Revenue. The value of the supply is $1 million (the consideration for the supply), so GST of $125,000 must be returned to Inland Revenue. 20 The operation of the reverse charge will not allow the life insurer in example 1 an input tax credit under section 3A, as it has imported services for a principal purpose other than that of making taxable supplies. Even though the imported services are a taxable supply with the life insurer as their deemed supplier, the services have still not been acquired by the life insurer as natural recipient for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, as the application of sections 3A and 5B require. Mixed-use acquisitions In some circumstances, a recipient of services subject to the reverse charge will be able to claim either an input tax credit under section 3A or change in use adjustments. This will occur when the services are not acquired by a solely non-taxable entity. For example, if a New Zealand company which principally (say, 70 percent), but not solely, makes exempt supplies, acquires services, the input tax credit adjustment provisions in section 21E would apply. Section 21E(1)(a) would be applicable because the New Zealand company acquires the imported services for the principal purpose other than that of making taxable supplies. Although the company is treated as the supplier under section 8(1), the company as the natural recipient has still acquired the services and section 5B does not apply. Section 21E(2)(a) would be applicable because tax has been charged under section 8(1) (as a result of the application of the reverse charge under sections 8(4B) and 5B) on the supply of services made to the company. Although the company is treated as the supplier under section 8(1), the supply has still been made to the company as the natural recipient and section 5B does not apply. Therefore section 21F would allow a deduction under section 20(3). A similar analysis would allow the company an input tax credit under section 3A(1)(a) if it has acquired imported services for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Figure 2: Application of the adjustment provisions Offshore Computer Company NZ Insurance Company NZ$1 million NZ Inland Revenue Computer Programming Services New ZealandOffshore NZ$125,000 GST Supplies of general insurance - taxable Supplies to non- businesses of life insurance - exempt 21 Example 2: Mixed-use acquisition – principally exempt An offshore computer company provides software to a New Zealand life insurance company for $1 million (see figure 2). Using a turnover approach, the software is used 70 percent for making exempt supplies of life insurance, and 30 percent for making taxable supplies of general insurance. Under the reverse charge, the life insurance company would, therefore, add GST to the $1 million, giving a figure of $1.125 million, and include the GST of $125,000 imposed under the reverse charge in its GST return. Because the life insurance company uses the software 30 percent for making taxable supplies, it is entitled to an input tax credit adjustment, and will be able to make a period-by-period deduction from its output tax liability. The life insurance company would not, however, include the $1.125 million as a supply it has made for the purposes of making the adjustment based on turnover. Example 3: Mixed-use acquisition – principally (but not 95 percent) taxable An offshore computer company provides software to a New Zealand life insurance company for $1 million (see figure 2). Using a turnover approach, the software is used 70 percent for making taxable supplies and 30 percent in making exempt supplies. The reverse charge will apply, as the software is not acquired by a company which makes taxable supplies amounting to 95 percent or more of total supplies. Under the reverse charge, the life insurance company would, therefore, add GST to the $1 million, giving a figure of $1.125 million, and include the GST of $125,000 imposed under the reverse charge in its GST return. The company will, however, be entitled to a full input tax credit of $125,000 on the importation of the services under section 3A, as they are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. It would then be required to make an adjustment on a period-by-period basis for exempt supplies made using the software. Time of supply rules The normal time of supply rules will generally apply for the purposes of the reverse charge. This will mean the time of supply for the reverse charge would be the earlier of when an invoice is issued or payment is made in respect of a supply, or when the services are performed if a supply is between associated persons and an invoice has not been issued, or payment received, before the relevant GST return is filed. A time of supply rule based on the performance of services may in some instances be problematic since the recipient may not be aware of the time the services are performed, especially when the services are performed on an ongoing basis or charged for at year’s end. For ongoing services this issue should be removed by adopting a test based on the time of payment in a similar manner to section 9(3), relating to agreements to hire. It is also proposed for the purposes of the reverse charge to ensure 22 that the reference to the time of performance in section 9(2)(a) will apply only if the issue of an invoice or making of payment have not occurred by the end of a given period – the taxable period that includes the date which is two months after the recipient’s balance date. This will mean that the time of supply for a supply of services between associated parties which is subject to section 8(4B) will be the earliest of: • when an invoice is issued; • when payment is made in respect of the supply; or • the end of the taxable period that includes the date which is two months after the recipient’s balance date for the year the services were performed. Example 4: Time of supply A (offshore parent company) and B (NZ subsidiary) are parts of a multinational group. Throughout a year (monthly) A supplies B with administrative and accounting services. B is registered for GST, accounts for GST on a two-monthly taxable period basis and makes solely exempt supplies. B is not charged for these services until after the end of each year, when a lump sum is charged for administrative and accounting services provided by the parent company to all members of the multinational group. The supply of services will be subject to the reverse charge as it is a supply that would be taxable in New Zealand and it is acquired by a business which makes taxable supplies amounting to less than 95 percent of total supplies. B’s balance date is 30 June, and the end of the taxable period that includes the date that is 2 months after B’s balance date is 31 August. The time of supply for the services could either be: Invoice: if A provides B with invoices/an invoice for the services provided before either payment is made or 31 August, the time of supply for the service/services will be when the invoice is issued. Payment: if B makes payment for the services before either the issue of invoices/an invoice for the supply/supplies or 31 August, the time of supply will be when the payment/payments are made. Taxable period following balance date: if neither an invoice is issued, nor payment made, before 31 August, then the time of supply will be 31 August. The supply will therefore be included in B’s GST return due on 30 September. 23 Value of supply The normal rules for determining the value of a supply will apply for the purposes of the reverse charge other than, in some circumstances, the rules for transactions between associated persons. Applying the normal rules would mean that the value of the supply would be either the actual consideration or the open market value of the supply if it is between associated persons and the actual consideration is less than the open market value of the supply. The use of the open market value rule for supplies between associated persons, however, could lead to an increase in compliance costs and potentially to a revenue loss if tax deductions resulting from the deemed value of supply were taken into account. The valuation of services for which there is no charge could, in particular, involve substantial compliance costs. To minimise any compliance costs and revenue loss, under new section 10(3B) the cost basis for supplies between associated parties will be required to be used if the consideration for the supply would be an allowable deduction to the New Zealand recipient under the Income Tax Act. Example 5: Value of supply As part of an international advertising campaign for a multinational group C (an offshore parent company) supplies D (a NZ subsidiary that makes only exempt supplies) with advertising services. As the advertising services are for a multinational group and most of the costs are absorbed and incurred in other countries in which the company operates, the New Zealand branch is not charged for the services, either explicitly or by way of a cost allocation from the head office. The supply of services will be subject to the reverse charge as it is a supply that would be taxable in New Zealand and it is acquired other than for solely taxable purposes. Prima facie, as C and D are associated persons, D would have to calculate the market value of the services it has received. However, section 10(3B) would apply so that an uplift in the value of supply to market value is not required, as the cost of the advertising services would have been a deduction for company D under the Income Tax Act 1994. The value of the supply would therefore be zero, and GST at 12.5% on this would result in a zero amount. Related party transactions General position In many instances, charges for services from an associated overseas business will be incorporated into a larger sum. This may be the case, for example, within a group of companies or single multi-national company, where the parent company or head office may allocate a proportion of its costs to the various parts of the enterprise or charge a management fee (referred to as “internal charges”). 24 The treatment of internal charges aims to achieve a balance between: • the objective of imposing the tax on services that, if not taxed, would give rise to distortions; • the need to ensure that the revenue base is maintained; and • the objective of minimising compliance and administration costs, limiting the extent to which the various components of the charge must be identified. The amendments aim to achieve this balance in part by excluding the salary and interest components of an internal charge so that only the remainder of the charge is subject to the reverse charge. A related issue is whether a New Zealand entity should be treated as distinct from its offshore parent or head office. This is problematic with branches, as a New Zealand branch, for example, is not a separate legal entity from its head office. The general approach proposed is to treat the New Zealand entity or presence as separate, but only in relation to supplies of services that would be taxable supplies if made in New Zealand by a registered person. This has required changes to the treatment of cross-border transactions between head offices and branches or members of groups of companies, as these are not usually treated as supplies for GST purposes. The proposals will ensure that New Zealand branches and subsidiaries are taxed in a similar manner. The treatment of related party transactions can therefore be summarised as follows: (i) Start from the principle that the reverse charge should apply to services which would be subject to GST if supplied in New Zealand by a GST registered person. (ii) Treat a New Zealand entity or presence as separate from its offshore presence in relation to the services described in (i). This requires: – treating a New Zealand branch of a non-resident company as a separate entity; and – not disregarding supplies within a group of companies. (iii) Calculate the amount of an internal charge that is to be subject to the reverse charge by taking the internal charge and identifying component supplies or values that are excluded from the ambit of the reverse charge – these include salaries, interest and also any other exempt supplies. Separating entities In respect of branches and head offices, new section 56B deems the following for the purposes of supplies subject to section 8(4B) in relation to a person: • a branch or division outside New Zealand to be a separate person and a non- resident; • activities carried on by that non-resident person as being carried on independently by that person; 25 • a branch or division inside New Zealand to be a separate person and resident in New Zealand; • activities carried on by that person resident in New Zealand as being carried on independently by that person; and • a head office to be a branch or division. In respect of groups of companies, section 55(7A) disregards the GST effects of grouping (overriding section 55(7)(a) and (c) to (dc)) for supplies made by a non- resident member of a group to a New Zealand resident member of a group for the purposes of supplies subject to section 8(4B). Related party charges Section 10(15C) provides that the value of related party services that are to be subject to the reverse charge under section 8(4B) is reduced by the value of any salary or interest charges from any member of a non-resident company’s wholly owned group under section IG 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 that form a part of an internal management services charge. Other exempt components will be excluded from the reverse charge more generally under section 8(4B)(c)(i). Example 6: Related party transaction E is the offshore head office of a multinational company. F is the New Zealand branch of the multinational company. The multinational company supplies financial services. E provides administrative, accounting and management services to F and to other branches in other countries. E recovers the cost of providing these services by making a cost allocation to each branch every year. F is debited with a cost allocation of $10 million, which covers administrative and management costs. Within the $10 million of administrative and management costs, there are the following cost components: Staff salaries: $5 million Financing (interest) costs: $1 million Administration costs: $1.5 million Management costs: $2.5 million Total cost allocation $10 million Supplies of administrative, accounting and management services are taxable supplies if made in New Zealand. F makes taxable supplies amounting to less than 95 percent of total supplies. Section 56B treats E and F as separate entities carrying on activities so, prima facie, the $10 million cost allocation is subject to the reverse charge. Under section 10(15C), however, components of a cost allocation that are attributable to salaries and interest incurred by E are excluded from the value of the cost allocation subject to the reverse charge. Therefore only $4 million of the cost allocation is subject to the reverse charge. 26 Example 6: Related party transaction – continued Therefore the amount subject to the reverse charge is: Staff salaries: 0 excluded Financing (interest) costs: 0 excluded Administration costs: $1.5 million Management costs: $2.5 million Total subject to reverse charge: $4 million GST at 12.5% Total GST to be returned: $500,000 Documentation requirements In the absence of invoices, alternative supporting documentation, such as a supply contract or record of payments made, will be allowed to substantiate the valuations adopted for the purposes of the reverse charge. New section 20(2)(d) allows input tax credits to be claimed on supplies subject to the reverse charge if sufficient records are kept as required by new section 24B. The section is also required so it can be ascertained whether output tax has been charged on the correct amount, particularly in relation to amounts excluded from the reverse charge under section 10(15C). Section 24B requires any recipient of a supply of services subject to section 8(4B) to maintain sufficient records of the supply to enable the following to be ascertained: • the name and address of the supplier; • the date on which, or the period during which, the supply was received; • a description of the services supplied; • the consideration for the supply; • the time by which payment of the consideration for the supply is due; and • the amount of the consideration for a supply that the taxpayer is excluding from the value of the supply under section 10(15C)(a) and (b). Digitised services The definition of “goods” will be amended so that supplies of imported digitised products, such as software provided over the Internet, will be treated as supplies of services and thus potentially subject to the reverse charge. This change will not affect persons who import no more than $40,000 of services in a 12-month period. Other minor changes The following changes to introduce the reverse charge are also being made to the GST Act: 27 • New section 25AA is inserted, as an equivalent to section 25 (credit/debit notes and adjustments relating to them) for the purposes of supplies subject to section 8(4B). • New section 11A(5), which excludes supplies subject to section 8(4B) from zero-rating under section 11A, is inserted. • New section 2A(1)(bb), which treats branches or divisions treated as separate persons under section 56B as associated persons, is inserted. • A definition of “non-resident” (a person who is not resident) is included for purposes of drafting style, and makes no substantive change to the law. All references to “not resident in New Zealand” in the GST Act are replaced by a reference to “non-resident”. 28 TRANS-TASMAN IMPUTATION (Clauses 9, 15, 39, 41-45, 47-50, 64, 66, 70, 77, 80-83, 93 and 96) Summary of proposed amendments Australia and New Zealand are reforming their imputation laws to reduce a longstanding problem of the double taxation, of certain trans-Tasman investments, known as “triangular tax”. This reflects the commitment of both governments to the continued strengthening of the Closer Economic Relations agreement and promoting trans-Tasman business by reducing the taxation impediments to operating in both countries. Australian and New Zealand shareholders of trans-Tasman companies that choose to take up these reforms will be allocated imputation credits representing New Zealand tax paid and franking credits representing Australian tax paid, in proportion to their ownership of the company. However, each country’s credits can be claimed only by its residents. New Zealand is introducing legislation incorporating Australian companies that wish to join New Zealand’s imputation rules as part of the joint Australia/New Zealand initiative. Similarly, on 29 May 2003 Australia introduced the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2003, which proposes legislation to incorporate New Zealand companies that wish to join Australia’s imputation rules. New Zealand is also introducing a new form of grouping for imputation purposes only which Australian companies may also join. This is an attempt to mitigate the problem that imputation credits cannot pass through companies resident in neither Australia nor New Zealand. Imputation grouping will enable any Australian or New Zealand company within a wholly owned group to pay an imputed dividend if tax has been paid, or imputation credits received from companies outside the group, by any Australian or New Zealand company within the group. It will not, therefore, be necessary to pay a dividend up the chain of companies for the top company to access imputation credits created further down the chain. Application dates The amendments enabling Australian companies to elect to maintain an imputation credit account apply from 1 April 2003 but the amendments allowing Australian companies to pay imputed dividends will apply from 1 October 2003. The imputation grouping rules also come in from 1 April 2003. 29 Key features New section ME 1B of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being inserted to allow Australian companies to elect to maintain an imputation credit account. New subpart FDB and a new definition in section OB1 are being added to set up the new concept known as “imputation grouping”. The rules are the same as currently apply for imputation of consolidated groups in sections ME 10 to ME 14. A new term, “consolidated imputation group”, is being added to incorporate imputation groups as well as existing consolidated groups that do not also join a imputation group. Background On 19 February 2003, the Australian Treasurer, Hon Peter Costello, and the New Zealand Minister of Finance and Revenue, Hon Dr Michael Cullen, announced that both countries had decided to adopt the pro rata allocation method to solve the longstanding “triangular tax” problem. This was after consultation on both sides of the Tasman following the joint release of the discussion document Trans-Tasman triangular tax on 6 March 2003. Within Australia and New Zealand, “triangular tax” arises when investors make equity investment in their own country through a company resident in the other country. Figure 1 sets out an example of a New Zealand investor in an Australian company which in turn invests into New Zealand. Figure 1: New Zealand investor in an Australian company that invests into New Zealand New Zealand investor New Zealand operation Australian Company C a p i t a l f l o w s C a p i t a l f l o w s Effective investment New Zealand Australia 30 ‘Triangular tax” is a consequence of Australia’s and New Zealand’s policies of allowing only: 7 • tax paid in their country to generate imputation credits; and • resident companies to pass on imputation credits to their shareholders. In the 1980s, when imputation rules were introduced in both Australia and New Zealand, these policies did not cause concern as Australians primarily invested into Australian companies and New Zealanders primarily invested into New Zealand companies. Since then, with the development of globalisation, generally, and Closer Economic Relations (CER), in particular, there has been a greater level of cross- investment between the two countries. This increased level of trans-Tasman cross- investment highlights the issue that Australia and New Zealand are respectively imposing two layers of tax upon the same underlying income. A pro rata allocation solution was chosen by both governments as it is the only method that apportions the tax benefits on the basis of the shareholders’ ownership, consistent with both countries’ current policy on imputation. Shareholders have the right to a proportion of the total income of a company rather than to a specific income source derived by the company. It seems appropriate, therefore, that the credit allocation rules continue to require a company paying a dividend to attach the same proportion of each type of credit to each dividend that it pays. Relief from “triangular tax” based on a pro rata allocation of imputation credits would see dividends paid by an Australian or New Zealand company have both an Australian and a New Zealand imputation credit attached. Subject to the respective countries’ rules on the maximum allocation of credits (maximum ratio), the imputation credits would be allocated to shareholders in proportion to their shareholding in the company. In New Zealand, the pro rata allocation method is being put into practice by allowing Australian companies to elect into the existing New Zealand imputation rules. This will allow Australian companies that elect to maintain an imputation credit account and pay New Zealand tax, to pass on that tax in the form of imputation credits on a pro rata basis to their shareholders. Australia has also introduced a bill containing similar legislation, to allow New Zealand companies to elect into the existing Australian imputation rules. Detailed analysis IMPUTATION RULES TO INCLUDE AUSTRALIAN COMPANIES Election to maintain an imputation credit account – section ME 1B An election by an Australian company to join the New Zealand imputation rules will be conditional upon: 7 Australia’s and New Zealand’s current imputation models are not alone in this feature. It is common international practice. 31 • its Australian residence being determined by a new provision in section OB1 which is based on the current Australian rules for determining the Australian residence of a company in section 6(1) of Australia’s Income Tax Assessment Act 1936; and • neither an Australian nor a New Zealand double tax agreement treating the company as not resident of either Australia or New Zealand. 30 days’ notice of election required The Australian company must give 30 days’ notice to the New Zealand Commissioner of Inland Revenue that it elects to maintain an imputation credit account. An imputed dividend can be paid only after the notice period has passed, or 1 October 2003, which ever is later. For all other purposes, the start date is retrospective to the beginning of the imputation year that applies to the date when the notice period has passed. For example, on 30 March 2004 an Australian company notifies the Commissioner that it elects to maintain an imputation credit account. This is effective for the purposes of paying an imputed dividend from 29 April 2004, but the company may maintain an imputation credit account from 1 April 2004. On 1 August 2003 an Australian company notifies the Commissioner that it elects to maintain an imputation credit account. This is effective for the purposes of paying an imputed dividend from 1 October 2003, but the company may maintain an imputation credit account from 1 April 2003. Revocation of election or cessation of eligibility Such an election may later be either revoked by the company at any time or lapse if the company ceases to be eligible to maintain an imputation credit account but is effective, for all purposes other than paying imputed dividends, until the end of that imputation year. Either a revocation or a cessation of eligibility will mean that the Australian company will cease to be an imputation credit account company. The effect is that under existing section ME 5(1)(k), a debit will arise in the account to the extent there is a credit balance – meaning that on revocation or cessation of eligibility, the company will lose its existing imputation credits. Such credits cannot be reinstated if it re-elects to maintain an imputation credit account or its eligibility is restored and a re-election can be made. Imputed dividends cannot be paid either from the date the Commissioner receives the revocation or from the date that eligibility ceases. Neither the revocation nor the lapse in eligibility will affect the obligations of the Australian company that arose while the company was maintaining an imputation credit account. The Commissioner has the discretion to revoke a company’s election in the event of an actual or potential breach in the imputation rules, including: • neither paying further income tax, penalties and interest on time nor entering into an arrangement with Inland Revenue to remedy the default; 32 • non-filing of imputation returns; or • the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe the Australian company will incur and default on a liability to further income tax, penalties and interest. The Commissioner also has a discretion not to accept the re-election of any company whose election has been revoked previously if the company cannot satisfy the Commissioner that the reasons for revocation will not occur again. A revocation by the Commissioner is also effective immediately for the purposes of paying imputed dividends, but for all other purposes it is effective from the end of that imputation year. Such discretions are necessary given the difficulties the Commissioner would have in collecting tax arrears in a country other than New Zealand. Joint and several liability For the same reason, all companies that are in the same wholly owned group as the Australian company that has elected to maintain an imputation credit account will be jointly and severally liable for any further income tax, penalties and interest as the company that incurred the liability. Such joint and several liability will generally be invoked only in the event of a default by the Australian company. The exception is when the companies within the wholly owned group are prohibited by an independent regulator from having such a joint and several liability with the company maintaining an imputation account. Consequential amendments Such companies that have a valid election will be defined as “Australian imputation credit account companies” in section OB 1. The definition of “imputation credit account” in section OB 1 is being expanded to include accounts maintained under section ME 1B. The definition of “imputation credit account company” is also being expanded to include companies that are required to maintain an imputation credit account under section ME 1B. Additional credits and debits to an Australian company’s imputation credit account As well as the existing provisions in sections ME 4, 5, 11 and 12 new subsections ME 4(1C), ME 5(1C), ME 11(1C), and ME 12(1C) are added to enable the following tax payments by the Australian company to create an imputation credit, and any refunds to create an imputation debit: • non-resident withholding tax on interest, dividends or royalties; • non-resident contractors’ withholding tax; • non-resident shippers’ tax; • non-resident film renters’ tax; and • non-resident insurers’ tax. 33 These payments also represent tax paid in New Zealand by an Australian company, so it is appropriate that they also create imputation credits in the same way as payments of income tax or the receipt of imputation credits. New subsections ME 4(2C), ME 5(2C), ME 11(2C), and ME 12(2C) are being added to clarify that the date the imputation credit or debit arises is the date the tax is paid or refunded respectively. New subsections ME 4(1D) and ME 11(1D) are being added to ensure that these new provisions, when combined with the original provisions for creating imputation credits, do not create imputation credits that exceed the amount of tax originally paid. Payment of dividend in Australian dollars New section CF 5B is being added to allow Australian companies, when paying an Australian dollar dividend, to use the New Zealand dollar equivalent at the time of declaring the dividend for all purposes of the imputation rules. This concession is dependant on there being no more than three months between the declaration and the payment of the dividend. Dividend withholding payment Item c in the formula in section NH 2(1) is being amended to allow imputation credits attached to a dividend to reduce a dividend withholding payment liability when no underlying foreign tax credits are available. Further income tax New subsection ME 9(5E) allows an Australian company that pays further income tax under section ME 9 but does not have a New Zealand income tax liability to gross up the tax paid into a loss, and transfer the loss to another group company. The reason for grossing up the tax into a loss is that if the further income tax payment were simply transferred to another group company, the group company could have the tax payment refunded if it had sufficient imputation credits to comply with section MD 2. Compliance requirements New subsection 29(1B) is being added to the Tax Administration Act 1994 to require an Australian company paying a dividend with an imputation credit attached to specifically use the term “New Zealand imputation credit” on the shareholder dividend statement. This is because the term “imputation credit” is also used in Australia with respect to Australian credits of company tax attached to dividends. 34 For Australian readers Shareholder dividend statement – section 29 Tax Administration Act 1994 Every time a company pays a dividend, it must provide to the shareholder receiving the dividend a shareholder dividend statement which includes the amount of the dividend, the amount of any imputation credits attached and the amount of any withholding taxes deducted. New subsection 69(1B) is being added to require an Australian company that maintains an imputation credit account but does not have to file a return of income to file its annual imputation return by 31 July following the end of an imputation year. Sections 139(A) and 142(1)(d) are being amended to impose a late filing penalty of $250 on Australian companies that do not file their annual imputation account returns on time. Subsections 43A(4) and (5), which can exclude companies from filing annual returns, is being amended to apply to New Zealand companies only. For Australian readers Annual imputation return – section 69 Tax Administration Act 1994 An imputation return must be filed annually regardless of the balance of the account at the end of the year. Imputation year – section OB 1 Income Tax Act 1994 Regardless of a company’s balance date, for the purposes of income tax, all companies in New Zealand’s imputation system have a balance date of 1 April to 31 March for the purposes of imputation. This is known as the imputation year. New subsection 67(1)(eb) is being added to require that Australian companies that pay dividends in Australian dollars include the exchange rate used on the company dividend statement when calculating the imputation ratio. For Australian readers Company dividend statement – section 67 Tax Administration Act 1994 Every time a dividend is declared a company dividend statement is required. It provides a summary of information that includes: • the number of shares that received a dividend or bonus issue; • the date the dividend is declared and the date paid; • the total amount of imputation credits attached; and • the imputation ratio. 35 Imputation rules The definition of “imputation rules” in section OZ 1 (1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being amended to include new sections CF 5B; the definition of “dividend” for Australian companies paying Australian dollar dividends; new subpart FDB, which introduces the imputation grouping rules; and sections ME 10 to ME 14, which govern the rules for maintaining a consolidated imputation credit account. For Australian readers Further income tax is payable to the extent a company has a debit balance in its imputation credit account at 31 March. It is payable by 20 June following. Imputation penalty tax is an additional penalty of 10% of the further income tax due. 36 Other imputation rules The imputation rules also include the following sections of the Income Tax Act 1994: • CF 6(1) and (2) – defines dividend for some purposes; • FC 12 – applicable to investors in Category A Group Investment funds; • GC 21 to GC 23 – anti streaming rules; • LB 1 and 2 – determines the amount of imputation credit that can be applied by shareholders; • MD 2 – limit on refunds of tax for companies with imputation credit accounts; • ME 1 to ME 14 – rules governing the operation of imputation credit accounts; • ME 30 to ME 40 – rules governing the operation of imputation credit accounts for statutory producer boards (producer boards governed by a New Zealand statute); • OB 6(1)(d) – income tax excludes penalties or interest charged under the Tax Administration Act 1994; • Part MZ – terminating imputation provisions (provisions that have a limited life and will terminate at a particular date). As well, they include the following sections of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which set out the requirements for furnishing: • 29 – a shareholder dividend statement; • 64 – a co-operative company to provide particulars of deemed dividend; • 67 – a company dividend statement when an imputation credit account company declares a dividend; • 69 – an annual imputation return; • 70 – a return when required by the Commissioner or when a company ceases to maintain an imputation credit account; and the assessment of: • 97 – imputation penalty tax; • 101 – further income tax; • 139B – late payment penalty; • 140B – imputation penalty tax if company has an end of year debit balance in its imputation credit account; • 140D (1) and (2) – interaction of imputation penalty tax with income tax; and • 180 – grounds for remissions and refunds of imputation penalty tax. 37 IMPUTATION GROUPING Third country issue Imputation grouping is being introduced as part of the reform in an attempt to mitigate what has become known as the “third country issue”, illustrated in figure 1. Consistent with current Australian and New Zealand imputation rules, the earlier discussion document had proposed that imputation credits would not flow through companies resident in neither Australia nor New Zealand – a third country. Figure 1: The third country problem A number of submissions disagreed with this aspect of the reform, arguing that it was not uncommon for trans-Tasman subsidiaries to be owned by a holding company in a third country. Although not wishing to treat trans-Tasman group structures involving a company resident in a third country more favourably than similar New Zealand group structures, the Australian and New Zealand governments have attempted to lessen this problem. Current consolidation provisions for imputation To treat trans-Tasman and New Zealand structures alike, the option chosen by the New Zealand government is one based on that which is currently available to New Zealand groups under the consolidation rules. Under these rules, there is no requirement that the chain of wholly owned companies be New Zealand resident; the requirement is simply that the companies which consolidate are New Zealand resident. Australia 3 rd Country New Zealand Imputation credits X Imputation credits √ 38 This means that tax paid by any of the New Zealand consolidated companies can go to a single consolidated imputation account which any consolidated company can use to impute a dividend. Figure 2: Example of current imputation mechanism for consolidated groups It is very important, however, to note that, even under consolidation, if a dividend is to be paid from the New Zealand subsidiary to the third country company, and the third country company is to receive a supplementary dividend, imputation credits must be attached. The attachment of imputation credits causes a debit to the consolidated imputation credit account, but as the third country company is not a member of the consolidated group, the imputation credits it receives cannot form a credit to the consolidated account. This is appropriate because the loss of imputation credits as the dividend leaves New Zealand ensures that New Zealand tax is always paid on the underlying income. This will continue to be a feature in the rules relating to imputation groups. To pay a supplementary dividend to the third country company, imputation credits must be attached and an imputation debit made to the consolidated imputation credit account. There will be no credit to the consolidated imputation account when the dividend is received by the 3rd country company. Summary of proposed amendments New subpart FDB is being added to incorporate the concept of imputation grouping within the Income Tax Act 1994. The effect will be that any company in the imputation group can attach imputation credits if tax has been paid by another group member. New Zealand parent 3 rd Country New Zealand subsidiary Consolidated ICA Imputation credits attached to dividend Tax paid 39 Figure 3: Example of proposed mechanism for imputation groups Eligibility is similar to eligibility for consolidation generally and is based on those rules. The main differences are: • The grouping is for imputation purposes only – section OB 1 definition of consolidated imputation group and application of ME 10 to ME 14. • Australian companies that have elected to maintain an imputation credit account are also eligible to group – section FDB 1(a)(ii). • Existing members of a consolidated group may also form part of an imputation group so long as all members of the consolidated group join the imputation group – section FDB 1(e). • Imputation groups with Australian and New Zealand members, known as trans- Tasman imputation groups, must also form a resident imputation subgroup consisting of the New Zealand members of the trans-Tasman group section FDB 3(1) and section OB 1 definition of “resident imputation subgroup” and “consolidated imputation group”. An imputation group does not need to have Australian members – it is quite possible for it to consist only of New Zealand companies. Other important points to note are: • Sections ME 10 to ME 14 are being amended to include imputation groups and resident imputation subgroups within their scope. These sections now apply to “consolidated imputation groups”, which is defined in section OB 1 as consisting of imputation groups, resident imputation subgroups and Australia 3 rd Country New Zealand Imputation credits attached to dividend Consolidated ICA Tax paid 40 consolidated groups of which no member is also a member of an imputation group. • Although two or more companies are eligible to form an imputation group (section FDB 2(1)), it may continue to exist if the group is reduced to one member (section FDB 3(2)) and member is itself the nominated company (section FDB 5(3)). • All members of the imputation group are jointly and severally liable for further income tax, penalties and interest incurred by any member of the imputation group (section FDB 4). • The nominated company must be a member of the imputation group, and if the imputation group is also a trans-Tasman imputation group, the nominated company must be a New Zealand company, and the same company must also be the nominated company of the associated resident imputation subgroup (section FDB 5(2)(b)). • If a New Zealand member leaves an imputation group, that is a trans-Tasman imputation group, it will also leave the resident imputation subgroup. This is because when the New Zealand member leaves the trans-Tasman imputation group, it will no longer be included within the definition of “resident imputation subgroup” in section OB 1, as it is no longer a member of the trans-Tasman imputation group. Trans-Tasman imputation groups and resident imputation subgroups Imputation groups that have both Australian and New Zealand group members are to be known as trans-Tasman imputation groups (new definition in section OB1). To ensure that New Zealand tax is paid on all dividends paid offshore, imputation groups having both Australian and New Zealand members (trans-Tasman imputation groups) will also be required to maintain a resident imputation subgroup, consisting of the New Zealand members only, as a subset of, and additional to, the trans-Tasman imputation group. Without a resident imputation subgroup operating alongside a trans-Tasman imputation group, it would be possible for income to leave New Zealand without any tax being paid in New Zealand. This could occur with a trans-Tasman imputation group that had never paid any New Zealand tax. Without the requirement for a resident imputation subgroup, it could pay a dividend to Australia, attaching imputation credits 8 and debiting the consolidated imputation credit account accordingly. When the dividend was received by the Australian company, it would then credit the consolidated imputation credit account with the attached imputation credits 9 , bringing the account back into balance. Thus untaxed New Zealand income could leave New Zealand without any New Zealand tax being paid at all. 8 to pay a supplementary dividend 9 and the non-resident withholding tax deducted 41 By having a resident imputation subgroup, consisting of the New Zealand members of the trans-Tasman imputation group operating as a subset of, and additional to a trans- Tasman imputation group, this problem is prevented. If no New Zealand tax has been paid by the trans-Tasman imputation group, when a New Zealand company pays a fully imputed dividend to Australia both the trans-Tasman imputation group’s imputation account and the resident imputation subgroup’s imputation account are debited with the amount of imputation credits attached. When the dividend is received by the Australian company, the attached imputation credits are credited to the trans-Tasman imputation group’s imputation credit account only. Should that debit balance remain in the resident imputation subgroup’s consolidated imputation credit account by 31 March, further income tax will be payable. When the further income tax is paid, both the trans-Tasman imputation group’s consolidated imputation credit account and the resident imputation subgroup’s consolidated imputation credit account will be credited with this payment. Example of how a trans-Tasman imputation group and a resident imputation subgroup will work OZ Co 1, NZ Co 1 and NZ Co 2 are all part of a wholly owned group of companies and wish to form a trans-Tasman imputation group. As the group contains Australian and New Zealand members, it is a trans-Tasman imputation group and the New Zealand members, NZ Co 1 and NZ Co 2, must also form a resident imputation subgroup. OZ Co 1 NZ Co 1 NZ Co 2 42 Both groups start the imputation year with a zero balance in their respective consolidated imputation credit accounts. NZ Co 1 then pays to OZ Co 1 a: • $67 dividend and • a $11.82 supplementary dividend. with: • $11.82 of non-resident withholding tax deducted and • imputation credits of $21.18 attached. On paying the supplementary dividend, NZ Co 1 receives a foreign investor tax credit of $11.82. Looking first at the dividend coming from the New Zealand company, the imputation credits attached and the foreign investor tax credit create debits to both the trans- Tasman imputation group consolidated imputation credit account and the resident imputation subgroup’s consolidated imputation credit account. Payment of dividend from NZ Co 1 – imputation entries Secondly, regarding the receipt of the dividend by OZ Co 1 with $11.82 non-resident withholding tax deducted and $21.12 imputation credits attached. Credits are made only to the trans-Tasman imputation group consolidated imputation credit account as the receipt of the dividend relates only to the Australian company OZ Co 1. Receipt of dividend by OZ Co 1 – imputation entries Trans-Tasman imputation group Consolidated ICA Resident imputation subgroup Consolidated ICA 21.12 11.82 21.12 11.82 21.12 11.82 Imputation credits received NEWT deducted Trans-Tasman imputation group Consolidated ICA Resident imputation subgroup Consolidated ICA 21.18 11.82 21.18 11.82 Imputation credits attached Foreign investor tax credit 43 No other transactions take place throughout the imputation year. At the end of the year the resident imputation subgroup’s consolidated imputation credit account has a debit balance of $33, so further income tax of $33 is payable. When the further income tax is paid, a credit arises to both consolidated imputation credit accounts. The trans-Tasman imputation group consolidated imputation credit account now has a credit balance of $33 which can be distributed to the ultimate shareholders. This is the right result as $33 of New Zealand tax has been paid. Payment of further income tax by the resident imputation subgroup – imputation entries Consolidated imputation groups A new definition, “consolidated imputation group”, is being added to section OB1. This includes imputation groups, resident imputation subgroups and consolidated groups of which no member is also a member of an imputation group. Trans-Tasman imputation groups are a type of imputation group, and so are also indirectly included. Sections ME 10 to ME 14, which currently apply to consolidated groups will be amended to apply now to consolidated imputation groups. This means that these sections will now apply to all imputation groups and resident imputation subgroups, as well as existing consolidated groups. The effect of these provisions on imputation groups, trans-Tasman imputation groups, resident imputation subgroups and existing consolidated groups are set out below: • An existing consolidated group does not wish to form an imputation group. Other than the change in terminology in sections ME 10 onward, there are no changes to existing consolidated groups for imputation. They are now a consolidated imputation group as no members of the consolidated group are also in an imputation group. They continue to apply the existing provisions in Trans-Tasman imputation group Consolidated ICA Resident imputation subgroup Consolidated ICA 21.18 11.82 21.18 11.82 Further income tax paid 33.00 21.18 11.82 33.00 44 sections ME 10 onward that have been renamed as applying to consolidated imputation groups. • New Zealand members of a wholly owned trans-Tasman group of companies that have not consolidated now wish to consolidate for imputation purposes only. The New Zealand members of the trans-Tasman group can form an imputation group under subpart FDB and apply the provisions in sections ME 10 onward relating to consolidated imputation groups. There is no requirement to form a resident imputation subgroup as well, as this imputation group does not include both New Zealand and Australian members, so it is not a trans-Tasman imputation group. • Australian members only of a wholly owned trans-Tasman group of companies wish to consolidate for imputation purposes. Australian members of a trans-Tasman group can form a trans-Tasman imputation group under subpart FDB and apply the provisions in sections ME 10 onward relating to consolidated imputation groups. There is no requirement to form a resident imputation subgroup as well, as this imputation group does not include both New Zealand and Australian members, so it is not a trans- Tasman imputation group. • The Australian and New Zealand members of a wholly owned trans-Tasman imputation group wish to consolidate for imputation purposes. The New Zealand members are not part of an existing consolidated group. The New Zealand and Australian members, who have elected to maintain an imputation credit account under section ME 1B, of the trans-Tasman group can form an imputation group under subpart FDB. As this imputation group includes both New Zealand and Australian members, it is a trans-Tasman imputation group, and the New Zealand members must also form a resident imputation subgroup Both the trans-Tasman imputation group and the resident imputation subgroup are consolidated imputation groups, so they both must comply with the provisions in sections ME 10 onward that apply to consolidated imputation groups. • An existing consolidated group wishes some members of its consolidated group together with some Australian wholly owned group members to consolidate for imputation only. This is not allowed as an imputation group must include either no members of an existing consolidated group or all the members of an existing consolidated group (section FDB1(e)). It will prevent a wholly owned group of companies having access to two imputation credits for one payment of tax, through an imputation group and a consolidated group’s imputation account. 45 • An existing consolidated group wishes to add Australian members and another New Zealand wholly owned member for imputation purposes only. All the members, including the ones that have already consolidated for income tax purposes, of the wholly owned group that wish to consolidate for imputation must form an imputation group under the provisions of subpart FDB. As this imputation group has Australian and New Zealand members, it is a trans- Tasman imputation group, and the New Zealand members must also form a resident imputation subgroup. As an existing consolidated group is the basis of the new imputation group, new subsection ME 10(1B) applies. It requires that the imputation credit account used by the consolidated group continue to be maintained as the imputation group’s consolidated imputation credit account. New Australian and New Zealand non-consolidated members are treated the same as new companies joining an existing consolidated group. In this case: – The existing consolidated imputation account will remain and become the trans-Tasman imputation groups’ consolidated imputation credit account (new subsection ME 10 (1B)). – All the debits and credits of the new Australian members, the new New Zealand members and the existing members of the consolidated group will go to the trans-Tasman imputation group’s consolidated imputation credit account once the imputation group has formed (existing subsections ME 11 and ME 12). – The pre-grouping balance of the account of the new New Zealand member and, to the extent there are any, the Australian members’ individual imputation credit accounts are not transferred to the trans-Tasman imputation group’s consolidated imputation credit account, but remain separate until such time as the consolidated imputation credit account has a debit to its account which it cannot offset by an existing credit. In such a case, and subject to shareholder continuity being maintained, a credit may be transferred from one of the new members individual imputation credit account to the trans-Tasman consolidated imputation account, to the extent of the consolidated imputation credit account’s debit balance (existing subsections ME 13(2) to (4)). A similar process applies to the resident imputation subgroup: – The existing consolidated imputation account remains and becomes the resident imputation subgroups’ consolidated imputation credit account (new subsection ME 10 (1D)). – All the debits and credits of the new New Zealand member and the existing members of the consolidated group go to the resident imputation subgroup’s consolidated imputation credit account once the subgroup has formed (existing subsections ME 11 and ME 12). – The pre-grouping balance of the new New Zealand member is not transferred to the resident imputation subgroup’s consolidated imputation credit account but remains separate until such time as the consolidated 46 imputation credit has a debit to its account which it cannot offset by an existing credit. In such a case, and subject to shareholder continuity being maintained, a credit may be transferred from the new member’s individual imputation credit account to the trans-Tasman consolidated imputation account, to the extent of the consolidated imputation credit account’s debit balance (existing subsections ME 13(2) to (4)). New section ME 10(1C) provides that if an imputation group consisting of New Zealand members only subsequently consolidates for income tax purposes and no longer wishes to be an imputation group, the consolidated imputation account used by the imputation group will continue and become the consolidated imputation group of the consolidated group. Otherwise, sections ME 10-14, which previously applied to consolidated groups, will apply to consolidated imputation groups, except as amended for payments of: – non-resident withholding tax on interest, dividends or royalties; – non-resident contractors’ withholding tax; – non-resident shippers’ tax; – non-resident film renters’ tax; and – non-resident insurers’ tax. Other amendments relating to imputation groups Refunds The effect of section MD 2, modified by section ME 14(5) for consolidated groups, is that companies cannot receive a refund if that refund would cause its imputation credit account to go into debit. This will still apply to imputation groups but on a self- assessment basis. These sections, however, envisage that for every company or consolidated group there will be an imputation return. With imputation groups this is no longer the case, while the individual companies will still have an individual income tax liability, only one imputation return will be required for the group. Section ME 14(6) has been added to allow the effect of MD 2 to still apply but on a self assessment basis, that is with the imputation group monitoring its compliance with section MD 2 rather than the Commissioner as is currently envisaged by the section. Companies within an imputation group can only request a refund if section MD 2 would have been complied with should references to the company’s imputation account be references to the imputation group’s imputation account. Should a company within an imputation group receive a refund without requesting it, the usual procedure will apply: the company has the choice of either returning it to Inland Revenue or filing an updated imputation credit account, one that complies with section MD 2, under section 70(3) of the Tax Administration Act. 47 Filing of consolidated imputation credit accounts Section 74 of the Tax Administration Act is being amended to apply to consolidated imputation groups generally rather than just consolidated groups, as at present. There is an exception, however, for resident imputation subgroups. While they must still prepare an annual imputation return, they will be required to file it only if they have a further income tax liability under section ME 14(3). 48 DEFERRED DEDUCTION RULE (Clauses 13, 14 and 66(14), (17), (18) & (21)) Summary of proposed amendments The deferred deduction rule introduced in this bill is aimed at aggressive tax arrangements, many of which are mass-marketed, that result in investors receiving more tax deductions than the money they invest in the arrangement. Typically, the tax benefit of these deductions occurs regardless of the success of the arrangement. The rule will apply to situations where the investor is not at real risk of having to repay loans in respect of an arrangement. However, a number of criteria are used to target the rule to minimise its impact on everyday commercial activities. Where the rule applies, deductions will be deferred to the extent the loans are outstanding and the investor continues not to be at real risk of having to repay them. The valuation of assets used in the arrangements in question is the most problematic feature of these arrangements, so it should ideally have been the target of any legislative response. Targeting valuation, however, would be very difficult because the forecasts of income that underpin valuation of the assets involved are inherently difficult to determine and are very subjective. Instead, the rule focuses on situations where investors do not have to pay for the assets they acquire as a proxy for dealing with valuation directly. Section DK 1 (limitation of deduction for certain film expenditure to amount at risk) is being repealed because it will no longer be necessary once the deferred deduction rule is implemented. Application date The rule will apply to deductions claimed for the 2004-2005 and subsequent income years. It will apply to existing arrangements only when 70 percent of the deductions claimed arise in respect of fixed life intangible property or software, or it can reasonably be expected that there are ten or more investors. This limitation is intended to ensure that the rule does not affect existing arrangements that are not targeted. Key features The rule will defer tax deductions on targeted loans provided the criteria set out in new sections ES 1 to ES 3 of the Income Tax Act 1994 are met. In commercially unsuccessful arrangements this deferral could be permanent. 49 The criteria are designed to minimise the possibility of genuine commercial investments being affected. The criteria are: • The arrangement has a promoter. • The arrangement must produce losses in the first three years. • The money that is not at risk must constitute 50 percent or more of the net arrangement assets of the investor and associated persons. • The arrangement’s net assets consist of less than 70 percent of tangible property that is comprised of land, buildings, or major plant or machinery. The definition of “money that is not at risk” and the 70 percent of tangible property test are central to the targeting of the rule. “Money that is not at risk” is defined as: • loans that are explicitly or economically limited or non-recourse; • loans where material payments are not required for ten years; • other loans which have the same effect. A loan is explicitly a limited recourse or non-recourse loan when its terms so state. A loan is economically a limited recourse loan when it is made to an arrangement specific entity (typically a company or a partnership whose partners are not natural persons) and is not secured other than perhaps over the assets or shares of the company. Loans are excluded, however, from the definition of “money that is not at risk” if the terms are on an arm’s length basis, the lender regularly lends money on arm’s length terms and carries on business in New Zealand. Such loans can be part of commercial arrangements even though they also lend themselves to aggressive tax arrangements. The 70 percent of tangible property test takes out assets which are easy to value and therefore do not need to fall within the rule. The rule has been carefully targeted so that it should not apply to financing arrangements for projects relating to tangible assets, vendor finance arrangements and other commercial activities. Background The deferred deduction rule was designed to target aggressive tax arrangements that provide tax deductions from which tax savings in early years exceed the amount of the investors’ own money put into the arrangement. In these arrangements the investor makes a cash return regardless of whether the arrangement is a commercial success or not. The arrangements usually have some of the following features: • They involve participation in a high-risk activity with apparently optimistic or unrealistic future sales projections. 50 • They include a transfer of property, including intangible and intellectual property that is difficult to value with precision. Transfer at an excessive price magnifies the available tax deductions, which are usually, but not always, by way of depreciation deduction. • Their finance is arranged so that the investor is not at real risk of ever having to repay the loans. This can create inflated interest deductions and/or provide support for a higher transfer price. • Their projected income is well into the future and may or may not materialise. How the aggressive tax arrangements work The arrangements in question are generally similar in structure and usually vary only in detail. Typically, investors put a relatively small amount of money into a joint venture or partnership. This can be by way of arrangement-specific, loss attributing qualifying companies or it can be direct. The joint venture or partnership undertakes an activity. Most of the money provided by the investor goes into the activity, with the balance going to the promoter. The promoter arranges for investors to have access to loan money. The loan money is used to purchase purportedly high-value assets that diminish in value, at least for tax- purposes, over time. The higher the purchase value, the greater the tax deductions. The investors are not at risk of having to repay the loan even if the arrangement is commercially unsuccessful. A variety of mechanisms are used to ensure this. They range from the loan being provided on explicit limited or non-recourse terms, to it being lent to an arrangement-specific company and only secured over the assets and, perhaps, the shares of the company. Example 1: Excessive tax savings Mary puts $10,000 into a joint venture (JV) that forecasts losses of $100,000 over the first three years. It forecasts income of $150,000 in year four, which in fact does not arise. The promoter of the arrangement sells fixed life intangible property (FLIP) to the JV for $95,000. This is depreciable over three years. The JV pays $5,000 cash (from Mary’s investment) for the property, with the balance of $90,000 funded by a non- recourse loan from the promoter. The JV spends the remaining $5,000 in a way that causes it to be deductible. Mary receives tax deductions of $100,000 over three years, saving her $39,000 if the 39% marginal tax rate applies to her income. This is $29,000 more than she has or will invest. She has made a substantial gain even though the JV has been unsuccessful. 51 The cash flows and loss transfers are as follows: Approach taken to target the arrangements The valuation of assets used in the arrangements in question is the most problematic feature, so it should ideally have been the target of any legislative response. Targeting valuation, however, would be very difficult because the forecasts of income that underpin valuation of the assets involved are inherently difficult to determine and are very subjective. Therefore the approach adopted to address these arrangements focuses on whether investors have used their own money or put their own assets at risk in the arrangement. Some of the arrangements to which the deferred deduction rule will apply are clearly of a tax avoidance nature, although this is not necessarily true of all. Detailed analysis New Subpart ES – Arrangements involving money not at risk, is inserted comprising new sections ES 1 to ES 3. Definitions – section ES 2 Relevant definitions include: “Loan” A loan is a financial arrangement under which a person provides money to another person, but does not include an excepted financial arrangement. “Promoter” A person who: • is a party to, or is significantly involved in formulating a plan or programme from which an arrangement is offered; or Joint Venture (3) Deductions $5k (4) Depreciates $95k FLIP (2) Sells F LIP $95k (2) Loan back $90k non-recourse (1) $10k $100k deduction Mary Promoter 52 • is aware of material and relevant aspects of the arrangement and who sells, issues or promotes the selling or issuing of the arrangement, whether or not for remuneration. A “promoter” does not include: • a person whose involvement with the arrangement is limited to providing legal, accounting, clerical or secretarial services to the promoter. • a person whose role is limited to sourcing finance for an arrangement in the normal course of their business. No numerical requirement is attached to the definition of “promoter” only for the purposes of the deferred deduction rule. Although promoter penalties apply only if there are at least ten investors in an arrangement, the deferred deduction rule will apply to future arrangements if there is only one investor per arrangement. “Money that is not at risk” Any outstanding obligation under: • an arrangement-specific loan, the terms of which have the effect of relieving the borrower from the obligation to repay all or some of the loan, whether the relief is contingent or not (explicitly limited recourse); • an arrangement-specific loan to an arrangement-specific person (typically, a company) that is unsecured or, in substance, is secured only over assets that are employed in the arrangement (economically limited recourse); • an arrangement-specific loan, the terms of which have the effect of relieving the borrower from the obligation to make any material payments in respect of the loan for a period of ten or more years from the date the loan is made; or • other loans which have the same effect. Loans, however, are excluded from the definition of “money that is not at risk” if the terms are on an arm’s length basis, and the lender regularly lends money on arm’s length terms and carries on business in New Zealand. Thus loans from New Zealand financiers are automatically not “money that is not at risk”. This exclusion was limited to New Zealand financiers because Inland Revenue is able to seek information from them. Intra-family or intra-group loans are also generally excluded. Application of the definition of “money that is not at risk” Three examples are presented of how the deferred deduction rule will apply in practice. In the first two examples the rule applies to the arrangements involved. The third example is of a structure to which the rule will not apply, even though it incorporates arrangement-specific finance. 53 Example 2: Explicit limited recourse loan Bill puts $10,000 of his own money into a joint venture (JV). The JV uses this for a computer development activity that produces deductions of $10,000 in the first year. The arrangement also provides that the promoter will sell to the JV fixed life intangible property that is depreciable over the first two years for taxation purposes. Each investor’s share of this is $40,000. Because the JV cannot afford to pay for it, the promoter will arrange finance. To ensure that Bill is not actually at risk of having to repay this finance, the loan is a limited recourse loan. In this example, the limited recourse loan would satisfy the criteria of “money that is not at risk” (section ES 2(2)(a) refers). Example 3: Economic limited recourse loan Kay puts $20,000 of her own money into an arrangement-specific loss attributing qualifying company which in turn invests into a partnership of loss attributing qualifying companies. The partnership uses this money to make a film and obtains a deduction for it in year one. The arrangement provides that the promoter will sell to the partnership fixed life intangible property that is depreciable for taxation purposes. Each partner’s share of this deduction is $70,000, also in year one. The promoter will arrange finance. This finance is secured over the assets of and shares in the loss attributing qualifying companies, with the result that investors are not actually at risk of having to repay this finance from their non-arrangement assets. In economic terms, the loan is limited recourse against the arrangement’s assets and income and would satisfy the definition of “money that is not at risk” (section ES 2(2)(c) refers). Example 4: Arm’s-length test satisfied John puts $10,000 of his own money into an arrangement-specific loss attributing qualifying company which in turn invests into a partnership of loss attributing qualifying companies. The partnership uses $8,000 of this to plant a pine forest and obtains a deduction for it in year one. The balance is used as part payment for the land on which the trees are grown. The arrangement provides that the promoter will sell to the partnership land on which to grow trees. This land will cost $42,000 per partner. Because the partnership cannot afford to pay for the land in full, the promoter arranges a loan of $40,000 per partner from a New Zealand bank. The finance is secured by mortgage over the land. This results in the investors actually not being at risk of having to repay this finance from their non-arrangement assets. In economic terms, the loan is limited recourse against the arrangement’s assets and income. As the loan is from a New Zealand bank and is at arm’s length on fully commercial terms and conditions, it is not “money that is not at risk” – refer section ES 2(3)(b). Because there is no “money that is not at risk”, the deferred deduction rule does not apply. John receives, via the loss attributing qualifying company, tax deductions of $8,000 plus interest. 54 When the deferred deduction rule applies – section ES 1 The subpart can apply only when all of the following conditions are in place. • There must be an arrangement that has a promoter. • The arrangement must produce losses in the first year of the arrangement, or cumulatively in years one and two, or cumulatively in years one, two and three (the loss period). • At the end of any of the period(s) referred to in the previous bullet point, the money that is not at risk must constitute 50 percent or more of the total cost of the arrangement assets of the investor and associated persons. • At the end of any of the period(s) referred to in the previous bullet point the arrangement’s net assets consist of less than 70 percent of tangible property that consists of land, buildings, or major plant or machinery. For many arrangements, the conditions will not be met, so the subpart can be ignored. For the purpose of determining whether a loss has been incurred in the loss period, section ES 1(2) provides that the investor and any affected associated persons are treated as if they have no other allowable deductions or gross income. A loss attributed to the shareholder of a loss attributing qualifying company is ignored, to prevent double counting, and the calculations are made as if no losses have been deferred in earlier years. In this respect, intra-group tax loss offsets do not yield deductions and can therefore be ignored. The total cost of the property held by the investor and any affected associated persons is calculated on a consolidated basis for elimination of intra-group assets, liabilities and equity, equivalent to that used for consolidated companies under generally accepted accounting practice. Example 5: Determining whether the rule applies Tom puts $10,000 of his own money into a scheme-specific loss attributing qualifying company which in turn invests into a partnership of such companies. The partnership uses $7,000 of this to plant trees and obtains a deduction for it in year one. The balance is used as part payment for the land on which the trees are grown. The arrangement provides that the promoter will sell to the partnership land on which to grow trees. This land will cost $12,000 per partner. Because the partnership cannot afford to pay for the land in full, the promoter arranges a loan of $9,000 per partner. This results in the investors actually not being at risk of having to repay this finance from their non-scheme assets. In economic terms, the loan is limited recourse against the scheme’s assets and income. 55 The cash flows and tax deductions, ignoring interest, are summarised below. Excess allowable deductions – section ES 1(1)(b) Section ES 1(1)(b) requires the allowable deductions of the investor and affected associated persons to be to be considered together. In the example, the loss attributing qualifying company, and the partnership of such companies are affected associated persons. The partnership of loss attributing qualifying companies does not have allowable deductions because section HD 1(1)(b) provides that there is no joint assessment for partnerships. Each partner takes into account their share of the allowable deductions incurred by the partnership. Allowable deductions claimed by Tom and the company are: Tom: $7,000 Loss attributing qualifying company: $7,000 Total: $14,000 However, section ES 1(2) provides that a loss arising under section HG 16(1) is ignored to the extent necessary to prevent double counting. The deduction claimed by Tom is attributed to him by the company, and is ignored to prevent double counting. Therefore, in the first year that Tom acquired an interest in the arrangement, the arrangement’s allowable deduction is $7,000. Gross income from the arrangement is nil, so the arrangement satisfies section ES 1(1)(b). Plants t rees (4) $7k (4) $7k deductions Partnership of LAQCs Bank LAQC (5) $7k deduction (2) $10k Tom (5) $7k deduction (1) $10k own monies Promoter (3) Sells land $12k (3) Loan $9k scheme specific 56 Tangible property test – section ES 1(1)(c) The rule applies only if less than 70 percent of the property that is subject to the arrangement is tangible property that is land, buildings or major plant and machinery. “Land” means the surface of the ground, and anything attached to it. For the purposes of determining whether the property of the arrangement is tangible property: • the property is measured at cost (refer to section ES 1(3)(a)); • the investor and any affected associated persons are considered together as a group (refer to section ES 1(3)(b)); and • the cost of the property is calculated on a consolidated basis for elimination of intra-group balances, equivalent to that used for companies under generally accepted accounting practice in New Zealand (refer to section ES 1(3)(c)). The investor and affected associated persons who are considered as a group are: • Tom; • the loss attributing qualifying company; and • the partnership of loss attributing qualifying companies. Tom owns the shares in the loss attributing qualifying company which is a partner in the partnership of like companies. The partnership owns land (including trees). Under consolidation principles, the $10,000 capital Tom holds in the loss attributing qualifying company needs to be eliminated. Likewise any capital or advances from the company to the partnership need to be eliminated. After consolidation, all of the property of the arrangement consists of land (including trees), so the deferred deduction rule does not apply. How the deferred deduction rule works – section ES 3 Broadly, section ES 3(1) and (5) provide that the deferred deduction rule applies in any year if: • section ES 1 is satisfied; • excess deductions are incurred in that year; and • at the end of that year, the arrangement involves “money that is not at risk”. Section ES 3(2) provides that any losses that are to be deferred are treated as gross income, and section ES 3(3) determines how the gross income should be allocated between the investor and any affected associated persons. Section ES 3(4) provides that amounts treated as gross income are allowed as deductions in the following income year. 57 Detailed provisions Under section ES 3(1), the deferred deduction rule will apply in any year when: • an arrangement satisfies the criteria in section ES 1; • the arrangement produces losses (excess deductions) in that income year, calculated as if there was no other gross income or allowable deductions, for the investor and affected associated persons combined: – ignoring losses that have been attributed to shareholders of loss attributing qualifying companies; and – ignoring any amount that is required to be added back as gross income under section ES 3(2); but – allowing any allowable deductions provided for by section ES 3(4) (amounts treated as gross income under the deferred deduction rule in the previous year that is allowed as a deduction at the start of the current income year); • the arrangement involves “money that is not at risk” at the end of the income year. For the purpose of determining whether there is “money that is not at risk” at the end of the income year: – amounts repaid as a result of transaction involving the use of put and call options or a contract of insurance or guarantee are disregarded if the put or call option or the contract of insurance or guarantee is part of the arrangement; and – the transaction does not give rise to gross income. Section ES 3(2) provides that the investor and any affected associated persons are jointly treated as deriving gross income equal to the lesser of: • the amount of the excess deductions calculated under section ES 3(1)(b) – that is, the excess deductions in that income year, calculated as if there were no other gross income or allowable deductions, for the investor and affected associated persons combined: – ignoring losses that have been attributed to shareholders of loss attributing qualifying companies; and – ignoring any amount that is required to be added back as gross income under section ES 3(2); but – allowing any allowable deductions provided for by section ES 3(4) (amounts treated as gross income under the deferred deduction rule in the previous year that is allowed as a deduction at the start of the current income year); and • the amount of “money that is not at risk”, at the end of the income year, as determined under section ES 3(5). 58 Section ES 3(5) provides that for the purpose of determining whether there is “money that is not at risk” at the end of the income year under section ES 3(1)(c): • amounts repaid as a result of transactions involving the use of put and call options or a contract of insurance or guarantee are disregarded if the put or call option or the contract of insurance or guarantee is part of the arrangement; and • the transaction does not give rise to gross income. This has the effect, illustrated in example 6, of deferring any deductions associated with the investor’s capital contribution until such time as total deductions exceed the amount of money that is not at risk. Section ES 3(3) provides that when an amount is treated as gross income, the amount is allocated between the investor and the affected associated person(s) on the basis of their respective excess allowable deduction. Section ES 3(4) provides that when an amount is deemed to be gross income, that amount is allowed as a deduction in the following income year. Section ES 3(5) provides that some amounts may be treated as being “money that is not at risk” although they have purportedly been repaid. Example 6: Application of the deferred deduction rule Jan puts $10,000 of her own money into a Joint Venture (JV). The promoter arranges a limited recourse loan of $40,000 for her to purchase fixed life intangible property (FLIP) from the promoter for $50,000 in total. Jan is able to claim depreciation on the FLIP of $25,000 in each of the 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 income years. No income is derived from the arrangement in either of those years. 2004-2005 year The deferred deduction rule will apply (see section ES 3(1)) because: • the criteria in section ES 1 have been satisfied; • deductions of $25,000 claimed by Jan exceed gross income (nil); and • at the end of the year the arrangement involved “money that is not at risk” ($40,000) Under section ES 3(2) Jan is required to treat as gross income the lesser of: • excess allowable deductions ($25,000); or • the amount of money that is not at risk ($40,000). Therefore $25,000 is treated as gross income for 2004-2005. 59 2005-2006 year Under section ES 3(4), Jan will be allowed a deduction of $25,000 in respect of the amount deemed to be gross income in 2004-05. She will also have current year depreciation deductions of $25,000. Thus she has total allowable deductions in the 2005-06 year of $50,000. Again, the deferred deduction rule will apply (see section ES 3(1)) because: • the criteria in section ES 1 have been satisfied; • deductions claimed by Jan total $50,000 and exceed gross income (nil); and • at the end of the year the arrangement involved “money that is not at risk” ($40,000). Therefore, $40,000 (the lesser of $50,000 or $40,000) is treated as gross income for 2005-2006. This provides an effective deduction for Jan’s $10,000 capital contribution in the second year. 2006-07 year In year three it is agreed that the arrangement will not succeed commercially (in fact, no income has been derived from sales) and the loan is expressly written off by the financier. Under section ES 3(4), Jan will be allowed a deduction of $40,000 in respect of the amount deemed to be gross income in the previous year. She also has $40,000 gross income from the accrual rules remittance of the $40,000 loan. The income and expenditure offset each other in this year. Over the life of the project, Jan has put in $10,000 capital and, in this case, enjoyed the tax benefits from a $10,000 deduction. Repeal of section DK 1 Section DK 1 provides for deductions for film expenditure to be reduced when the expenditure is funded from a limited recourse loan. As the deferred deduction rule will generally apply to such arrangements, section DK 1 is no longer required and is being repealed. Other policy changes 63 INCOME TAX EXEMPTION FOR COMMUNITY TRUSTS (Clauses 5, 17 and 66(5)) Summary of proposed amendments Community trusts established under the Trustee Banks Restructuring Act 1988 will become exempt from income tax from the beginning of the 2004-2005 income tax year. Distributions from these trusts will, however, continue to attract income tax. This means that tax-exempt beneficiaries of community trusts will still pay no tax on their distributions, while tax-paying beneficiaries will pay tax on the distributions they receive at their own tax rate. This should not alter the after-tax amount they currently receive from these distributions. The changes are being made to reduce compliance costs on these community trusts. Application date The income tax exemption for community trusts will be available from the beginning of the 2004-2005 income tax year. Key features An amendment to section CB 4(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 provides that community trusts established under the Trustee Banks Restructuring Act 1988 will be exempt from income tax from the beginning of the 2004-2005 income year. Distributions of income from these community trusts will be subject to tax in the beneficiaries’ hands, effectively, at the same rate they have been subject to tax in the community trusts before this amendment. This means that distributions to tax-exempt entities would still be taxed at 0%. Distributions to taxable beneficiaries will be taxed at the beneficiaries’ own tax rate. This has the effect of requiring the beneficiary, rather than the community trust, to account for the tax on the income. Until now community trusts have paid tax on the income and distributed tax-paid income to tax- paying beneficiaries. This amendment effectively means that all distributions by community trusts will be beneficiary income. Beneficiary income under current tax rules is taxed at a beneficiary’s own tax rate. For reasons of reducing compliance costs it is not proposed that this beneficiary income be subject to a withholding tax in the community trust based on individual beneficiaries’ tax liability. Similarly, imputation credits received by the community trusts will not be available for attaching to the distribution of beneficiary income. 64 Community trusts can continue to distribute the corpus of the trust – the capital sums settled on the trust and capital gains made by the trust – without a tax impost. Community trusts, as a result of the proposed amendment, can also distribute the tax- paid retained earnings of the trust without a tax impost. Background Community trusts established under the Trustee Banks Restructuring Act 1988 sought an income tax exemption to reduce compliance costs currently incurred by them in making tax-free distributions to mostly tax-exempt entities. Community trusts are not currently exempt from income tax. They do not generally qualify for the charitable income tax exemption under the Income Tax Act 1994 because their purposes are wider than those of charities. However, most of the distributions made by community trusts are to tax-exempt entities. These entities include charitable entities and other organisations (such as amateur sports promoters) that receive a specific tax exemption under the Income Tax Act. Community trusts currently ensure that distributions made to tax-exempt entities are not subject to income tax and those made to taxable beneficiaries are covered by tax credits (such as imputation credits) received by the trusts. In order to do this, they incur compliance costs. Under current tax law, if a community trust pays beneficiary income to a tax-exempt entity, that income will not be liable for income tax in the hands of the trust or the beneficiary. This is because beneficiary income is taxed at a beneficiary’s tax rate, which in the case of a tax-exempt entity is 0%. In a number of cases, community trusts have established charitable subsidiary companies or sub-trusts. Consequently, a community trust can distribute any income it is not able to distribute in a particular income year to its charitable entity as beneficiary income. In future years, distributions can be made to charitable beneficiaries out of the community trust’s charitable entity. This ensures that beneficiary income paid to tax-exempt charitable entities is not subject to tax. When a community trust makes a distribution to a taxable entity, it will generally make this out of trustee income, which is subject to tax at 33%. Analysis of the financial statements of community trusts indicates that any trustee income tax liability is covered by imputation credits received by community trusts on dividend income or, alternatively, is covered from tax losses, foreign tax credits and resident withholding tax credits. When the trustee income tax liability is covered by credits received by the community trusts, there is no further income tax liability for the trust. Thus community trusts incur compliance costs relating to the calculation of their own taxable income, the operation of a separate charitable entity and the determination of whether the beneficiaries they distribute to are tax-exempt or taxable entities. There may also be compliance costs for beneficiaries in determining their tax status in order to be able to advise the trust. 65 Consequently, community trusts have sought an income tax exemption so that they can continue to make untaxed distributions to tax-exempt entities without incurring compliance costs. Under current tax rules, community trusts, in effect, pay income tax only on dividend income they receive with imputation credits. 66 REPEAL OF INCOME TAX EXEMPTION FOR SICK, ACCIDENT OR DEATH BENEFIT FUNDS (Clauses 6, 10, 11 and 62(2)) Summary of proposed amendments The income tax exemption for the investments earnings of sick, accident or death benefit funds is being repealed. The related resident withholding tax exemption is also being repealed. A closely targeted exemption is being created for the investment earnings of funds established solely for the purpose of paying for the funeral expenses of employees and their dependants. Application date The repeal of the income tax exemption will apply to income derived after the date of enactment. Key features The income tax exemption for the investment earnings of sick, accident or death benefit funds in section CB 5(1)(i) of the Income Tax Act 1994 will be repealed. The corresponding resident withholding tax exemption in section NF 9(1)(i) of the Income Tax Act 1994 is also being repealed. The income tax exemption is being removed because it is anomalous in terms of current tax policy. As discussed below, the exemption is inconsistent with the current policy for both the taxation of savings and insurance policies. The current exemption also raises tax base maintenance concerns. New section CB 5(1)(ib) will contain a closely targeted exemption for the investment earnings (interest and dividends) of funds established solely for the purpose of paying for the funeral expenses of the employees of an employer and the spouses and dependants of employees. The exemption will be limited to funds established by an employer for ten or more employees who have equal eligibility to benefits from the fund. All contributions to these funds will have to be made by either employers (and subject to fringe benefit tax) or employee beneficiaries of the fund. In addition, any such funeral expense fund would need to be approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Background Income derived by a trustee of a sick, accident or death benefit fund (other than business income) is currently exempt from income tax under section CB 5(1)(i) of the Income Tax Act 1994. A sick, accident or death benefit fund is defined in section CB 5(2) as a fund established for the benefit of the employees of any employer, or the members of an incorporated society, and the surviving spouses and dependants of any 67 such employees and members. The fund is required to be approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The income tax exemption for these funds was first enacted in 1940. The Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance (1998) considered that the income tax exemption for the funds was anomalous in terms of current tax policy and that there was no public policy justification for its continuance. Accordingly, the Committee recommended the repeal of the tax exemption. The income tax exemption for the investment earnings of these funds is inconsistent with the current policy for the taxation of savings. Because of the open-ended nature of the definition of sick, accident or death benefit funds, such funds can be used as savings vehicles. The exemption effectively allows earnings on personal savings to be exempt from income tax. The exemption therefore provides concessionary treatment that is not available to other forms of savings. The income tax exemption is also inconsistent with the treatment of insurance policies entered into for protection against sickness, accident or death. The earnings on contributions or premiums paid on such policies are generally taxable. The income tax exemption also raises tax base maintenance concerns. In particular, schemes with very aggressive features which exploit this exemption have been marketed to high-income individuals to reduce the tax they pay. This problem is increased by the open-ended nature of the current fund tax exemption, as there is no requirement that a fund be established only for protection against sickness, accident or death. 68 CHARITABLE DONEE STATUS (Clause 22) Summary of proposed amendment Books for Africa, the Bright Hope International Trust, the Cheboche Area Trust Inc, the Greater Mekong Subregion Tertiary Education Consortium Trust, the Help a Child Foundation New Zealand, Plan New Zealand, the Sampoerna Foundation Limited, Surf Aid International Incorporated and The Sir Edmund Hillary Trust are to be given charitable donee status. This will enable donors to obtain tax relief on their donations. Application date The amendments will apply from the 2003-04 income year. Key features The following organisations are being added to section KC 5(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994, which lists the organisations that qualify for charitable donee status: • Books for Africa; • Bright Hope International Trust; • Cheboche Area Trust Inc; • Greater Mekong Subregion Tertiary Education Consortium Trust; • Help a Child Foundation New Zealand; • Plan New Zealand; • Sampoerna Foundation Limited; • Surf Aid International Incorporated; and • The Sir Edmund Hillary Trust. Background Donations to qualifying organisations entitle individual taxpayers to a rebate of 33 1/3 percent of the amount donated, to a maximum of $630 a year. Donations by non- closely held companies, and closely held companies which are listed on a recognised stock exchange, qualify for a deduction to a maximum of 5 percent of their net income. 69 Books for Africa This organisation collects donated books and ships them to Africa for free distribution to poor and needy people in Africa. Their fundraising is to cover the costs of shipping the books. Bright Hope International Trust The main focus of this Trust is providing education and medical care for AIDS orphans. This organisation has a United States base and is working with the poor in 50 countries. Cheboche Area Trust Inc The stated aims of this Trust are to develop improved health and education services for the people of Cheboche, in Nepal. Greater Mekong Subregion Tertiary Education Consortium Trust This Trust is to promote higher tertiary educational standards in the Mekong region. The Greater Mekong Subregion comprises Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Vietnam, Thailand and the Yunnan province of China. The consortium is comprised of tertiary institutions from the Greater Mekong Subregion, Australia and New Zealand. Help a Child Foundation New Zealand The current focus of this organisation is needy children in Africa and India. It has set up schools and children’s homes, provides day care and helps parents who cannot provide for their children. It works mainly through child sponsorship. Plan New Zealand Plan New Zealand is the New Zealand branch of an international child-focused aid organisation which was established approximately 65 years ago and operates in developing countries. It will initially concentrate on raising funds for child sponsorship. Moneys raised through child sponsorship will benefit whole communities, not just individual children. Sampoerna Foundation Limited The stated aims of this company are to provide funding for the education of Indonesian students. Surf Aid International Incorporated This organisation has been established to provide medical aid and related education programmes to communities adjacent to surfing locations and their neighbouring communities. They are currently operating in the Mentawai Islands in Indonesia to improve the health of the local population. To carry out its work it seeks support from the global surfing community 70 The Sir Edmund Hillary Trust This Trust has been established for the purpose of marking the 50 th anniversary of Sir Edmund Hillary’s ascent of Mt Everest. It has been established to further charitable purposes in both New Zealand and Nepal. (In the case of Nepal, the advancement of religion has been excluded from the activities the Trust may engage in.) 71 FAMILY ASSISTANCE – INCREASES TO FAMILY SUPPORT, CHILD TAX CREDIT AND PARENTAL TAX CREDIT INCOME THRESHOLDS (Clauses 23 and 25) Summary of proposed amendments Family assistance legislation is being amended to allow an increase in income thresholds for family support, the child tax credit and the parental tax credit from 1 April 2004. Income thresholds are to be increased by 1.78% to provide an adjustment for inflation in line with the estimated increase in the Consumer Price Index for the year ended September 2003. This will have the effect of increasing the income thresholds for family support, the child tax credit and the parental tax credit from $20,000 to $20,356 and from $27,000 to $27,481. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2004. Key features Section KD 2(6) of the Income Tax Act 1994, which explains how the abatement of entitlement is calculated, will be amended to include the adjusted income thresholds. The $20,000 threshold, at which abatement begins, will become $20,356. The $27,000 threshold, at which the rate of abatement changes from 18% to 30%, will become $27,481. Similar and consequential changes will also be made to the rules for calculating interim instalments, in section KD 5B(5) and Schedule 12. Background Income thresholds are the points at which family assistance entitlement starts to be abated as family income rises. At the current threshold levels, family assistance abates by 18 cents for every extra dollar of family income above $20,000 a year and 30 cents for every extra dollar of family income above $27,000. The proposed increase in income thresholds will mean that low-income and middle-income families with income above $20,000 will receive more family assistance. 72 FAMILY ASSISTANCE DEBT – WRITING OFF OVERPAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH ADDITIONAL PAYDAYS (Clauses 23, 24 and 26) Summary of proposed amendments Family assistance legislation is being amended to write off overpayments of family assistance that arise when there is an extra payday in the year. Under the new legislation, where eligible recipients paid by Inland Revenue or the Ministry of Social Development receive an additional payment and incur an overpayment at the end-of- year square-up, an adjustment will be made so that the overpayment attributable to the extra payday is not collected from recipients. Application date The amendment will apply from the 2003-04 year. Key features Section KD 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994, which relates to the annual square-up of payments and entitlement, will be amended so as to reduce a claimant’s overpayment subject to the satisfaction of certain criteria. Claimants paid by Inland Revenue will have their overpayment reduced by an amount which is the lesser of the last instalment payment received and the amount of their overpayment if they: • receive 27 fortnightly instalments of family assistance from Inland Revenue in 2003-04; and • incur an overpayment at end-of-year square-up. Claimants paid by Ministry of Social Development will have a similar reduction in their overpayment if they: • receive at least one instalment of family assistance from the Ministry of Social Development in 2003-04 or 2004-05; and • do not received a fortnightly instalment from Inland Revenue in the same income year; and • incur an overpayment at end-of-year square-up. 73 Background Because a year is slightly longer than 52 weeks, claimants who receive interim payments throughout the year (rather than at the end in a lump sum) sometimes receive one more payment than usual. In 2003-04 for example, there will be 27 fortnightly paydays for claimants paid by Inland Revenue, instead of the usual 26, and 53 rather than 52 paydays for Ministry of Social Development claimants paid weekly on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. In 2004- 05 there will be 53 paydays for Ministry of Social Development claimants paid weekly on Thursdays. As fortnightly or weekly entitlement is calculated based upon a standard year comprised of 26 or 52 payment periods, claimants who would otherwise have balanced at the end-of-year square-up will be overpaid in years with additional paydays. Claimants who would have been overpaid for some other reason will have their overpayment magnified by the extra payday. Overpayments associated with additional payment periods may contribute to the creation of family assistance debt for some claimants. Evidence suggests that some families choose not to receive family assistance payments during the income year as a result of having previously incurred a debt, and apply for an end-of-year lump sum instead, which means they no longer receive payments throughout the year to assist with day-to-day living expenses. Debt also reduces the apparent return from employment and may act as a disincentive for low-income families to move out of benefit and into work. 74 TAX POOLING (Clauses 32-34, 40-42, 46-49, 60 and 66(21)) Summary of proposed amendments Four amendments are being proposed to the recently enacted tax pooling provisions to remove a disincentive for companies to participate in tax pools. The most significant amendments are changes to the imputation provisions to allow taxpayers who, through an intermediary, deposit an amount in a tax pooling account with Inland Revenue to receive an imputation credit for the amount deposited. Imputation debits would arise for deposits refunded and for tax transferred within the pooling account to another taxpayer. Consequential amendments are being made which broadly are designed to ensure that taxpayers participating in a pool and receiving imputation credits when deposits are made are in no worse or better a position than the standard imputation treatment affords. More minor amendments provide that no resident withholding tax is to be deducted on use-of-money interest paid to a pooling intermediary by the Commissioner, and that amounts paid and received by pool participants in substitution for use-of-money interest is “interest” for the purpose of withholding tax and income provisions. Finally, a change is proposed to the requirement for an intermediary to notify a pool participant that payment to the intermediary does not satisfy a taxpayer’s obligations to the Commissioner. It is sufficient for an intermediary to give a pool participant general notice of this, rather than giving notice on receipt of every payment from the pool participant. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2003, the date on which the tax pooling provisions came into effect. Key features Imputation • Section MBB 6(8), which sets out the time at which imputation credits arise for tax paid through a pooling account, is being replaced with a set of imputation provisions applicable to pool participants. Broadly, companies will receive a credit in their imputation credit account when a payment they have forwarded to an intermediary is deposited in a tax pooling account with the Commissioner (proposed new sections ME 4(1)(ad) and ME 4(1B)(a)). Debits to the imputation credit account will arise in relation to refunds from the pooling account to the company and sales of the amount deposited to another taxpayer (sections ME 5(1)(eb) and (ec) and ME 5(1B)(a) and (b)). Such debits are required so that a company still ultimately only receives imputation credits for tax paid by it, and deposits in a tax pooling account are not “tax paid” by the company for the purposes of the Act until deposits are transferred to the company’s income tax account. The new rules, which are explained in detail 75 later, are intended to ensure that taxpayers are neither advantaged nor disadvantaged by paying tax through a pooling account. Other remedial amendments • Section MBB 4(3) is being amended so that an intermediary can give general notice to a pool participant that payment to the intermediary does not satisfy the participant’s obligations to the Commissioner. • Section MBB 9, which deals solely with the deductibility of payments made between an intermediary and client that are substitutes for use-of-money interest, is being replaced with a provision that is broader in scope. Proposed new section MBB 9 clarifies that such payments are “interest”, which was assumed in the tax pooling provisions as enacted. Such payments are treated as interest income to the recipient, and expenditure incurred in deriving gross income to the payer. They are also treated as interest for the purposes of the resident and non-resident withholding tax provisions (though resident withholding tax is still not deductible on interest paid to an intermediary by a client under section NF 1(2)(a)(ix)). • Under proposed new section NF 1(2)(a)(x), the Commissioner would not deduct resident withholding tax from payments of use-of-money interest paid to a tax pooling intermediary. Background Under existing section MBB 6(8), taxpayers who pay tax through a pooling account get a credit in their imputation credit account (ICA) for the amount of funds transferred to their income tax account. The credit arises at the time that the Commissioner receives a request from the intermediary to transfer the funds (generally after the end of the income year when the tax liability is known). This is a disincentive to taxpayers paying tax through a pooling account because it is penal relative to the imputation treatment of those who pay tax directly to the Commissioner. Taxpayers who pay provisional tax directly to the Commissioner receive a credit in their ICA when tax is paid and they can attach these credits to dividends paid out in that imputation year. Taxpayers who instead pays provisional tax through a pooling account receive a credit only after the end of the imputation year, when tax is allocated from the pool to their income tax account. Credits are therefore not available for distribution in the year the provisional tax is paid. Even if the standard imputation treatment were to apply to pool participants, problems would arise. Under that treatment, companies would not get any credit in their ICAs until after the end of the income year, when their tax liability is established and tax is allocated from the pooling account to their income tax account. However, unlike the existing treatment under section MBB 6(8), the credits would arise retrospectively, as at the date the tax was paid (generally provisional tax dates in the previous imputation year). If the company wanted to pay out imputation credits in that year for tax it expected to have retrospectively credited to its ICA, it would still have an imputation 76 debit at 31 March, which requires payments of further income tax and penalty tax by 21 June. The various options to deal with this (such as ignoring the further income tax obligation, or paying the further income tax and obtaining a refund when the credits have retrospectively arisen, or transferring sufficient funds from the pool to the income tax account at 31 March to cover credits distributed) are all unsatisfactory. A new set of imputation provisions has therefore been designed to apply to pool participants. The new rules are not intended to confer an advantage on pool participants, but are intended to remove the disincentive discussed earlier and match, so far as possible, the imputation treatment afforded to companies that pay tax directly to the Commissioner. Detailed analysis Companies will receive a credit in their ICA when funds they forward to an intermediary are deposited into a tax pooling account. Companies that are cautious and pay more into the pooling account than their tax liability can be penalised by this treatment if there is a breach of continuity. On the breach, they could lose more credits than they would have lost if credits had only arisen for tax paid. There are therefore two sets of rules – a basic set for those companies that do not expect a breach of continuity or that pay out their imputation credits to shareholders before any such breach. There is a second optional set of provisions for companies that would generally pay funds into the pool in excess of their tax liability and that are concerned about losing all those credits on a breach. Companies that elect to apply these provisions are, under section ME 3B, “pooling credit recorders”. These two sets of rules are discussed separately below. Basic rules – companies that are not “pooling credit recorders” Credits for deposits into pooling account A company that is not a pooling credit recorder receives a credit in its imputation credit account for amounts that it has paid to an intermediary and that are deposited in a tax pooling account with the Commissioner (section ME 4(1)(ad)). The credit arises on the date the funds are paid into the tax pooling account (section ME 4(2)(ad)). The intermediary will notify the taxpayer of that date. No imputation credit arises if and when those funds deposited into the tax pooling account are transferred to the company’s income tax account (section ME 4(1)(a)(x)). Refunds from pooling account If all or part of those funds in the tax pooling account are refunded to the intermediary instead of being transferred to the company’s income tax account, a debit arises to the ICA equal to the amount of the refund (section ME 5(1)(eb)). The time at which the debit arises depends on the balance in the company’s ICA (section ME 5(2)(eb)). If the amount of the refund is less than or equal to the balance in the ICA at the date of the refund or at the end of the previous imputation year, the debit arises on the date of the refund. If the refund exceeds the balance at those dates, the debit arises at the end of the previous imputation year. 77 This timing rule is intended to achieve the same purpose as the restrictions on refunds of tax under section MD 2. That section prevents companies obtaining refunds of tax when they have already distributed imputation credits for that tax to their shareholders. In the case of refunds of amounts held in pooling accounts for which companies have received an imputation credit, it is not feasible for the Commissioner to withhold the refund as he does not know to whom the refund relates. (The funds could have been transferred from the original contributor to another taxpayer.) Instead, the timing rule is intended to act as a disincentive for taxpayers to pay funds into a pooling account, distribute the credits to shareholders and then seek a refund of that amount from the pooling account. A debit arising as at the previous 31 March will trigger further income tax and imputation penalty tax obligations. It is therefore critical for taxpayers seeking refunds from the pool that they check the balance in their ICA at the relevant dates. Note that, when there are insufficient funds in the ICA at the relevant dates, a debit will arise of the whole amount of the refund on the previous 31 March. There is no apportionment of the debit between the date of refund and the previous 31 March because such apportionment does not work (for example, where there is a $30,000 refund and only $20,000 in the ICA at the relevant dates). When the company obtaining the refund is a qualifying company, the date on which the debit arises is always the date of the refund. This is because the restrictions in section MD 2 do not generally apply to qualifying companies (section MD 2(7)). Transfers to other taxpayers If a taxpayer does not require funds that are held for its benefit in the tax pooling account and sells the funds to the intermediary for on-sale to another taxpayer, a debit will arise in its ICA (section ME 5(1)(ec)). As with refunds from the pooling account, the timing of the debit depends on the balance in the ICA on the date on which the transfer is made in the books of the intermediary (that is, the date on which the funds are sold) and the balance as at the previous 31 March (section ME 5(2)(eb)). Refunds and transfers to another taxpayer are treated in the same way and the discussion above in relation to the timing of debits for refunds applies equally to transfers. It is critical to check the ICA balance at the relevant dates when transferring funds held in a pooling account to another taxpayer. For the purchaser of such funds who is also not a pooling credit recorder, a credit equal to the funds transferred will arise in the ICA under section ME 4(1)(ae). The credit arises on the date on which the transfer is made in the intermediary’s books (ME 4(2)(ae)). Breach of continuity On a breach of shareholder continuity, the credits that have arisen in the ICA from deposits in a pooling account are lost under the general rule in section ME 5(1)(i). 78 Consolidated groups The imputation treatment described earlier applies in the same way to payments made by a consolidated group into a pooling account. Equivalent amendments are being made to sections ME 10-ME 13. Examples Examples 1 to 5 illustrate the operation of the provisions for taxpayers who are not pooling credit recorders. Examples 1-5: Companies that are not pooling credit recorders Example 1 – standard case 7/7/03 A Co pays $50k to the intermediary, who deposits it into the tax pooling account. Credit arises to A Co’s ICA (ME 4(1)(ad) and ME 4(2)(ad)). 7/11/03 Ditto 7/3/04 Ditto 31/8/04 After year end, A Co’s residual income tax (RIT) is $120,000, so the intermediary requests IRD to transfer $40,000 from the pooling account to A Co’s tax account as at 7/7/03, 7/11/03 and 7/3/04. No credit arises to A Co’s ICA on this transfer – (ME 4(1)(a)(x)). 1/9/04 The intermediary purchases the $30k excess from A Co and sells it to B Co. There is a transfer on this date in the intermediary’s books of the $30k – it ceases to be held for A Co and is held for B Co. A debit of $30k arises to A Co’s ICA (ME 5(1)(ec)). As the amount of the $30k transfer does not exceed the credits in A Co’s ICA at the end of the previous imputation year (31/3/04), the debit arises on 1/9/04 (ME 5(2)(eb)(i)). A credit for $30k arises to B Co’s ICA on 1/9/04 (ME 4(1)(ae) and ME 4(2)(ae)). A Co’s ICA Cr Dr Bal 7/7/03 $50k $50k 7/11/03 $50k $100k 7/3/04 $50k $150k 31/3/04 $150k 1/9/04 $30k $120k 79 Example 2 – insufficient credits in A Co’s ICA at end of previous imputation year 7/7/03 A Co pays $50k to the intermediary, who deposits it into the tax pooling account. Credit arises to A Co’s ICA (ME 4(1)(ad) and ME 4(2)(ad)). 7/11/03 Ditto 7/3/04 Ditto 20/3/04 A Co attaches $150k credits to dividends paid to shareholders. 7/7/04 A Co pays $40k to the intermediary, who deposits it into the tax pooling account. Credit arises to A Co’s ICA (ME 4(1)(ad) and ME 4(2)(ad)). 31/8/04 After year end, A Co’s RIT is $120,000, so the intermediary requests IRD to transfer $40,000 from the pooling account to A Co’s tax account as at 7/7/03, 7/11/03 and 7/3/04. No credit arises to A Co’s ICA for these transfers – ME 4(1)(a)(x)). 1/9/04 The intermediary purchases the $30k excess from A Co and sells it to B Co. There is a transfer on this date in the intermediary’s books of the $30k – it ceases to be held for A Co and is held for B Co. A debit of $30k arises to A Co’s ICA (ME 5(1)(ec)). The amount of the $30k transfer exceeds the credits in A Co’s ICA at the end of the previous imputation year (31/3/04), but A Co’s credit balance at 1/9/04 is $40k. Since there are sufficient credits at that date, the debit arises on 1/9/04 (ME 5(2)(eb)(i)). A credit for $30k arises to B Co’s ICA on 1/9/04 (ME 4(1)(ae) and ME 4(2)(ae)). A Co’s ICA Cr Dr Bal 7/7/03 $50k $50k 7/11/03 $50k $100k 7/3/04 $50k $150k 20/3/04 $150k 31/3/04 $0k 7/7/04 $40k $40k 1/9/04 $30k $10k 80 Example 3 – insufficient credits in A Co’s ICA at end of previous imputation year and date of transfer to another taxpayer 7/7/03 A Co pays $50k to the intermediary, who deposits it into the tax pooling account. Credit arises to A Co’s ICA (ME 4(1)(ad) and ME 4(2)(ad)). 7/11/03 Ditto 7/3/04 Ditto 20/3/04 A Co attaches $150k credits to dividends paid to shareholders. 7/7/04 A Co pays $20k to the intermediary, who deposits it into the pooling account. Credits arise to A Co’s ICA (ME 4(1)(ad) and ME 4(2)(ad)). 31/8/04 After year end, A Co’s RIT is $120,000, so the intermediary requests IRD to transfer $40,000 from the pooling account to A Co’s tax account as at each of 7/7/03, 7/11/03 and 7/3/04. No credit arises to A Co’s ICA for these transfers (ME 4(1)(a)(x)). 1/9/04 The intermediary purchases the $30k excess from A Co and sells it to B Co. There is a transfer on this date in the intermediary’s books of the $30k – it ceases to be held for A Co and is held for B Co. A debit of $30k arises to A Co’s ICA (ME 5(1)(ec)). The amount of the $30k transfer exceeds the credits in A Co’s ICA at the end of the previous imputation year (balance = $0), and at the date of the transfer (balance = $20k). A debit of $30k therefore arises as at the previous 31 March (ME 5(2)(eb)(ii)). This will trigger imputation penalties and a requirement to pay further income tax. A credit for $30k arises to B Co’s ICA on 1/9/04 (ME 4(1)(ae) and ME 4(2)(ae)).

Credit arises to A Co’s ICA (ME 4(1)(ad) and ME 4(2)(ad)). 7/11/03 Ditto 15/12/03 Breach of shareholder continuity – debit to ICA of $100k (existing ME 5(1)(i)). 7/3/04 A Co pays $50k to intermediary. Credit arises in ICA (ME 4(1)(ad) and ME 4(2)(ad)). 31/8/04 After year end, A Co’s RIT is $120,000, so the intermediary requests IRD to transfer $40,000 from the pooling account to A Co’s tax account as at 7/7/03, 7/11/03 and 7/3/04. No credit arises to A Co’s ICA for these transfers (ME 4(1)(a)(x)). 1/9/04 The intermediary purchases the $30k excess from A Co and sells it to B Co. There is a transfer on this date in the intermediary’s books of the $30k – it ceases to be held for A Co and is held for B Co. A debit of $30k arises to A Co’s ICA (ME 5(1)(ec)). As the amount of the $30k transfer does not exceed the credits in A Co’s ICA at the end of the previous imputation year (balance = $50k)), the debit arises on 1/9/04 (ME 5(2)(eb)(i)). A credit for $30k arises to B Co’s ICA on 1/9/04 (ME 4(1)(ae) and ME 4(2)(ae)). The problem with this outcome is that, if A Co had paid the $100k pre-breach tax directly to the Commissioner, rather than through a pool, it would (as a result of sections ME 5(1)(i) and ME 5(1)(e)(iii)) have, in substance, lost only $80k in ICA credits on the breach. (It would receive a refund of $30k, giving rise to an imputation debit of only $10k which leaves $40k to be passed on to shareholders.) Because A Co has paid tax through the pool and not elected to be a pool account recorder, it has only $20k ICA credits, rather than $40k, to pass on to shareholders. A Co can avoid this outcome by electing to be a pooling credit recorder (see examples 6 to 12). A Co’s ICA Cr Dr Bal 7/7/03 $50k $50k 7/11/03 $50k $100k 15/12/03 $100k $0 7/3/04 $50k $50k 31/3/04 $50k 1/9/04 $30k $20k 82 Example 5 – standard case with clear-out of ICA before breach of continuity debit 7/7/03 A Co pays $50k to the intermediary, who deposits it into the tax pooling account. Credit arises to A Co’s ICA (ME 4(1)(ad) and ME 4(2)(ad)). 7/11/03 Ditto 14/12/03 Imputation credit balance of $100k attached to dividends. 15/12/03 Breach of shareholder continuity – no debit arises. 7/3/04 A Co pays $50k to the intermediary, who deposits it into the tax pooling account. Credit arises in ICA (ME 4(1)(ad) and ME 4(2)(ad)). . 31/8/04 After year end, A Co’s RIT is $120,000, so the intermediary requests IRD to transfer $40,000 from the pooling account to A Co’s tax account as at 7/7/03, 7/11/03 and 7/3/04. No credit arises to A Co’s ICA for these transfers (ME 4(1)(a)(x)). 1/9/04 The intermediary purchases the $30k excess from A Co and sells it to B Co. There is a transfer on this date in the intermediary’s books of the $30k – it ceases to be held for A Co and is held for B Co. A debit of $30k arises to A Co’s ICA (ME 5(1)(ec)). As the amount of the $30k transfer does not exceed the credits in A Co’s ICA at the end of the previous imputation year (balance = $50k)), the debit arises on 1/9/04 (ME 5(2)(eb)(i)). A credit for $30k arises to B Co’s ICA on 1/9/04 (ME 4(1)(ae) and ME 4(2)(ae)).

If a company was sufficiently certain that there was no likelihood of breach of shareholder continuity, or that imputation credits could be paid out before any breach, it could elect not to differentiate between pooling imputation credits and ordinary credits. When the tax liability of a company exceeds the funds contributed by the company into a pooling account and the company purchases tax from another taxpayer, and there is a breach of continuity before the purchase, the company will, of course, retain the benefit of credits for the funds purchased (because those credits arise on the date on which the funds are purchased). 83 Companies that are pooling credit recorders Companies that tend to pay more funds into the pool than their tax liability, and that may have a breach of continuity without paying out all the credits to shareholders before the breach, may wish to elect into rules that are intended to better reflect the existing imputation rules applying on breach of continuity while still allowing credits to arise on deposits into a tax pooling account. Under those rules, undistributed credits for tax paid before the breach will be lost. The rules distinguish between credits and debits that relate to funds in a pooling account with the Commissioner (“pooling imputation credits” and “pooling imputation debits”) and other types of credits and debits. Pooling imputation credits can be treated in exactly the same way as ordinary credits – for example, they can be distributed to shareholders. The only difference is that they are not lost on a breach of continuity. (See the proposed amendment to section ME 5(1)(i).) Instead, pooling credits are converted into ordinary credits when tax is allocated from the pooling account to the company’s income tax account. This ensures that only credits relating to tax paid before the breach are lost. A company that wishes to apply these rules, and distinguish between pooling debits and credits and other debits and credits, is known as a “pooling credit recorder” (section ME 3B). Credits for deposits into pooling account A pooling credit recorder receives an imputation credit for funds paid to an intermediary that are deposited into a tax pooling account with the Commissioner (section ME 4(1B)(a)). The credit arises on the date the funds are paid by the intermediary into the tax pooling account (section ME (2B)(a)). Transfer from pooling account to company’s income tax account When a company (through the intermediary) arranges for the transfer of an amount from the tax pooling account to its income tax account, offsetting ordinary credits and pooling imputation debits for the amount of the transfer arise to its ICA. An ordinary credit will arise for the amount transferred (section ME 4(1)(ac)) on the effective date of the transfer (section ME 4(2)(ac)), and a pooling imputation debit will arise for the amount transferred (section ME 5(1B)(c)) on the effective date of the transfer (section ME 5(2B)(b)). Refunds from the pooling account If all or part of the funds in the tax pooling account that were contributed by the company are refunded to the intermediary instead of being transferred to the company’s income tax account, a pooling debit arises to the ICA equal to the amount of the refund (ME 5(1B)(a)). The timing of the debit is determined under section ME 5(2B)(a) and depends on the balance in the ICA as at the date of the refund or the end of the last imputation year. Section ME 5(2B)(a) is in the same terms as the equivalent provision applying to non-pooling credit recorders (section ME 5(2)(eb)), and therefore the discussion on the timing of the debit for refunds for non-pooling credit recorders applies equally to pooling credit recorders. 84 Transfers to other taxpayers If a taxpayer does not require funds that are held for its benefit in the tax pooling account and sells the funds to the intermediary for on-sale to another taxpayer, a debit will arise in its ICA (section ME 5(1B)(b)). As with refunds from the pooling account, the timing of the debit depends on the balance in the ICA on the date on which the transfer is made in the books of the intermediary (that is, the date on which the funds are sold) and the balance as at the previous 31 March (section ME 5(2B)(a)). Transfers to another taxpayer are treated in the same way as refunds, so the discussion earlier on the timing of debits for refunds applies equally to transfers. For the purchaser of such funds who is a pooling credit recorder, a credit equal to the funds transferred will arise in the ICA under section ME 4(1B)(b). The credit arises on the date on which the transfer is made in the intermediary’s books (that is, the date on which the funds are purchased) under section ME 4(2B)(b). Consolidated groups Consolidated groups can also elect to be pooling imputation credit recorders. Equivalent amendments to those previously discussed have been inserted into sections ME 10 to ME 13. Examples Examples 6 to 12 illustrate the operation of the provisions for pooling credit recorders. 85 Examples 6 to 12: Pooling credit recorders Example 6 – standard case 7/7/03 A Co pays $50k to the intermediary, who deposits it into the tax pooling account.

Credits arise to A Co’s ICA of $40k (ME 4(1)(ac)) on each of 7/7, 7/11, 7/3 (ME 4(2)(ac)). Pooling imputation debits of $40k arise to A Co’s ICA (ME 5(1B)(c)) as at the effective dates 7/7, 7/11 and 7/3 (ME 5(2B)(b)). 1/9/04 The intermediary purchases the $30k excess from A Co and sells it to B Co. There is a transfer on this date in the intermediary’s books of the $30k – it ceases to be held for A Co and is held for B Co. A pooling imputation debit of $30k arises to A Co’s ICA (ME 5(1B)(b)).

There is a transfer on this date in the intermediary’s books of the $30k – it ceases to be held for A Co and is held for B Co. A pooling imputation debit of $30k arises to A Co’s ICA (ME 5(1B)(b)). As the amount of the $30k transfer does not exceed the credits in A Co’s ICA at the end of the previous imputation year (balance = $70k)), the imputation debit arises on 1/9/04 (ME 5(2B)(a)). A pooling imputation credit for $30k arises to B Co’s ICA on 1/9/04 (ME 4(1B)(b) and (2B)(b)). A Co’s ICA Cr PCr Dr PDr Bal 7/7/03 $40k $50k $40k $50k 7/11/03 $40k $50k $40k $100k 15/12/03 80k $20k 7/3/04 $40k $50k $40k $70k 31/3/04 $70k 1/9/04 $30k $40k The outcome is that A Co loses only $80k on breach of continuity and has credits of $40k, being “tax paid” after the breach, to pass on to shareholders. The amount lost on breach of continuity is the same as that that would have applied if the taxpayer had paid the correct amount of tax directly to the Commissioner. 89 Example 10 – standard case with partial clear-out of ICA before breach of continuity debit 7/7/03 A Co pays $50k to the intermediary, who deposits it into the tax pooling account. A pooling imputation credit arises to A Co’s ICA (ME 4(1B)(a) and ME 4(2B)(a)). 7/11/03 Ditto 14/12/03 Imputation credits of $70k are attached to dividends. 15/12/03 Breach of shareholder continuity – as all credits are pooling credits, no debit arises. 7/3/04 A Co pays $50k to the intermediary, who deposits it into the tax pooling account. A pooling credit arises in ICA. A Co’s ICA Cr PCr Dr PDr Bal 7/7/03 $50k $50k 7/11/03 $50k $100k 14/12/03 $70k $30k 7/3/04 $50k $80k 31/8/04 After year end, A Co’s RIT is $120,000, so the intermediary requests IRD to transfer $40,000 from the pooling account to A Co’s tax account as at 7/7/03, 7/11/03 and 7/3/04. Pooling debits and offsetting credits for $40k arise on 7/7, 7/11 and 7/3/04 (ME 5(1B)(c) and ME 5(2B)(b); ME 4(1)(ac) and ME 4(2)(ac)). This results in the loss of $10k credits on breach of continuity. An amendment to section ME 5(1)(i) ensures that the offsetting pooling debits of $40k arising as at each of 7/7 and 7/11 do not cancel out those credits. 1/9/04 The intermediary purchases the $30k excess from A Co and sells it to B Co. There is a transfer on this date in the intermediary’s books of the $30k – it ceases to be held for A Co and is held for B Co. A pooling imputation debit of $30k arises to A Co’s ICA. As the amount of the $30k transfer does not exceed the credits in A Co’s ICA at the end of the previous imputation year (balance = $70k)), the debit arises on 1/9/04. A credit for $30k arises to B Co’s ICA on 1/9/04. A Co’s Adjusted ICA Cr Pcr Dr Pdr Bal 7/7/03 $40k $50k $40k $50k 7/11/03 $40k $50k $40k $100k 14/12/03 $70k $30k 15/12/03 $10k $20k 7/3/04 $40k $50k $40k $70k 31/3/04 $70k 1/9/04 $30k $40k This is the correct outcome. If A Co had paid the right amount of tax ($40k at each provisional tax date) directly to the Commissioner, it would have lost $10k on breach and would have $110k to pay out to shareholders. In this example, it paid out $70k of credits on 14/12 and has a balance of $40k left to pay out. 90 Example 11 – A Co buys tax from intermediary to satisfy underpayment 7/7/03 A Co pays $50k to the intermediary, who deposits it into the tax pooling account. A pooling imputation credit arises to A Co’s ICA (ME 4(1B)(a) and ME 4(2B)(a)). 7/11/03 Ditto 14/12/03 Imputation credits of $70k are attached to dividends. 7/3/04 A Co pays $50k to the intermediary, who deposits it into the tax pooling account.

The intermediary requests IRD to transfer $50,000 from the pooling account to A Co’s tax account as at each of 7/7/03, 7/11/03 and 7/3/04. Pooling debits, and corresponding credits, arise as at those dates (ME 5(1B)(c) and ME 5(2B)(b); ME 4(1)(ac) and ME 4(2)(ac)). 1/9/04 A Co purchases from the intermediary $10k that was deposited into the pool at each of 7/7/03, 7/11/03 and 7/3/04 ($30k is transferred in the intermediary’s records to A Co’s name on 1/9/04). A pooling credit of $30k arises as at 1/9/04 in A Co’s ICA (ME 4(1B)(b) and (2B)(b)). The $10k is transferred as at each of 7/703, 7/11/03 and 7/3/04. Pooling imputation debits and credits arise to the ICA as at each of those dates (ME 5(1B)(c) and ME 5(2B)(b); ME 4(1)(ac) and ME 4(2)(ac)).

A pooling imputation credit arises to A Co’s ICA (ME 4(1B)(a) and ME 4(2B)(a)). 7/11/03 Ditto 14/12/03 Imputation credits of $70k are attached to dividends. 15/12/03 Breach of continuity – no debit arises because credits are pooling credits. 7/3/04 A Co pays $50k to the intermediary, who deposits it into the tax pooling account. A pooling credit arises in ICA. A Co’s ICA Cr PCr Dr PDr Bal 7/7/03 $50k $50k 7/11/03 $50k $100k 14/12/03 $70k $30k 7/3/04 $50k $80k 31/8/04 After year end, A Co’s RIT is $180,000. The intermediary requests IRD to transfer $50,000 from the pooling account to A Co’s tax account as at each of 7/7/03, 7/11/03 and 7/3/04. Credits and pooling debits arise for $50k at each of the transfer dates. This means that $30k is lost on breach of continuity.

($30k is transferred in the intermediary’s records to A Co’s name on 1/9/04.) A pooling credit of $30k arises as at 1/9/04 in A Co’s ICA (ME 4(1B)(b) and (2B)(b)). $10k is transferred from the pooling account to A Co’s income tax account as at each of 7/703, 7/11/03 and 7/3/04. Credits and pooling debits for $10k arise as at these dates. This gives rise to a further debit of $20k on breach of continuity, which leaves the ICA in debit at that date (see below). 92 A Co’s Readjusted ICA Cr Pcr Dr Pdr Bal 7/7/03 $50k +$10k$50k $50k + $10k $50k 7/11/03 $50k +$10k$50k $50k + $10k $100k 14/12/03 $70k $30k 15/12/03 $30k + $20k $-20k 7/3/04 $50k + $10k$50k $50k + $10k 31/3/04 $30k 1/9/04 $30k $60k This is the intended result. A Co has paid tax of $180k – $120k before the breach and $60k after the breach. It paid out $70k in credits before the breach. Therefore it loses $50k on the breach, and retains the $60k to pay out after the breach. 93 FURTHER INCOME TAX (Clauses 31, 36, 43 and 99) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments provide relief from double taxation and extra penalties in relation to further income tax liabilities which arise when imputation credit accounts are over- drawn. In certain circumstance payments of further income tax may be used to offset income tax liabilities, and income tax payments may be used to offset further income tax liabilities. Relief from use-of-money interest and late payment penalties will be available where further income tax and income tax liabilities are outstanding at the same time. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment, but a window of two calendar months from enactment is being allowed for taxpayers to request retrospective adjustments to further income tax liabilities incurred since the 1998-99 income year. Key features Section ME 9(5) of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being replaced by two new subsections, MB 9(5B) and (5C). New subsection (5B) provides that payments of further income tax may be credited to an income liability (including provisional tax) that arises at any time when the company is an imputation credit account company. Likewise, new subsection (5C) provides that payments of income tax may be credited against the further income tax liability, as long as the payment was made after 31 March in the year when the imputation credit account debit caused the further income tax liability. In both cases a company will need to specify the amount to be credited. Offsetting further income tax liabilities and income tax liabilities in this way will make the tax system fairer and ensure that a taxpayer is not penalised twice for what can effectively be one default in payment. New section 181B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for the remission of use-of-money interest and late payment penalties on further income tax liabilities when income tax liabilities are outstanding at the same time. The remission will apply to the extent that the amount of further income tax charged is equal to or less than the amount of the unpaid income tax liability. 94 An amendment to section MB 9 ensures that set-offs of overpaid tax between companies in a wholly owned group will be subject to section MD 2. That is, such setoffs will not be allowed if they create a debit balance in a company’s imputation credit account. This is consistent with the new transfer rules in Subpart XB of the Tax Administration Act because the rules apply only if excess tax is refundable. The amendment to section MB 9 is necessary to ensure that group company set-offs do not have inappropriate results under the remission provisions. Background Further income tax is charged when a company has a debit in its imputation credit account at 31 March in any year. The amount charged is equal to the debit balance in the imputation credit account and is due and payable on 20 June. Currently, section ME 9(5) of the Income Tax Act 1994 provides that any payments of further income tax can be credited to an income tax liability, as well as further income tax, but only to an income tax liability that arose after the date of payment. This can produce inappropriate results, as shown in examples 1 and 2. Example 1 Company Z pays first and second instalments of provisional tax for the 2003 income year of $110,000 each (total amount paid: $220,000). In December 2002 it declares a dividend and, in anticipation of a third instalment of provisional tax of $110,000 (making total provisional tax payments of $330,000), allocates imputation credits of $330,000. However, the third instalment of provisional tax due on 7 March 2003 is overlooked and is not paid until 7 April 2003. As a result, Company Z’s imputation credit account has a debit balance of $110,000 at 31 March 2003. This triggers a liability for further income tax of $110,000 plus imputation penalty tax due on 20 June 2003, despite the fact that the imputation credit account was balanced on 7 April 2003 by the late payment of $110,000. Alternatively, if that payment had been designated to further income tax, the effect of section ME 9(5) would have been that it would not have been available to meet the outstanding provisional tax instalment. Although Company Z has paid the third instalment, and the imputation credit account is now clear, it still owes further income tax of $110,000 plus interest and penalties. This effectively amounts to double taxation because Company Z’s only default was in respect to the provisional tax payment. 95 Detailed analysis Under the new rules, Company Z in example 1 will be able to specify that the payment of $110,000 made on 7 April 2003 is also credited to the further income tax liability due on 20 June 2003. This will extinguish the further income tax liability, but not the imputation penalty tax, which will need to be paid separately. As no further income tax is outstanding at 20 June 2003, there is no need to apply the new section 181B of the Tax Administration Act. Example 2 shows how the relief provisions will operate in relation to use-of-money interest and late payment penalties. Example 2 Company A pays first and second instalments of provisional tax for the 2003 income year of $10,000 each (total amount paid: $20,000). In December 2002 it declares a dividend and, in anticipation of a third instalment of provisional tax of $10,000 (making total provisional tax payments of $30,000), allocates imputation credits of $30,000. However, the third instalment of provisional tax due on 7 March 2003 is overlooked and is not paid until 7 July 2003. As a result, Company A’s imputation credit account has a debit balance of $10,000 at 31 March 2003. This triggers a liability for further income tax of $10,000 due on 20 June 2003. Under section ME 9(5B), Company A in example 2 will be able to specify that the payment made on 7 July 2003 should be credited to the further income tax liability (as well as the third instalment of 2003 provisional tax). This will extinguish the further income tax liability, but not the use-of-money interest and late payment penalties relating to further income tax for the period from 20 June 2003 to 7 July 2003, nor the imputation penalty tax. As at 20 June 2003, Company A was liable to pay further income tax under section ME 9(1) and was also subject to late payment penalties in relation to the third instalment of 2003 provisional tax that was paid late. The use-of-money interest and late payment penalties effectively apply to the same default, the late payment of the third instalment of provisional tax. Therefore section 181B of the Tax Administration Act provides relief. Company A can apply for relief from use-of-money interest and late payment penalties charged on the further income tax. Imputation penalty tax will still need to be paid. 96 As far as late payment penalties are concerned, Company A incurred late payment penalties on outstanding income tax (the third provisional tax instalment) as follows: 8 March 2003 (1% initial penalty) $100 14 March 2003 (4% initial penalty) $404 8 April 2003 (1% incremental penalty) $105 and so on until it was paid. In relation to the further income tax liability, Company A incurred late payment penalties of: 21 June 2003 (1% initial penalty) $100 27 June 2003 (4% initial penalty) $404 As the late payment penalty on the outstanding income tax liability is greater that that charged on the outstanding further income tax liability, the late payment penalty on the further income tax can be remitted in full. Similar analysis applies to the interest running on both accounts. 97 BRANCH EQUIVALENT TAX ACCOUNTS AND FOREIGN LOSSES (Clauses 51-54) Summary of proposed amendments The branch equivalent tax account rules are being amended to clarify that attributed foreign losses and foreign investment fund losses cannot create branch equivalent tax account credits. This is a revenue protection measure intended to prevent the inappropriate generation of tax credits. Application dates The amendments will apply from 1 April 1995 except when a taxpayer has a filed an income tax return based on the current law before the date of introduction of the bill, when it shall apply from that date. Key features Sections MF 4(1)(b) and MF 8(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1994 are being amended to ensure that the term “available net losses” excludes attributed foreign net losses and foreign investment fund net losses. Background The branch equivalent tax account rules aim to prevent double taxation of foreign income that is subject to income tax under controlled foreign company or foreign investment fund rules, as well as subject to foreign dividend withholding payment on foreign dividends received. The intention is that regardless of which income stream occurs first, tax will only be paid once. The branch equivalent tax account mechanism provides that if income tax has been paid first, a branch equivalent tax account credit arises which offsets the liability to foreign dividend withholding payment. Alternatively, if a dividend had been paid in advance of the income being earned in the controlled foreign company, with foreign dividend withholding payment being paid first, a branch equivalent tax account debit arises which offsets the liability to income tax. A branch equivalent tax account credit can also be created when losses from New Zealand sources have been offset against attributed foreign income, so no liability to income tax arises. The intention was always that only losses from New Zealand sources could create branch equivalent tax account credits. However the re-ordering of the Income Tax Act in 1994 and the subsequent changes, made with the introduction of the Act’s new core provisions in 1997, have made that unclear. 98 Upon reordering of the Act all losses, both New Zealand and foreign, were grouped together under Part I. As a branch equivalent tax account credit could be created when “any loss” offset a company’s attributed foreign income of the company, this regrouping of losses made it less clear that branch equivalent tax account credits could only be created with New Zealand losses. The changes also apply to the Act as it was before the introduction of the new core provisions and clarify that any loss other than attributed foreign losses or foreign investment fund losses can create a branch equivalent tax account credit. The changes under core provisions allowed “available net losses” to create branch equivalent tax account credits. “Available net losses” are defined under section OB 1 as losses offset under part I which include attributed foreign net losses and foreign investment fund net losses. As allowing attributed foreign net losses and foreign investment fund net losses to create branch equivalent tax account credits is contrary to the original policy intent, amendments are being made to exclude them with effect from the introduction of the core provisions. 99 APPLICATION DATE OF NEW TAX CODES (Clause 55(3)) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment clarifies that a new tax code should apply from the start of the pay period in which it is received by an employer, instead of the succeeding one. This rule would apply only where the new tax code was received by the employer before the payroll preparation date for that pay period. The amendment will reduce compliance costs and increase the accuracy of the PAYE system. Application date The amendment will apply to pay periods ending on or after 1 April 2004. Key features Section NC 8(4) of the Income Tax Act is being amended to provide that a new tax code can apply for the current pay period where the code is delivered prior to the cut off point for the preparation of the pay. Background The amount of tax deducted from salary and wages depends upon the tax code that the employee supplies to the employer. When employees’ circumstances change – for example, when they become liable for student loan repayments or take on a second job, they can elect a new tax deduction code. At present, a new tax code applies from the start of the pay period after the one in which it is provided to the employer. This can cause confusion as many employers are actually applying new tax codes to the current period in which they are received. Applying new tax codes in this way increases the accuracy of the PAYE deduction system. The amendment will reduce compliance costs for employers in that they will not have to remember to apply the new code with effect from the following pay period. The amendment also improves the accuracy of the PAYE deduction system and therefore requires fewer salary and wage earners to file returns or request income statements. 100 PROGRESSIVE RATES OF SPECIFIED SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTION WITHHOLDING TAX (Clauses 57, 58 and 59) Summary of proposed amendments The bill introduces progressive rates for SSCWT (specified superannuation contribution withholding tax) that will allow for the appropriate taxation of employer contributions to employer-based superannuation funds for employees earning $38,000 or less. If an employer chooses to use the progressive rate system, the rate of SSCWT on behalf of each employee will be based on the sum of annual salary or wages and superannuation contribution received by the employee in the previous year. The SSCWT rate for contributions on behalf of employees with salary or wages and superannuation contributions totalling $38,000 or less will be 21%, and for employees with salary or wages and superannuation contributions totalling more than $38,000 it will be 33%. The measure is intended to reduce the over-taxation of the retirement savings of low- income people. Application date The amendments will apply to employer contributions made after 1 April 2004. Key features A new section NE 2AB of the Income Tax Act 1994 will be introduced to allow for the application of progressive rates of SSCWT. The 21% rate will be voluntary and at the discretion of employers. If employers choose not to offer it, a flat rate of 33% will be applied. For employers who choose to use the rates, a rate will be determined for each employee at the beginning of the standard tax year, which is 1 April. The rate will be set by the employer or fund manager (depending on the administrative features of the fund) with reference to the employee’s annual salary/wages and superannuation contributions in the previous standard tax year (1 April to 31 March). When employees have not worked for the previous year, an annualised estimate based on the salary or wages and superannuation contributions they have received or will receive will be used. The progressive SSCWT rate will apply for the full year, and no adjustment will be required if salary or wages and/or contributions change during the income year to which the rate applies. However, if an employee’s salary or wages and superannuation contributions do change, a new rate will be set the following year based on this change. 101 For example, if an employer elected to use the progressive SSCWT rates, the employer or fund manager would determine the progressive SSCWT rate on the combined salary or wages and employer’s superannuation contributions paid to the employee in the previous tax year. If the combined total was over $38,000 the rate would be 33% and if under this threshold the rate would be 21%. Therefore, if an employee’s annual salary was $32,000 and superannuation contributions were $2,000, the marginal income rate on salary of $34,000 is 21%, so the rate of SSCWT on the contributions would be 21%. Background Contributions by employers to superannuation funds on behalf of their employees are generally subject to SSCWT at a flat rate of 33 percent. The 33% rate over-taxes employees earning less than $38,000 and under-taxes those earning more than $60,000. In last year’s Budget the government announced that it intended to introduce, by 1 April 2004, legislation to deal with the over-taxation of employer contributions for employees earning under $38,000. Officials then consulted with sector representatives and employers on three options, receiving a number of written and oral submissions. The main concerns arising from consultation were compliance costs and potential for salary re-characterisation. Although the chosen option could be said to be marginally more complex than others consulted on, and impose additional compliance cost as a result of including the employee’s superannuation contribution as part of the rate calculation, it provides a basis for the SSCWT rate calculation that is less likely to be manipulated and therefore avoids the re-characterisation problem. 102 INCOME TAX RATES (Clause 3) Summary of proposed amendments The bill confirms the annual income tax rates that will apply for the 2003-2004 income year. The annual rates to be confirmed are the same rates that applied for the 2002-2003 income year. Application date The amendment will apply for the 2003-2004 income year. Key features The rates listed in Schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 will be confirmed for the 2003-2004 income year. Background The Income Tax Act 1994 provides for the rates of income tax specified in the First Schedule of the Act to be confirmed each year. 103 EXTENDING NON-FILING OF INCOME TAX RETURNS (Clauses 78(6), 78(9) and 84) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment removes the requirement for most IR 56 taxpayers, which include private domestic workers, staff of foreign consulates and embassies, New Zealand based representatives of foreign companies and Operation Deep Freeze personnel, to file end-of-year income tax returns. They will instead be issued with an income statement for the year. Application date The amendment will apply from the 2003-04 income year. Key features Section 33A(2)(h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being repealed and section 80D(1) amended to remove the requirement for most IR 56 taxpayers to file IR 3 returns. Background Private domestic workers (such as home helpers, attendant caregivers, nannies and gardeners) and other IR 56 taxpayers are required to return tax on income from employment, under the PAYE rules, as if they were the employer. They are also required to file an end-of-year income tax return (an IR 3) to reconcile the PAYE deductions made throughout the year (as well as any other income and tax paid). The requirement for IR 56 taxpayers to file an IR 3 return is based largely on past ACC obligations, when levies payable were calculated on the return. From the 2002 income year, however, the calculation of ACC levies is administered by the Accident Compensation Corporation. Consequently, this key reason for requiring most IR 56 taxpayers to file an end-of-year return is no longer valid. An income statement (or personal tax summary) is sufficient for these taxpayers. IR 56 taxpayers will still be required to file a return only if they have income, in a year, other than from employment (and interest or dividends). 104 HOME-BASED SERVICES (Clauses 7, 66(26), 66(28), 74, 79 and 86) Summary of proposed amendments Provisions are being introduced to empower the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to determine standard costs for services such as home-based childcare. The Commissioner will also be able to exempt from income tax specified taxpayers in recognition of the need for practicality and the minimisation of compliance costs, while providing a consistent framework for taxation in the industry. This measure is aimed at helping taxpayers providing services such as home-based childcare, whose tax obligations are often disproportionate to the level of net tax paid. This amendment is intended to reduce or remove these compliance costs, depending on the disparity involved. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features A new section, 91AA, is being inserted into the Tax Administration Act 1994, and consequential amendments are being made to both that Act and the Income Tax Act 1994 as follows: • Section 91AA(1) and (2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows the Commissioner to determine standard costs for specified home-based services. • Section 91AA(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows individuals to use these standard costs in lieu of actual costs, thus significantly reducing industry compliance costs. • New section 33B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 removes the requirement to file a return for those who have income below the standard costs, removing all compliance costs. However, the right to file an income tax return is retained, if desired, in which case either actual costs or the standard costs can be used. Under section ID 1(2) of the Income Tax Act 1994, no losses are allowed if standard costs are used. • Sections 91AA(2)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and CB 9(h) of the Income Tax Act 1994 allow the Commissioner to determine that income earned by certain taxpayers providing home based services is not taxable on the basis that the compliance costs of calculating and paying any tax owed exceed the benefits of the tax payment. 105 Background The current treatment of taxpayers who provide services based on the use of their home, such as the home-based childcare industry, or those providing board can result in some taxpayers with relatively low income incurring high compliance costs. This measure addresses the concern by allowing the Commissioner to exempt income in certain circumstances, and taxpayers to use standard costs in others. 106 SHORTFALL PENALTIES AND LOSS ATTRIBUTING QUALIFYING COMPANIES (Clause 95) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment provides relief when a loss attributing qualifying company’s net loss has been overstated, causing a tax shortfall to both the company and its shareholders. Under current law, both the company and its shareholders can be subject to shortfall penalties in these circumstances. Application date The amendment will apply retrospectively to shortfall penalties imposed since 1 April 1998, in accordance with the four-year time bar for reassessments. Key features New section 141FC of the Tax Administration Act 1994 deals with the situation where, as a consequence of the attribution of a net loss by a loss attributing qualifying company and the subsequent disallowance of deductions to the company and, therefore, the shareholders as well, shortfall penalties are charged to both the company and the shareholders. In these circumstances the shareholder will be able to apply for a reduction in the penalty when the shortfall penalty charged to the company has been paid in full. The reduction will be limited to the shareholder’s pro rata proportion of the company’s shortfall penalty. For the purposes of the apportionment, the shareholder’s shares will be limited to those owned by the shareholder during the whole period from the start of the year of the offence to the date the penalty was imposed. Example LAQC Ltd is charged a shortfall penalty of $20,000, which it pays in full. A owns 20 of the 100 shares in LAQC Ltd (20%) for the whole of the period from the year of offence to the date the penalty was imposed. A is charged a shortfall penalty of $800. A seeks an offset. The equivalent of A’s share of LAQC Ltd’s shortfall penalty is $4,000 ($20,000 x 20%). As the penalty charged to A is less than $4,000, and A owned the shares for the whole of the period from the start of the year of the offence to the date the penalty was imposed, A’s shortfall penalty will be offset. 107 Background Net losses of loss attributing qualifying companies are attributed to shareholders. The High Court (Chapman v CIR (HC M402-SD02)) has recently held that where a loss has been overstated, causing a tax shortfall to both the company and the shareholders, shortfall penalties can be imposed on both the company and shareholders because they have taken separate tax positions. This decision is under appeal. Conceptually, only one penalty is appropriate in these circumstances. By providing relief to the shareholder, the offset mechanism recognises that penalties can be difficult to collect from a company that may no longer be a qualifying company, or is insolvent. The design of the offset mechanism also ensures that the amendment will not affect the arguments the Court of Appeal will be asked to decide in the Chapman case. 108 STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT DEDUCTIONS (Clauses 55(1) & (5), 126, 127, 128, 129 and 130(2) & (4)) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment allows Inland Revenue to instruct an employer to make the correct student loan repayment deductions from a borrower’s salary or wages. Application date The amendment will apply from pay periods ending on and after the date of enactment. Key features Currently, Inland Revenue has the power to instruct an employer to change an employee’s income tax code to ensure that the correct amount of tax is deducted. This amendment creates a similar power in relation to student loan repayment deductions. Sections 2, 17, 18 and 25 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 are being amended accordingly. Background Student loan borrowers whose income is from salary or wages, and whose primary income exceeds the repayment threshold, are required to advise their employer of their student loan liability. Repayment deductions, which are incorporated into the PAYE deductions, are then made by the employer. If the correct deductions are made, most salary and wage earners will have little, or no, end-of-year liability. However, despite being reminded of their obligations, some borrowers fail to fulfil this requirement. Remedial amendments 111 JUDGES’ ALLOWANCES (Clauses 66(10), (25) & (27) and 67) Summary of proposed amendments In 1998 the Income Tax Act was amended to ensure that remuneration and expenses paid to judges would receive the same tax treatment as similar payments made to employees. The bill contains remedial amendments that ensure the legislation reflects this policy. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2003. Key features The changes amend the definitions of “salary or wages” and “employment” contained in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. The definition of salary or wages has been extended to include payment of salary or allowances paid to judges under a determination of the Remuneration Authority. The definition of “employment” has been extended to include the activities of the office of a judge which give rise to an entitlement to the receipt of a source deduction payment. A consequential amendment repeals the definition of “specified office holder” in section OB 1, and also repeals the reference to income of a specified office holder in the definition of “source deduction payment” in section OB 2(1). The effect of these changes is to make the remuneration of judges fit more clearly within the tax treatment that applies to employees. Background In 1998 the Income Tax Act was amended to ensure that judges would receive the same tax treatment as employees in respect of the income they derive from their office as a judge. However, it has since been found that those amendments may not have been sufficient to achieve that objective. This is because judges are not, in fact, in an employment relationship, and some provisions of the Act assume that such a relationship exists for employees. It is therefore necessary to add the remuneration of judges to the definition of “salary or wages”, and include the activities for which that remuneration is paid in the definition of “employment”. 112 GROUP INVESTMENT FUNDS (Clauses 8, 12, 16, 18 and 66(15)) Summary of amendments A deduction provision for management fees charged by trustee companies to investors of group investment funds is being repealed because it is no longer required. Application date The amendment will apply from the start of the 2004-2005 income, year so that group investment funds and trustee companies have time to make any required changes to their business practices and systems. Key features Section DI 3A of the Income Tax Act 1994, which allows group investment funds to claim a deduction for management fees charged by trustee companies to investors in a fund, is being repealed because it is no longer required. Section CF 3(1)(ga), which provides that any amount distributed to a trustee company on behalf of an investor is not a dividend, is also repealed, along with a number of cross-references to section DI 3A. Background Section DI 3A was introduced to ensure that group investment funds could claim a deduction for management fees charged by trustee companies to investors in a group investment fund. Under the Trustee Companies Act 1967, trustee companies were prohibited from charging management fees to group investment funds. To get around this prohibition, trustee companies charged management fees to investors and group investment funds deducted those fees and paid them to the trustee companies instead. Section DI 3A, however, was an interim measure. The intention was that it would be repealed as soon as the Trustee Companies Act could be amended to provide for group investment funds to pay management fees to trustee companies. The Trustee Companies Amendment Act 2002 removed the prohibition. Management fees paid by group investment funds to trustee companies are deductible under normal tax rules, so section DI 3A and section CF 3(1)(ga), which was a consequential amendment introduced at the same time as section DI 3A, are no longer required. 113 IMPUTATION AND DIVIDEND WITHHOLDING PAYMENT CREDITS (Clauses 37 and 38) Summary of proposed amendment When a refund would create a debit balance in a company’s imputation credit account or dividend withholding payment account, no debit or credit to those accounts will result from crediting the overpaid amount to another income tax or dividend withholding payment liability. The amendment is intended to align the relevant legislation with the comprehensive transfer rules enacted in 2002. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2003. Key features Section MD 4, which denies a credit to an imputation credit account or dividend withholding payment account in some circumstances, is being repealed because it is no longer appropriate. New section MD 5 provides that no debit or credit will arise to the imputation credit account when: • overpaid tax that cannot be refunded under section MD 2 is credited to an income tax or provisional tax liability under section MD 2(5); • overpaid dividend withholding payments that cannot be refunded under section NH 4(2)(a) is credited to a dividend withholding payment payable under section NH 4(2)(b); and • overpaid dividend withholding payments that cannot be refunded under section NH 5(5) is credited to a dividend withholding payment payable under section NH 5(5)(b). Background Comprehensive transfer rules (Part XB of the Tax Administration Act 1994) were enacted in the Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002. Under Part XB, transfers of tax are treated as a refund and repayment of the relevant amount of tax. Section MD 4, which denies a credit to the imputation credit account in certain circumstances, is not consistent with this approach, and is therefore being repealed. 114 Part XB applies to the extent that excess tax is refundable. This means it does not apply when the company’s imputation credit account or dividend withholding payment account has insufficient credits and an amount is credited under sections MD 2(5), NH 4(2)(b) or NH 5(5)(b). Therefore a special rule is required to deal with these situations. Amounts credited under those provisions should have no effect on the balance of the imputation credit account or the dividend withholding payment account, therefore they should not result in a debit or credit to those accounts. 115 PROCEDURE FOR ISSUING NOTICES (Clause 76) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments clarify that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue may send notices to an address nominated by a taxpayer or by the taxpayer’s agent, whether it is a physical address or a post box. These amendments remove uncertainties with the procedure for issuing notices to taxpayers and ensure that notices posted in this manner by the Commissioner are valid. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 1995, the date the Tax Administration Act 1994 came into force. Key features The amendments make two insertions in section 14(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to clarify that the Commissioner may give valid notice by: • posting the notice to an address nominated by the taxpayer; or • posting the notice to an address nominated by the taxpayer’s agent. Background The Tax Administration Act 1994 does not explicitly allow for Inland Revenue notices to be posted to post boxes. However, the High Court recently decided in Hieber v CIR 10 that in some circumstances valid notice could be given via a post box. The decision causes some uncertainty for Inland Revenue as well as taxpayers and tax agents who are not covered by the decision but choose to receive correspondence through post box addresses. Taxpayers commonly use post boxes to provide security and ease of communication. Often the street address of a taxpayer (particularly business taxpayers and tax agents) is not equipped to receive mail. These amendments validate existing policy and practice, ensuring that all taxpayers can continue to receive notices from the Commissioner in a manner that provides certainty of delivery without causing disruption to their normal business practices. The amendments are backdated to provide certainty for taxpayers and Inland Revenue regarding notices that have already been issued to post boxes and other addresses nominated by taxpayers or their agents. 10 (2002) 20 NZTC 17,774. 116 CHARGES OVER PROPERTY (Clause 98) Summary of proposed amendment The Tax Administration Act 1994 is being amended to ensure that it reflects the policy outcome intended when the Personal Property Securities Act 1999 was enacted: that Inland Revenue should be able to register charges over the property of persons who default in the payment of tax deductions and ACC earner premium. Application date The amendments apply from the date of enactment. Key features Charges that are created under section 169 of the Tax Administration Act (Unpaid tax deductions, etc., to constitute charge on employer’s property) may be registered on the Personal Property Securities Register. Background Inland Revenue has the ability to create charges over the property of a person who defaults in payment of tax deductions and ACC earner premium. Until recently, such charges were registered under registers including those created by: • the Chattels Transfer Act 1924 • Part VI of the Companies Act 1955. Registers for charges over personal property created by these Acts were discontinued when the Personal Property Securities Register was established by the Personal Property Securities Act 1999 on its commencement on 1 May 2002. The intention when that Act was introduced was that the status quo should be maintained in relation to the tax provisions that were affected by the Act. Therefore charges over personal property that previously could be registered under the two Acts listed above should now be registered in the current register. There is doubt about whether legislative changes made to section 169 at the time the Personal Property Securities Act was enacted achieve this. The amendment in this bill ensures that the Personal Property Securities Act will operate in the same way, in relation to section 169 charges, as the registers that preceded it. The amendment also replaces incorrect references to the Land Transfer Act 1952 and the Deeds Registration Act 1908 with a reference to the Statutory Land Charges Registration Act 1928. 117 EMPLOYER OBLIGATIONS FOR STUDENT LOAN DEDUCTIONS (Clauses 70(2) & (4) and 130(1), (3) & (4)) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment ensures that offences by employers relating to student loan deductions are penalised in the same way as offences relating to PAYE. Application date The amendment will apply from the 1997-98 income year, when the compliance and penalties legislation came into effect. Key features Amendments are being made to the definition of “NRWT rules”, “PAYE rules”, “RWT rules” and “SSCWT rules” in the Income Tax Act 1994 to omit unnecessary references to sections contained in Part IX. The Student Loans Scheme Act is also being amended to ensure that part IX applies as far as it is applicable to repayment deductions. Background The Student Loans Scheme Act 1992 originally contained its own offences and related penalties. In 1996 those relating to employer deductions were repealed. The intention was that student loan offences by employers in relation to repayment deductions would come within the provisions of the penalty rules introduced in Part IX of the Tax Administration Act. However, the amendment made to the Student Loans Scheme Act at that time excludes section 143A(1)(d) and (e) and 143B(1)(d), and Part IX (except section 146). The original amendment should have applied to sections 143A, 143B and 146 as far as they are applicable to repayment deductions. This outcome is achieved by amending the definition of the PAYE rules in section OZ 1 of the Income Tax Act, and by amending section 25 of the Student Loan Scheme Act to ensure that the penalty provisions in the Tax Administration Act apply. 118 MINOR TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS A number of minor technical amendments are being made to the tax Acts. Unless otherwise stated, the amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Income Tax Act 1994 Definition of “dual resident company” (Clause 21) The definition of “dual resident company” in section IG 2(11), which is part of the group loss offset provisions, refers incorrectly in two places to “an agreement”. This reference will be replaced with “double tax agreement”. Underlying foreign tax credits (Clause 29) Section LF 1(1), which deals with the purpose of the underlying foreign tax credit provisions, is intended to apply to New Zealand resident companies. The provision, however, refers only to a “New Zealand company”, which is defined in section OB 1 as a company incorporated in New Zealand, which is a narrower definition than that for New Zealand resident companies. Accordingly, the two references to “New Zealand company” will be replaced with a reference to a “New Zealand resident company”. The amendment will apply from the 1995-96 income year. Electing the appropriate tax rate on extra emoluments (Clause 55(2)) Section NC 8(1A) allows employees to provide a tax code declaration to an employer electing the appropriate tax rate on extra emoluments (with the rates set in clause 8 of schedule 19 to the Income Tax Act 1994). While the present wording of section NC 8(1A) allows an employee that has an annual taxable income in excess of $60,000 to elect to have any extra emoluments taxed at the 39% rate, it also allows them to elect the 33% tax rate. An amendment is being made to require employees to elect the appropriate tax rate on extra emoluments (that is, the 33% tax rate on extra emoluments only if total income in a year is $60,000 or less). The amendment will apply from 1 April 2004. Resident withholding tax exemption certificates (Clause 62(1)) Section NF 9(1)(c), which relates to resident withholding tax exemption certificates, refers to the Trustee Banks Restructuring Act 1988. This reference is redundant because that Act has been repealed. Accordingly, section NF 9(1)(c) will be repealed. 119 Redundant references to “additional tax” (Clauses 62(3), 65 and 89) There are several redundant references in the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 to “additional tax”. These redundant references should be replaced with references to “late payment penalty”. The affected provisions are sections NF 9(11) and NH 3(7) of the Income Tax Act 1994 and section 94(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. These amendments will apply to late payment penalties arising from the 1997-98 income year. Definition of “commercial bill” (Clause 66(4)) The list of provisions to which the definition of “commercial bill” in section OB 1 applies is incomplete. This list will be amended by adding references to section DJ 16 (expenditure incurred on acquiring commercial bills) and section GC 14A (an anti- avoidance provision relating to commercial bills). Definition of “determination” (Clause 66(8)) The definition of “determination” in section OB 1 cross-refers to the definition in section LC 7(2). Section LC 7(2) has been repealed and, accordingly, the cross- referencing definition of “determination” in section OB 1 will also be repealed. Definition of “emergency call” (Clause 66(9)) The definition of “emergency call” in section OB 1 was amended by the self- assessment amendments enacted in 2001. As a result, paragraph (c) of the definition contains an incorrect cross-reference. Accordingly, the reference in that paragraph to “paragraph (a)(iii)” will be replaced with a reference to “paragraph (a)(iv)”, with application from the 2003-03 income year. Definition of “resident in New Zealand” (Clause 66(24)) The definition of “New Zealand resident” in section OB 1 refers to a person resident in New Zealand under sections OE 1, OE 2 or OE 3. However, the corresponding section OB 1 definition of “resident in New Zealand” does not also contain a reference to section OE 3, which refers to a non-resident life insurer who elects to be treated as resident in New Zealand. Accordingly, a reference to section OE 3 will be included in the section OB 1 definition of “resident in New Zealand”. Measurement of voting and market value interests (Clause 68) Section OD 5(3), which relates to the measurement of voting and market value interests, refers to two types of trustee companies. A minor clarification to the terminology will be made to ensure that it is clear which type of trustee company is being referred to in the provision. 120 Basic rates of income tax (Clause 71(2)) Part A of Schedule 1 lists the basic rates of income tax. Clauses 1 to 8 list the basic rates of income tax for specific types of taxpayers or income. Clause 9 provides for the determination of the basic rate for all other taxpayers or income types (mainly individuals). Clause 9 contains a cross-referencing error as it refers to clauses 1 to 10 instead of clauses 1 to 8. This error was made when Schedule 1 was replaced by the core provision amendments, which apply from the 1997-98 income year. Clause 9 will be corrected by replacing the reference to “clauses 1 to 10” with a reference to “clauses 1 to 8”, with application from the 1997-98 income year. Tax Administration Act 1994 Requisition of information held by offshore entities (Clause 76) Section 17(1B) was recently enacted by the Taxation (Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003 to ensure that Inland Revenue can requisition from New Zealand residents information or documents held by offshore entities controlled by the New Zealand residents. A clarifying amendment will be made to section 17(1B) to ensure that the effect of this provision is carried through to the relevant offence provisions, which was always the legislative intention. Non-filing of returns (Clauses 78(4), 78(5) and 78(8)) The Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002 extended the non-filing of tax returns to taxpayers with income totalling $200 or less, in an income year, from which tax was not deducted. This was achieved by the addition of section 33A(1)(a)(iv) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. However, section 33A(2)(d), (e) and (g) requires recipients of withholding payments, interest or dividends that do not have a New Zealand source and from which withholding tax is not deducted at source, and beneficiary income, respectively, to file end-of-year income tax returns, irrespective of the total amount of the income involved. An amendment is being made to provide that taxpayers with income from these sources are required to file returns only if the total amount, in an income year, is more than $200. The amendment will apply from the 2002-03 income year. Redundant notice of assessment reference (Clause 85) Section 80H(2) provides that if any income statement is treated as an assessment then the requirement in section 111 for the Commissioner to give notice to a taxpayer of an assessment does not apply. Following the self-assessment amendments enacted in 2001, section 80H treats an income statement as an assessment made by a taxpayer rather than the Commissioner and the notice requirements in section 111 apply only to assessments made by the Commissioner. Section 80H(2) is therefore redundant and will be repealed. 121 Accounting terminology (Clauses 87 and 88) Two references in sections 91E(4)(j) and 91F(4)(h) to “generally accepted accounting principles” will be changed to “generally accepted accounting practice” to ensure that the use of accounting terminology is consistent between the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. The Income Tax Act 1994 was previously inconsistent in its use of these two terms (which have the same meaning), and it was amended in 2002 to provide for consistent use of “generally accepted accounting practice”, which is the terminology employed in the Financial Reporting Act 1993. The amendments will apply from 17 October 2002. Redundant objection procedure reference (Clause 90) In section 100, relating to the assessment of non-resident withholding tax, there is a redundant reference to the former objection procedures. This reference will be replaced with the reference to the new challenge procedures. The amendment will apply from 1 October 1996. Assessment made by Commissioner following incorrect income statement (Clause 91) Section 106(1B) relates to the payment of tax under an assessment made by the Commissioner following an incorrect income statement. This provision will be amended to correct internal subsection references, with application from the same income years the original cross-referenced provisions applied from. Definition of “interest period” (Clause 92) The definition of “interest period” in section 120C(1) is being amended to reflect the effect of the Income Tax (Refund of Excess Tax) Order 2003. The Order raises from $50 to $200 the threshold under which a taxpayer who is issued with an income statement and is owed a refund does not have to confirm that the refund is correct. Under the section 120C(1) definition of “interest period”, where a taxpayer has been issued an income statement and has overpaid tax, use of money interest applies from the date of issue of the income statement to the earlier of the date on which the tax is refunded, or the date on which the taxpayer is able to claim the refund (in the case of overpaid tax of $50 or more). The reference to “$50” in paragraph (b)(iii) of the definition is being changed to reflect the higher threshold under the Income Tax (Refund of Excess Tax) Order 2003. The amendment will apply in respect of overpaid tax from the 2002-03 income year. Gross carelessness penalty (Clause 94) Section 141C will be amended to make it clear that when a taxpayer makes a mistake, and the mistake is of such magnitude that the taxpayer breaches the gross carelessness standard, that shortfall penalty should be imposed. This is consistent with the new section 141A(4) inserted by the Taxation (Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003. The amendment will apply from the start of the 2004-2005 income year for income tax and from 1 April 2004 for other tax types. 122 Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Definition of flat-owning or office-owning company (Clause 103) The reference to “flat-owning or office-owning company” in section 3(3)(c) cross- refers to the definition in section 2(1) of the Companies Amendment Act 1964. This Act, however, was repealed in 1993, and the definition of “flat-owning or office- owning company” is now contained in section 121A of the Land Transfer Act 1952. Accordingly, the reference in section 3(3)(c) of the GST Act to “section 2(1) of the Companies Amendment Act 1964” will be replaced with a reference to “section 121A of the Land Transfer Act 1952”. The amendment will apply from 1 July 1994. Supply not in New Zealand if recipient is entitled to an input tax credit (Clause 106(5)) Section 8(8) ensures that unless the supplier and the recipient agree otherwise, a supply of telecommunications services from a non-resident to a registered person in New Zealand for which the New Zealand recipient would be entitled to an input tax credit is not subject to GST. It refers to supplies by “telecommunications suppliers”, which may unduly limit the scope of the exclusion, as telecommunications services may be supplied by companies which do not fall within the definition of a “telecommunications supplier”. The reference to “telecommunications supplier” will therefore be removed. GST returns (Clause 112) Section 18, which relates to other returns that are required to be made in addition to ordinary returns, contains a reference to section 19. Section 19 has been previously reorganised into several sections and the part of former section 19 that related to returns is now contained in section 19B. Accordingly, the reference in section 18 to section 19 should be updated by replacing it with a reference to section 19B. Single change-in-use deductions (Clause 116(2)) Section 21H(3)(d), which relates to the making of a single deduction for a change-in- use of a good or service, refers to the former section 21, which governed both output tax and input tax change-in-use adjustments. Given that section 21H(3)(d) is meant to refer to single output tax adjustments, the reference in it to “section 21” will be replaced with “section 21(1)”. The amendment will apply from 10 October 2000. Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 Student loan scheme – remedial amendment (Clause 131) Minor drafting errors in the student loan underestimation penalty provisions (section 44A) are being corrected. The provisions currently refer to “repayment obligation” whereas the references should be to “residual repayment obligation” or “interim repayment obligation” as appropriate. 123 Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002 Transfers of overpaid tax (Clauses 30, 35, 61, 63 and 120) New rules relating to the transfer of overpaid tax were recently enacted by the Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002. These rules allow Inland Revenue, at the request of a taxpayer, to transfer tax that is overpaid by the taxpayer to another period or type of tax or to another taxpayer. New section 173T provides that when excess tax is used to offset an outstanding tax liability of a taxpayer, the taxpayer can request that the offsetting occurs at a date allowed by the new transfer rules. Consequential references to section 173T were inserted in the offsetting rules in sections MB 8(1) and (2), MD 1(3), NF 7(5) and NG 16(4) of the Income Tax Act 1994 and section 46(6) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. A minor clarifying amendment will be made to these offset rules to ensure that the Commissioner’s offsetting powers are not reduced by the inclusion of references in the offsetting provisions to section 173T of the Tax Administration Act. However, a taxpayer may request that the Commissioner apply the offset from any date that is allowed by the transfer rules. This clarifying amendment to the offsetting provisions will have the same application date as the relevant amendments enacted by the Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002.

The environment within which tax disputes are resolved is, therefore, critical to maintaining an efficient tax administration. 1.2 This discussion document is the product of the first review of the legislative framework of the disputes resolution process and is primarily concerned with the pre-assessment phase of the process. It introduces for public consultation proposals for further improving the framework. Policy objective of the disputes process 1.3 The objective of the legislative disputes process is to ensure that an assessment is as correct as is practicable and to deal with any disputes over tax liability fairly, efficiently and quickly. The disputes process is designed to achieve these objectives by ensuring a high level of disclosure of relevant information and discussion between the parties, which encourages them to place “all cards on the table”. The procedures require time and effort to be put into cases early in the process before an assessment which would alter a position in a taxpayer’s return is issued. 1.4 The overall objectives of the process have, therefore, been to improve the quality and timeliness of assessments and to reduce the likelihood and grounds for subsequent litigation. The context of this review 1.5 The purpose of this discussion document is to ensure that the government’s objective to make the dispute resolution procedure fairer, faster and generally more efficient is being supported by the legislation. The review will therefore focus on particular ways in which, within this objective, the disputes process can be improved for both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. 1.6 The review also provides the first opportunity to address GST issues in the context of developments in tax administration, particularly the recent introduction of self-assessment, which aligned legislation with the practice of taxpayers self-assessing their tax liability. 2 Is the current process working? 1.7 The current process would appear to a significant extent to be meeting its objectives because the number of audited cases that are disputed is decreasing and the cases that are being litigated are also decreasing. 1.8 In 1997, the proportion of audited cases giving rise to a dispute was two percent of total cases. This figure dropped to 0.91 percent in 2002. 1 The decrease suggests that the disputes process, combined with Inland Revenue’s audit selection process, is reducing the number of disputed cases. This is illustrated in figure 1. Figure 1: Total results in litigated tax disputes 1.9 In 1996, Inland Revenue’s Litigation Management unit was established. The unit manages the litigation of disputed tax cases and cases where Inland Revenue’s actions are subject to judicial review. Although the number of cases that have proceeded to the disputes phase is lower, it is generally the higher value cases that are being disputed. 2 In addition, Inland Revenue is increasingly more successful with those cases that are litigated. 1 Based on data collected by Inland Revenue. 2 Inland Revenue Annual Report 2001, for the year ended 30 June 2001, page 94. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 1993 1994 1995 199619971998199920002001 year number Favourable to IRD Favourable to taxpayer Partial Total 3 1.10 These factors indicate that the overall objectives of the disputes process, to improve the quality and timeliness of assessments and to reduce the likelihood and grounds for subsequent litigation, are being met. The proposals 1.11 The discussion document concentrates on further improving the process by ensuring that: • each step of the disputes process is completed according to the policy intent of the legislation; • the documents required throughout the process are drafted to contain relevant information in an efficient way; and • legislated time frames are consistent with the objectives of the disputes process. 1.12 The disputes process is dependent on an efficient administrative practice. Although this discussion document can improve the framework within which these processes operate, it does not generally address administrative practices. It is therefore important that Inland Revenue also undertakes a review of its administrative practices and policies in relation to the resolution of disputes, which is currently under way. The scope of the legislative review 1.13 As reflected in the structure of this discussion document, the scope of the legislative review covers five broad subject areas: • the need for Inland Revenue to complete the process as the legislation intended; • the content of the Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA), the Notice of Response (NOR) and the Statement of Position (SOP); • the increasing incidence of the taxpayer NOPA; • the need to align the eight-year refund period with the four-year time bar and associated GST issues; and • miscellaneous issues. 4 SUMMARY OF MAIN PROPOSALS The main proposals in this discussion document are to: • clarify that the Commissioner’s power to amend an assessment is to be used only in connection with the formal disputes process, except in limited circumstances prescribed in legislation or following an agreed adjustment or other situation in which a NOPA is not required; 3 • provide for the ability to simplify the content of the NOPA and the NOR and clarify the role of the SOP; • provide for the time bar to be suspended for one year, rather than the current six months, when the taxpayer has had difficulty complying with an information request; • replace the reference to the omission of gross income in relation to the exceptions to the Commissioner’s four year statute bar period with a provision which has regard to the conduct of the taxpayer; • prescribe information that must be contained in taxpayer-initiated NOPAs; • align the eight-year refund period with the four-year statute bar; • limit the time in which taxpayers can make GST input tax adjustments to two years, other than when there is an agreed adjustment, and clarify that GST is self-assessed; • improve the process for test case procedures, so that a case can become a test case before an assessment is issued; and • repeal the term “disputable decision” to clarify that, other than in specified circumstances, an assessment is the basis of a dispute. Application date 1.14 In general, the proposals in this discussion document will apply in relation to disputes begun on or after the date the amending legislation is enacted. 3 This proposal does not affect the Commissioner’s ability to issue an amended assessment without first issuing a NOPA, as prescribed in section 89C Tax Administration Act 1994. 5 Submissions 1.15 The government invites submissions on the proposals in this discussion document. Submissions should be made by 5 September 2003 and addressed to: Disputes Review c/- The General Manager Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON or e-mailed to policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz 1.16 Submissions may be published on the website of the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue in the interests of making the information widely available. 1.17 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for officials from Inland Revenue to contact those making submissions and to discuss their submission, if required. 1.18 A submission may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. If you feel there is any part of your submission that should be properly withheld under the Act, please indicate this clearly on your submission. 6 Chapter 2 THE DISPUTES RESOLUTION PROCESS Background to the current disputes process 2.1 The disputes process was introduced in 1996 in response to the recommendations of the Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department, which was chaired by Sir Ivor Richardson. 4 2.2 The objection procedures at that time were perceived as deficient in that they did not adequately support the early identification and prompt resolution of issues leading to tax disputes. The Richardson Review recommended that a comprehensive approach to tax disputes be developed with the following objectives: 5 • every practical effort be made to ensure that assessments are correct before they are issued; • any dispute be identified at the earliest practical time; • communication between the taxpayer and Inland Revenue be direct and open to ensure that all information relevant to the dispute is available as soon as possible; and • appropriate independent advice within Inland Revenue be provided at the earliest practical time.” 2.3 In response, a pre-assessment phase was introduced, comprising a set of prescribed steps to facilitate the “all cards on the table” approach to tax dispute resolution. 2.4 This chapter describes in detail the legislative steps that make up the disputes resolution process. How does a dispute arise? 2.5 A dispute may arise when a taxpayer and Inland Revenue have not reached agreement on a tax position taken in a taxpayer’s self-assessment, and often follows an audit of the taxpayer. If no agreement has been reached on some or all of the issues identified, Inland Revenue will begin the disputes process by issuing a notice of proposed adjustment. 4 Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department, Report to the Minister of Revenue (and on tax policy, also to the Minister of Finance) from the Organisational Review Committee, April 1994. 5 Ibid p 67. “ 7 2.6 Alternatively, a taxpayer may dispute his or her own assessment or disputable decision made by the Commissioner by issuing a notice of proposed adjustment. The time bar 2.7 The Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) imposes time limits for increasing assessments. If a taxpayer has furnished a return and made an assessment, the Commissioner may not amend the assessment to increase the amount assessed if four years have passed from the end of the income year in which the taxpayer provided the return. 6 The Commissioner is prevented from refunding amounts of overpaid income tax after eight years from the end of the year in which the original assessment was made. 7 The Commissioner cannot refund amounts of overpaid GST after eight years from the end of the taxable period in which tax was assessed. 8 2.8 The time bar does not apply if the Commissioner is of the opinion that a return is fraudulent, wilfully misleading or does not mention gross income which is of a particular nature or was derived from a particular source. 9 The disputes process 2.9 Once a dispute has begun, the issuing of a correct assessment should proceed through a series of steps prescribed in Part IVA of the TAA. 2.10 Once an assessment is issued the challenge process, involving litigation in the courts, as set out in the TAA begins. 2.11 The main legislative elements of the pre-assessment phase of the disputes resolution process are: • Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA); • Notice of Response (NOR); and • Disclosure Notice and Statement of Position (SOP). 2.12 There are also two important administrative phases in the process – the conference and adjudication phases. 2.13 The current application of all these elements is explained in more detail below. 6 See section 108 and for GST assessments, section 108A TAA. 7 See section MD 1(1), Income Tax Act 1994. 8 See section 45, GST Act 1985. 9 See section 108(2) TAA. 8 The Notice of Proposed Adjustment 2.14 The NOPA is the first formal step in the disputes process. 2.15 The content of a NOPA is prescribed in the TAA and must contain sufficient detail to reasonably inform the recipient of: 10 • the items in a disputable decision or a tax return that the issuer of the notice proposes should be adjusted; • the tax laws on which the adjustments are based; • an outline of the facts giving rise to the adjustments; • the legal issues arising in respect of the adjustments; • the propositions of law relied on or distinguished in respect of the adjustments. 2.16 The purpose of the NOPA is to ensure that the party receiving the notice is aware of the arguments on which the other party is relying. Reducing these points to writing emphasises the need to review the positions of Inland Revenue or the taxpayer and is intended to foster open and frank discussion early in the resolution process in terms of the “all cards on the table” objective. Providing adequate information also ensures that the NOPA can be responded to fully. 2.17 The taxpayer may dispute his or her own assessment by issuing a NOPA within two months after the date of the notice of assessment. Acceptance of Notice of Proposed Adjustment 2.18 If the adjustment is accepted in writing, or the adjustment is deemed to have been accepted, because either Inland Revenue or the taxpayer has not responded in time, the disputes process ends and an amended assessment is issued or the assessment stands. 11 No further challenge may be made to that adjustment. 12 2.19 A late response by a taxpayer is deemed to have been received within the response period if exceptional circumstances apply. Exceptional circumstances are circumstances that: 13 • are beyond the taxpayer’s control; and • provide reasonable justification for a late response. 10 See section 89F TAA. 11 See sections 89H and also 89J TAA. 12 See section 89I TAA. 13 See sections 89K and for the Commissioner 89L TAA. 9 The Notice of Response 2.20 If the taxpayer or Inland Revenue disagrees with one or more of the proposed adjustments in a NOPA, the taxpayer must notify the other party by issuing a NOR within two months 14 of the date of issue of the NOPA. The NOR is the vehicle used by the recipient of the NOPA to formally reply to the proposed adjustment. 2.21 The content of the NOR is prescribed in the TAA and must: 15 • specify the items in the NOPA that the recipient considers to be in error; • specify the tax laws that are relied on; • outline the facts contained in the NOPA that the recipient considers to be in error; • outline any further facts on which the recipient relies; • outline any additional legal issues that the recipient considers arise in respect of the NOPA; and • state the propositions of law relied upon in respect of the response notice. 2.22 A failure to comply with the content requirements of a NOR may result in deemed acceptance. For example, the NOPA will be deemed to have been accepted if the NOR merely states that the proposed adjustment is not accepted. Small claims election 2.23 A taxpayer may indicate in his or her NOPA or NOR (in a dispute initiated by the Commissioner) that he or she wishes to be heard before the small claims jurisdiction of the Taxation Review Authority (TRA). 16 The TRA’s jurisdiction includes the determination of small claims where the facts are clear and not in dispute, the tax to pay or tax effect is below $15,000 and no significant legal issues of precedent are involved. The taxpayer is bound by the decision of the TRA. 2.24 There is also a standard practice statement which outlines Inland Revenue’s criteria for settling small, simple disputes and the administrative procedures within Inland Revenue to fast-track them to resolution. 17 14 The legislation defines “response period”. This is two months from the date of issue of the originating document. 15 See section 89G(2) TAA. 16 See section 89E TAA. 17 Standard practice statement INV-140. 10 Disclosure notice 2.25 If the dispute is not resolved because the NOR is not accepted, the Commissioner may issue a disclosure notice. A disclosure notice requires both Inland Revenue and the taxpayer to detail in writing their respective Statements of Position. The disclosure notice is an important document because it triggers the application of the evidence exclusion rule. The evidence exclusion rule limits any challenge by the taxpayer and Inland Revenue to the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law disclosed in their respective SOPs. 2.26 The evidence exclusion rule is subject to a judicial discretion to admit previously undisclosed matters. 18 The applicant must show that he or she could not, with due diligence, have found or discovered this material at the time of delivery of the SOP, and allowing the material is necessary to avoid “manifest injustice.” The Statement of Position 2.27 Each party’s SOP must: 19 • give an outline of the facts on which the party intends to rely; • give an outline of the evidence on which the party intends to rely; • give an outline of the issues that the party considers will arise; and • specify the propositions of law on which the party intends to rely. Statement of Position in Commissioner-initiated disputes 2.28 If the Commissioner initiates the dispute, then the Commissioner must issue a SOP at the same time that a disclosure notice is issued. 20 The taxpayer must file his or her own SOP within two months of the disclosure notice. 21 The taxpayer may apply to the High Court for further time to issue the SOP provided that the taxpayer applies within the same two months and it is unreasonable to reply within that time because the issues in dispute had not previously been discussed. 22 2.29 If the taxpayer fails to respond to the Commissioner’s SOP and the taxpayer has not applied to the High Court for more time in which to reply, the taxpayer will be deemed to have accepted the proposed adjustment as detailed in the Commissioner’s SOP or NOPA. 23 18 See section 138G. 19 See sections 89M(4) and 89M(6) TAA. 20 See section 89M(3) TAA. 21 See section 89M(5) TAA. 22 See section 89M(11) TAA. 23 See section 89M(7) TAA. 11 2.30 The Commissioner has a right of reply to the taxpayer’s SOP 24 but must exercise this right within two months of the date of issue of the taxpayer’s SOP. Any additional information in the reply then becomes part of the Commissioner’s SOP. 25 Statement of Position when the taxpayer initiates the dispute 2.31 If the taxpayer has initiated the dispute, the taxpayer may issue a statement of position within two months of the date that the Commissioner issues a disclosure notice. 26 The Commissioner then has two months to prepare a SOP in reply to the taxpayer’s SOP. 27 2.32 The Commissioner may apply to the High Court for an extension of time to reply to the taxpayer’s SOP. The extension may be granted if the Commissioner applies before the expiry of the two-month period in which to respond to the taxpayer’s SOP and it is unreasonable to reply within the period owing to the number, complexity or novelty of the matters raised in the taxpayer’s SOP. 28 2.33 The need to apply to the High Court may arise when the taxpayer’s SOP refers to facts, issues, evidence or propositions of law that have not previously been disclosed and it is necessary for the Commissioner to obtain and consider these matters. 2.34 The taxpayer does not have a right to reply to the Commissioner’s SOP. However, the Commissioner and the taxpayer may agree to additional information being added, at any time, to their SOPs. 29 Conference 2.35 Conferences between the Commissioner and the taxpayer were administratively prescribed following a recommendation by the Richardson Review. 2.36 The purpose of the conference, of which there may be more than one, is to facilitate the resolution of any disputed facts and issues that have been raised in the NOPA. 2.37 An administrative rather than a legislative process is appropriate because, while the conference phase should be used and encouraged, in limited cases it may not be regarded by the parties as useful and should not, therefore, be mandatory. 24 See section 89M(8) TAA. 25 See section 89M(9) TAA. 26 See section 89M(5) TAA. 27 See section 89M(10) TAA. 28 Ibid. 29 See sections 89M(13) and 89M(14) TAA. 12 Adjudication 2.38 A dispute that is not resolved by the end of the SOP phase is generally referred to the Inland Revenue’s Adjudication unit. The function of this unit is to consider the dispute impartially and independently of the audit function. 2.39 As the Adjudication unit is a delegated function of the Commissioner, it is not appropriate that it be legislatively prescribed. Assessment 2.40 An assessment as amended by the Commissioner is issued after completion of the disputes process, or the original assessment stands. Post - assessment challenge 2.41 A taxpayer is entitled to challenge an assessment by beginning proceedings in a court within the response period. 30 30 See section 138B(1) TAA. 13 Figure 2: Process for a dispute initiated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue Taxpayer who is required to file return must make an assessment CIR issues NOPA? s 89B(1) May elect small claims jurisdiction of TRA Taxpayer issues NOR rejecting NOPA s 89G(1)?

These proposals will provide greater certainty for taxpayers that they will be given time within the statute bar period to respond to Inland Revenue on the issue in dispute. Current limitations of the time bar waiver procedure will also be removed. 3.1 The most important objectives of the disputes process are to ensure that a dispute is resolved as promptly as possible and that an assessment is correct when it is issued. The various steps in the process are designed to facilitate these objectives. For the majority of disputes, these objectives are being met. In some cases, however, the full disputes process has not been completed as the legislation intended. This may result in the issue of an assessment and ensuing litigation before an attempt has been made to resolve the dispute. Objectives of the process 3.2 A balance between equity and efficiency requires legislative time limits and other constraints in order to achieve finality in respect of a person’s tax position. In other words, correctly quantifying a tax liability is not an absolute value because it must be balanced against finality and certainty. 3.3 The “all cards on the table” objective brings with it an expectation that the statutory processes will be followed by Inland Revenue. However, each step in the process is quite detailed and resource-intensive, especially if issues are identified late in the process. Although the possible imposition of penalties and, more generally, self-assessment underline the importance of the 31 This proposal does not affect the Commissioner’s ability to issue an amended assessment without first issuing a NOPA, as prescribed in section 89C TAA. 16 taxpayer “getting it right first time”, there will invariably be instances where errors are not discovered until some time after a return is filed. 3.4 Ensuring that the process is followed without undermining the equity and efficiency objective is paramount for an effective disputes resolution process. The proposals in this chapter are aimed at further ensuring that this objective is met. The relationship between the disputes and assessment processes 3.5 Recent judicial comment clarified that the statutory power to amend assessments at any time, (now section 113 of the Tax Administration Act) is discretionary in nature and its exercise is, therefore, not mandatory. 32 However, the circumstances in which the power to amend assessments should be used are still unclear. 3.6 A lack of certainty in the relationship between the Commissioner’s power to amend an assessment at any time, subject to the time bar, and the formal disputes process may reinforce this problem. However, the policy intent is that, other than in the case of an agreed adjustment, the formal process must be followed. 3.7 Inland Revenue has issued a Standard Practice Statement (INV-510) “Requests to Amend Assessments”, which states that it is not appropriate for the Commissioner to exercise the discretion to amend an assessment under section 113 if the issue is the subject of a current dispute. An assessment may be amended following the completion of the disputes process, to reflect an agreed adjustment, or other situation in which a NOPA is not required. 3.8 Standard Practice Statement INV-510 sets out when Inland Revenue will consider an issue that is likely to be an agreed adjustment. It sets out the types of errors that will be considered and what the taxpayer needs to provide to Inland Revenue for an adjustment to be considered. 3.9 The Commissioner’s general power under section 113 to amend assessments could, however, be amended so that its role is made more explicit. 3.10 An issue that needs to be addressed is that Inland Revenue is not currently required by the legislation to complete all the steps in the formal disputes process. This is a result of the uncertain relationship between section 113 and the rest of the disputes process. 32 Ronald George Lawton v CIR (2002) 20 NZTC 17,531. 17 Inland Revenue’s ability to shorten the process 3.11 The case of PLM Software Limited v CIR 33 confirmed that failure by the Commissioner to comply with the statutory disputes resolution process does not invalidate an assessment made by the Commissioner. The minimum that is necessary under the legislation is to issue a NOPA. In this case the Commissioner issued a NOPA and shortly afterwards issued an assessment as the time bar was imminent. However, the courts have stated that the legislated disputes process “should be given effect wherever possible”. 34 3.12 The curtailment of the process might occur for the following reasons: • Inland Revenue runs out of time to complete the process because the investigation was begun late in the process. • There have been delays by the taxpayer in providing information leading to a reluctance by Inland Revenue to undertake the next step in the process. • The taxpayer requests that the investigator not issue a NOPA until certain issues have been resolved. (Although this may be worthwhile, it may also delay the remaining steps in the process.). • The taxpayer is reluctant to grant a time bar waiver. This may be because of the risk that Inland Revenue may find more issues in the extended period relating to the return under review. 3.13 In any of these circumstances the Commissioner may decide to issue an amended assessment, but the ability of both sides to resolve the issues before the case goes to Court is reduced. 3.14 It is important that the steps in the process are followed wherever practical and that the taxpayer have certainty as to the process. At the same time, however, some of the impediments to achieving this need to be addressed by reviewing the current time bar waiver provision. Proposed treatment 3.15 It is proposed that the Commissioner’s power to amend assessments under section 113 of the TAA will, other than in legislatively prescribed circumstances, be restricted to cases where the full disputes process has been followed by Inland Revenue, upon Inland Revenue having made an agreed adjustment or in circumstances where a NOPA is not required. 35 33 (2001) 20 NZTC 17,336. 34 Alpe v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,372. 35 See section 89C TAA. 18 3.16 In this context, what is meant by “following the full process” is that, generally, the Commissioner will not be able to simply issue an amended assessment after the issue of a NOPA. Instead, the Commissioner must, after issuing a NOPA, give the taxpayer two months to issue a NOR and two months to issue a SOP (after the Commissioner’s SOP has been issued). 3.17 Although reference to adjudication will continue, it will not be legislatively prescribed as it was intended to be an administrative process. This was because it was envisaged that the adjudication function would be set up within Inland Revenue. This function would be separate from the audit function and would have as its purpose “...the provision of an impartial application of tax law and a greater application of technical expertise to the affairs of taxpayers prior to the issue of an assessment.” 36 3.18 Inland Revenue will not be required to complete the full process in certain exceptional circumstances. These circumstances will be provided for in the legislation and will include: • disputes involving criminal activity; • disputes where the taxpayer and/or person associated with the taxpayer (who is involved in a similar issue to that under dispute with the taxpayer) has begun judicial review proceedings; • disputes where the taxpayer has intentionally not complied with information requests made earlier in the process or with statutory obligations required in the revenue acts; and • the Commissioner obtaining an order from the High Court providing for more time to complete the process or that the full process need not be followed. 3.19 This proposal will not prejudice a taxpayer’s ability to challenge the decision to issue an assessment for any of the reasons described above in the normal manner. 3.20 The exception to the process for judicial review proceedings is needed for when the parties’ resources are directed away from progressing the dispute through the process towards addressing the facts and issues in the judicial review application. This exception will not apply to judicial review proceedings that are about the application of the time bar. 3.21 An order from the High Court may be sought if the Commissioner considers that there are reasonable grounds, other than those specifically prescribed in the legislation, for not following the full statutory process. The court order would either provide for more time to complete the process or, in exceptional cases, that the full process need not be followed. 36 Resolving tax disputes: proposed procedures – a Government consultative document, December 1994, p 19. 19 3.22 The proposals will not alter the current override to the statute bar in cases of evasion and omission of a source of income, although the latter override does need to be reviewed, as discussed at the end of this chapter. 3.23 The proposed change will include transitional measures to ensure that audits and disputes that have begun at the time of introduction are not affected by the proposal. 3.24 Introducing legislation as a way of further distinguishing agreed adjustments and disputes that require a NOPA to be issued has been considered. However, further legislating for such a boundary would require the introduction of more detailed rules and create levels of complexity that legislation is meant to minimise. The time bar waiver 3.25 A taxpayer may agree to extend the four-year time bar by up to six months if more time is required to complete the process. 37 The extension takes the form of a waiver, which must be in the prescribed form and signed and delivered to the Commissioner by the taxpayer before the expiry of the relevant four-year period. 3.26 The existing time bar waiver period of six months is problematic because: • in cases where the lack of time arises owing to the non-compliance for whatever reason by the taxpayer with a request for information, six months is likely to be insufficient to complete a process that is not already substantially under way; and • taxpayers are reluctant to grant the waiver because of the risk that Inland Revenue may identify new issues in the waiver period in relation to the assessment in dispute. 3.27 Any extension to the four-year time bar would be inconsistent with the objective of early resolution in respect of a taxpayer’s tax liability. If the need for a waiver has arisen because the taxpayer has not for any reason complied with an information request by Inland Revenue, it could be argued that an assessment should be issued based on the information available within the statute barred period or the waiver period (if applicable), without further attempts to resolve the issue. This would be unsatisfactory, however, because the Commissioner may not have had the vital information needed to issue a correct assessment. The approach would also be inconsistent with the objective of resolving disputes to avoid litigation. 37 See section 108B TAA. 20 3.28 Non-compliance with a request for information may arise because the information is being sought offshore and is difficult to obtain or the taxpayer is otherwise having difficulties providing the information. In such a case, even assuming that the request for information has been made in the early stages of the dispute, the taxpayer’s inability to comply with the request will delay the remaining steps in the process. Proposed treatment 3.29 It is proposed that in this situation the Commissioner will suspend the time bar until the information is provided. However, the total length of time for which the time bar is suspended must not exceed one year. 3.30 This provides an additional six-month period to the current six-month period to complete the process, a limited extension that takes into account the fact that the information may never be obtained. 3.31 Requests for information made under section 17 of the TAA require a person to provide the information set out in a notice by the Commissioner. The appropriate use of section 17 notices by Inland Revenue should ensure that the extended period is used relatively infrequently. 3.32 As with the existing waiver period, the one-year period will be available only with the agreement of the taxpayer, although, as proposed earlier, Inland Revenue may decline to follow the full statutory process if a taxpayer has failed to comply with an information request for reasons other than the inability to do so. At the end of the one-year period, Inland Revenue will be required either to issue the assessment or concede the case. 3.33 It is proposed that taxpayers’ concerns in relation to the granting of waivers be addressed by limiting the extension to further investigation by Inland Revenue only of issues that had been identified by either party and made known to the other before the waiver was granted. The proposal will also clarify that once a time bar waiver has been granted, it cannot be withdrawn. Exceptions to the time bar 3.34 In terms of section 108(2) of the TAA, an assessment can be amended at any time if the return provided by the taxpayer is: • fraudulent or wilfully misleading; or • does not mention gross income which is of a particular nature or was derived from a particular source. 21 3.35 On a literal interpretation, the second limb to this section would apply regardless of whether or not it was the taxpayer’s intention to omit gross income. On the other hand, the section will operate effectively only if Inland Revenue uses the discretion while having regard to the behaviour of the taxpayer and the amount of tax at stake, as was suggested in the case of Babington v CIR. 38 The application of the provision should, therefore, be clarified. 3.36 Another concern with the second limb is that while it refers to omission of income, it does not address a range of other aspects inherent in the calculation of a taxpayer’s tax liability, such as the overstatement of deductions. 3.37 When section 108(2) was introduced it was based on the taxpayer providing the return and the Commissioner making the assessment. With the introduction of self-assessment, taxpayers must assess their own income tax liability. This leaves taxpayers with the responsibility to ensure their assessment is correct and that they have complied with all obligations imposed on them by the tax laws. The section needs to better recognise the shift to self-assessment. Proposed treatment 3.38 It is proposed that the provision relating to the omission of gross income be removed and replaced with a provision which has regard to the conduct of the taxpayer. This is consistent with other parts of the TAA; for example, in the penalties legislation, the taking of an abusive tax position determines the liability to shortfall penalties. 3.39 If the abusive tax position in question resulted from the overstatement of deductions by the taxpayer, it is possible that neither limb of section 108(2) would apply. If it is determined that a taxpayer has taken an abusive tax position it would be appropriate, and more consistent with the general scheme of the legislation, to allow the Commissioner the discretion to extend the time bar. This could be achieved, for example, by amending the second limb to refer to negligence and/or material non-disclosure by a taxpayer, as opposed to fraud as provided for in the first limb. 3.40 A provision of this nature would give the greater certainty needed as well as better reflecting taxpayers’ obligations under self-assessment. 3.41 The government recognises that this objective could be achieved in a number of ways and therefore seeks submissions on how best to give section 108(2) a more coherent focus that is consistent with the Act and taxpayers’ obligations under it. 38 \[1957\] NZLR 861 (CA). 22 Chapter 4 THE STEPS IN THE PROCESS – NOPAS, NORS AND SOPS Key proposals are to: • clarify that the NOPA and NOR may be brief documents and require the arguments in those documents to be relevant to the facts; • clarify that if a dispute reaches the disclosure notice phase, a disclosure notice is to be issued in every case, other than in exceptional circumstances, regardless of whether the Commissioner or taxpayer initiated the dispute; and • clarify that the SOP contain a list of potential witnesses and a brief description of the witness evidence. These proposals are intended to ensure that the costs incurred in preparing the various documents are no greater than is necessary for the particular case. 4.1 The disputes process is designed to achieve a high level of disclosure of relevant information and discussion between the Commissioner and taxpayers. Although the process generally achieves this objective, the documentation required at the various stages could be improved in a number of respects. This chapter examines the steps in the process and contains proposals that further ensure that the process is efficient and cost-effective. Content of NOPAs and NORs 4.2 The current effect of the NOPA and NOR documents is that costs are incurred early in the process because relatively detailed information is required at these stages. The costs are a natural consequence of the time and effort it takes both Inland Revenue and the taxpayer to produce the documents to the standard stipulated in the legislation. 4.3 A certain amount of criticism has been directed at the extent of these costs along the following lines: 39 • The process, involving the issue of a NOPA, NOR, conference phase, disclosure notice, statement of position and reference to Adjudication is extremely cumbersome and costly. 39 Protecting the integrity of the Tax Act: the practitioner’s perspective, 2002 ICANZ Tax Conference, 11 & 12 October 2002, John Shewan; PriceWaterhouseCoopers. “ 23 • For most taxpayers, unless the numbers involved are significant, the burden and resulting cost of participating in the dispute resolution process is sufficient to dissuade them from proceeding. • The time required to move through the dispute resolution process, particularly the delay between the issue by the taxpayer of a response notice and the issue by the Commissioner of a disclosure notice and statement of position, is such that Inland Revenue is forced to issue an assessment to avoid the period becoming statute-barred.” 4.4 Some observations that can be made on these comments in light of the objectives of the disputes process are: • For either party, the expense and time in preparing the documents should be relative to the amount of tax in dispute. • Neither party should be placed in the position of having to prepare documents that are more detailed than necessary when the facts and legal arguments in support of their position are relatively persuasive. • On the other hand, the objective of the disputes process is to identify and/or resolve the dispute early, which necessitates the provision of a certain level of detail. • In addition, a certain level of disclosure assists in ensuring that both parties adopt a level of caution before advancing to the disputes stage, so that only genuinely arguable cases are taken. • The small claims process (discussed in chapter 8) is available to reduce the costs in relation to cases that do not warrant the full process. 4.5 Thus, while a certain level of detail will always be needed in NOPAs and NORs in order to achieve the early resolution of disputes, this detail should be no greater than is necessary in each given case. 4.6 This should, to a large extent, be dealt with administratively by ensuring that the level of detail is appropriate to the case at hand and providing a summary of facts and legal arguments. To complement this, this chapter proposes changes to the legislation to better reflect what is intended to be achieved with NOPAs and NORs. Proposed treatment 4.7 It is proposed that the content of a NOPA contained in the current legislation be prescribed in the following terms: • the proposed adjustments to be made to the assessment; • an outline or brief statement of the facts and legal arguments which give rise to the need for adjustment; 24 • the tax law relied on; and • an outline or brief statement as to how the legal arguments apply to the facts. 4.8 Although this prescription retains the substance of the existing requirements, it clarifies that the NOPA may be a brief document. It also removes language such as “propositions of law relied on or distinguished” which overly formalises the required content of the NOPA and therefore reduces the flexibility to adapt the style of the document to the particular circumstances of each case. 4.9 The proposed requirement that the legal arguments are applied to the facts will ensure that the proposed adjustment is not a statement which appears out of context in relation to the rest of the document but is, rather, a logical conclusion. 4.10 It is proposed that the content of a NOR be similarly prescribed in the following terms: • an outline or brief statement of the facts and legal arguments in the NOPA that are in error; • any alternative facts or legal arguments to be considered; • an outline or brief statement as to how those facts apply to the arguments; and • reasons for rejection of the NOPA. 4.11 This would, again, reduce the formality of the existing language as it appears in the legislation and both allow some flexibility in the precise style of document used and keep the statement of facts in context. It would also clarify that the NOR is confined to the adjustments proposed in the NOPA. 4.12 These changes recognise that, where possible, a dispute should be resolved at an early stage, without unnecessary cost and resource expended. They also recognise that not all disputes can be resolved at an early stage, and more cost and resource will be involved to progress the dispute to the more detailed statement of position phase. If this is the case, regular communication with the taxpayer is recommended as noted in the government’s most recent discussion document on the compliance and penalties legislation. 40 The intended effect of this communication is to assure the taxpayer that Inland Revenue is still trying to resolve the issue, and the matter is progressing. 40 Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review – a Government discussion document, August 2001, p 46. 25 Content of the SOP 4.13 If a dispute has not been resolved at the NOPA and NOR stage it will progress to the SOP stage. The SOP forms the basis for a challenge so it is an important document containing much of the detail of the dispute, and a corresponding amount of time must be put into ensuring that the document is as complete and thorough as possible. 4.14 The relative importance and the purpose of the SOP, as compared with those of the NOPA and NOR, is not clearly provided for in the legislation as the language is very similar to that provided for in the NOPA. 4.15 The SOP should be the document that reflects a detailed analysis of the dispute. It is appropriate that the SOP should be a more considered document than the NOPA and NOR because: • at that point there is a significantly greater likelihood that the dispute will proceed to litigation; and • as the dispute progresses so will the disclosure of information and argument as their relevance becomes more apparent. 4.16 It is at the SOP stage of the process where the disclosure notice triggers the evidence exclusion rule. If a disclosure notice is not issued the evidence exclusion rule cannot be relied on. Proposed treatment 4.17 The intended importance of the SOP is already signalled in the existing legislative requirements. However, the current requirements could be improved by: • clarifying what must be disclosed by way of evidence to be relied on at the hearing, including the extent to which witnesses must be identified; and • clarifying that a disclosure notice must be issued in every dispute except in the limited circumstances where the full process is not required to be completed, as discussed in chapter 3. The evidence required in the SOP 4.18 The 1994 government consultative document on proposed procedures for resolving tax disputes stated that “the reference to ‘evidence’ in the SOP context is not intended to require the exchange of full briefs of evidence or exhaustive lists of documents. Rather, it is intended to ensure that both 26 parties have an appreciation of the availability of evidence on the factual issues in dispute.” 41 4.19 This objective remains valid. The evidence exclusion rule is generally perceived as working effectively for both parties. The policy intent of “fairly informing the other party of the issues, facts, evidence and law” is generally well reflected in the legislation and in practice. 4.20 A practical issue, however, is the extent to which the legislation requires each party to provide as part of the SOP, and hence be effectively bound by, a list of witnesses. In this respect it is important to recognise the role of the pre-trial stage where strategies will be developed by either party in relation to the presentation of the case. Given the role of the pre-trial stage, it is practical only to require that parties provide in the SOP a list of potential witnesses or types of witness, without necessarily naming the witnesses, and a brief description of the intended nature of their oral evidence. 4.21 This would involve a minor legislative clarification only and would not detract from the purpose of the evidence exclusion rule, which is about the nature of the evidence to be given rather than on how that evidence is to be presented. 4.22 The main circumstance in which it may not be appropriate to issue a disclosure notice is when a witness needs to be protected, or the name of a person who will give expert evidence is not known at the time. Providing for information in relation to witnesses in more general terms should overcome this problem without detracting from the purpose of the evidence exclusion rule. The legislation can, therefore, be clarified to make the issue of a disclosure notice mandatory, except in disputes where the Commissioner is not required to complete the process, as discussed in chapter 3. Introducing a time frame for the Commissioner to issue a SOP 4.23 Some commentators have suggested that the Commissioner should be required to issue a SOP within a legislated time frame. 42 One reason given for this is that the taxpayer is limited to two months to prepare a SOP. However, there is provision in the legislation for a time extension to the two- month period at the SOP stage for the taxpayer if the issues in dispute had not previously been discussed between the Commissioner and the taxpayer. The Commissioner may also correspondingly apply for a time extension if it is unreasonable to reply within the response period because of the complexity of issues raised in the taxpayer’s SOP. 43 41 Resolving tax disputes: proposed procedures – a Government consultative document, December 1994, p 23. 42 Above n 39. 43 See sections 89M(10) and 89M(11), Tax Administration Act 1994. 27 4.24 The main reason that the legislation does not prescribe a time frame for SOPs initiated by the Commissioner is that there needs to be adequate time allowed to determine whether the issue is able to be resolved before litigation. This includes allowing sufficient time for the conference phase, which is an important administrative part of the disputes process. 4.25 In an efficiently managed case, excessively rigid time frames may, in fact, signal to the taxpayer that Inland Revenue is focused on meeting the statutory phases of the dispute rather than on taking the time to resolve it. 4.26 Although introducing more time limits at the SOP stage would provide taxpayers with more assurance as to how their dispute is progressing, this can also be achieved administratively through greater contact with the taxpayer and the provision of guidelines as to likely time frames. This is consistent with the government’s recommendations in the most recent discussion document on the compliance and penalties legislation, 44 and Inland Revenue’s recent standard practice statement (INV-170). 44 Above n 40, p 46. 28 Chapter 5 DISPUTES INITIATED BY THE TAXPAYER Key proposals are to require taxpayers to: • supply to the Commissioner detailed information to support a proposed adjustment under a taxpayer NOPA; and • signal in their return whether they intend to issue a NOPA to their self- assessment when they are aware that they are likely to be doing so. These proposals ensure that taxpayers will be able to continue to issue a NOPA to their self-assessment but that, in turn, administrative costs for Inland Revenue will be lowered as the detail of the issue is identified, and notice given of the NOPA in relevant cases, at an earlier stage. 5.1 When the disputes rules were being developed, the government of the day considered that taxpayers should be able to issue a NOPA to an assessment, in circumstances such as where Inland Revenue had issued an assessment without first issuing a NOPA. For example, Inland Revenue might issue an assessment if it was considered that the return contained a simple mistake. The mistake would be corrected and an assessment issued. The taxpayer might, however, be dissatisfied with the outcome. It was considered that the taxpayer should have access to the disputes procedure, rather than pursue the issue through the court system, which is costly and time-consuming. 5.2 A taxpayer has a statutory obligation to correctly determine the amount of tax payable if a self-assessment is required. 45 Therefore taxpayers’ ability to amend their own assessments might be seen as inconsistent with the necessary element of finality that characterises an assessment. 5.3 The original objective of allowing taxpayer-initiated NOPAs could, therefore, be regarded as limited to the exceptional circumstances of: • the taxpayer disagreeing with a matter that the Commissioner has regarded as straightforward; or • the taxpayer having genuinely, despite his or her best attempts to correctly determine the tax liability, made an error in the return. 45 See Legislating for self-assessment of tax liability: a Government discussion document, August 1998, and reflected in sections 15B (aa) and 92 TAA 1994 with application to the 2002-03 and subsequent income years. 29 5.4 This is not the way that the taxpayer-initiated NOPA process is necessarily being applied by taxpayers. Instead, it is often being seen as a way of raising a new issue with Inland Revenue in a manner that will ensure that penalties are not imposed. 5.5 The wider use of taxpayer-initiated NOPAs has both advantages and disadvantages which need to be further considered. The advantages of taxpayer-initiated NOPAs 5.6 An advantage for taxpayers in being able to dispute their assessment is to eliminate their exposure to shortfall penalties. At present, a taxpayer can file a return on a conservative basis and then file a NOPA on a less conservative basis. As penalties are calculated by reference to the tax position taken in a self-assessment, rather than in a NOPA, the risk of shortfall penalties applying is reduced. For Inland Revenue, the fact that taxpayers can issue a NOPA to their own assessment may mean that issues are identified without the need for investigation and Inland Revenue has the necessary information to resolve them. 5.7 Therefore, an advantage of the taxpayer-initiated NOPA is that it provides an opportunity to address an issue before an investigation, which is consistent with the objective of the early resolution of disputes. Disadvantages of taxpayer-initiated NOPAs 5.8 On the other hand, the disadvantages of taxpayer-initiated NOPAs are: • their potential inconsistency with the objective of self-assessment, which is to correctly determine the amount of tax payable in an assessment; and • as a related issue, Inland Revenue’s inability to be aware of the extent to which taxpayer-initiated NOPAs are likely to be issued and hence the extent to which it can determine in advance the resources that will be required to respond to them. Proposed treatment 5.9 If the wider use of the taxpayer-initiated NOPA is to continue, the benefits of this wider use will need to be more certain in practice. Although the theoretical advantage of the taxpayer-initiated NOPA is that Inland Revenue obtains the necessary information that may be pertinent to an assessment, it would seem that the extent of the information that is currently provided in these circumstances varies significantly. 30 5.10 It is therefore proposed that the wider use of the taxpayer-initiated NOPA continue but, in addition to the information that will be required in the NOPA, as proposed in chapter 4, the legislation will be amended to require the taxpayer to supply to the Commissioner detailed information to support the NOPA, such as: • detailed and clear statements as to the facts and legal arguments that give rise to the proposed adjustment; and • all material documentary evidence to support the adjustment. 5.11 The main advantage of this proposal is that, because of the greater level of detail that will be required, potential disputes may be resolved at an earlier stage (ideally without the need for further investigation). 5.12 From Inland Revenue’s perspective, the taxpayer’s NOPA will usually be the first time it becomes aware of the issue in question. As noted earlier, the unrestricted use of the taxpayer-initiated NOPA may make the disputes process difficult for Inland Revenue to manage, particularly given the constraints of the two-month period to issue a notice of response. 5.13 This problem will be alleviated by Inland Revenue’s ability to issue briefer notices of response, as outlined in chapter 4, and by the greater level of detail proposed for a taxpayer NOPA, which will better ensure that taxpayers advance only genuinely arguable cases. 5.14 It is also proposed that taxpayers who are aware at the time they file their return that they will be issuing a NOPA in relation to that return, be required to signal that intention in the return. This proposal will give Inland Revenue advance notice that there is an issue and will therefore assist in the management of resources. The proposal will not prejudice taxpayers’ ability to NOPA their self-assessment within two months if they have not signalled in their return their intention to issue a NOPA. 5.15 As indicated in the government’s discussion document Legislating for self- assessment of tax liability, taxpayers will continue to be limited to a two- month period to issue a NOPA to their self-assessment. Extending the period would be inconsistent with the objective of self-assessment. 31 Chapter 6 TIME FRAMES The key proposal is to limit the eight-year refund period to the statute bar period of four years. This proposal creates greater consistency with time frames for amendment and, more generally, with the objective of earlier certainty. Four-year time bar 6.1 If a taxpayer furnishes an income tax return and an assessment has been made and four years have passed from the end of the income year in which the taxpayer provided the return, the Commissioner may not amend the assessment to increase the amount assessed. 46 This four-year time bar does not apply in cases where the Commissioner is of the opinion that a return provided by a taxpayer is fraudulent or wilfully misleading or does not mention gross income of a particular nature or source. GST has a similar time bar. The time bar may also be waived by the taxpayer for up to six months in order to resolve a dispute. 6.2 Time frames provide certainty and finality in respect of a person’s tax position. The finality provided by the four-year statutory time bar is emphasised by the courts as central to tax administration so that after the stipulated period of time taxpayers and Inland Revenue may close their books and dispose of their papers. 47 Eight-year refund period 6.3 If tax has been paid in excess, the excess amount is refunded to the taxpayer. The refund cannot be made after eight years from the year in which the original assessment was made. 6.4 The refund period was aligned with the time bar (four years) in 1944. At the time it was considered that there was no reason why the time within which a taxpayer has a right to claim a refund should not be the same as the time within which an assessment could be amended. The refund period was increased to six years in 1957, with the introduction of PAYE, in recognition of the possibility that employers could make mistakes in their calculations. It was increased to eight years in 1968, where it remains today. 46 See section 108 TAA 1994. 47 Lloyds Bank Export Finance v CIR \[1992\] 2 NZLR 1,6 (PC). 32 6.5 These long periods for refunds were established in an era when the administrative environment was based on assessments carried out by the Commissioner. Departing from four years for a refund was aimed at ensuring taxpayers were not unduly prejudiced by any errors made by employers or the Commissioner when the PAYE scheme was introduced, as systems were not computerized. 6.6 In today’s commercial environment an eight-year period is inconsistent with the aim of both the disputes resolution process and self-assessment: ensuring that finality in, balanced with a full consideration of, a taxpayer’s tax position is reached at the earliest practicable stage. Proposed treatment 6.7 It is proposed that the refund period for income tax and GST be subject to the four-year statute bar for amending assessments. The proposal will remove any doubt about time frames as, currently, the refund period of eight years and the time bar of four years may conflict with each other and create uncertainty as to the finality of a taxpayer’s assessment. Rebates 6.8 Currently, taxpayers have eight years within which to claim a rebate. This was intended to align the rebate period with the current refund period. Given the proposal in this discussion document to match the refund period with the four-year time bar, it would be appropriate to similarly align the rebate period with the four-year time bar. Taxpayer’s obligations to keep records 6.9 The TAA requires that a business retain records in New Zealand for a period of at least seven years after the end of the income year to which those records relate. 48 Whether this seven-year period should remain will be considered separately once the outcome of this review is determined. 48 See Section 22 TAA. 33 Chapter 7 TIME FRAMES AND GST Key proposals are to: • limit to two years the period for which taxpayers are able to make late claims for input tax adjustments, other than where there is an agreed adjustment; and • legislate more explicitly that GST is a self-assessed tax. These proposals provide certainty for taxpayers when late claims for input tax credits are made and reduce the revenue risks of the current uncertain time frames. 7.1 Taxpayers assess their own GST liability and pay GST at the time a return is made. The Commissioner is required to make an assessment only if a taxpayer has failed to file a return, or if the Commissioner is dissatisfied with a taxpayer’s return, or if asked to do so by a taxpayer. The Commissioner cannot increase a tax assessment or make an assessment after four years from the end of the GST return period in respect of which the GST tax return was provided or assessment made. 49 7.2 Registered persons must calculate the tax payable by them under the GST Act. Output tax must be attributed to a taxable period and in calculating the amount of tax payable in each taxable period a registered person must deduct from the amount of output tax the amount of input tax credits allowed. The taxable period within which output tax and input tax is attributed is dependent on the accounting basis of the registered person. If a taxpayer uses the invoice or hybrid basis of accounting for GST, output tax is attributed to the period in which the supplies are made determined under the time of supply rules. If the payments basis is used, output tax is attributed to each period in which payment is received. Time frames for making and amending assessments 7.3 Currently, if a registered person has paid excess GST and an assessment has been made, the Commissioner may refund the tax, provided that eight years have not passed after the end of the taxable period in which the tax was assessed. 49 See section 108A TAA. 34 7.4 It is unclear, however, how the time bar provisions in the Tax Administration Act and the refund provisions in the GST Act apply to situations where: • a registered person is not satisfied with a return and requests the Commissioner to amend the return; and • no assessment has been made by the Commissioner. 7.5 It is clear that time limits for amending a GST liability apply when an assessment has been made by the Commissioner. Proposed treatment 7.6 It is proposed that the GST Act be amended to provide more expressly for GST self-assessment, in line with the legislation that has introduced self- assessment for income tax. 7.7 This will formalise the treatment of GST as being self-assessed. The Commissioner’s power to make initial assessments will be restricted to the making of a default assessment. The Commissioner will be able to amend assessments after taxpayers have made the initial assessment of their tax liability. 7.8 Initial and amending assessments will be restricted to the four-year statutory time bar period. 7.9 This proposal, combined with aligning the eight-year refund period with the four-year time bar, as discussed in chapter 6, will help to clarify the time frame issue when seeking a GST adjustment that is agreed between the taxpayer and the Commissioner. Adjustments for input tax 7.10 The Commissioner may not make or amend an assessment to increase a GST liability if four years have passed from the end of the return period in respect of which the taxpayer’s GST return was provided or assessment made. 50 On the other hand, under section 20(3) of the GST Act, taxpayers may have an unlimited time in which to claim input tax credits which have not been previously deducted. The adjustment may be made in current period returns. There is no clear differentiation for these adjustments between those that would be disputed by Inland Revenue and those that would be agreed adjustments. 50 See section 108A TAA. 35 Proposed treatment 7.11 In cases where the amendment sought by the taxpayer may give rise to a dispute, the general period for raising a NOPA is two months after the self- assessment. The government recognises that claiming GST input tax credits may depend on the taxpayer’s ability to obtain a tax invoice, so a longer period of two years would be more appropriate in these cases. A two-year period is also consistent with business practice, which often involves the annual reconciliation of GST against financial accounts. 7.12 Adjustments agreed between the Commissioner and the taxpayer, including those for simple or obvious mistakes and oversights, could, under the general time frame proposed for refunds, be made within four years of the return being furnished and assessment made. 36 Chapter 8 OTHER ISSUES Key proposals are to: • remove the term “disputable decision”, which now encompasses an “assessment” in recognition that, other than in specified circumstances, an assessment is the basis of a dispute; • extend the application of the test case procedures so they can be used earlier in the disputes process, rather than only in the context of challenging an assessment through court proceedings; and • ensure that the fast-tracking procedure to resolve small disputes is used in appropriate cases. Disputable decision 8.1 When the disputes legislation was being introduced the government of the day considered that some determinations made by the Commissioner were so closely associated with quantifying a person’s tax for a year that they required objection rights. These decisions were not necessarily represented in an “assessment” so were included in the disputes procedures by the use of the term “disputable decision”. 8.2 The term “disputable decision” is defined to mean an assessment and particular decisions made by the Commissioner under tax laws such as loss determinations, which may not be represented in an assessment. The definition has been widely drafted, leading to arguments that all decisions made by the Commissioner could be “disputable decisions”, which are subject to the disputes process. Proposed treatment 8.3 Because of the uncertain ambit of the term, it is proposed to repeal the references to “disputable decision” and replace them with the term “assessment.” This recognises that in most circumstances it is the assessment that forms the basis of a dispute. 8.4 However, there may still be particular circumstances that require dispute rights when no “assessment” is issued in respect of a taxpayer – for example: 37 • a decision that determines a person’s tax status, such as whether a taxpayer is an “employee” or an “independent contractor”, which is relevant to the application of the PAYE rules and the person’s ability to claim deductions; and • when an assessment is issued to a person other than the person wishing to dispute the assessment. If a mortgagor’s goods are sold, GST payable on the supply is paid by, and the assessment issued to, the mortgagee, not the mortgagor, who may wish to dispute the assessment. 8.5 These circumstances would need to be specifically provided for to allow them to be disputed through the disputes process. Test cases 8.6 Test case procedures apply only when a matter reaches the court proceedings stage. This is because in order to prevent the time bar running, an assessment must be issued before a case can be designated as a test case. In some circumstances, such as where a large number of taxpayers are involved in a particular investment product, the inability to designate a case as a test case earlier in the process can result in excessive administrative and compliance costs. Proposed treatment 8.7 It is proposed that test case procedures be available in respect of the dispute resolution rules as well as in relation to the challenge rules. 8.8 Court proceedings may be stayed where a test case is likely to determine all or most of the issues in a group of similar cases, 51 as the statute bar rules do not apply in relation to matters put before the courts for final determination. 8.9 Groups of cases that share similar facts or questions of law should be able to be progressed through the disputes procedures depending on the outcome of a representative or test case, just as is possible in relation to court proceedings. 8.10 In that case, the statute bar would be suspended while the test case is progressed so as not to prejudice taxpayers whose cases are dependent on the test case. This would provide an equivalent treatment for the exception to the statute bar rules provided in respect of court proceedings. 8.11 The Commissioner will not be required to obtain the taxpayer’s consent to stay the taxpayer’s dispute. However, the same safeguard that applies to taxpayers in the challenge rules to seek a hearing despite the stay, will also apply in respect of the dispute rules. When the taxpayer’s case raises 51 See section 138Q TAA. 38 additional issues to those in the test case it will be made clear that these will be treated independently. Fast-tracking small disputes 8.12 A taxpayer is entitled to elect to have a dispute heard by the small claims jurisdiction of the Taxation Review Authority (TRA). This election can be made in the taxpayer’s NOPA or NOR. Alternatively, an administrative procedure for fast-tracking small disputes, based on the TRA criteria of a small, simple dispute is available. This process is detailed in standard practice statement INV-140 “Fast tracking small simple disputes”. 8.13 The disputes process should be flexible to cater for all types of tax disputes, including small disputes that are capable of being resolved quickly. The options for resolving small, simple disputes do not appear to be sufficiently widely used. Proposed treatment 8.14 The small claims procedure is in place to facilitate the resolution of small, simple disputes. The current complexities in the fast-tracking procedure can be addressed by reviewing the administrative guidelines for using the process. Greater availability and use of this procedure will further promote the objective of resolving disputes quickly so as to reduce any unnecessary complexity in the system.

Non-cash untaxed benefits became popular in the environment of high marginal tax rates that prevailed at that time. By taxing fringe benefits, FBT was intended to buttress the PAYE system so that all forms of remuneration were taxed equally. The initial focus of FBT was on the main fringe benefits at that time – cars, low interest-loans and free, subsidised or discounted goods and services. 1.2 Fringe benefits continue to be offered today, albeit perhaps representing a less significant part of packages, and the types of benefits provided by employers have widened, 1 so that FBT continues to play an important role in maintaining the integrity of the tax base. 1.3 Although there have been specific changes to the rules to clarify particular areas, such as the use of a test period to establish private use of a motor vehicle, the FBT system has remained substantially unchanged. The most major change was the introduction of the multi-rate system in 2000, which was designed to remove the overtaxation of low and middle-income employees by attributing fringe benefits at the marginal tax rate of the employee. Objectives of the review 1.4 A key step in the process for developing and assessing tax policy – the generic tax policy process – is the undertaking of a review of policy once it has been implemented to see if it is operating as intended and how it can be improved. Several of these reviews have been carried out in various areas of tax policy since the process was introduced in 1994 – for example, the GST review and the accrual rules review. The FBT review is another in this series. 1.5 FBT can be considered to have been a relatively effective tax, but questions have arisen over the almost 20 years since it was introduced as to whether its efficiency and equity could be improved. In October last year the government called for taxpayers to identify areas they wished to be addressed in the review. Seventy-eight submissions were received from a cross-section of the public. 1 A wide variety of subsidised goods and services is provided, either by the employer or by a third party, and paid for by the employer. 4 1.6 The vast majority of submissions considered the fringe benefit tax system to be complex and costly and suggested ways to reduce the cost by simplifying both the process and the rules. There was general concern that some of the rules were unfair, particularly in relation to motor vehicles. Anomalies in a number of areas were also highlighted. 1.7 A number of submissions commented on the rationale and scope of the FBT rules – for example, should the FBT rules be limited to benefits that can be readily substituted for salary or key benefits that were offered in lieu of salary? Some submissions suggested employees rather than employers should pay the tax, as part of the PAYE system. Others cautioned against the potential compliance cost increases and wage pressures that this might bring. A range of other issues was also raised. 1.8 Inland Revenue surveyed 301 large employers throughout New Zealand on the subject of compliance costs, including those associated with FBT. When businesses and tax agents were asked to name the one thing that could be done to reduce tax-related compliance costs, FBT was rated as the second most important issue for large employers. It was also the second biggest issue for tax agents generally and their most significant technical tax issue. Tax agents identified a number of issues that were considered a waste of their time or added to their clients’ fees, and FBT was one of three general categories of issues. 1.9 Several developments in case law and changes in interpretation over time have added to the complexity of the tax, as they have suggested that the policy intent of the legislation is not being achieved in some areas. The different treatment of leased versus licensed car parks and the interpretation of “work-related vehicle” are prime examples. 1.10 The purpose of the post-implementation review is, therefore, to assess the operation of FBT and address taxpayers’ concerns about the way the tensions between simplicity, comprehensiveness, and cost and equity are balanced. There are good policy reasons for retaining FBT. The challenge of the review is, therefore, to reduce the difficulty and cost to employers of complying with the FBT rules while essentially maintaining the revenue collected from FBT. 2 The scope of this discussion document 1.11 This discussion document outlines a number of proposals on which the public is invited to comment. The aim is that any changes the government decides upon from this review would be included in amending tax legislation next year. 2 Over $370m in revenue is expected to be raised from FBT in the current fiscal year, two-thirds of it from motor vehicle related fringe benefits. 5 1.12 The focus of the document is on employment-related fringe benefits. The document, therefore, does not consider the interaction of FBT with other issues such as the deductibility of business entertainment expenditure, or the relative treatment of benefits under different entities such as partnerships. 1.13 Because the review has focussed on both the FBT framework and problems with specific benefits, the discussion document looks at, on the one hand, issues such as who should pay the tax and the basis for valuing benefits, and on the other, problems such as how best to value motor vehicles and the extent to which car parks are included as fringe benefits. A range of remedial issues also needs to be addressed. 1.14 Part two outlines the conceptual framework and practical issues that provide the foundations for New Zealand’s FBT system. 1.15 Part three examines the application of the FBT rules in relation to motor vehicles, car parks, loans to employees, the multi-rate, charities, low-value benefits and business tools. These areas address both concerns expressed in submissions and some anomalies that are both conceptually problematic and that provide opportunities to erode the FBT revenue base. 1.16 In discussing these issues and suggested solutions, a key point is the need to strike appropriate trade-offs between compliance costs and an accurate and comprehensive system. Often there will be a number of solutions, depending on where the trade-off is made. Accordingly, we are particularly interested in feedback on whether the suggested solutions achieve the best trade-offs. 1.17 Part four of the discussion document addresses other exemptions and issues raised by taxpayers or which are of concern to Inland Revenue. Summary of proposals 1.18 The proposed changes are: Motor vehicles • Owners would have the choice of calculating the benefit based on the vehicle’s book value (with a minimum value) or, as at present, based on its cost. • The rate applying to either the cost price or book value would be reduced in recognition of lower real motoring costs since the rate was set in the early 1980s. This would reduce the rate from 24% to 20% of cost. (The equivalent rate under the proposed book value option would be 36%.) 6 • The incentive to use various vehicle leasing structures to reduce FBT liability would be removed by aligning the treatment of leased vehicles with that of owned vehicles. This means that the benefit in respect of a leased vehicle would be based on either cost or book value. Market value (at a rate of 27%) could, however, be used if information on the cost or book value could not be easily obtained. • To remove the potential for private use within a 24-hour period being treated as two days’ private use, each employer would have the option to elect the start time for a day, which would be consistently applied in calculating the motor vehicle fringe benefit. Car parks • FBT would be applied to employer-provided car parks that are available for private use, irrespective of their legal form or whether they are on or off the premises, on the basis that any car park provided to an employee for private use is a benefit. Currently, because of the broad application of the “on-premises” exemption, most car parks are not subject to FBT. Various valuation options are suggested, and a minimum value threshold is discussed. Multi-rate calculation • Employers who file their fringe benefit returns on-line with Inland Revenue would have access to an on-line electronic calculator that would undertake the end-of-year multi-rate calculation for them. • Other simplification options are to replace the FBT multi-rate calculation with a simpler calculation that uses the top marginal tax rate on the employee’s cash remuneration as a final tax, or to apply a single rate (54%) that produces the same overall revenue outcome. • Employers who cease to employ staff and do not intend to replace them would have the option of applying the flat rate of 64% in their final return rather than doing the multi-rate calculation. Low-interest loans • Employers would have the option of valuing their loans to employees at a publicly available market rate as an alternative to the current prescribed rate of interest. Minimum thresholds • The minimum value thresholds that apply to unclassified fringe benefits would be increased. The employee de minimis would be increased from $75 to $200 per quarter and the employer de minimis increased from $450 to $2,000 per quarter. These increases are expected to remove the need for a number of employers to file FBT returns. 7 Business tools • The private use of employer-owned work tools such as cell phones and laptops would be exempt from FBT when provided to employees primarily for business purposes. Miscellaneous issues • Payment of income protection insurance premiums by an employer on behalf of an employee would be exempt to the extent that the employee would have received a tax deduction if he or she had paid the premium directly and the income stream would have been taxable. • Benefits relating to employer health and safety obligations would be exempt from FBT. • The current law would be clarified to confirm that FBT should not apply to benefits that arise when an employer secures a bulk discount for employees, provided those discounts would be available to other groups on a basis unrelated to employment. • For the purposes of the on-premises exemption, an employer’s premises would include the premises of other companies in the consolidated group. • The general anti-avoidance rule in section BG 1 would be applied to FBT. • The legislation treating share options as monetary remuneration would be amended to make it clear that it covers options that are cancelled in exchange for cash. • The legislation would be clarified so that an election to pay FBT on a quarterly basis is made at the time of filing. • Employers would be given the option of making their election to pay FBT annually by telephone rather than in writing. Other key decisions Who pays the tax? 1.19 FBT would continue to be paid by employers. Charities exemption 1.20 Following submissions from the review of charities, the current exemption that charities have from FBT would be retained. An anti-avoidance rule is proposed to close off possible opportunities for the exemption to be exploited by charities providing employees with credit cards as a significant proportion of their remuneration. 8 Submissions are invited 1.21 Submissions on any aspect of this paper are welcome.

Part two Fringe benefit tax 11 Chapter 2 POLICY FRAMEWORK 2.1 In theory, anything that employers provide to employees that could be considered to be a substitute for salary and wages should be treated as a fringe benefit. Fringe benefits that reduce employees’ needs to meet private outgoings from their own resources clearly increase their capacity to spend or save in just the same way as does the payment of additional salary and wages in cash. Given that salary and wages are taxable, it follows that, to ensure neutrality of treatment, fringe benefits should be taxable on an equivalent basis, provided that the economic benefits of doing so are not outweighed by the economic costs. 2.2 Applying neutral treatment ensures that economic behaviour is not influenced by the tax outcome and improves economic efficiency. The efficiency gains from FBT result from a reduction in the tax incentive to provide fringe benefit remuneration and the associated reduction in attractiveness of activities that lend themselves to high fringe benefit remuneration. 2.3 Neutrality also means greater equality as employees enjoying equivalent remuneration packages pay equivalent tax, regardless of the package’s composition. What should be a taxable benefit? 2.4 Because what constitutes a benefit can be very wide, further tests are necessary to identify more specifically the extent of any taxable benefit. Should FBT apply to all benefits that make an employee better off, even if they are not readily substitutable for cash, or should it apply only to those benefits that are easily substitutable for cash or are the non-cash equivalent of a taxable allowance? Taxing cash substitutes only 2.5 The argument for a more limited approach is that it would be more consistent with the position that benefits arise with the use of goods and services that employees would otherwise purchase privately. Anything that an employee could not substitute for cash remuneration would not be a fringe benefit. 2.6 Take, for example, the case of employer–provided, non-exchangeable tickets to a weekend sports event. The value of attending will vary greatly depending on whether the employee enjoys the particular sport or the team playing. It is unlikely that an employee not keen on sport could negotiate a cash substitute for such a low-value benefit, particularly if the tickets are part of a sponsorship package. That employee may be able to sell the tickets but there can be costs associated with doing so. On the other hand, if an 12 employee is a sports fan it is likely that the employer-provided tickets alleviate the cost the employee would otherwise have met from cash remuneration. The cash substitution approach would, to some extent, remove this uncertainty about whether the employee is likely to receive a benefit. 2.7 Applying the cash substitution approach would mean a comparatively narrower range of benefits would be covered. As such, the approach could have a greater impact on economic decision-making and equity across employees, depending on the extent to which those benefits that were not covered were considered by employees to have value. Furthermore, it could be difficult in many instances to determine whether a fringe benefit is, in fact, substitutable for cash. One approach would list a range of benefits that were considered to be substitutable for cash. Any such list would, however, involve a degree of arbitrariness. Taxing all non-cash remuneration 2.8 Taxing all non-cash remuneration will have a lesser impact on decision- making as it seeks to treat all benefits that flow from the employer to the employee equally for tax purposes. Although this may appear to be too wide to be practicable, the ability to value a benefit will act as a practical limitation and the ultimate test as to whether something has potential value to the employee. 2.9 Further practical adjustments can be applied. Some benefits are very difficult to value as there is no readily associated market price. When it is evident in such cases that the cost involved in paying FBT on the benefit clearly outweighs the value of the benefit, exempting the benefit can operate as a useful moderating tool to prevent the FBT rules from applying unreasonably. 2.10 When benefits can be more easily measured, instances of when the cost involved in paying FBT outweighs the value of the benefit can be handled by the setting of minimum taxable values, or de minimis thresholds. Valuing benefits 2.11 Two key tests are helpful in valuing benefits: • if the benefit involves the provision of an asset, whether the asset is available for private use by the employee; and • the value of the benefit to the employee. 13 2.12 Consider, for instance, the situation of an employer providing an employee with a motor vehicle. Without the employer-provided car, the employee would have had to purchase a car and incur fixed costs (depreciation, interest, licensing, insurance and warrant of fitness). If the employee uses the vehicle, he or she enjoys further savings in terms of avoiding running costs (maintenance, tyres and possibly oil and petrol if the employer also covers this). 2.13 If recognition of the benefit was confined to actual private use – say, on the basis of either kilometres travelled or time, the benefit would be materially undervalued because the fixed costs occur irrespective of whether the vehicle is used. The employee enjoys the economic benefit of avoiding these costs, hence the concept of availability being a fringe benefit. 2.14 The other important concept is that the value of the benefit should be the value to the employee rather than, say, the cost to the employer of providing the benefit. In many cases the two values will differ, with the employer having an incentive to provide benefits that have a low marginal cost to them but that are more highly valued by the employee. An example that highlights this disparity is air tickets, which an employer who is in the business of providing air travel may be quite happy to offer to employees at a very low price because the marginal cost of an empty seat at the time of departure is close to zero. In contrast, the benefit of the ticket to the employee is in most instances the price of a normal (standby) fare. The reason the focus needs to be on the value to the employee is because it should measure what the employee is willing to give up in terms of (after tax) salary and wages. Trade-off between accuracy and compliance costs 2.15 Trying to measure all benefits accurately is unrealistic as it would give rise to significant compliance costs for taxpayers and enforcement costs for Inland Revenue. Also, the behavioural effects and revenue implications are minimal from low-value benefits. This means, just as when deciding which benefits should be taxable, that a realistic approach should be taken, with the main emphasis being on the “big ticket” and more frequently occurring benefits. Even in those cases, however, we acknowledge that there is room for flexibility and the need to make trade-offs between accuracy and compliance costs. 2.16 Getting the right trade-off is important. The broader the application of tax to fringe benefits, the greater the incentive to switch from fringe benefits to cash remuneration, which then becomes taxable under the personal tax system. At the same time, a reduction in the occurrence of fringe benefit remuneration eases the administration of the tax. However, a relatively onerous tax also increases the incentive for avoidance and evasion and leads to pressure for the granting of concessions or exemptions. A concessionary tax tends to have the opposite results, including making the administration of the tax more difficult through reducing the incentive to switch to cash remuneration. 14 Categorisation of benefits 2.17 Fringe benefits can be categorised into three groups for valuation purposes: • benefits that are easily quantified and can be assessed by individual valuation – for example, an employer paying for an employee’s holiday; • benefits, such as motor vehicles, that would require a more complicated calculation if assessed on an individual basis and should, therefore, be treated as a class to which a standard set of rules applies; and • benefits, such as a staff cafeteria in which food is provided at subsidised prices, that are difficult to allocate to individuals largely because, although the benefit might be frequently used, each benefit is small. 2.18 The earlier discussion suggests that the FBT rules should focus primarily on the first two categories and that the third is unlikely to be worth taxing and can be addressed by setting minimum values that apply before a benefit is recognised. 2.19 When, as in the first category, an employer provides a taxable benefit by paying for a good or service that is supplied by another independent party, the value of the benefit to the employee can be taken for practical reasons as the cost to the employer. In such cases the benefit has a clear market price and the value to the employee should equate to the cost to the employer. 2.20 The next chapter discusses how the current rules compare with this framework. 15 Chapter 3 CURRENT FRINGE BENEFIT TAX RULES 3.1 The current fringe benefit tax rules contained in subpart CI of the Income Tax Act 1994 take a wide approach. Although they list specific significant benefits, such as motor vehicles, subsidised travel and loans, they also contain a catch-all provision (section CI 1(h)) that covers “any benefit of any other kind whatever, received or enjoyed by the employee ...whether directly, or indirectly, in relation to, in the course of, or by virtue of the employment of the employee and which is provided or granted by the employer of the employee...”. 3.2 The rules then exclude certain benefits, such as a benefit from an employer that is a charitable organisation provided the benefit is not received in the course of carrying on a business, or benefits provided on an employer’s premises. 3.3 Minimum value thresholds apply to remove low-value benefits from any FBT impost. Unclassified benefits (those falling within section CI 1(h)) of $75 or less per quarter ($300 per year) per employee are excluded and an employer or associated person can provide aggregate unclassified benefits of up to $450 per quarter before FBT applies. 3 Also, discounts of 5% or less are ignored when the goods are of low value. Trade-off between accuracy and lower compliance costs 3.4 The trade-off between accuracy and lower compliance costs has been a major influence on the design of the current rules. Back in 1985 it was noted to be an issue, particularly in relation to the valuation of benefits. Because the value of a benefit is often difficult to determine and may vary considerably among different cases, a system based on case-by-case assessment can involve heavy compliance and administrative costs. It may, however, be more equitable than the alternative of a system of prescribed benefit values which do not permit much case-by-case variation. 3.5 No system was considered capable of meeting simultaneously equity and compliance and administrative cost objectives. Hence, the rules developed at that time attempted to achieve a reasonable trade-off between these conflicting objectives. Although their deficiencies were recognised, they were considered to be less than the problems associated with the loss of revenue created by not taxing fringe benefits. 3 There are no equivalent minimum values for those benefits, such as motor vehicles, that are separately listed as benefits in section CI 1. 16 Availability for use versus actual use 3.6 If an asset is provided by an employer to an employee, its fringe benefit value is determined by whether it is available for private use. In the case of motor vehicles, the availability test is applied on a daily basis. Whether a vehicle is available for private use can be determined by keeping a log book for a three-month test period (see section CI 11). If the vehicle is available for private use at any time during the day, such as for home-to-work travel, availability for such use is considered to exist for the whole day. 3.7 If the benefit relates to a service rather than the provision of an asset, the benefit is valued according to the actual use of that service, with no value being attributed to having access to the subsidised service. Discounted goods are similarly treated – even though the discount may be available to the employee at all times, goods have to be purchased to trigger the taxable benefit. 3.8 Arguably, the availability of a discount or access to services has some value, but it is very difficult to determine and will vary from employee to employee, depending on whether they intend to purchase the goods or services. Given these difficulties, it is sensible to treat the availability aspect as irrelevant and apply “use” as the appropriate test. Value of benefit to employee 3.9 Under the Act, benefits are, in general terms, valued as follows: • when the employer makes a contribution on behalf of an employee, at the actual amount paid by the employer; • when the employer provides a good or service, at the lower of cost or market value; or • when the employer provides a good or service for which there is a part charge, such as a low-interest rate on a loan, at the difference between the price to the employee and the market value or market value proxy (for example, a prescribed rate of interest). 3.10 Because of the need to strike a balance between accuracy and lower compliance costs, standard rules apply to those types of assets for which identifying and allocating actual individual benefits would be compliance cost intensive. 3.11 The prime examples are motor vehicles and subsidised transport. In the latter case the cost is the higher of 25 percent of the highest price that would be charged to the public or non-employees or the price paid by the employer. This proxy is used because of the difficulty in establishing the appropriate cost, since price varies according to the attached conditions. In the absence of this rule, the value of the benefit should be the average cost or the 17 marginal cost, highlighted by the example used previously regarding airline tickets. 3.12 Another example of the difficulty in balancing accuracy and compliance costs arises when ensuring that FBT is accurate by applying the marginal tax rate of the employee. Currently, the rates are 17.65%, 26.58%, 49.25% and 63.93%, to reflect the personal marginal tax rates of 15%, 21%, 33% and 39%. As discussed later in this document, taxpayers are concerned about the complexity that this multi-rate approach entails. Previously, only one rate applied, but taxpayers were concerned that this meant some employee benefits were overtaxed. 18 Chapter 4 WHO SHOULD PAY THE TAX? 4.1 One option that has been raised is that rather than the employer paying the tax, the tax would be paid by the employee. The rationale for this approach is that FBT is a tax on individual benefits, at the individual’s marginal tax rates, to bolster PAYE. It is not intended to supplement company tax. 4.2 The option of the employee paying FBT would involve attributing benefits to individual employees, who would in some manner pay the tax. The tax would likely be collected by applying the PAYE withholding tax, possibly with an end-of-year square-up through the tax return process. 4.3 Requiring individual employees to include benefits as taxable income would effectively leave employees with the same remuneration package while increasing their taxable incomes. Accordingly, it would reduce their entitlements and increase their obligations under the various programmes delivered through the tax system, such as family support, student loan repayments and child support payments. It would align these employees with those who receive all their remuneration as salaries and wages, resulting in more equal treatment. It might also raise employees’ awareness of the extent of the benefits they receive. These various outcomes may increase economic efficiency. 4.4 Whether the employee or employer pays the tax should not, in theory, affect the incidence of the tax. There may be some implications, however, if the employer does not also pass on to the employee the equivalent amount the employer is paying in FBT. If employees’ remuneration is already treated as a package, any fringe benefits and the associated tax will generally be built into that package. In other cases the two parties may have to negotiate over whether the employer passes on to the employee the equivalent amount that the employer is currently paying in FBT. 4.5 Because employers would still need to calculate benefits and attribute them to individual employees, changing who pays the tax is unlikely to result in any material compliance savings for employers, although it may obviate their need to undertake the multi-rate calculation. Overall compliance costs would probably increase as there would be additional compliance costs for employees. Furthermore, if benefits could not be attributed, the tax impost would probably remain with the employer. Treating fringe benefits in exactly the same way as salaries and wages would reduce the likelihood of bringing former IR 5 taxpayers back into the end-of-year return filing process, although employees would still need to decide whether they were due a refund. 19 4.6 Alternatively, the employee could be required to pay the tax just on the easily attributable fringe benefits, such as loans, but this might just lead to confusion among the parties as to their relative responsibilities for paying the tax. 4.7 On balance, in the context of the objectives of the FBT review there does not seem to be merit in changing who pays the tax. Most of the advantages of integrating FBT into the PAYE system can be achieved without shifting who pays the tax. The government is already working on improvements to the way FBT is returned, including, as discussed in the later chapter on the multi-rate calculation, better access for employers to Inland Revenue’s on- line calculation tools. Part three Major issues 23 Chapter 5 VALUATION OF MOTOR VEHICLE BENEFITS Proposed changes • Owners would have the choice of calculating the benefit based on the vehicle’s book value (with a minimum value) or, as at present, its cost. • The rate applying to either the cost price or book value would be reduced in recognition of lower real motoring costs since the rate was set, in the early 1980s. This would reduce the rate from 24% to 20% of cost. (The equivalent rate under the proposed book value option would be 36%.) • The incentive to use various vehicle leasing structures to reduce FBT liability would be removed, by aligning the treatment of leased vehicles with that of owned vehicles. This means that the benefit in respect of a leased vehicle would be based on either cost or book value. Market value (at a rate of 27%) could, however, be used if information on the cost or book value could not be easily obtained. • Each employer would have the option to elect the start time for a day, which would be consistently applied in calculating the motor vehicle fringe benefit. 5.1 The valuation of motor vehicles for FBT purposes was the issue most frequently raised as an area of concern in the comments made in submissions. Submissions considered that the review should reconsider the FBT treatment of motor vehicles in a range of areas. Current treatment 5.2 As noted in chapter 2, motor vehicles are valued for FBT purposes on the basis of their availability for private use rather than actual use, to reflect the full range of fixed and variable costs the employee is saved from incurring by having the use of a vehicle that is owned by someone else, who bears those costs. The FBT value to an employee of a car provided by an employer is, therefore, the sum of the fixed (or standing) costs and variable (running) costs related to private use that the employee would have to bear if he or she owned the car. 5.3 Like other fringe benefits, the actual value of an employer-provided vehicle will vary according to individual employees’ vehicle preferences and use. However, taking all such factors into account for each relevant employee would significantly increase compliance costs for employers. To avoid this 24 complexity, a set rate is applied (currently 24% a year 4 ). That rate is based on the combined average fixed and variable costs for a vehicle that has an average amount of private use, expressed as a percentage of the cost of an average vehicle. The data source for these costs is the Automobile Association annual survey of motoring costs. 5 This rate is then applied to the actual price of the vehicle to establish the value of the fringe benefit. 5.4 What constitutes the vehicle’s actual price depends on whether the employer owns or leases the vehicle. In the case of a vehicle that is owned by the employer, the 24% rate is applied to the original cost of the vehicle. For example, if the cost of the car provided to an employee for unlimited private use is $30,000, the value of the fringe benefit is $7,200. 5.5 If the vehicle is leased and the lessor and lessee are not associated persons, the 24% rate is applied to the market value of the motor vehicle at the time the lease began. If, however, the leasing parties are associated, the vehicle’s cost is used. 5.6 In any of these cases, however, the objective should be that the same amount of FBT is payable irrespective of the type of arrangement under which the vehicle is provided. To achieve this objective, the valuation basis for the cost of the car must be either consistent across all arrangements, or the statutory formula must vary to arrive at the same amount of liability. 5.7 The relevant formula and rules are contained in sections CI 3 and schedule 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Binding ruling (Binding ruling Pub 00/10) sets out what is considered by Inland Revenue to be the “cost price” of a vehicle for FBT purposes. 5.8 The formula establishes the maximum taxable benefit. Because it is an average, it will in individual cases result in the actual benefit being either undertaxed or overtaxed, but this is the trade-off for lower compliance costs. 5.9 The legislation also provides for the maximum taxable benefit to be reduced by any amounts paid by the employee for the receipt or enjoyment of the fringe benefit (see section CI 4(1)) and any days that the vehicle is not available for private use. The employee, for example, may pay for the petrol or the vehicle may not be available on weekends. 4 This means that the average cost of owning a vehicle for five years is 120% of the original purchase price. 5 As published in AA Directions. 25 The valuation basis – cost or book value 5.10 Writers of submissions perceived the current valuation formula’s use of the original cost of the vehicle to be unfair as the FBT liability remains constant while the vehicle declines in value over time. Although some appeared not to be aware that the valuation formula includes a depreciation allowance, 6 others considered that aligning the FBT valuation with the depreciated value used for other tax purposes would result in a compliance cost saving. 5.11 The government agrees that there is a perception problem associated with using a vehicle’s cost price as the base for calculating the benefit. Also, because the formula assumes vehicles are held for an average of five years, it results in overtaxation if the vehicle is kept beyond five years. 5.12 In 1982 the Task Force on Tax Reform (the McCaw Task Force), 7 which recommended introducing FBT, considered the alternative option of using a vehicle’s tax book value as the base, but noted a higher rate would be required to produce the same overall result as using cost price as the base. (As the example below illustrates, the equivalent percentage to 24% of the cost price would be 44% of the book value.) Comparison of rates based on book values and original cost of a vehicle purchased new for $30,000 Taxable value under the current formula $30,000 x 24% \*1 $7,200 taxable value per year x 5 years $36,000 total taxable value over 5 years Taxable value based on depreciated value to produce same amount of tax Book value Taxable value of vehicle of fringe benefit Year 1 (Original Cost) $30,000 $13,200 Year 2 $20,640 $9,082 Year 3 $14,200 $6,248 Year 4 $9,770 $4,299 Year 5 $6,722 $2,957 Total over 5 years $35,786 The example assumes a vehicle purchased new at $30,000 FBT rate equivalent is 44% \*2 \*1 proposed in this chapter to be reduced to 20%. \*2 36% following the proposed reduction to 20% of cost. 6 See appendix. 7 See Chapter 6.VI of the Report of the Task Force on Tax Reform, April 1982. 26 5.13 Because the rate would be higher, the FBT liability using book value would initially be higher than when using the cost price. Also, because the annual tax depreciation rate on cars is, at over 20%, 8 higher relative to that used by the Automobile Association, using it in the calculation is likely to exacerbate the rate increase. Consequently, changing the base alone may not address concerns expressed in submissions, although it would align the taxable value of the motor vehicle for fringe benefit purposes with the value of the vehicle for other tax purposes. 5.14 An alternative would be to use market value rather than book value, but this would have higher compliance and administrative costs because of the need to verify each car’s market value annually. Using some standard values may assist in this regard but could be quite inaccurate. Minimum value 5.15 Because the depreciated tax value declines rapidly over five years, using book value could significantly understate the value of the benefit thereafter. Accordingly, a minimum fringe benefit value would be needed to reflect the benefits that the use of an employer-provided vehicle continues to provide to an employee regardless of the value of the vehicle on the employer’s books. The minimum value should cover at least the average cost of warranting, registering, insuring and running private vehicles, assuming an annual distance of 14,000kms, 9 which equates to around $3000. Proposal 5.16 The government proposes that tax book value (subject to a minimum value) be used as a method of valuing vehicle fringe benefits, as an alternative to cost price. Having a choice would enable employers to better align the base they use for FBT purposes with the base they use for tax depreciation purposes. Employers would need to elect at the beginning which option they wished to use for each vehicle and that election would continue to apply for the period of ownership of the vehicle, or the first five years, whichever is shorter. If the book value option were adopted, a minimum value of $3000, reviewed periodically, would apply. Availability for private use 5.17 Submissions considered that the concept of “availability for private use” also needed to be re-examined because a large FBT liability could be incurred if the employer did not prohibit private use, even in circumstances where actual private use was very small. 8 For tax purposes, a motor vehicle can be depreciated annually at a rate of either 21.6% of its cost price or 31.2% of its diminishing value. These rates include a 20% loading on the economic rate. 9 The assumed average motoring used by the Automobile Association. 27 5.18 As noted earlier, under the current rules, an identification of private versus business use can be made based on a three-month test period in which a log of use is kept. This allocation is, however, on the basis of availability rather than actual use. For the reasons outlined earlier, the government considers availability to be the appropriate approach. 5.19 Actual private use of work-provided motor vehicles can be quite variable, ranging typically from occasional home-to-work travel only to regular use outside work. Unfettered use usually arises with vehicles provided to executives, whereas it is more likely that other staff will take home fleet vehicles, perhaps primarily for garaging. In the latter case employers will often place specific limits on private use and require that work use take priority during work time. This “tagging” of the benefit, it is argued, reduces its value. This is a reasonable argument, but by how much is the benefit reduced? 5.20 In some instances employees may find the limitations have little practical impact on their ability to use an employer-provided car when they want. For example, an employer may require that a vehicle is used solely for work purposes during work hours but this would not impede an employee from using the car to drive to and from work and on evenings and weekends, so he or she could still have a higher use of the vehicle than is assumed in the standard formula used to calculate the fringe benefit. 5.21 This example illustrates the difficulty of trying to identify the impact of particular limitations on the value of any benefit. The impact will depend on the extent of the limitation, the personal circumstances of the employee and how well the limitation is adhered to (which will depend on how sensibly it can be monitored). The appropriate rate 5.22 In 1982 the McCaw Task Force used Automobile Association data to calculate both the fixed and variable costs of motoring, grouping cars according to three categories (small, medium, large) and assuming they travel an average of 16,000kms each year. The aggregate cost was then expressed as a percentage of the cost of the car. On this basis it calculated the percentage benefit to range from 35% for a large vehicle to 43% for a small vehicle. The Task Force considered, however, that a more conservative rate of 24% a year would be more appropriate, to reflect the following factors: • Many taxpayers’ private motoring travel is less than the benchmark distance of 16,000kms. • Some operating costs (such as fuel) may be met by the employee. • The vehicle may be superior to that which the employee would have purchased for his or her own use. 28 • Some restrictions may be placed on the use of a vehicle for private purposes so that it is not wholly available for private running. 5.23 These factors were partially reflected in the final 1985 legislation. Operating costs specifically met by employees reduce the benefit; the availability for private use test is applied to motor vehicles on a daily basis; and the rate calculation of 24% was the cost at that time for employees travelling an average of only 8,000kms per year. 5.24 Applying the methodology used by the McCaw Task Force to current motoring costs and car prices 10 shows that, in real terms, the cost of motoring has declined significantly over the past 20 years, as shown in table 1. Based on 16,000kms, the annual motoring costs as a percentage of the cost price of the vehicles have declined by as much as 20%. The decline is mainly in the variable costs as there is no decline at the 8,000kms level. Arguably, however, 8,000kms per year is too low to reflect average actual travel. The Automobile Association assumes average annual motoring to be 14,000kms, which we consider to be a more reasonable basis for the calculations. It produces a decline in real motoring costs of around 18%. Table 1: Motoring costs as percentage of cost of vehicle Year & Source 1982 McCaw\* 1981 AA\* 1984 MOT\* 2003 AA\* % AA change from 1981 at 16,000kms 40.035.533.427.4-22.8 at 14,000kms -32.230.726.4-18.0 at 8,000kms -22.322.923.5+5.4 \* Number shown is an average for small, medium and large vehicles. 5.25 This decline over the last 20 years suggests that the valuation of the fringe benefit at a rate of 24% of a vehicle’s cost is now overstated, so the rate could be reduced. Continuing to apply a discount to the actual rate will also help reflect any reduction in the benefit’s value from the limitations often placed on private use during the day. Proposal 5.26 Applying an 18% reduction to the 24% discounted rate considered appropriate in the early 1980s and included in the legislation would reduce the rate to 20%. The equivalent percentage using book value as the base would be around 36%. The government proposes, therefore, to introduce revised valuation rates of 20% for cost and 36% for book value. 10 See appendix for the basic method as applied to motoring costs and prices for 2003. 29 Leased vehicles 5.27 FBT on leased vehicles is assessed on the vehicle’s market value at the beginning of the lease. This is intended to produce the same outcome as if the vehicle were owned but removes the need for the employer to ascertain the cost or book value from the owner. 5.28 In practice, however, as a number of submissions noted, leasing a vehicle can produce a lower FBT liability. This is because many leases are being structured so that they become renewable each year, resulting in a new market value annually and a commensurate reduction in FBT as the vehicle ages. 11 The result is that, effectively, there is a double recognition of depreciation – one being through the market value of the vehicle and the other being incorporated into the rate calculation, as explained earlier. 5.29 This situation should be rectified to help ensure both that the FBT base is not undermined and that the choice between leasing and owning is not driven by the tax outcome. Proposal 5.30 The suggested approach is to provide equality of treatment between leased and owned vehicles by allowing lessees the same options that owners have when valuing the fringe benefit. This means that lessees would be able to use either a rate of 20% on the cost price of the vehicle or a rate of 36% on the book value of the vehicle. If lessees cannot obtain the necessary cost price or book value information from the lessor, they would be able to use a market value rate (27%) that produces an equivalent FBT result. 5.31 This option would not increase compliance costs for employers who lease vehicles as they could continue the current practice of valuing vehicles each year, with the book value or cost price generally replacing the market valuation. Availability on a daily basis 5.32 A related issue raised by submissions is whether the FBT liability should continue to be calculated on a daily basis. Currently, if a vehicle is available for private use at any time during the day, such as for home-to-work travel, the vehicle is considered to be available for the whole day. Calculating the 11 These types of leases are commonly referred to as 1x1x1 leases. Another common form of leasing arrangement is nine-to-five leases. The latter typically involve an individual (usually a shareholder- employee) buying a vehicle and leasing it back to his or her company for its business use during specified hours in exchange for a market rental. Such agreements are often a means of allowing the individual to enjoy the private use of the vehicle without incurring FBT on that private use. The discussion document does not address the conceptual and technical issues surrounding such leases but consideration is being given to those issues. The leases are a response to the boundary issues between different forms of entity – in particular, the relative treatment of fringe benefits received by shareholder-employees and the self-employed; and technical issues arise, for example, about the appropriateness of the valuations involved, as well as about the general nature of the arrangement. 30 benefit on, say, an hourly basis would involve a far higher compliance cost and would be more difficult to monitor. Some submissions considered that calculating on a daily basis leads to unfair outcomes when, for example, an employee takes a vehicle home at night because the employee is required to take it to another work site the following morning. In such cases the vehicle is considered to be used privately between the time it is driven home and the time it is driven to work and an FBT liability arises for both days. 5.33 We agree that when an employee has no choice but to take a vehicle home so as to get to another work site the following day, such as may occur with a district nurse, that this should be treated as a business use, provided the employee is prohibited from using the vehicle for private use over the period. The recently released exposure draft IS3448, from Inland Revenue’s Adjudication and Rulings division, is likely to be helpful in clarifying the FBT treatment in such cases. 5.34 The government has also looked at the feasibility of a day being defined as any 24-hour period rather than a calendar day. A reference point would be needed, which could be achieved by employers electing when their day would begin. For example, an employer may elect to begin the day at 6.00pm, in which case any private travel between 6.00pm on a particular calendar day and 6.00pm the following calendar day would be treated as being all within the same day for FBT purposes. 5.35 The employer’s election would apply for every day thereafter but could be reviewed after three years. The election would also only apply to motor vehicle fringe benefits. Employers should not generally need to maintain more records as a result of this option if the private use of a vehicle follows a regular pattern and can, therefore, be established through a logbook test period. Moreover, it is optional, so that if an employer makes no election, the current treatment of a calendar day would apply. Proposal 5.36 Individual employers would have the option to elect the start time for their day for the purposes of calculating their motor vehicle fringe benefits, and that election would also apply for every day after the election. Employers could review their election after three years. If an employer did not make an election, a day would be a calendar day. 31 Chapter 6 WORK-RELATED VEHICLES Proposed changes There is no specific proposal to change the definition of “work-related vehicle” but some options for simplifying the definition without creating a behavioural change that would significantly erode the tax base are discussed. The requirement that a work-related vehicle display the employer’s logo would be retained but the Commissioner of Inland Revenue would have the discretion to waive it when an employer could demonstrate that the requirement would seriously compromise the nature of the business. Current law and problems 6.1 Attempts to limit FBT applying to work use have, apart from the use of logbooks to record private versus business use, involved the wholesale exempting of vehicles on the basis of their appearance as “work-related vehicles”. 6.2 “Work-related vehicle” is a defined term in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act. Under the definition, certain private travel in a motor vehicle (not being a car) is exempt from FBT provided it is restricted to: • travel between home and work in the course of, and as a condition of, employment; and • travel incidental to business travel. 6.3 To qualify for the exemption, the employer’s name or logo or equivalent identifier must be prominently and permanently displayed on the vehicle. Any days on which this definition is met are excluded from the FBT calculation. 6.4 This exemption dates from the beginning of the FBT legislation in 1985. The first proviso was not designed to cover all travel between home and work but only that travel that had been directed by the employer. This was envisaged to cover those situations when an employer required the vehicle to be taken home at night because, for example, there was no overnight parking at the employer’s premises, or the use of the vehicle was required to carry goods or equipment. 32 6.5 The exemption is not available for many employer-provided vehicles as cars are generally not considered to be acquired for work purposes because they are primarily designed for the carriage of passengers. 12 Court decisions have, however, identified instances when cars can qualify – for example, when passenger seats have been removed – and have generally resulted in a widening of what qualifies as a work-related vehicle. 6.6 Submissions considered the current definition to be anomalous and an impediment to normal business practice; a vehicle may be needed, for example, to transport clients or fellow workers between sites as much as goods or equipment. They considered the main problem with the exemption to be that it focuses on the type and appearance of the vehicle rather than the purpose to which it is put. Employers in the same situation can be treated differently, depending on the type of vehicle being used. Ordinary hatch- back cars, for example, are generally “motor cars” and, therefore, not exempt, but hatch-backs modified with removable plywood inserts may meet the exemption criteria. 13 Furthermore, the definition is relatively inflexible and can fail to keep up with changing work practices. 6.7 An additional problem is that the logo requirement can disadvantage businesses with sensitive activities. For example, if organisations who are involved in community health work brand their work vehicles, patients visited at home may be put at risk. Comment 6.8 The problems outlined here do not arise when there is no private benefit element for an employee – that is, when the vehicle is exclusively used for work purposes. Employers can, therefore, avoid any FBT implications by ensuring that no private element arises. 6.9 Having said that, however, the government acknowledges that incidental private use of vehicles acquired primarily for business use will inevitably occur from time to time, just as it does for other employer-owned assets, and that FBT should not apply in such cases when the costs outweigh the benefits. This necessitates some form of exclusion mechanism. 12 Taxi cabs are an obvious exception, given that they are a work vehicle for the specific purpose of carrying passengers. 13 CIR v Rag Doll Fashions (NZ) Ltd (1995) 17 NZTC 12,104. 33 6.10 Intuitively, from a compliance perspective, exempting a range of obviously work-related vehicles is preferable to requiring all motor vehicles to have to keep logs of business and private use or, alternatively, applying a minimum taxable value to motor vehicles. But a range of boundary problems arise with this exemption, the solutions for which are not straightforward. 6.11 The key problem in designing a better, and preferably simpler, solution is that it needs to be sufficiently robust, from both an economic and administrative perspective, while not creating additional compliance costs. Economic implications 6.12 Arguably, the current exemption gives rise to its own economic distortions since it potentially enables some employees to receive material fringe benefits that are not taxed. The benefit arising from the ability to use a vehicle for home-to-work travel is in many cases not incidental if the vehicle is used in this way each day. Even though the employer may require the vehicle to be taken home for good commercial reasons, employees may still receive a material private benefit in terms of reducing their transport costs between home and work. 6.13 For example, travelling just 30kms between work and home on each working day of the year (240 days) amounts to 7,200kms, which is half the assumed average travel of a vehicle that is available for unlimited private use, the big difference being that in the latter case home-to-work travel is subject to FBT. The magnitude of this imputed “concession” means that if the definition of a work-related vehicle was extended to include cars there would be a significant incentive to try to characterise cars as work-related vehicles, irrespective of whether they should in principle be regarded as such. 14 6.14 There are also the distortions, as highlighted by submissions, that arise from the definition influencing decisions at the margin as to which vehicles to buy. Were an employer to purchase a car and make it available for private use on the same limited basis as permitted under the definition of work-related vehicle, the employer would incur compliance costs from having to keep a log book for a test period to verify the limited use and, more importantly, would have to pay FBT on the private benefit. This means that there is a strong incentive to purchase a vehicle that meets the work-related vehicle definition, irrespective of whether it is the optimal vehicle for the job. Although, undeniably, distortions arise in this situation, they are a trade-off for the compliance cost reductions provided by the exemption. 14 There will be questions about whether the benefit is of the same value. Does a truck used to transport a concrete mixer and other equipment and materials have the same private benefit to an employee as a sedan? If the employee does not see the vehicle as a substitute and retains his or her own vehicle, the benefit is arguably just the saving in running costs or some equivalent transport cost. 34 6.15 If, by extending the definition, the behavioural changes were only at the margin, the current distortions might be reduced and the change would, therefore, be worth making. But if there were significantly higher behavioural change, more economic distortions would likely be created. For example, the policy objectives of FBT would be completely undermined if those cars on which FBT is currently payable because of their being fully available for private use became “redefined” as work-related vehicles. Revenue implications 6.16 Apart from the economic implications, the government is also concerned that this potential for significant behavioural change could lead to a material erosion of the FBT revenue base. 6.17 The definition is already difficult to administer in terms of identifying whether a vehicle is actually being used for more than the private purposes allowed by the definition. Consequently, any further liberalisation could lead to relatively free private use under the guise of employer letters prohibiting wide scale private use 15 and/or vehicles being called “work vehicles” because they might be used for client visits. The current rules at least serve as an impediment to this abuse. Simplifying the definition 6.18 Given the economic and fiscal implications, the government needs to be convinced that the risk of widespread behavioural change is low. At present, the government does not have sufficient information on which to make an informed decision on this point. Accordingly, the government invites submissions on ways in which the definition could be simplified without resulting in widespread avoidance. The rest of this chapter discusses possible options for achieving this objective. The government is not committed to any of these options but, rather, raises them to assist submissions in this area. 6.19 The options discussed are: • extending the current exemption by widening the definition of “work- related vehicle”, subject to certain safeguards; • replacing the exemption with a minimum taxable value that also covers cars; • replacing the exemption with a charge for per-kilometre private use for vehicles that meet a widened definition of “work-related vehicle”; 15 Technically, a vehicle is not available for private use if an employer has prohibited its use, even though it may actually be used. The operation of the exemption, therefore, becomes dependent on employers’ enforcement and Inland Revenue audit. The record-keeping requirements necessary to establish that a vehicle is not available for private use are set out in Tax Information Bulletin Volume 4, No 8 (April 1993). 35 • supplementing the current definition by applying any changes only to vehicles that would qualify for the definition of “work-related vehicle” but for the fact they are cars; • replacing the exemption with a charge for per-kilometre private use for vehicles that meet the current definition of “work-related vehicle”. Options Option 1: Widening the definition of “work-related vehicle” subject to certain safeguards 6.20 The definition of “work-related vehicle” could be widened to include any vehicle, provided that at all times during a quarter any private benefits are only incidental and/or limited to travel between home and work as directed by the employer, and the vehicle clearly displays the organisation’s name, logo or similar identifier. 6.21 Widespread behavioural change could be mitigated by all or any of the following: • Employees would use logbooks to identify the nature of the travel for those vehicles that do not meet the current definition but that meet the widened definition. This would provide a record for audit purposes to establish whether private use was confined to travel between home and work and/or incidental use. Employers could weigh up the compliance costs of keeping logbooks against the benefits of having their cars that are used for work purposes designated as work-related vehicles. Unlike the current provision that enables a logbook to be kept for a test period to establish private use, 16 this approach would require a log to be kept permanently. It would focus on both actual use as well as availability for private use. A key problem with logbooks is that their effectiveness is reliant in the first instance on the employer providing a check on what the employee has recorded; otherwise verification can be problematic. • A vehicle would have to meet the requirements of a widened definition at all times. This means that just one day’s use unrelated to business or home-to-work travel during the quarter would result in that quarter being subject to full FBT in relation to the vehicle. • Situations when the employee and employer are associated persons would be excluded from the widened definition. The current definition would continue to apply in such cases. The presumption is that employer limitations on private use are less likely to be enforced or monitored when the employer is associated with the employee, so the scope for behavioural change is larger. 16 This current log book provision records the days of private use and enjoyment of a vehicle during the three-month test period. The results of the test period apply for three years. Private use includes any availability for private use. 36 Option 2: A minimum taxable value 6.22 An alternative option to widening the work-related vehicle exemption would be to replace it with a minimum taxable value (in tax terms, a de minimis) for motor vehicle fringe benefits. It would be quite separate from other minimum taxable values applying to other low-value benefits. A minimum taxable value applies to vehicle fringe benefits in the United States, for example, for administrative and compliance reasons. 6.23 It could be applied in either of two ways – as a threshold which, once crossed, would mean that all the fringe benefit would be taxed, or as a threshold above which the maximum exemption would begin to be abated. 6.24 The advantage of this option is that it need not be confined to particular vehicle types, so that low-value private use of cars would be exempt from FBT. The trade-off is that it would mean a tightening up for some taxpayers as their travel between home and work would no longer be automatically exempt. 6.25 Overall compliance costs would likely increase given that it would mean having to keep a record of actual benefits for all those road vehicles that are currently exempt as work-related vehicles. 17 A significant number of employers could, therefore, be affected. For those employers who pay FBT on a quarterly basis, the minimum taxable value would need to be applied on a quarterly basis, which could produce a different tax outcome from application on an annual basis if the benefits arose unevenly during the year. 6.26 But the main problem with a minimum taxable value if applied to all vehicles would be that it would not be sufficiently targeted to identify minor availability for private use. If, for example, a second-hand vehicle was purchased, its value could be quite low, so that applying a minimum taxable value in such instances could allow a significant proportion of private use before FBT applied. The de minimis might, therefore, need to be limited to vehicles that are less than five years old. Also, since the system determines private availability on a daily basis, incidental use of just a few minutes would mean that the whole day would be considered to be private use, which could severely limit the usefulness of the measure. Alternatively, if it were expressed in terms of days, it would enable unlimited private travel to be undertaken on those days, which would not be the objective. Option 3: Valuing private travel at running costs 6.27 Under this option, vehicles predominantly used for work purposes would be charged FBT on private use by adopting a standard running cost rather than the full costs of motoring. To qualify, the vehicle would have to meet the equivalent of the work-related vehicle exemption, except that cars would also 17 There would be no additional compliance costs for those vehicles that are already doing this because they do not currently qualify for the exemption. 37 be included. Given that some private use may be difficult to measure, the test would likely focus on charging FBT on travel between home and work. 6.28 A justification for this approach is that if employees do not see the vehicle involved as a substitute and retain their own vehicles, the benefit is arguably just the saving in running costs or some equivalent transport cost. This approach is used in Canada for motor vehicles other than automobiles that are essential to an employer’s business operation, when the only personal use is to provide transportation between an employee’s home and work. In such cases the benefit can be computed on a cents-per-kilometre basis for equivalent automobile transportation. 6.29 The key advantage of this option is that it would apply uniformly across all vehicle types and reduce the difference in tax treatment between vehicles that qualify and those that do not. 6.30 Problems with the option are: • There would still be some tax advantage between a vehicle that qualifies and one that does not, so there would still be an incentive to characterise a vehicle as complying with the requirements, which may be difficult to address. • More generally, the private benefits may be undervalued because a per- kilometre charge would measure actual use rather than availability for use. • Those employers that are currently exempt would be faced with paying FBT as well as the additional compliance costs from having to keep logbooks that measure the kilometres travelled by employees between their home and work. Option 4: Applying option 3 just to vehicles that do not meet the current “work- related vehicle” definition only because they are cars 6.31 This option would supplement rather than replace the work-related vehicle exemption by enabling vehicles that would meet the definition of work- related vehicle were they not excluded because they are motor cars, to qualify for a lower FBT impost based on a per-kilometre running cost. 6.32 An advantage of applying this approach to just the additional vehicles is that there would be no extra compliance costs for those that are currently exempt. Also, many employers who would be able to use the supplement are likely to have already established private use for their vehicles through keeping a log book for a trial period. In the case of the per-kilometre charge, however, actual use would need to be recorded on an ongoing basis. 38 6.33 This option would involve a revenue loss for the government. Moreover, behavioural and enforcement issues would still arise, given that there would be an increased incentive to characterise cars as meeting the new requirements, as FBT for those vehicles that qualify would be based on a per- kilometre running cost and actual private use rather than the full costs of motoring and availability for private use. Option 5: Applying a per-kilometre running charge to vehicles that currently meet the “work-related vehicle” definition 6.34 This option would involve no extension of coverage but would mean that the work-related vehicle exemption would be replaced by a charge per kilometre that reflected running costs. 6.35 The advantage of replacing the exemption with a charge per kilometre of private use would be that it reduces the tax effects at the margin between vehicles that do and do not qualify, thereby reducing the significance of where the definition boundary is drawn. Because it would not involve an extension of the definition, the behavioural change and enforcement issues would be less likely to be of concern than under option 3. 6.36 As with option 3, however, employers with work-related vehicles would still be faced with a new FBT liability and greater compliance costs. Logo requirement 6.37 We considered the merits of continuing to require the employer’s identifier on a work-related vehicle and concluded that the requirement should be generally retained. Its purpose is both to deter widespread private use and to help in monitoring that the definition is being adhered to. For this reason, the identifier needs to be permanently affixed to the vehicle. 6.38 It is proposed, however, that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue be given the discretion to waive the identifier requirement when an employer can demonstrate that the requirement would seriously compromise the nature of the business. Emergency call-outs 6.39 Another key exception that applies to motor vehicle fringe benefits is the exemption of those days on which emergency call-outs are made. The trigger for the exemption is that the vehicle leaves the employee’s home to make an emergency call (as defined). Any private use or enjoyment during that day is ignored. Unlike the definition of “work-related vehicle”, the definition of “emergency call” does not confine the private use or enjoyment to incidental benefits or travelling between home and work. 39 6.40 The definition is somewhat of a misnomer as it does not always require an emergency or breakdown situation to occur before it applies. “Emergency call” not only covers visits by emergency services such as the fire or ambulance services but also other visits such as those involving an employee carrying out services that are essential to the operation of any plant or machinery of the employer or their customer. 6.41 Several queries have been raised about various terms within the definition relative to the original policy intent. If the definition of “work-related vehicle” were broadened to include cars under one of the options discussed earlier in this chapter, revising or even removing the definition of “emergency call” would be considered. Otherwise the definition would not be changed. 40 Chapter 7 CAR PARKS Proposed change The private use and availability for private use of a car park would be included in the list of benefits that are subject to FBT, with the “on-premises” exemption for car parks being removed. Consequently, significantly more employee-provided car parks would be subject to FBT, irrespective of their legal form or whether they are on or off-premises. Various methods for valuing car parks are discussed, including a minimum value threshold under which using car parks would remain untaxed (see next chapter). Organisations such as schools and hospitals should not be affected by the change. Introduction 7.1 Car parks provided to employees that are situated within the employer’s place of work or leased to the employer are not subject to FBT as they fall within the exemption for benefits provided on the employer’s premises. A leased car park may, however, be far removed from the physical premises of the employer. In contrast, licensed car parks provided to an employee are subject to FBT even though they may be right alongside the leased parks. 7.2 Submissions noted that this distinction is arbitrary and generally recommended exempting all car parks to ensure consistent treatment. About two-thirds of employer-provided car parks are estimated to be exempt at present. 7.3 The government agrees that the distinction is arbitrary. Given that an employer-provided car park has an economic benefit to employees as it saves employees from having to pay for a park themselves, the government considers that FBT should apply to all employer-provided car parks that are available for private use, irrespective of legal form. This means excluding car parks from the current “on-premises” exemption. 7.4 This chapter discusses the policy rationale for the change and the next chapter discusses a range of options for valuing car parking benefits. Ideally, the benefits should be valued at the market value of equivalent car parks, but in some cases establishing the market value may be difficult. Under this approach, a sizeable number of parks would still not give rise to a benefit because, for example, comparable free parking would be available on the street. Also discussed is a minimum value threshold that might further limit the application of the proposed change. 41 Problems with the current law “On-premises” exemption 7.5 Car parks are included within the scope of the FBT rules through the catch- all provision in section CI 1(h), which incorporates “(a)ny benefit of any other kind... enjoyed by the employee”. 7.6 However, car parks that are located on the premises of the employer are exempt from FBT under section CI 1(q), which more generally exempts a wide range of benefits provided by employers on their premises. 18 Leases and licences 7.7 In 1999 Inland Revenue issued Public Ruling (BR Pub 99/6) on car park fringe benefits. In relation to car parks, the ruling defined the premises of the employer as being car parks that the employer enjoyed an exclusive right to occupy. 7.8 Following this interpretation, the “on-premises” exemption extends to car parks that are leased or rented by the employer. This is because a lease is considered to convey an exclusive right to occupy the property being leased as well as a legal interest in it and is, therefore, part of the employer’s premises. However, employers who hold a licence in relation to an employer-provided car park are liable for FBT on the basis that a licence does not provide an exclusive right of occupancy. Example • Employer A, who holds a licence to occupy a car park in a building next to its premises, is required to return FBT on the car park if it is provided to an employee. • Employer B, who leases a car park in a parking building five blocks away from the employer’s offices, is not required to return FBT on the car park because the employer has an exclusive right to occupy the park. That car park is treated as part of the employer’s premises, despite the car park’s geographical separation from the employer’s business activities. 7.9 In this example, the “on-premises” exemption results in different tax treatments according to the legal characterisation of the car park, despite the same benefit (not having to pay for private parking) being enjoyed by the employees in both situations. 18 All benefits other than the use or enjoyment of free, discounted or subsidised travel, accommodation, or clothing. 42 7.10 In principle, the legal rights enjoyed by the employer regarding the car park should not be relevant to whether a car park provided to an employee confers a private benefit on the employee. Business premises 7.11 Restricting the definition of the “premises of the employer” to locations on which the employer’s business is carried on would remove the lease/licence distinction. However, there is no policy rationale for exempting from the FBT rules car parks that are situated on the employer’s business premises. The location of the car park on the employer’s premises does not change the private benefit associated with the car park. 7.12 This approach would also cause uncertainty about what the employer’s business includes and how close to the business activities the car park would need to be to form part of the same premises. Minor benefits 7.13 The original intent of the “on-premises” exemption was to exclude minor benefits enjoyed on the employer’s premises that were generally costly to value and monitor relative to the FBT value of the benefits. The provision of alcohol at a company function that includes clients and some employees is an example of the type of minor benefits that were intended to be covered by the exemption. 7.14 In contrast, the value of car parks, at least those provided in urban centres, can be very high, as illustrated in table 2: Table 2: Regional variations in monthly car park charges Location (% weight)\* Park type (% weight)\* Approx cost $\* Adjusted regional cost $ Adjusted average cost $ Auckland (44) Reserved (17.5) 310 217 153 Daily (82.5) 200 140 Wellington (11) Reserved (31.0) 300 210 181 Daily (69.0) 240 168 Other North Island (29) Reserved (11.0) 80 40 76 Daily (89.0) 160 80 Christchurch (7) Reserved (12.0) 170 119 101 Daily (88.0) 140 98 Dunedin (2) Reserved (70.0) 80 56 73 Daily (30.0) 160 112 Other South Island (7) Reserved (12.0) 50 25 38 Daily (88.0) 80 40 \* Council data of central city parking charges. Location weightings are from a survey of firms. The adjusted regional cost is the approximate cost reduced by either 30% or 50% to reflect lower costs in suburban areas. The adjusted average regional cost is the adjusted regional cost weighted according to the proportion of reserved and daily parking. “Other North Island” daily charge is higher than the reserved parking charge because Hamilton has only a council charge for street parking. 43 Policy intent 7.15 When a car park is provided to an employee by an employer for private car parking the employee enjoys an economic benefit from not incurring car parking expenses that would have to be paid from salary or wages. 7.16 In most situations the nature of car parking benefits is determined by the nature of the travel that necessitates the car park. Generally, whenever an employee travels from home-to-work, or another location, the travel will be of a private nature, because the travel facilitates employment but is not the employment task itself. Hence, the use of an employee-provided car park is also private in nature. An exception to this general approach may be appropriate when the employee is an “itinerant” worker, such as a travelling salesperson. 7.17 In contrast, if a vehicle meets the definition of “work-related vehicle”, there should be no fringe benefit because both the vehicle and its parking during work hours are work-related. Such situations should be specifically exempted. Example 1 Bruce is a manager who drives his own car to work and is provided with a car park as part of his remuneration package. During business hours he is not required to use his car for business purposes. Example 2 Alison works for a company that makes curtains and blinds. She drives a van, which is a work-related vehicle, to and from work. She is allocated a car park by her employer because she is required to make frequent visits to customers during business hours. Example 3 Carol is a human resources adviser who lives close to and walks to and from work. Sometimes she is required to visit clients during business hours. At these times Carol uses the company car that is available to all staff for business purposes. The vehicle is normally parked on the company’s premises. 7.18 Of the three examples, only in example 1 could the car park be considered to remove the need for the employee to purchase car parking facilities during business hours. Only in that instance should FBT be payable. In example 2 the employee does not have any vehicle that is available for private use once it is at work as it is a work vehicle. 44 7.19 In example 3 the employee receives no private benefit as she does not require a car park for private travel, not even between home and work. The vehicle is solely for business purposes. FBT is not relevant. Home as a work base 7.20 Car parks located at an employee’s private residence when the residence is also a place of work would not be covered by the FBT rules because the car parks would not generally be provided by the employer. If the residence were owned by a company that employed the occupier of the residence, any rental paid by the occupier would normally include the parking. To the extent that the employer subsidised the rent, the benefit would be treated as monetary remuneration rather than subject to FBT. Availability for use 7.21 In addition to the actual use of a car park, the availability of a car park is an advantage to an employee. Irrespective of whether or not an employee chooses to use the car park on any given day, the ability to use the car park whenever it is needed is a benefit enjoyed by the employee. Although car parks are treated as the provision of a service under section CI 3(10), arguably a car park is an asset and, as noted earlier, assets should, in theory, be valued according to their availability. 7.22 Compliance costs would increase significantly if employers were required to determine the exact extent to which a car park was privately used. This would involve monitoring employees’ actual use of employer-provided car parks and the cost of each car park for each period of actual use. It would also be inconsistent with the way that many car park charges are structured, given that they are usually payable on a monthly basis and provide for 24- hour use. 7.23 In practice, there may not be a significant difference between valuing a car park on the basis of actual use versus its availability, given that in many cases an employee may not place much value on a car park being available overnight if there is little or no need to use it outside work hours. Any relatively lower demand for car parking outside of work hours would normally be reflected in car park charges. Other issues 7.24 The government considers that there may be a case for excluding car parks provided to employees of entities such as hospitals and schools that are required to operate in central business districts and other affected areas to serve the needs of the community in those areas. 19 The government welcomes submissions on how best to address this issue. 19 Some of these entities, as charities, may be exempt from FBT anyway, as discussed in chapter 10. 45 Proposal 7.25 The government proposes to include, as a listed fringe benefit, employer- provided car parks that are used for private purposes or available for the private use of an employee. 7.26 Car parks would, therefore, be specifically excluded from the “on-premises” exemption. 46 Chapter 8 VALUATION OF CAR PARKS Background 8.1 If a car park were valued on the basis of its actual benefit to the employee the value would be the amount that the employee was willing to pay to have the use of the car park whenever it was needed. This amount would include the cost of having the car park available so that it could be used when it was needed. 8.2 In practice, it would be difficult to ascertain accurately the value that each employee places on the benefit as the circumstances of each employee will vary. Even if it were possible to arrive at an accurate valuation, the compliance costs involved in correctly valuing, monitoring and recording the benefit to each employee would be extremely high. 8.3 As with other parts of the FBT rules, therefore, the current valuation rules were intended to be a compromise between accuracy and simplicity, to prevent high compliance costs relative to the tax returned. 8.4 Under section CI 3(10), 20 the value of a fringe benefit that involves the provision of a car park is: • the open market value if the employer is normally providing car parking as part of the business; or • the amount paid or liable to be paid by the employer if the employer is not in the car parking business; • the open market value if neither (a) nor (b) apply. 8.5 In practice, the application of these rules is limited, given the “on-premises” exemption and the interpretation that it includes leased car parks. However, with the proposed removal of the “on-premises” exemption for car parks, the application of the rules needs to be reviewed. The cost to the employer 8.6 As noted earlier, the cost of an employer-provided car park can be a reasonable estimate of the private benefit enjoyed by the employee when the car park is leased or licensed to the employer at market value. In other circumstances, this valuation method can be complex and lead to incorrect outcomes. 20 Section CI 3(10) determines the value of fringe benefits that involve a service. 47 Example 1 The car park is leased to the employer from a car parking company at market value. Example 2 The car park is owned by the employer, who purchased it some years ago. Example 3 The car park is leased to the employer as part of the employer’s business premises but has no specific value assigned to it under the lease. 8.7 In example 1 the cost to the employer approximates the cost to the employee as this is the price the employee would have had to pay for the car park if it were not provided by the employer. 8.8 In example 2 difficulties arise from the different benefits enjoyed by the employer and employee in relation to the car park. The original cost of the car park represents the historic value to the employer rather than the current value. Unless the employer’s opportunity cost 21 is used, cost may bear no relationship to the value of ongoing use or availability of the car park enjoyed by the employee. 8.9 In example 3 the car park has a current value, but because the car park is not separately priced in the contract, as it is attached to the location of the actual business premises, it may be difficult to identify the cost attributable to providing the car park. Market value to the employee 8.10 Except when the car park is leased or licensed to the employer at market value, the value of the fringe benefit is best based on identifying the cost of the alternative parking that the employee would have had to obtain if the employer had not provided the car park. (In this document this is described as an alternative market value.) In areas where free or inexpensive alternative car parking is available, FBT on the employer-provided car park would be nil or very low. The value of car parking fringe benefits would be higher in areas where car parking is more expensive. 21 For example, what employers could receive if car parks were let out to the public. 48 Example 1 A car park is provided to an employee at an inner city business. The price of parking on the street outside the business is $1 per hour between 8am and 6pm on weekdays. Outside those hours there is no charge for the car park. The market value of the car park provided to the employee is $1 x 10 hours x 5 days, or $50 per week. Example 2 A car park is provided to an employee located in a rural area. Visitors to the business generally park along the road in front of the business. There is no charge for parking along the roadside. The market value of the car park in this example is nil. What is an equivalent car park? 8.11 A key part of applying the market value rule involves determining what is an equivalent car park. An equivalent car park would provide identical or similar benefits to the employer-provided car park. 8.12 The market value of an equivalent car park would be readily ascertainable when an identical car park is available to the general public, particularly if it is provided by the employer. For example, a business may contract a parking company to manage visitors’ car parks, which staff may also be able to use free of charge. 8.13 The market value is more difficult to ascertain when a range of similar but not identical car parking options is available at different prices. 22 In this situation it is reasonable to assume that the employee would use the lowest cost equivalent alternative. The value of the fringe benefit should, therefore, be equal to the least expensive equivalent park. 8.14 Generally, an equivalent car park would: • be available to the general public for the same period of time as the employer-provided car park; and • provide the same or similar level of assurance of available car parking; and • be located in the same or similar vicinity as the employer-provided car park. 22 For example, off-street parking on a weekly basis and on-street parking on an hourly basis. 49 Options for applying the market value rule 8.15 In the absence of a third party, market-based charge to the employer, an alternative market value rule is the best approximation of the cost to the employee. There is a range of options, however, for applying the rule that should assist in reducing compliance costs. The government invites feedback on which of these options would achieve the best balance between the appropriate policy outcome and the need to minimise costs. Option 1 Use the market rate of the equivalent car park within a specified radius (say, 0.5km) of the employer-provided car park This option aims for reasonable precision as to the location of equivalent car parks. The assumption is that equivalent surrounding car parks will have a relatively uniform value. If there were no equivalent car park within the specified radius, the closest comparable park would have to be used. The onus would be on the employer to provide corroborating evidence. To reduce compliance costs, the identified value could be valid for a specified period of time – for example, five years. This period of time, although essentially arbitrary, would provide certainty for the employer while retaining a reasonably current approximation of the value of the car park. To further reduce compliance costs, this approach could be applied just to the central business districts (CBD), or comparable council zoning, so that if a car park were outside of the CBD it would not be subject to FBT. At the margin, however, this would mean that FBT would be payable on car parks on one particular street but not the neighbouring street. Option 2 Use local council or similar charges for equivalent car parks This option would provide a specific benchmark that may be less open to argument than having reference to all possible equivalent car parks. It should, however, link to the closest equivalent car park as council charges can vary across a city. It would mean that valuations would be subject to the policies of councils; for example, a council may introduce a particular pricing policy that is not necessarily reflective of market rates. Also, in some areas, councils may not provide equivalent car parks. Again, this option could be limited to car parks in CBDs. 50 Option 3 Apply standard values that reflect regional differences This option would save employers having to identify equivalent car parks and market rates. The use of standard values to reduce compliance costs is used elsewhere in the tax legislation. Periodic surveys – say, every five years – could be undertaken to establish regional values, and local authority zoning could be used to specify the CBD or commercial areas that would be covered. One rate for New Zealand would considerably simplify the application but would be inequitable as car park charges vary significantly from region to region (see table 2). A variant would be to apply the standard rate just to the main centres such as the Auckland and Wellington CBDs. Although this option seems simple, it does raise boundary issues. To reduce the incentive for car parking to be developed just outside of the zone, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue could be given discretion to set and alter the area covered for tax purposes. Option 4 Apply a set value related to the value of the land on which the car park is sited This option would overcome regional boundary problems and result in a valuation that reflected the circumstance of each car park. But it would be relatively complicated to apply and would require some work on the part of the employer, plus the possible costs of any valuation. It would involve taking the rateable land value, assuming the car park is a vacant lot, and determining the value per square metre by dividing the valuation by the number of square metres. The square metres would then be linked to a set value for FBT purposes. Option 5 Combination of the four preceding options If the employer is charging third parties for equivalent car parks or is paying a third party for the use of car parks, this could be the value attributed for FBT purposes. Otherwise, a standard regional value would apply. 51 A minimum threshold 8.16 Regardless of any other limitations, such as specifically limiting the benefit to CBD areas, a minimum threshold could be set per park to exclude small benefits. This would in itself exclude many car parks outside of the main centres – for example, the average value of a car park in the South Island outside of Christchurch and Dunedin is $38 per month. 8.17 Employers would have reasonable certainty about whether a benefit was likely to arise as the annual value of most car park benefits would be known in advance and so could be compared against the minimum threshold. But with those cases near the threshold, employers would have to keep track of benefits to ensure they did not exceed the threshold. 8.18 The government also welcomes submissions as to how a rule of this nature can best be implemented. 52 Chapter 9 MULTI-RATE CALCULATION Proposed changes • Employers who file their fringe benefit returns on-line with Inland Revenue would have access to an on-line electronic calculator that would undertake the end-of-year multi-rate calculation for them. Employers would not be subject to penalties if they filed returns electronically and the calculations produced a wrong answer, provided they had supplied correct information. They would be subject to use-of-money interest. • Other simplification options are to replace the FBT multi-rate calculation with a simpler calculation, or apply a single rate (54%) that produces the same overall revenue outcome. • Employers who cease to employ staff and do not intend to replace them would have the option of applying the flat rate of 64% in their final return rather than doing the multi-rate calculation. Introduction 9.1 Since its introduction, FBT has been criticised for the complexity of its calculations. The recent introduction of the multi-rate calculations has increased these concerns, which have been reflected both in the consultation with businesses and in the research undertaken. 23 9.2 The FBT multi-rate system was introduced in April 2000 in response to the increase in the top personal tax rate to 39%, which raised the FBT rate to 64%. By better reflecting employees’ personal marginal tax rates, the multi- rate calculation is intended to increase the accuracy of the tax system. This is done by reducing the rate of FBT applying to those who earn less than $60,000, while removing any incentive for high-income employees to substitute fringe benefits for monetary remuneration to avoid the 39% tax rate. Hence there are good conceptual reasons for retaining the multi-rate. The government recognises, however, that these gains have been at the expense of simplification and, accordingly, has been considering ways in which the rules could be made less complex. 23 See appendix. 53 How the multi-rate calculation works 9.3 Employers may file FBT returns quarterly, 24 annually or on an income year basis. Employers can file returns on an annual or income year basis only if their PAYE and specified superannuation contribution withholding tax deductions are less than $100,000 a year. 9.4 In general terms, employers that file quarterly FBT returns can either: • pay FBT on all fringe benefits at the rate of 64% for the full year, in which case their use of the multi-rate calculation in the fourth quarter is optional; or • pay FBT at 49% for the first three quarters and undertake the multi-rate calculation in the fourth quarter. 9.5 Employers paying on an annual or income year basis similarly have the choice of paying 64% on all fringe benefits or applying the multi-rate calculation. 9.6 The rules vary, depending on whether the benefits can be attributed to individual employees or have to be pooled as non-attributed benefits, the type of benefits and whether the employees are also major shareholders in the business. Special rules apply if insufficient information is available to undertake the multi-rate calculation at the time of filing the fourth quarter return. 9.7 Specifically, employers undertaking the multi-rate calculation must: • determine the value of fringe benefits provided to each employee for the year; • determine each employee’s cash remuneration for the year; • calculate the tax on that cash remuneration and determine the net cash remuneration; • add the value of the attributed fringe benefits to the net cash remuneration for each employee to determine his or her fringe benefit- inclusive cash remuneration; and • calculate the tax on the fringe benefit-inclusive cash remuneration. 9.8 The FBT liability is the difference between the tax on the fringe benefit- inclusive cash remuneration and the tax on cash remuneration. The FBT already paid during the year is deducted from this amount to get the final FBT that is payable or refundable. 24 On the 20 th of July, October and January, with the final quarter due on 31 May. 54 Problems associated with the calculation 9.9 The multi-rate calculation provides an accurate assessment of an employer’s FBT liability. However, it also increases the complexity and, therefore, compliance costs faced by employers because it requires additional calculations and the use of tax rates and thresholds specific to the calculation, instead of using the ordinary marginal tax rate scale. 9.10 This complexity increases the likelihood of errors, which in turn exposes employers to a higher risk of penalties and use-of-money interest. The high compliance costs associated with the calculations may also result in increased non-compliance. Proposal 9.11 Advances in information technology make it possible to reconsider how FBT calculations are performed, who performs them, and where the responsibilities for each part of the process should lie. Specifically, the government proposes that Inland Revenue provide an on-line FBT calculator for optional use by employers who file their returns electronically. 25 Under this approach, employers could supply all the information required and the calculator would do the FBT calculations for them, as well as the multi-rate calculation at the end of the year. The calculation would become the basis of their FBT return. This would reduce compliance costs and give users results they could rely upon to be correct provided the information they supplied was correct. 9.12 This would be a complex system for Inland Revenue to design and deliver, so the application date of this proposal, if implemented, would depend on the changes required to Inland Revenue’s systems and procedures. The earliest likely application date would probably be 1 April 2006. How the proposal would work 9.13 Employers who filed quarterly would pay their FBT liability each quarter based on the current 49% or 64% rates. Each quarter they would also supply additional information electronically, to enable their current quarterly FBT liability to be determined and to carry out their end-of-year multi-rate calculation. At the end of the year they would be able to access the information previously provided to Inland Revenue and then would have to enter their employees’ cash remuneration for the year. The FBT multi-rate calculation would be carried out by the calculator. If the employer was satisfied with the information provided, the resulting FBT calculations would form the final quarter’s return and the amount due would become the 25 A survey undertaken by Inland Revenue suggested reasonable support among employers for this type of option. 55 employer’s FBT assessment. Payment of the amount due would be required by the due date and could be made either electronically or manually. 9.14 Income year or annual filers would supply information at the end of the year or annually, and the calculator would perform the multi-rate calculation annually. 9.15 This proposal would not change the self-assessment system on which New Zealand’s tax system is based, since the fundamental determination of the facts and the application of tax law to their own circumstances would remain with the taxpayer. Penalties could be imposed if taxpayers applied those laws incorrectly. 9.16 If, however, there were an error in the FBT assessed and it was attributable to an incorrect calculation, it would be the responsibility of Inland Revenue, not the employer. In that case, shortfall penalties would not be imposed on the employer. If the employer had, as a result of such an error, underpaid tax a new due date for payment would be set. Although no penalties would apply, use-of-money interest would. If there were an error in the FBT assessment attributable to incorrect information provided by the employer, it would be the responsibility of the employer. The normal penalty rules and use-of- money interest would apply to such errors. 9.17 Although the proposal should reduce errors in final computation, there might still be errors in the underlying data which employers would want to correct. A simple way to achieve this would be to allow the information to be updated in the following quarter, with the employer having a mechanism to indicate which quarter the correction relates to. Information required 9.18 Employers using the calculator would be required to supply certain general information in relation to their employees. Specific information would also be required for each class of fringe benefit, to enable the FBT liability to be determined. The information requirements and the frequency of provision are shown in table 3. 56 Table 3: Provision of information by quarterly FBT filers under the proposed system 26 Information Frequency of provision Employee-specific information Employee’s name Only when the employer starts to provide benefit An FBT rate election (49%, 64%, or whether shareholder employee) Annually Employee’s remuneration Annually Vehicle Vehicle identifier Once/only when vehicle changes Cost of the vehicle Once/only when vehicle changes Number of days available for private use Quarterly Employee contribution Quarterly Low-interest loans Year the loan was granted (if non-reviewable) Once Highest interest rate applying to loan for month Quarterly Lowest loan balance in period Quarterly Discounted goods/services Value of discounted goods Quarterly Value of subsidised transport Quarterly Value of employer contributions to fund Quarterly Employee contribution towards cost of fringe benefit Quarterly Example of how the electronic calculator would be used An employer provides a motor vehicle to a new employee. The employee’s income exceeds $60,000 and the employer decides to pay fringe benefit tax each quarter based on the 49% rate. The employer will provide to Inland Revenue, on the first FBT return, the employee’s name, the FBT rate chosen, the vehicle identifier, and the cost of the vehicle. This information will be required only once, unless circumstances change. Each quarter, the employer will also supply the calculator with the number of days the car was available for private use and the amount of any contributions the employee makes. The information would be retained in the calculator, along with other information provided on the employer monthly schedule and used at the end of the year to undertake the end-of-year square-up. The employer would be able to access the information on-line, confirm it and deduct the FBT paid during the year and pay any remaining FBT by the due date. 26 Based on current FBT requirements. 57 Low-interest loans 9.19 At present, the calculation of the FBT liability on low-interest loans for a given period requires an employer to determine the daily loan balance during the period. This imposes compliance costs on the employer, who must keep and undertake calculations. To simplify the amount of information that has to be supplied to the calculator, it is proposed that the employer provide the lowest loan balance for the period to Inland Revenue. This is likely to be the latest loan balance. 9.20 When another fringe benefit is provided to an employee or an employee begins to receive a fringe benefit, the information would be supplied when the employer makes the next quarter’s FBT payment. Benefits and risks of the proposal 9.21 The proposal’s principal benefits lie in reducing employers’ risks of making calculation errors, their spending less time on revising numbers, a reduced likelihood of penalties being applied, and a probable reduction in stress. 9.22 Since the FBT multi-rate system has been introduced relatively recently, some of the concerns about its compliance costs may reflect the transition to the new rules rather than permanent compliance costs. Therefore the expected benefit of the proposal may be less than anticipated. 9.23 Although there could be a reduction in compliance costs associated with the calculations, there would be an increase in compliance costs in providing information more frequently, even though the process had been simplified. Other options Use employee’s top marginal tax rate instead 9.24 An alternative proposal is to simplify the FBT calculation and thereby do away with the multi-rate calculation. The proposal would replace the multi- rate calculation and tax the fringe benefit at the FBT equivalent rate of each employee’s top marginal tax rate. The calculation would involve: • determining the fringe benefits provided to each employee for the quarter; • determining the employee’s likely gross cash remuneration for the year; • determining the highest marginal tax rate that applies to the cash remuneration of the employee; and • taxing the fringe benefit at the FBT rate equivalent to the employee’s highest marginal tax rate. 58 9.25 This calculation would be undertaken each quarter by the employer. Simplifying the calculation could enable the FBT calculation to be a full and final payment of the employer’s liability. 9.26 This alternative proposal would reduce compliance costs for employers, especially those who do not have access to on-line or computerised FBT calculation tools. The calculation would be less accurate, however, and might increase an employer’s FBT liability. 9.27 The government would also need to introduce anti-avoidance measures to ensure that there was no additional incentive to provide remuneration in the form of fringe benefits when an employee’s marginal tax rate was less than the top rate. A single average rate 9.28 Many submissions advocated a return to a single rate system as one of their most preferred simplification measures. Generally, submissions advocated a rate below 64% to ensure that low and middle-income earners would not be disadvantaged. The government considers that there are strong conceptual reasons for retaining some form of multi-rate and notes that employers have the option of using the single rate of 64% for all fringe benefits. As a possible alternative means of simplification it seeks comment on whether a flat rate that produces the same overall revenue as at present would be preferred to the other options raised here. That rate would be around 54%. This approach would trade off accuracy for simplicity, while achieving the same overall revenue result. Ceasing to employ staff 9.29 Employers who cease to employ staff and do not intend to replace them during the year are still required to undertake the multi-rate calculation in their final return. It is proposed to reduce compliance costs by amending section ND 8(1) so that employers also have the option of applying the flat rate of 64% in their final return. 59 Chapter 10 THE EXEMPTION FOR CHARITIES Proposed changes • The current exemption that charities have from FBT would be retained. • An anti-avoidance rule is proposed, to close off possible opportunities for the exemption to be exploited by charities providing employees with credit cards as a significant proportion of their remuneration. Background 10.1 Benefits provided to employees of charitable organisations are exempt from FBT, other than when they are employed in businesses carried on by charities. This exemption has been in the FBT rules since 1985, although it was removed for a brief period in 1990. 10.2 The government discussion document Tax and Charities, issued in June 2001, proposed that the FBT exemption for charities be removed on the basis that, in principle, employees of charities should be treated in the same way as other employees. A similar recommendation had been made by the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance in its December 1998 report. Most of the submissions received in response to the discussion document, many of which were from charities, opposed the abolition of the exemption on various grounds, including compliance costs. As a result, the issue, including whether it would be feasible to limit the exemption, was referred for consideration in the wider context of this review. 10.3 There was a divided response from those who provided comments for the purposes of this review as to whether the exemption should be retained. Some commented that the FBT review needed to reconsider the application of the exemption as they considered that it applied inequitably – universities, for example, must pay FBT, while polytechnics and other tertiary institutions may be exempt. Some also considered that it was unfair to exempt charities but not other local or public bodies that performed a similar function. Charities reiterated their earlier arguments against removing the exemption, that: • having to pay FBT would reduce the amount of funds they have available for charitable purposes; 60 • employees of charities are paid less than market salaries, and fringe benefits partly redress this; • the compliance costs would be particularly severe on small charities, which do not have the resources to pay a tax accountant to calculate any FBT liability; and • bigger charities may undertake less efficient practices in order to reduce their FBT liability. 10.4 It would appear that while, like other employers, charities may offer their staff a wide range of fringe benefits, the main form of fringe benefit is motor vehicles. Policy arguments 10.5 FBT relates to income earned by the employee rather than the income of the employer, even though the tax is paid by the employer. The current FBT exemption for charities, therefore, advantages employees of charities because they pay less tax than other employees on the same total remuneration. 10.6 There is no tax policy reason why one set of employees should be treated differently from any other purely because of who they work for or because the remuneration is paid in kind. Given that the true value of the benefit normally accrues to the employee rather than the employer, the fact that the employer is exempt from income tax is not a relevant consideration. The contrast is more obvious when it is considered that employees of charities are taxed on their cash remuneration through the PAYE system in the same way as other employees. 10.7 Apart from equity issues, the main concern with any FBT exemption is the flow-on distortions that are created from having some form of remuneration that is not taxable. For example, the exemption provides an incentive for further fringe benefits to be substituted for cash remuneration, increasing the relative tax advantage. Compliance costs 10.8 Although removing the exemption for charities would remove any distortions that the exemption creates, it would increase compliance costs for charities. Charities would have to pay tax on benefits, which could mean higher costs or lower cash payments to employees. Alternatively, charities might decide to alter the relative value of fringe benefits and instead pay more cash, to reduce compliance costs. 61 Possible limitations 10.9 Consideration was given to various options for limiting the exemption, some of which are outlined below. The government’s conclusion was that the limitations in these options would be either too narrow or too wide to be meaningful or effective. Furthermore, any limitation, such as apportionment between charitable and private use, would likely result in more compliance costs than if the exemption was either retained or removed in full. Examples of possible limitations and their problems Example 1 One option would be to limit the exemption to vehicle-related benefits provided the vehicles are available for charitable purposes at all times. This would remove any small private benefits that might arise when a vehicle is provided to carry out charitable purposes. It would go beyond the current exemptions for incidental benefits, emergency calls, or work-related vehicles. But, in fact, it would not preclude wide private use because a vehicle could still be concurrently available for charitable purposes, and the exemption would, therefore, be very broad in its application. Example 2 A limit could be related directly to the employee’s circumstances. An exemption may be more justified, for example, when the person’s only remuneration is to cover necessities, such remuneration being exempt from income tax. Arguably, the provision of a fringe benefit is neither a deciding factor in determining employment decisions nor a substitute for cash remuneration in such cases. An example would be those who join certain religious orders. But such an exemption would be extremely narrow. Example 3 Options that would allow more private use of motor vehicles would likely focus on maintaining records of actual use. To avoid the significant compliance costs arising from having to keeping logbooks, or otherwise having to apportion business and private use, the fringe benefit could be a set percentage – say, 50 percent – of the usual value. But there would be no sound basis on which to base any such percentage. Other issues 10.10 A number of other issues were also considered in determining the FBT treatment of charities: • Many charities do not provide fringe benefits and would, therefore, not be affected by whether the exemption was removed or retained. 27 27 In a survey conducted by Watson Wyatt, Remuneration Report for the Voluntary Welfare Sector (April 2001), more than half the participants did not provide fringe benefits to employees. 62 • Even without the exemption, many of the fringe benefits provided by charities might not be subject to FBT. Charities would need to be sufficiently large to have employees (rather than volunteers) and have systems that are capable of making source deduction payments. They would not have to pay FBT on incidental private benefits on vehicles available for emergency calls, or on work-related vehicles. The government’s proposed changes, particularly those in relation to the valuation of motor vehicles, low-interest loans and increasing the minimum thresholds would, in many instances, further reduce any FBT liability. • More importantly, at present, little information is available on the value of current benefits, so that neither the impact on the sector of removing the exemption nor how it fits within the government’s assistance to the sector can be determined. 28 Leading conclusion from review 10.11 The government’s view, after weighing up the various factors, is that the exemption for employees of charitable organisations should be retained. But given the policy reasons that militate against the exemption, the government is not in favour of extending it to other groups that may be similar but who are not charities. Although this may give rise to distortions, any extension would likely lead to greater distortions, as well as erode the tax base. Possible anti-avoidance rule 10.12 Although the government has decided to retain the exemption, it is concerned to minimise the potential for the exemption to be exploited by providing a significant proportion of employees’ remuneration in the form of fringe benefits. This is more likely the more readily substitutable a benefit is for cash. Credit cards are perhaps the closest cash substitute as a wide range of goods and services can be purchased with them. 10.13 There has been some suggestion that credit cards are being used to provide significant untaxed fringe benefits to some employees of charities. The government considers this to be inconsistent with its policy objectives and wishes to close off such opportunities. This will be achieved either through including a specific anti-avoidance rule targeted at credit cards and other short-term credit facilities or by specifically excluding such activities from the exemption. 28 One of the benefits from the proposed registration and reporting system for charities should be a better indication of the aggregate value of the government’s various forms of assistance to the sector. 63 Tertiary institutions and FBT 10.14 Some submissions were concerned that universities are subject to FBT, on the basis that they are specifically excluded from the definition of “charitable organisation”, while other tertiary institutions may not be. The government has set out its reasons for not altering the current exemption but it is worth noting that there is some debate over whether polytechnics, colleges of education and wananga are subject to FBT. Public authorities are subject to FBT and one argument is that at least some of these tertiary institutions are public authorities. 64 Chapter 11 LOANS TO EMPLOYEES Proposed changes • The benefit received from loans would be valued with reference to either the prescribed rate of interest or a publicly available market rate. Employers would elect which method to use, and that election would be binding for five years and apply to all their loans to employees. • “Publicly available market rate” would be defined to include discounted rates available to employees other than by reason of their employment. Current rules 11.1 FBT applies when an employer provides a loan to an employee. An employee loan would also be subject to FBT if the employer has entered into an arrangement for the loan to be provided by a third party. 11.2 The value of a fringe benefit arising from an employee loan is the amount by which interest calculated according to the FBT prescribed rate of interest exceeds actual interest paid. The prescribed rate generally differs from the lowest publicly available market rate. The prescribed rate of interest 11.3 The FBT prescribed rate of interest is set by Order in Council and is reviewed before the start of each quarter. In order to allow for the various reporting requirements and the actual making of the regulations, the new rate must be determined two months before the start of the new quarter. The rate can, therefore, be out of date before the new quarter begins, as well as during the quarter itself. 11.4 The prescribed rate is based on the weighted average of first home mortgage interest rates for eight major providers of housing finance, using each institution’s total lending outstanding for housing purposes. For the quarter beginning on 1 October 2003, the prescribed rate is 7.08%. 11.5 This method of setting the prescribed rate generally results in the rate being higher or lower than the lowest market rate by the time the rate is applied. This difference may fluctuate during the quarter, given that market rates can move while the prescribed rate is fixed. The prescribed rate may also be less than the actual market rate if the security for the loan is not a house. Credit card loans, for example, are unsecured and carry a commensurately higher interest rate. 65 Policy rationale 11.6 The value of the benefit of an employer-provided loan to an employee is the difference between the interest rate of that loan and the lowest market interest rate that would otherwise be available to the employee. 11.7 If the prescribed rate of interest is higher than the market rate of interest the FBT rules overtax the benefit of the loan, but if the prescribed rate is lower than the market rate, the fringe benefit is undervalued. The prescribed rate will be higher than the lowest available market rate when interest rates are declining, as they have been over the past few years. The fringe benefit from employee loans will be undervalued when market interest rates start increasing. 11.8 In this context, the prescribed rate of interest method for valuing employee loans is a compromise between accuracy and compliance costs. It was designed to approximate market rates while saving employers the cost of having to track market rates. These costs could be significant for many employers. Accordingly, employers should be able to continue to use the prescribed rate to value employee loans if they wish. 11.9 On the other hand, employers who have sufficient information to make a more accurate calculation of the benefit of the loan according to market interest rates should be able to do so. 11.10 To reflect the benefit to the employee accurately, the value of the fringe benefit would need to be calculated with reference to a market rate that would be available for the type and length of loan that the employee had received from the employer. Example An employer lends employee A $10,000, unsecured, at 5% over five years to buy a vehicle. The lowest publicly available unsecured personal loan rate is 10%. An employer lends employee B $10,000 for a house deposit. The loan is secured against the house and set at 5% over five years. The lowest publicly available fixed five-year interest rate is 6.5%. The prescribed rate of interest at the time is 7.5%. The benefit of the employer-provided loan to employee A is much larger than the benefit to employee B in this example as employee A would have had to pay a higher interest rate than employee B if the employer had not provided the loans. Accordingly, if the employer had elected to value the loans according to the difference between the market rates and the actual rates applied, the FBT on employee A’s loan would be much higher than the FBT on employee B’s loan. However, the difference between the prescribed rate and the actual interest rate applied to both the employee loans is 2.5%. The employer would be able to use this rate when calculating FBT on the loans. The prescribed rate would undervalue the loan to employee A and overvalue employee B’s loan. 66 Proposal 11.11 The government proposes that employers be able to elect to value employee loans for FBT purposes according to the difference between the rate charged on the loan and either the prescribed rate of interest or a relevant publicly available market rate. 11.12 Providing for two methods allows employers to strike the balance between accuracy and compliance cost in the way that best suits their particular business. However, there would need to be legislative guidelines on making an election, to prevent employers changing the valuation method each quarter according to which method resulted in the lowest FBT. The election should apply for five years and cover all loans to employees. “Publicly available” interest rates 11.13 Generally, the publicly available rate would be a carded rate offered by a member of the New Zealand Banker’s Association. This restriction would limit the potential for interest rates that are used to defeat the FBT rules. 11.14 Sometimes, however, special reduced rates are offered to particular groups. If an employee would qualify for a special reduced interest rate for reasons other than his or her employment, no private benefit would arise from an employer-provided loan at that rate. 11.15 On the other hand, when the reduced rate applies to a class to which the employee does not belong, FBT would apply if the employer provided a loan to the employee at that rate. Clearly, in this situation the employee receives a benefit that he or she would not have received if the employer had not provided the loan. Example An employer is a financial institution that is promoting a special interest rate for members of the local tennis club. Employee A is a member of the local tennis club but employee B is not. No FBT would arise if the employer offered a loan to employee A at the special interest rate because employee A qualifies for the discount by being a tennis club member. If the employer provided employee B with a loan at the special interest rate, FBT would be triggered because the special interest rate is a private benefit arising out of the employment situation. 67 Comparable to valuation of discounted or free goods and services 11.16 This proposed approach is consistent with the general valuation rules applicable to discounted goods and services that are also provided by the employer to the public. 11.17 Goods that are manufactured, produced or processed by the employer are valued at the price charged for identical goods to arm’s length purchasers. Services provided by the employer’s business must be valued at the price charged to the general public. Proposal 11.18 The government proposes that “publicly available market rates” be defined to include reduced interest rates that would be available to employees other than by reason of their employment. 68 Chapter 12 LOW-VALUE BENEFITS Proposed changes • The employee-related threshold for minor fringe benefits would be raised from $75 to $200 per quarter. • The employer-related threshold would be raised from $450 to $2000 per quarter. • Benefits that arise in relation to employer health and safety obligations would be exempt from FBT. 12.1 The catch-all provision in section CI 1 (h) applies FBT to all unspecified private benefits derived by an employee from his or her employment, subject to a few exceptions. The main general exceptions relevant to unclassified benefits are: • benefits provided on the employer’s premises; • benefits that remove the need for the payment of an allowance if that allowance would have been exempt income under section CB 12 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (reimbursement of expenditure on account of an employee); and • minor unclassified benefits totalling $75 or less, per quarter, per employee, provided all such benefits provided by an employer to all employees does not exceed $450 per quarter. (Annual and Income year filers have corresponding thresholds.) Reason for catch-all provision 12.2 Some submissions have argued that this catch-all approach has extended the FBT rules beyond the scope of remuneration by including all private benefits arising from employment. 12.3 Generally, a taxable fringe benefit arises when there is a clear nexus between the provision of labour by the employee and a benefit provided as compensation. This may come in the form of an employee accepting a lower salary on the condition that a car, for example, is made available to the employee for private use. A taxable fringe benefit also arises when an employee’s salary is supplemented, such as when an employee receives vouchers. 69 12.4 The FBT rules should cover both these circumstances. However, the rules arguably extend beyond these to tax any private benefit arising from employment, regardless of whether it is in the nature of remuneration. The example of flowers given to an employee upon the death of a relative has been cited as a common instance when a private benefit may arise from employment but does not have the nature of remuneration. 12.5 In addition, the catch-all provision imposes significant compliance cost on employers as it requires the recording and monitoring of all benefits. Specific exemption of employer health and safety-related benefits 12.6 Benefits that might arise as a result of an employer meeting health and safety obligations can fall within the scope of FBT. Such benefits include free vaccinations, subsidised health checks and counselling services. The FBT treatment of these benefits depends on the location of their provision. If this occurs on the premises of the employer, the benefit will be exempt. This treatment is appropriate since the on-premises exemption was introduced to reduce compliance costs stemming from valuing a myriad of small benefits which are available to employees on their employer’s premises. 12.7 If, however, the vaccination, counselling or health check is performed away from the employer’s premises, FBT applies. Policy rationale 12.8 There seems to be no good policy rationale for exempting these activities on the basis of location, given that any benefit that arises would be the same whether performed at the employer’s premises or at the doctor’s surgery, or elsewhere. In this instance the exemption only creates an arbitrary division between taxable and non-taxable fringe benefits of the same type. 12.9 Furthermore, difficulties with valuation is not a rationale for the current exemption. Vaccinations, health checks, and counselling are all available to the general public and can be valued at the open market value. 12.10 In principle, the fact that a fringe benefit may also benefit the employer or society in general should not mean that tax should not be charged on the benefit to the employee if it is in the nature of remuneration. The link to remuneration, however, is more difficult to establish in the case of these types of benefits. Would employees have purchased the benefit themselves had the employer not provided it? If not, then it is difficult to argue that the employees have been saved a cost that they would otherwise have incurred out of their remuneration. 70 Proposal 12.11 The specific exemptions from FBT would be extended to cover such items as flu injections and eye tests on the basis of their being part of employer health and safety obligations. Those obligations may arise from the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992 or the State Sector Act 1988. 12.12 This proposal would not extend to a more general exemption of employer- paid health insurance premiums or childcare facilities, where the employee can be regarded as clearly receiving a subsidy from the employer for activities for which the employee would normally bear a cost. Minor unspecified benefits 12.13 Section CI 5 creates an exemption from FBT for unspecified benefits when the aggregate taxable value of those benefits provided to the employee during the quarter amounts to $75 or less, and the aggregate taxable value of all benefits provided by the employer to all employees during the quarter does not exceed $450. 12.14 The provisions were intended to act as a buffer, excluding small benefits that are not in the nature of remuneration and benefits that are so low in value that the cost of paying FBT on them is unreasonably high relative to the value of the benefit. 12.15 The provisions have not been adjusted for over ten years 29 and are now generally seen as too low for the current commercial climate. In particular, the $450 cap for all benefits provided to employees is seen as disadvantaging larger employers. 12.16 Many submissions on the issues for inclusion in the FBT review advocated an increase in the threshold and/or the removal of the $450 cap on the basis that too many benefits that were not within the intended scope of FBT were being caught by the rules. 12.17 Raising the thresholds would remove FBT on some benefits that should not be subject to FBT, although it would be a blunt instrument to achieve this purpose because it would also remove FBT on benefits of low value that should, in principle, fall within the FBT rules because they have the character of remuneration. 29 The threshold was set at $50 when FBT was introduced in 1985 and was subsequently increased to $75 in 1992. The current structure of having both an employee and employer threshold was introduced in 1993. 71 12.18 Moreover, the minimum thresholds do not necessarily offer a trade-off between accuracy and cost because in order to use the provisions an employer must track all unclassified benefits to establish whether the thresholds have been exceeded. The provisions are, therefore, unsuitable for fringe benefits that are difficult to monitor or value. In such cases specific exemptions are more effective. From a policy perspective, therefore, minimum thresholds are a useful adjunct to specific exemptions in relation to small measurable benefits. Their main benefit, from an employer’s perspective, is in lowering overall FBT liability. Proposal 12.19 The government proposes to: • increase the employee-related minimum threshold from $75 to $200 per quarter; and • increase the employer-related threshold from $450 to $2000 per quarter. 72 Chapter 13 PROPOSED EXEMPTIONS – USE OF CERTAIN BUSINESS TOOLS Proposed changes The private use (and availability for private use) of employer-owned business tools such as cell phones and laptops would be exempt from FBT if the tools are provided to the employee primarily for business purposes. Use and availability for use of business-related assets 13.1 The private use or availability for private use of business-related equipment such as cell phones and laptops is currently subject to FBT under the catch- all provision in section CI 1(h), unless the private use is only on the employer’s premises. 13.2 The FBT valuation rules do not directly address the use or availability for use of such assets owned by the employer and, consequently, cause uncertainty about the value of the benefit. 13.3 In theory, the rental value or similar annual cost of the equipment could be an appropriate basis for the valuation of the benefit. However, rental values may overvalue the benefit if the employer places restrictions on the use of the equipment, such as an international calling bar on a cell phone, that would not generally apply if the employees had hired the equipment themselves. Policy rationale 13.4 The government agrees with submissions that argued that it is difficult and, therefore, costly to monitor and value the private use of small items such as laptops and cell phones when they are provided by employers primarily as business tools. As they are primarily for business use, any private benefit would likely be incidental. 13.5 In the absence of an express condition granting use of the equipment in a salary package, these benefits may also be difficult to characterise as remuneration. When the equipment is provided to facilitate the employee’s job, such as when a cell phone is given to an employee who is on call and when a laptop is provided to an employee to complete work assignments at home, the benefit to the employee may be seen as merely incidental. The ability to surf the internet at home after having completed the work 73 assignment may benefit the employee but does not have the character of remuneration for the work done. 13.6 Even in situations where the benefit can be characterised as remuneration, such as when the cell phone provided by the employer alleviates the need to purchase private telephone services, the compliance costs involved may be so high that they outweigh the benefit of imposing FBT. 13.7 Although this boundary is difficult to judge, the complexity in valuing business-related equipment and the difficulty in monitoring the uptake of these benefits indicates that these benefits give rise to particularly high compliance costs. 13.8 The valuation of the private use or availability for use of laptops and cell phones contrasts with the relatively straightforward calculation when ownership of a laptop or cell phone is transferred to an employee. In that situation the value of the laptop or cell phone is its market value less any contribution by the employee. 13.9 The extent to which the use of business-related assets such as cell phones and laptops are substituted for cash remuneration is unknown. Only limited potential for substitution exists as the employee is unlikely to require more than one laptop or cell phone at any one time. 13.10 The difficulty in regularly measuring any private benefits that do arise effectively precludes them from being encompassed in the minimum thresholds, so the better solution is to exempt them. As one submission noted, this would be consistent with the government's initiatives for promoting a knowledge economy. Proposal 13.11 The private use of employer-owned work tools such as laptops, cell phones and other business-related assets would be exempt from FBT when these assets have been provided to the employee primarily for business purposes. This exemption is on the assumption that the private use would be incidental, which could be verified by periodic audit. 13.12 This proposal represents a trade-off between accuracy and simplicity. As such it recognises that the high level of cost and complexity associated with valuing and monitoring private benefits that arise from the use of work tools such as laptops and cell phones will generally outweigh the advantages of taxing these fringe benefits. 13.13 Cell phones and laptops that are provided by an employer but are either owned by the employee or are not required to be brought to work would continue to be subject to FBT, as would land line telephones. Part four Minor issues 77 Chapter 14 OTHER EXEMPTIONS Proposed changes • Payment of income protection insurance premiums by an employer on behalf of an employee would be exempt to the extent that the employee would have received a tax deduction if he or she had paid the premium directly and the income stream would have been taxable. • The current law would be clarified to confirm that FBT should not apply to benefits that arise when an employer secures a bulk discount for employees, provided those discounts would be available to other groups on a basis unrelated to employment. • For the purposes of the on-premises exemption, an employer’s premises would include the premises of other companies in the consolidated group. Income protection insurance 14.1 In principle, the FBT treatment of income protection insurance policies should put the employee in the same position as if the employer had paid the employee a cash amount and the employee had then paid the premium directly. This is not the case currently because employees who pay the premium directly can be eligible for a deduction for the premium paid, on the basis that it is to ensure future income. Employees do not, however, receive a deduction when the employer pays the premium on their behalf. Example Scenario 1: An employer pays a $100 premium on an income protection insurance policy for an employee. Given that the marginal tax rate of the employee is 33 cents, the FBT liability is $49. Scenario 2: The employer pays the employee the $149 in cash and the employer deducts PAYE of $49. The employee then pays the $100 premium and can claim a deduction against income of $100, which reduces the tax liability by $33. Under scenario 2 the employee is $33 better off. 78 Proposal 14.2 The government’s proposed solution for rectifying this difference is that the premiums paid by the employer would be exempt from FBT if the employee would have received a tax deduction had he or she paid the premium directly, and if any claim under the policy would be subject to tax in the employee’s hands. This means that those premiums relating to personal sickness or accident policy insurance (which is treated as exempt income under section CB 5(1)(h)) would not qualify for the exemption. Third-party provided benefits Incidental benefits 14.3 When an employer enters into an arrangement for a third party to provide employees with benefits, the employer is still regarded as having provided the benefits and is liable for the FBT on them. 14.4 There is an argument that FBT should not apply to benefits that arise when an employer has secured a bulk discount for its staff from a third party merely because they represent a significant group. The crucial criterion in these circumstances should be whether such a discount would be available to the employees were they members of some other group unrelated to their employment. If the third party generally provides a bulk discount to large groups to attract their custom then, from a policy perspective, it is difficult to consider the discount to be a fringe benefit. 14.5 The employer may not have provided any consideration for the discount, although this need not be an indication that the benefit is not really employment-related, particularly if the parties are associated persons. Proposal 14.6 It is proposed that the current law be clarified to confirm that FBT should not apply to benefits that arise in instances such as when an employer secures a bulk discount for its employees, provided those discounts would be available to other groups on a basis unrelated to employment. This treatment is conceptually the same as that proposed for low-interest loans, outlined in chapter 11. Third party pays the FBT 14.7 Another issue raised in submissions was whether the third party providing the benefit to the employee should have the option to meet the FBT liability. There may be good practical reasons for this, such as the third party having the information to calculate the value of the benefit, or the third party may consider the information on cost to be commercially sensitive. 79 14.8 The third party may also have chosen to provide the benefit to the employee in return for services provided by the employee to the third party through the employer. In such cases the third party is bearing the cost of the fringe benefit, and it seems appropriate that it, rather than the employer, be able to elect to pay the FBT. The employer would in these circumstances be exempt from FBT on the relevant fringe benefit. 14.9 This could, however, give rise to some complexities: • because the third party would not have access to the salary details necessary to identify the employee’s marginal tax rate, the 64% tax rate may need to be applied to the benefit; and • to reduce the opportunity to use this treatment to take undue advantage of the minimum value threshold, the employer and the third party should not be associated persons and no payment should be made by the employer to the third party in respect of the benefit. 14.10 The government seeks comment on the practicalities of this treatment. On-premises exemption 14.11 As discussed earlier, benefits provided on an employer’s premises are excluded from FBT. This exemption does not, however, extend to the premises of another member of a group of companies, which can produce inconsistent outcomes. An employee may, for example, be employed by one member of the group of companies but receive a benefit while at the premises of another member – say, on a visit as part of his or her employment duties. It seems logical, therefore, that the on-premises exemption be able to be applied on a consolidated group basis or when companies are 100 percent commonly owned. Proposal 14.12 For the purposes of the on-premises exemption, an employer’s premises would include the premises of other companies in the consolidated group or when the companies are 100 percent commonly owned. Travel costs when employee posted overseas 14.13 Although a number of submissions raised the issue of the FBT treatment of spousal travel, the government is not proposing to alter that treatment. In general terms, having the spouse or partner of an employee accompany the employee on a business trip cannot be considered to be for work purposes. This is because of the difficulty in establishing a clear nexus between the spouse’s or partner’s role during the trip and the generation of income for the employer’s business. Therefore if an employer pays for an employee’s 80 spouse or partner’s travel costs in such cases, the payment should be treated as a fringe benefit and subject to FBT. 14.14 One issue that has arisen in the FBT review, however, is the appropriate FBT treatment of family visits to employees working overseas that are paid for by the employer. If the employer pays for the employee to return home to visit his or her family, this cost may currently be exempt from FBT on the basis that it removes a need to pay the employee a reimbursement allowance for travel costs the employee would have incurred in travelling between the employee’s home and place of work for the purposes of their employment. If, in the alternative, the employer incurs the cost of the family visiting the employee, the FBT outcome should arguably be the same – that is, any benefit should be exempt. 14.15 In principle, the government agrees that there are grounds for considering an exemption if: • it can be shown that the travel by the family is required as part of the employee’s employment; • the business purposes that would have been met by the employee making the trip continue to be achieved by the family visiting the employee; and • the exemption for family visits is limited to the amount that would have been exempt from FBT if the employee had made the visit. 14.16 The government invites comment on this point. Work-related clothing 14.17 No changes are proposed to the FBT rules on work-related clothing. Distinctive work clothing provided to employees by their employer is exempt from FBT provided it meets the definition of “distinctive work clothing”. This is defined as clothing that is worn for work purposes and would not be normally worn for private purposes, and can be identified with the employer by virtue of: • a name, logo, or other similar identifier being prominently and permanently displayed on the clothes at all times; or • the uniform’s pattern, colour scheme or style being readily identifiable with the employer. 81 14.18 Given that some concerns were raised in submissions about the practical application of these requirements – in particular, what is meant by “readily identifiable” and “prominently displayed”, the requirements were reviewed. While acknowledging that any definition creates interpretation issues and, therefore, compliance costs, this is part of the trade-off for having an exemption. The conclusion is that changing the definition would create more problems than it would resolve and that, therefore, no change should be made. 82 Chapter 15 OTHER ISSUES • The general anti-avoidance rule in section BG 1 would be applied to FBT. • Section CH 2, relating to share options, would be amended to make it clear that it covers options that are cancelled in exchange for cash. • The legislation would be clarified so that an election to pay FBT on a quarterly basis is made at the time of filing. • Employers would have the option of making their election to pay FBT annually by telephone rather than in writing. Anti-avoidance rule 15.1 Although FBT has its own anti-avoidance provision in part G of the Income Tax Act 1994, 30 unlike many of the specific anti-avoidance rules in part G, it is not also bolstered by the general anti-avoidance rule in part B, which enables a tax avoidance arrangement to be voided and any associated tax advantage to be counteracted. This omission arises because of the wording in section BG 1, when read in conjunction with sections OB 6 and OZ 1. The omission in this legislation and its predecessor, the Income Tax Act 1976, does not appear to have been deliberate. In the circumstances, the general anti-avoidance rule should apply to FBT and the government proposes to make a remedial change to achieve this. 15.2 This change would apply as a back-stop measure to bolster other specific anti-avoidance rules, including the specific rule proposed in this document in relation to charities. Interaction with share option schemes 15.3 Under section CH 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994, exercised share options provided to an employee by an employer are treated as monetary remuneration, with the value of the benefit being the difference between the value of the shares on the date of acquisition and the amount paid by the employee for them. To avoid double taxation, the FBT rules specifically exclude benefits that arise under section CH 2. 30 See section GC 17. 83 15.4 An issue has arisen as to the treatment of options that are cancelled in exchange for cash rather than converted into shares. In these circumstances the option holder still receives a benefit so that if section CH 2 were not to apply, then FBT should apply in theory, although there is confusion as to whether it does in fact apply. This confusion creates compliance costs for taxpayers. 15.5 To avoid these compliance costs, the government proposes to clarify section CH 2 to ensure that, as intended, any benefits in relation to share options are covered by that provision rather than the FBT rules. Value of transport benefits 15.6 Transport-related fringe benefits provided by an employer are generally valued at 25% of the highest amount charged by the employer to members of the public. This means, for example, that an airline that provides its staff with free air travel for their private use generally pays FBT at the rate of 25% of the highest fare charged to a member of the public for a comparable flight. This discount was intended to represent a stand-by type of fare, given that employees may not be guaranteed a seat until shortly before departure. 15.7 Some submissions questioned whether the rate of 25% is still appropriate, given the range of discounted fares that are now available to the public. This should be able to be established empirically. Accordingly, the government invites submissions on this point. In considering the rate, the government would need to take into account the full range of transport options to which the rate applies. Policyholder loans 15.8 Section CI 2(8) of the Income Tax Act 1994 applies the FBT rules to loans provided by a life insurer to a policyholder. This is done by treating the relationship between the policyholder and the life insurer as an employment relationship. The purpose of the provision is to capture the benefits of low- interest loans to policyholders in the same way that such benefits, when provided to shareholders of a company, are treated as dividends. 15.9 Over recent years many life insurers have demutualised but because there is an exemption in the dividend rules for amounts subject to FBT, the FBT rules continue to apply to low-interest loans to policyholders even when the life insurer is now a company. 84 15.10 Because some life insurers have not demutualised, section CI 2(8) needs to be retained. But the government invites submissions on whether loans to shareholders in life insurance companies should be subject to the dividend rules rather than the FBT rules. One aspect to consider is the implications of changing who pays the tax. At present, the life insurer pays the FBT, whereas if the benefit were treated as a dividend, the shareholder would pay the tax, which would likely increase compliance and administrative costs. Changes to election provisions in subpart ND 15.11 Some technical issues have been raised with the election requirements in subpart ND. Subpart ND sets out the specific tax rules, such as the multi- rate, in relation to the fringe benefits identified in subpart CI. The proposed changes are: • Section ND 2(3) provides that an employer elects to pay FBT on a quarterly basis by filing a return and paying tax at the rate selected. Since not all taxpayers pay when they file, the proposal is that the section be amended so that an election is made at the time of filing. • Employers can elect to pay FBT on an annual rather than a quarterly basis if they meet certain criteria. The election must be in writing. In practice this means that employers complete an Inland Revenue form. It is proposed that sections ND 13, 14 and 15 be amended to provide employers the option of making their election by telephone. An advantage of making a telephone election is that the employer can discuss such detail as whether they meet the annual filing criteria and when the change of filing will apply from. 85 Appendix MOTORING COSTS FOR PETROL-DRIVEN VEHICLES ESTIMATED ON 14,000KM PER YEAR, FIRST FIVE YEARS OF OWNERSHIP Engine capacity Up to 1300cc 1301 – 1600cc 1602 – 2000cc Over 2000cc Average Price of a New Car Including Registration $19,662 $28,065 $36,936 $42,356 A – FIXED COSTS Average Value at Start of Third Year $14,441 $20,612 $27,128 $31,108 Annual Relicensing $217 $217 $217 $217 Insurance – Comprehensive, No Claim $540 $665 $805 $825 Warrant of Fitness Annually at $34 for the First 6 Years $34 $34 $34 $34 Total Outlay $15,232 $21,529 $28,184 $32,185 Interest on Outlay at 8.2% $1,249 $1,765 $2,311 $2,639 Capital Cost (Outlay + Interest) $16,481 $23,294 $30,495 $34,824 Depreciation (at 14.3% from Average Value) at 3 rd Year $2,065 $2,948 $3,879 $4,449 Depreciated Value $12,376 $17,665 $23,248 $26,660 TOTAL FIXED COSTS $4,105 $5,629 $7,247 $8,164 B – RUNNING COSTS Petrol – Litres Used per 100km 6.9 7.2 8.6 10.8 Litres Used over 14,000km 966 1009 1204 1512 Cost at $1.09 per Litre (January 2003) $1,056.80 $1,103.85 $1,317.18 $1,654.13 Oil at $7.82 per Litre – 1 Litre per 2,500km = 5.6 Litres Used $43.74 $43.74 $43.74 $43.74 Tyres Estimated Life of 40,000km – Cost per Year $157.78 $182.65 $224.99 $229.83 Repairs & Maintenance (Incl.

Two of the areas identified as essential for building effective innovation are: • attracting people with exceptional skills; • increasing global connectedness. The skills needed for a thriving, knowledge-based economy are in demand throughout the world. The people with those skills are increasingly mobile, and New Zealand businesses need to be able to compete with businesses in other countries to attract them to work here. Whether they are returning New Zealanders or citizens of other countries, people recruited from overseas bring with them links to other countries, knowledge of foreign markets and contacts with new ideas and developing technology. These connections are especially valuable for a country as remote as New Zealand. This importance justifies a review of New Zealand’s international tax system to ensure that it does not unnecessarily discourage recruitment of overseas talent. The proposal introduced in this discussion document is intended to reduce the tax- related costs to New Zealand business of recruiting internationally mobile labour. It will thereby promote global connectedness, the growth of a skilled workforce, and the development of an innovative, competitive economy. Hon Dr Michael Cullen Hon David Cunliffe Minister of Finance Associate Minister of Revenue Minister of Revenue 2 3 Chapter 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Employees recruited from overseas may face extra tax costs in coming to New Zealand, compared with what they would face at home or in other countries. The result is that extra costs are imposed on New Zealand business, who recruit them. This occurs either because recruits negotiate a higher level of remuneration, to compensate explicitly or implicitly for the additional tax burden, or because some potential recruits are deterred from taking the job at all. New Zealand businesses may then have to accept a second-best candidate, with an ongoing cost to the efficiency of the business. 1.2 It is important that New Zealand business gets the overseas recruits it needs, at the best price. The skills needed to produce growth and innovation are in demand internationally. A country the size of New Zealand should be open to obtaining those skills from beyond its domestic labour market. New Zealand’s isolation also means it is important to use employment opportunities to develop better connections with the rest of the world. In this way New Zealand can keep in touch with international expertise, especially in the rapidly changing fields of science, technology and commerce. 1.3 Employers are best placed to determine which skills are needed and where they can best be found. The government’s role is to set a regulatory framework which does not unduly interfere with attempts by employers to recruit the people they need. The proposals described in this discussion document aim to reduce the obstacles to overseas recruitment that the tax system imposes. 1.4 Businesses are effectively paying many of these costs themselves, and the current system distorts the behaviour of both businesses and overseas recruits. A well-designed tax system can do better. 1.5 In its final report to the government, the Tax Review 2001 recommended that individuals with no previous connection to New Zealand who become residents for tax purposes should be taxed only on their New Zealand- sourced income for the first seven years. 1.6 We have developed the idea of a temporary exemption from tax on overseas income for people who are recruited from overseas, but with a focus on reducing costs for New Zealand businesses, and widening the idea to include returning New Zealanders. The result is the proposal set out here. 1.7 We propose that people who are recruited to New Zealand to work as employees should be exempt from some of New Zealand’s international tax rules. The exemption would last for a limited period. It would apply to people who are coming to New Zealand for the first time, or who have not been resident in New Zealand for at least ten years. The exemption could cover all sources of overseas income (including, for example, rents from 4 overseas properties and interest in foreign bank accounts). Alternatively, it could cover only those areas where New Zealand’s tax rules are particularly comprehensive (such as income from overseas companies controlled by the taxpayer). 1.8 The proposed exemption is not about attracting capital by encouraging wealthy immigrants. Since the exemption is from tax on foreign-sourced income, it would be an unsuitable tool for encouraging people to invest in New Zealand. The focus is on reducing employment costs for New Zealand business. 1.9 Nor is the proposed exemption a suitable tool for encouraging self-employed entrepreneurs to come to New Zealand. Entrepreneurs do not have the same opportunity to pass their extra costs on directly to New Zealand businesses. For these reasons, the exemption is aimed at employees. 1.10 The primary benefit of the proposed exemption would be to make it cheaper for New Zealand business to recruit and retain skilled employees. SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS A temporary exemption from some of New Zealand’s international tax rules would be given to people who are recruited to work here. The exemption would apply to anyone who has been non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes for ten years before the current period of residence. It would apply regardless of nationality, so returning New Zealanders could be eligible, as long as they had been non-resident for long enough. The exemption would be targeted at people coming to work as employees in New Zealand. It would not be available to people coming here to retire, or to start up their own business, because there are no analogous costs for New Zealand business associated with these groups. As well as passing the non-residence test, claimants would also have to pass a work test. They would have to earn a minimum amount of income from a New Zealand employment, or work full-time in such an employment, in any tax year for which the exemption was claimed. Income from employment might include income as a partner from a non-family partnership. The work test would apply to a whole household, so that where both spouses were eligible on non- residence grounds, only one partner need earn above the threshold. The exemption could cover a selected group of rules where New Zealand’s approach is particularly comprehensive, or it could be wider, including tax on all foreign, non- employment income. This document therefore proposes two options for discussion, one narrow and one broad. 5 The narrow option provides an exemption from New Zealand’s tax rules, where the treatment of foreign transactions is more rigorous than international norms. In particular, they include rules that tax accrued, unrealised gains. Employees from overseas would be exempted from: • the special rules applying to foreign investment funds, controlled foreign companies and financial arrangements; and • non-resident withholding tax and approved issuer levy. The narrow option might also include an exemption in relation to: • employee share options earned overseas during a period of non-residence; • trust tax liabilities arising because the employee is a settlor who has become resident. An alternative, broad option would give an exemption from tax on all foreign-sourced income, including overseas rents, interest and other investment income but excluding employment income. It would also cover non-resident withholding tax, approved issuer levy and some trust tax liabilities. The exemption would last for a limited number of years. Year for year, a broad option would be fiscally more expensive than a narrow option. We propose that a broad option could last for three years after the date of arrival, or the narrow option could last for seven years, at a roughly equal fiscal cost. Potential claimants would establish their residence eligibility through a process of certification. This would allow them to claim the exemption through self-assessment, subject to passing the work test in each year. Consultation process 1.11 Views are sought on the broad and narrow options, the detailed design of the exemption, and how it should be implemented. 1.12 Please send submissions, by 19 December, to: Reducing tax barriers to international recruitment C/- General Manager Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington NEW ZEALAND email: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz 6 1.13 Please note that submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982.

An increasing number of people, however, are mobile and have a wide choice of potential destinations in which to work. One such group is people whose skills and experience are in demand internationally, who can choose where they want to work. For them, differences in tax systems are one factor to be taken into account when choosing where to work. 2.2 Tax on offshore income appears to be an especially important issue for these individuals. They may accept fluctuating tax levels on salary and wages, which can be thought of as payments for the broad array of services inextricably linked to the local quality of life and local pay standards. Their tolerance may be lower for taxes on income perceived as having a more tenuous connection with the country of destination. 2.3 People coming to New Zealand to work can find taxes on foreign-sourced income higher than in other countries. This is partly because some of New Zealand’s tax rules relating to foreign-sourced income – such as the foreign investment fund rules and the controlled foreign companies rules – are more comprehensive than those of other countries. Moreover, some countries have wide exemptions from tax on foreign-sourced income for new migrants. They include the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, both of which are likely alternative destinations for skilled workers also considering a move to New Zealand. This means that prospective migrants with foreign-sourced income that is taxable in New Zealand, such as property rents and interest on bank deposits, may face higher tax bills here than they would in other countries. 2.4 Potential employees choosing between jobs in New Zealand and either Hong Kong or the United Kingdom are likely to be the most sensitive to tax differences. For any given country, though, the differences will be inconsequential for some potential employees and significant for others. 2.5 New Zealand businesses need to recruit certain numbers of overseas residents with skills and experience which are not available in New Zealand. The tax imposed by our laws on those potential recruits can be passed on to New Zealand business in various ways, including the following: • Potential recruits may explicitly negotiate for the New Zealand employer to meet the extra cost of taxation. The tax is effectively borne by the business from its profits. In effect, it is not a tax on the income of the non-resident, but a tax on New Zealand business. 8 • In other cases employers may not know that they are bearing the cost of the extra tax. When naming their price recruits will recognise the extra tax that they will have to pay and simply start with a higher figure in salary negotiations. Some may request more compensation than the total extra tax bill, to compensate for compliance costs and the nuisance factor. • If a business is not able to offer adequate compensation it may lose the best person for the job. It will have to employ the next best candidate, which gives rise to a cost to the efficiency of the business. • Even before the negotiation stage, some potential recruits will decide not to come to New Zealand at all. They may decide that they are unlikely to negotiate adequate compensation. Others will realise that they could restructure their finances in a way to limit the extra tax burden, but will decide that they do not want to spend time doing this. The best candidates, those with good job offers elsewhere, may be especially likely to be swayed by these marginal considerations. These decisions reduce the pool of available talent. New Zealand business is less likely to be able to recruit and retain the best possible employees, and that costs New Zealand business in the long run. 2.6 It is often the case that New Zealand businesses cannot compete purely in terms of salary with similar businesses in other English-speaking OECD countries, although New Zealand has other attractions which can make up for some differences in remuneration. There is not an unlimited capacity to reduce salaries, however, and removing tax barriers would help employers to make the most of those attractions. 2.7 The proposed exemption aims to reduce the tax on foreign-sourced income which mobile, tax-sensitive workers can pass on to New Zealand business. Its purpose is to reduce the cost to New Zealand business of recruiting highly skilled workers, not to increase the number of overseas workers coming to New Zealand. The justification for an exemption 2.8 Most taxes create costs for the economy, but those costs are balanced against the need to raise revenue. Any proposed exemption must be justified in the context of New Zealand's wider tax framework. Why this exemption and not another? 2.9 New Zealand has a broad-based tax system under which different types of income and expenditure are taxed equally, as far as possible. This reduces the extent to which tax considerations affect economic decisions and thus reduces the economic cost of taxation. In general, exemptions and special treatment for particular types of income or taxpayers are to be avoided. 9 2.10 In the context of international taxation, the residence principle is the basic economic framework of the New Zealand tax system. Within this framework, New Zealand residents are taxed on their worldwide income, which minimises tax incentives that would distort residents’ decisions about whether to invest offshore or in New Zealand. 2.11 Conversely, the starting point for taxing non-residents is their New Zealand income, and overseas income is not taxed at all. But even their New Zealand income is generally taxed only when they bear the burden themselves. If the cost can be passed on to New Zealanders, it is better to remove or reduce the tax. Example Alex manages an overseas investment fund, and is considering where to invest $10 million. He is considering making loans in New Zealand, and in Atelia, a low-tax country. Atelian borrowers would pay interest of 6%, with no Atelian taxes. In New Zealand, interest would be subject to withholding tax of 15% to cover the investment fund’s New Zealand tax liability. New Zealand borrowers would therefore have to pay 7.06% in order to produce a net return of 6%, if they are to compete for Alex’s investment. This means that while the tax is collected from Alex, New Zealand borrowers would be required to pay him a higher return to compensate for that tax. New Zealand borrowers are effectively paying the tax on Alex’s behalf or face losing his investment. New Zealand tax law recognises this problem, and the New Zealand borrowers can instead apply for a special status which enables them to pay tax at only 2% on their interest, a total of 6.12%. 2.12 A proposal to exempt overseas recruits from tax on foreign-sourced income is consistent with the logic of the residence principle. For the limited class of residents concerned, whose connection to the country is new and fragile, these taxes are inefficient. 2.13 At present, our tax system effectively collects such taxes from businesses, but distorts the behaviour of both businesses and overseas recruits. The distortion to the behaviour of recruits is avoidable. If it were determined that the revenue collected was needed for government spending, it could be collected directly from the domestic tax base instead, without the unnecessary distortion. 10 Chapter 3 SCOPE OF THE EXEMPTION 3.1 Rules about which taxes would be covered by the exemption, who could claim it, and how long it would apply for need to be considered carefully to ensure that the exemption is efficient. Ideally, the exemption would cover only those taxes which are passed on to New Zealand business, would apply only to recruits who are “sensitive” to New Zealand’s tax system, and would last only as long as that relative sensitivity lasted. But for each person these thresholds will be different. 3.2 As far as possible, the proposed exemption should be designed to avoid the following side effects: • distorting investment decisions, especially making overseas investments more attractive than New Zealand investments; • making overseas recruits relatively cheaper to employ than New Zealand residents with equal skills and experience; and • damaging efficiency and perceptions of equity in the New Zealand tax system. The two options 3.3 A broad option would exempt eligible employees from paying New Zealand tax on any foreign-sourced income (apart from employment income). This would include income from all foreign investments, such as shares in foreign companies, interest on foreign savings and rental income from foreign properties. It would also cover the obligation to deduct tax from payments made to a foreign lender. 3.4 The narrow option would focus on those New Zealand tax rules which are more comprehensive than the international norm. Of special concern are the rules relating to controlled foreign companies and foreign investment funds. There may also be a case for including rules on financial arrangements in the exemption. A common feature of these rules is that they tax the investor on income and gains made by the investment vehicle even though these gains may not have been realised or distributed. The narrow option would also cover deductions from payments made to a foreign lender and could also cover overseas share options and certain trust income. 3.5 The main effect of the narrow option would be to reduce direct tax charges on people with significant interests in companies and unit trusts in foreign countries (other than Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States, for which an exemption already 11 applies). It would also reduce the tax suffered by people owing money abroad, the most likely example of which is a foreign mortgage. 3.6 The broad option would cover the same ground as a narrow option and would also reduce tax bills for people with any form of income from low-tax jurisdictions. There would be less effect on income arising in countries with tax systems similar to New Zealand’s, because the income would be taxed fully there, with or without the exemption, and a foreign tax credit would be available to set against any New Zealand tax. A broad exemption would have an effect on this type of income only to the extent that New Zealand’s rules and rates currently produce a higher tax bill – for example where the other country does not tax a particular type of investment Advantages of the broad option 3.7 The broad option is by definition more comprehensive than the narrow option, and more likely to be successful in reducing tax-related costs to New Zealand business. The broad option is more likely to be useful in helping businesses attract people who would otherwise consider migrating to Hong Kong or the United Kingdom. It would send a stronger signal to businesses and their potential overseas recruits. It would also be easier to understand and simpler to comply with. Disadvantages of the broad option 3.8 The broad exemption is likely to distort people’s decisions about where to invest, whether offshore or in New Zealand. There would be an incentive to retain and even increase their offshore, tax-free investment, at the expense of New Zealand investments. This option might be more likely to encourage investment into tax havens. This effect, however, would be curtailed by the time-limit placed on the exemption. Arguably, a person arriving in New Zealand to work is unlikely to invest in the country until connections have been made and knowledge acquired. By that time, the exemption would be coming to an end, so the distortionary effects of a wide exemption might not in fact be that great. 3.9 The broad exemption might be seen as less fair, especially as it would apply to some returning New Zealanders, as well as people from other countries. In fact, some of the relieved tax would have been borne by New Zealand employers anyway. But perceptions of equity are important for a tax system which depends on voluntary compliance. Furthermore, there would be some unfairness to the extent that the broad option would be less well targeted. 12 Advantages of the narrow option 3.10 Some people may perceive any exemption from tax as unfair. The reduced scope of the narrow option is likely, therefore, to be seen as fairer. It would give a series of carefully defined exemptions from some quite technical rules, instead of a blanket exemption for all foreign-sourced income. There would be less difference between the tax liabilities of overseas recruits and New Zealand residents having similar patterns of income. 3.11 Any exemption will produce distortionary incentives to restructure investments to take advantage of it. The distortions under the narrow exemption may be fewer, especially if some taxability is retained. For example, the special rules relating to the taxation of foreign investment funds would be relaxed, so that there would be no taxation of unrealised gains. This would remove the comprehensiveness of the rules, but income from a fund would still be treated like any other foreign investment income, with distributions taxed as they are made. 3.12 Similarly, under the narrow option controlled foreign companies would not be taxed on the current rigorous basis, but distributions would be taxed ordinarily. This would mean that there was no investment vehicle that was simply tax-free, to attract funds which would otherwise go elsewhere. 3.13 The narrow exemption would likely work best for people deciding between remaining at home and accepting a job in New Zealand. Such people, if they are without job prospects elsewhere, may be sensitive to the New Zealand tax system than to their domestic tax system, but oblivious to systems in other countries. Disadvantages of the narrow option 3.14 The tax avoidance possibilities of foreign investment funds and controlled foreign companies, which the special rules are in part designed to foil, would be opened up by the exemption. There would be, therefore, some incentive to invest in these vehicles. The distortionary effects of the exemption would at least be confined to those people prepared to engage in tax planning at the avoidance end of the spectrum. 3.15 Although the distortionary effects of the narrow option might be limited in scope, they would last for longer if the narrow option were to cover a longer period than the broad option. 3.16 The narrow option would not necessarily cover all of the tax costs arising from a highly skilled recruit moving to New Zealand. Although it singles out the most obvious areas of difference, it does not address any of a wide range of smaller differences, which could result in the New Zealand tax charge exceeding any foreign tax credit available. 13 International comparisons 3.17 Since few countries offer a broad exemption from tax for the foreign-sourced income to employees from overseas, New Zealand should be cautious at this stage. The Australian government recently proposed a broad exemption but it has not passed into law. The United Kingdom’s domicile rules (currently under review) give an indefinite exemption from tax on foreign-sourced income for many immigrants. Hong Kong does not seek to tax foreign- sourced income at all, but in other respects, its tax rates are also very low. Residents are taxed only on profits, salary, and property values arising in Hong Kong, and the tax rate is 15% across the board. Merely introducing a temporary exemption for foreign-sourced income would not come close to making New Zealand competitive with Hong Kong in terms of tax. On the other hand, at the margin it could make all the difference. Breadth and length 3.18 A wide exemption would be more fiscally expensive than a narrow exemption over the same period of time. Thus, a broad exemption lasting three years would have approximately the same fiscal cost as a narrow option lasting seven years. On this basis, if the choice were between these two options, which would be more beneficial for New Zealand business? 3.19 Since the narrow option contains those elements most likely to be taken into account by employer and employee, it might be wisest to spend the money here. On the other hand, the longer period would exceed the likely period of sensitivity. Before seven years are over, employees might have moved investments to New Zealand, completed their employment contract and returned overseas, or simply failed to renegotiate compensation with an employer who now regards them as less mobile and not so sensitive to tax. In that case, it might be better to choose the shorter, wider option, which is likely to fall entirely within the period of sensitivity, although it may cover some tax to which some mobile workers are not sensitive. 14 Chapter 4 OPTION ONE: THE NARROW EXEMPTION 4.1 The narrow option would target the exemption at certain features of our tax laws. This would include relief from foreign investment fund and controlled foreign company rules, the non-residents withholding tax rules and the approved issuer levy rules. It could also include overseas share options, accruals and trusts. Although this chapter devotes more space to considering the narrow option than the next chapter to the broad option, this is only because the subject requires a more detailed discussion of what should be included. Controlled foreign company income 4.2 When a foreign company is controlled by a small number of New Zealand residents, the controlled foreign company rules may apply. 1 Under these rules, the income of the company is attributed to its owners according to their interests. New Zealand owners are then taxed on their attributed shares of the company’s income, regardless of any actual distributions. The company’s income is calculated for this purpose as if it were a branch operating in New Zealand. Tax paid by the company in respect of the attributed income is usually allowed as a credit against the owner’s tax bill. 4.3 The intention of these rules is to ensure that New Zealanders face similar tax liabilities, whether they invest in foreign or domestic enterprises. 4.4 The controlled foreign company rules do not require attribution of current income when the company is resident in Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, the United Kingdom or the United States. Instead, the income is taxed only when it is distributed. These countries are considered to have tax systems that are equivalent to New Zealand’s, so any tax due in New Zealand would be largely offset by a foreign tax credit. 4.5 The other main exception to the rules is that they do not apply where a person has less than a 10 percent income interest in the company, although the foreign investment fund rules may apply here instead. 4.6 New Zealand’s controlled foreign company rules are broader than those of many other countries. In New Zealand, the rules do not distinguish between the active and the passive income of a business. In most other OECD countries, active income is exempt, and taxed only on distribution. Thus the New Zealand rules may impose a higher tax charge. 1 The rules apply when five or fewer New Zealand residents hold 50 percent or more of the control interest in the company, or are able to control the exercise of shareholder decision-making rights. They also apply if a single New Zealand resident holds more than 40 percent of the control interest, unless a single non-resident holds an equal or greater amount. 15 4.7 The broader scope of New Zealand’s rules can also cause relatively high compliance costs for taxpayers because of the need to prepare a second set of accounts. Company income is first calculated in accordance with the tax laws of the country of residence, and must then be recalculated in accordance with New Zealand tax law. Because active income is taxed, trading stock and depreciation have to be recalculated, thereby increasing the compliance costs. 4.8 The rules apply as soon as someone becomes resident in New Zealand. There is no transition period during which business interests can be rearranged. Example Helen is a South African computer engineer. She owns 20 percent of the shares in a family company based in Cape Town. The other shares are held by her parents. In South Africa, she is taxed on her income from the company as it is distributed. She moves to New Zealand to take up a job. She must now arrange for the family company’s income to be recalculated in line with New Zealand tax law, and she must pay New Zealand tax on 20 percent of the company’s total income, regardless of how much is distributed to her. 4.9 The higher tax and compliance costs associated with New Zealand’s rules add to the cost of recruiting employees who have significant business interests overseas. We therefore propose to include them in any narrow exemption. 4.10 Under a narrow exemption, controlled foreign company income would not be attributed and taxed, but any distributions paid out would be taxed in the usual way, like any other company distribution. Once the exemption ended, the company income would begin to be taxed under the controlled foreign company rules, as if the taxpayer had become New Zealand resident on the day the exemption expired. Foreign investment fund income 4.11 The foreign investment fund rules apply to certain interests held by a New Zealand resident in foreign companies, unit trusts, superannuation schemes and life insurance policies. Like the controlled foreign company rules, they are designed to tax residents on their shares of an overseas entity’s income on a current year basis rather than when the income is distributed. 4.12 There are several exemptions from the rules, including: • an interest in a company or unit trust in Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, the United Kingdom or the United States; 16 • an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme or life insurance policy for the income tax year in which a person first becomes a New Zealand tax resident, and the next three years; and • all of an individual’s foreign investment fund interests if the aggregate acquisition cost was less than $50,000. 4.13 If an interest in a fund is not exempt, it must be disclosed to Inland Revenue, and the income must be calculated according to the rules and included in the tax return. 4.14 The intention of the foreign investment fund rules is to tax residents on their share of the income of the entity, regardless of distributions. Since many investors are not privy to the information needed to calculate the whole income of the entity in which they have invested, alternative calculation methods are permitted. In roughly descending order of accuracy, and ascending order of simplicity, these methods are: • branch equivalent; • accounting profits; • deemed rate of return; and • comparative value. 4.15 Only the branch equivalent method permits credit to be given for foreign tax paid. 4.16 The most commonly used is the comparative value method, which is simple and does not require a lot of information. This method calculates the income or loss based on the change in the market value of the shares over the year. Fluctuations in exchange rates will also be included. Consequently, investors will effectively be taxed on their unrealised capital gains, and with no credit for tax paid by the foreign entity on its profits. 4.17 New Zealand’s approach to foreign investment funds is more comprehensive than that of many other countries. It is based on the principle that residents should be taxed on their worldwide income as it accrues. Other countries have narrower rules, aimed at countering tax avoidance. As with controlled foreign companies, it is common for other countries to have an exemption for active business income. Thus in Australia, an interest in a foreign company which qualifies for the active business exemption is outside the foreign investment fund rules altogether. 4.18 Anecdotal evidence and submissions received by the Tax Review show that the foreign investment fund rules are often considered to be a deterrent to highly skilled people thinking of coming to New Zealand to work. It is therefore likely that the rules add to the cost of recruiting overseas employees. 17 Example Paul works in Paris. He owns $70,000 worth of shares in French companies. He pays French income tax on his dividends. If he came to work in New Zealand, his shareholdings would be treated as foreign investment funds. He would adopt the comparative value method, and would have to pay tax on the annual change in value of the shares, including exchange rate fluctuations. 4.19 The narrow exemption would include foreign investment fund income , so only distributions from the fund would be taxed during the period of exemption. Once the exemption ended, the interest in the fund would begin to be taxed under the special rules, as if the taxpayer had become New Zealand resident on the day the exemption expired. 4.20 The government is considering possible options for reforming the taxation of offshore portfolio investment, which could eventually lead to further changes to the foreign investment fund rules. The application of the narrow exemption to funds would be reviewed in the light of any such changes. Share options 4.21 New Zealand follows the international norm in taxing employee share options on the exercise spread, at the time they are exercised. The exercise spread is the difference between the value of the shares at the time they are acquired, and the price paid for them. 4.22 The tax liability on share options arises when the option is exercised. If the option is exercised by a New Zealand resident, it is taxable in New Zealand. This is the case even if the option is earned in overseas employment at a time when the employee was not a New Zealand resident. In this respect, New Zealand’s tax rules are more comprehensive than those of many other countries. 4.23 For example, people who are resident in Australia, the United Kingdom, United States or Singapore are not taxed when they exercise share options if the options were earned overseas before they became resident. (In the United States, this depends on their not being US citizens). Some of these countries do charge capital gains tax on the ultimate sale of the shares, which in some circumstances reflects some of the pre-exercise gains. 4.24 Overseas recruits coming to New Zealand with unexercised share options from a previous jobs could, therefore, face a tax bill which would not have arisen had they decided to take up work in one of several other countries likely to compete for their skills and experience. This fact is likely to increase the recruitment cost for New Zealand business, at least in respect of highly mobile employees with several choices of location. 18 4.25 New Zealand business costs are less likely to rise in cases where employees are making a direct comparison between New Zealand and their long-term home country. Someone with share options from their current employment who was considering a move to New Zealand as an alternative to staying at home would face tax on the exercise of the option regardless of what choice they made. 4.26 On the other hand, the tax treatment in New Zealand may be a factor for an employee who compares the treatment with other alternative destinations, but not with the country of origin. Example Angela is a New Zealander who has worked abroad for fifteen years, mostly in Asia. She has acquired share options which are exercisable over the next three years, and she expects to make gains on exercise of between $200,000 and $300,000. If she goes to work in Australia, United Kingdom or United States she will pay little or no tax when she exercises the options. But if she comes to New Zealand, she will pay tax on the whole of the gains. 4.27 It could also be argued that New Zealand’s taxation of share options is more severe than that of other countries because of its lack of exemptions and other favourable treatment. This comparison applies bilaterally, as well as multilaterally. For example, a share option earned in Britain might be exempt from United Kingdom tax because it met certain statutory criteria, but would be taxed in New Zealand. However, the range of treatment internationally is very wide. It ranges from deferral of payment of the tax (Ireland), to exemption for quite large amounts (United Kingdom), with some countries offering partial exemption for variously limited amounts (Canada and the United States). We are not aware of any OECD country which offers complete exemption for gains on employee share options earned in that country. 4.28 There is certainly a case for including overseas share options in the narrow exemption. Unfavourable comparisons with the United Kingdom, United States, Australia and Singapore could not then be drawn. On the other hand, such an exemption would increase the likelihood of double non-taxation (meaning no tax charged in the country of earning and the country of exercise), as it would make it easier for employees to plan their actions to take advantage of differences in the tax rules on share options. This is much less of a risk with other types of foreign-sourced income, which is likely to be subject to tax in the source country, in spite of any temporary exemption in New Zealand, and in relation to which the taxpayer has much less control over the timing of the income. 19 4.29 A particular risk is that overseas employees intending to retire to New Zealand might plan to maximise the proportion of their remuneration taken in the form of share options during their last years overseas, and then cash in the options, tax-free, in New Zealand. They would have to be employed in New Zealand only for as long as it took to exercise the options (but at least one year). Non-resident withholding tax and approved issuer levy 4.30 New residents often retain a house in their home country, which may be mortgaged. The mortgage lender will not normally be resident in New Zealand, but the fact that the borrower is resident in New Zealand will be enough to give the lender a New Zealand source of income. This means that interest paid by the resident to the non-resident lender must be paid net of non-resident withholding tax. The rate of tax is 10% for countries with whom New Zealand has a double tax agreement and 15% for other countries. 4.31 Non-resident withholding tax is a tax on the interest received by the foreign lender, but because non-resident lenders usually charge an interest rate net of all New Zealand taxes, in practice, the burden of the tax is borne by the resident borrower. An alternative for the resident borrower is to apply for approved issuer status, register the security with Inland Revenue, and pay an approved issuer levy at 2% on the interest paid to the foreign lender. The liability for the approved issuer levy remains with the borrower. Example Anna leaves Germany and comes to work in New Zealand on a three-year contract. She owns a house in Frankfurt on which she makes mortgage payments of $4000 a month, mostly interest. She lets the house for $3500 a month, making a small loss. Because she is now resident in New Zealand, her German mortgage lender has a New Zealand source of income. Anna must deduct non-residents withholding tax at 10% from her mortgage payments, and pass it to Inland Revenue. In practice, she must pay that amount in addition to the mortgage payments, otherwise she will be in breach of the terms of her mortgage. Anna decides instead to elect for approved issuer status. She no longer has to pay the 10% withholding tax, but she does have to pay Inland Revenue a levy of 2% of her interest payments. Her housing costs have thus increased by about $800 a year. 4.32 Many new residents are unaware of their liability to pay non-resident withholding tax, or of their opportunity to elect to pay the approved issuer levy instead. They may thus become exposed to shortfall penalties, as well as the non-resident withholding tax charge, which in many cases will be unrecoverable from the lender. 20 4.33 Non-resident withholding tax and approved issuer levy add to the direct tax and compliance costs of new residents with foreign debts. These costs are in some cases passed on to employers, increasing the cost of overseas recruitment. Non-resident withholding tax and approved issuer levy are therefore included in the narrow option. Other possible areas for exemption Financial arrangements 4.34 Like the foreign investment fund and controlled foreign companies rules, the financial arrangement rules (also known as the accrual or accruals rules) bring gains to charge for tax as they accrue, even though those gains may not be realised or received for some time. The rules apply to a wide range of financial instruments and transactions. They match income with the relevant expenditure, and they limit the scope for turning taxable income into non- taxable capital gains. 4.35 Many other countries do not have similar rules. The rules are therefore likely to cause extra tax costs for some people thinking of coming to work in New Zealand, and consequent costs to New Zealand business. 4.36 For example, money invested overseas in a deep discount or a zero coupon bond might produce no taxable income in that country until the bond matures. Under New Zealand’s financial arrangement rules, the gain would be spread over the life of the bond, and tax would be payable each year. 4.37 A mortgage is a financial arrangement, and in the common situation of overseas employees retaining a mortgaged property in their home country, a tax liability could arise on foreign exchange fluctuations. 4.38 There may be a case for including the accrual rules in a narrow exemption, and it would be useful to hear of circumstances in which exposure to the accrual rules has been an issue for a prospective overseas recruit. 4.39 If the narrow option did provide some exemption for financial arrangements, it would not be enough to confine the exemption to foreign-sourced income, because money lent to a New Zealand resident gives rise to New Zealand- sourced income. Deemed income from foreign exchange fluctuations on a mortgage, for example, would, therefore, not be foreign-sourced income. One possibility would be to exempt all foreign-sourced income arising under the accrual rules, as well as New Zealand-sourced income arising under those rules if the financial arrangement was a loan made to the exempt person before he or she became resident. Alternatively, it might be necessary to extend the exemption to the accrual rules as a whole. In that case it would probably be desirable to limit the exemption to pre-residence arrangements, to reduce the scope for avoidance. 21 Trusts 4.40 The trust tax rules provide that New Zealand tax on trustee income arising overseas depends on the tax residence of the settlor. Trusts established overseas but with New Zealand resident settlors are taxable in New Zealand, and the tax can be recovered from the settlor. This prevents New Zealand resident settlors from avoiding or deferring New Zealand tax by establishing trusts overseas. It also means that trusts with little or no connection with New Zealand can become subject to New Zealand tax rules as a result of the settlor immigrating to New Zealand. 4.41 Settlors who migrate to New Zealand for the first time after settling a trust are already given some relief from the general rule. They need not pay the tax due on the trustee income. However, it may be advantageous for them to choose to do so if there are New Zealand beneficiaries. Otherwise, some distributions to those beneficiaries may be taxed at 45% instead of the beneficiary’s marginal rate. 4.42 The current rules are more likely to create extra tax costs for settlors who are returning to New Zealand, having set up a trust while non-resident. If they have been resident in New Zealand at any time between 1987 and the making of a settlement, they will be liable to tax as agent of the trustee. However, this might be partly offset by foreign tax credits, relating to tax paid directly by the trustee on the same income. 4.43 If the settlor rules were included in the exemption, it might save some compliance costs and a possibility of an extra tax charge for some returning New Zealanders. We would welcome submissions on this point. Other areas 4.44 We would like to hear of any other areas where New Zealand tax on foreign income or payments is unusually comprehensive and likely to be compensated by employers. 22 Chapter 5 OPTION TWO: HOW WOULD THE “BROAD” EXEMPTION WORK? 5.1 The broad exemption would remove New Zealand tax from all the foreign income of an eligible employee. This would have a greater effect in cases where the income is not taxed much in its country of source, and a lesser effect where the income arises in a country with a tax system similar to New Zealand’s. 5.2 The effect of the broad exemption is also dependent on the choices available to a potential employee. Examples • Lee is a New Zealander currently working in South America. After 20 years of a career in international business, he has built up an investment portfolio based in a couple of low-tax jurisdictions. He is considering jobs in Australia, the United Kingdom, United States and New Zealand. If he goes to the United Kingdom he will not be taxed on his investment income as long as he leaves it offshore. If he goes to Australia or the United States he will be taxed. If he comes back to New Zealand, he will be taxed unless the broad exemption is introduced. • Wendy is a teacher living in London, where she owns her own house. She has a small portfolio of United Kingdom shares. She takes up a temporary post in New Zealand and lets her London house. She pays United Kingdom income tax on her rental and dividend income. She is also liable for New Zealand tax on this income. Her New Zealand liability on the rental income is fully covered by the credit for the United Kingdom tax she has paid. But the New Zealand tax due on her dividend income is greater than the United Kingdom credit, because of the United Kingdom imputation and tax rate rules. Wendy therefore has some net tax to pay in New Zealand, which would be relieved under the broad exemption. 5.3 The starting point for a broad exemption would be an exemption for all foreign-sourced income arising during the period of the exemption. This could be achieved along the lines of section BD 1(2)(c) of the Income Tax Act 1994, which exempts from gross income any amount which is “a foreign-sourced amount and the taxpayer is a non-resident when it is derived”. The exemption would be extended to include any amount which is foreign sourced income and the taxpayer qualifies for the exemption when it is derived. 23 5.4 Such an exemption would cover most sorts of foreign-sourced income, but it would not deal with everything. For example, liability to deduct non-resident withholding tax does not depend on the definition of gross income in the first place. Exemption from non-resident withholding tax for mortgage payments would have to be specified separately. 5.5 Are any other specific provisions needed, in the context of a broad exemption? New investments 5.6 A broad exemption would create an incentive to increase overseas investments. One way of countering this distortion would be to provide that only sources of foreign income held at the time of entry to New Zealand qualify for the exemption. However, such a rule would increase the complexity of administering and complying with the exemption. “New sources” would have to be defined, including further investment in existing vehicles. This rule could create difficulties for ordinary investment planning. 5.7 As noted earlier, the incentive to invest overseas would diminish as the exemption period drew to an end, which is when a decision to invest in New Zealand would become more likely in any case. 5.8 We therefore do not propose to distinguish between pre-migration and post- migration foreign-sourced income, except in the case of financial arrangements, for the reasons already given. Employment income 5.9 Employment income and other income from the provision of the taxpayer’s own services would be excluded from both the broad and narrow options. Since the exemption is aimed at people coming to New Zealand to work, this is unlikely to have any practical effect in most cases. Few eligible taxpayers would retain overseas employments or consultancies. Nevertheless, the exclusion would be made explicit, to reduce the scope for avoiding tax on New Zealand earnings by recharacterising them as foreign earnings (for example, by weighting the remuneration under employment contracts with New Zealand and overseas companies in the same group). The exclusion would extend to any benefit or income which related to services or employment carried out during the exemption period. This would probably have to include share option benefits if the benefit if dependent on continuing employment. Otherwise, it would be all too easy to arrange remuneration for the New Zealand employment through a share option arrangement set up before residence commenced. 24 Chapter 6 THE TEMPORARY NATURE OF THE EXEMPTION 6.1 The point of limiting the duration of the proposed exemption is to target mobile labour that is sensitive to tax. Some people who move to work in New Zealand may decide to put roots down and stay here permanently. Putting a time limit on the exemption is a way of identifying those people who have ceased to become sensitive to New Zealand tax by virtue of their decision to remain in New Zealand on a permanent basis. 6.2 A time limit also reduces any incentive for people to favour investment overseas. Removing the exemption after a period will encourage long-term stayers to consider taking advantage of investment opportunities in New Zealand. 6.3 We suggest that mobility and tax sensitivity are likely to be much lower for people who stay here to work after the end of their first contract. What is the length of a typical contract for skilled employees in the international labour market? State sector CEO contracts are for five years. The Tax Review suggested a seven year exemption. The maximum work permit is for three years, although in practice highly skilled employees with a definite job offer may be granted permanent residence by the New Zealand Immigration Service provided they meet other immigration requirements. 25 Chapter 7 ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA 7.1 The proposed exemption is designed to make it cheaper for New Zealand businesses to attract highly skilled and experienced employees to New Zealand. This chapter examines the eligibility criteria required in order to target the exemption at this group. New residents 7.2 People coming to New Zealand for the first time are most likely to pass on extra tax costs to their employers. They would be eligible for the exemption, assuming they met the work test. Returning New Zealanders 7.3 An important question is whether the exemption should apply to returning New Zealanders as well as to people who are tax resident for the first time. On the one hand, it could be argued that this gives to New Zealanders who have left the country a concession which is not granted to those who have stayed here and contributed to the economy. On the other hand, there is an argument that denying them the concession discriminates against New Zealanders who are in a very similar position to other mobile non-residents. 7.4 Some New Zealanders considering whether to return will be just as sensitive to tax as foreigners. If they have not been tax resident in New Zealand for a significant amount of time, and have skills which are internationally in demand, they are just as mobile as foreigners. If they have acquired sources of foreign income, it is likely that they, too, will pass on their increased tax costs to New Zealand employers. 7.5 Some returning New Zealanders will be less sensitive to tax, as the decision to return to New Zealand will be made for family reasons. Nonetheless, while other factors will entice expatriates back to New Zealand, this does not mean that tax will not be a decisive factor at the margin, especially in deciding whether to return sooner rather than later. Getting highly skilled New Zealanders to return during their working lives is more valuable to New Zealand than having them return in their retirement. 26 7.6 Immigration statistics suggest that there are fewer New Zealanders than non- New Zealanders in the group of highly skilled workers coming to New Zealand. The cost of extending the exemption to returning New Zealanders is unlikely to exceed one-third of the overall cost. 2 7.7 If returning New Zealanders were excluded from the exemption, businesses could find it cheaper to choose nationalities other than returning New Zealand citizens. We have no desire to create such an incentive. If anything, returning New Zealanders are more likely to fit quickly back into New Zealand cultural and economic life. 7.8 Extending this exemption to returning New Zealanders recognises that New Zealand business benefits by hiring citizens who return after going overseas to gain skills, experience and contacts which are not available here. Who will qualify as a returning New Zealander? 7.9 To confine the exemption to those who really are tax sensitive, we propose that New Zealanders must have been non-resident for tax purposes for a period of time in order to qualify. This means, for example, that they will have had no permanent place of abode in New Zealand for that period. 7.10 It is important that the period is long enough to deter New Zealanders with large offshore investments from simply going abroad for that period in order to qualify for the exemption upon their return. We propose that the period of non-residence be ten years, or twice the length of the exemption period if that is shorter. (If the exemption period is only four years, it seems unlikely that anyone would go abroad for more than eight years in order to qualify for it). 7.11 Non-residence for tax purposes would be defined in terms of domestic law, irrespective of double tax agreements. Someone who was deemed under a double tax agreement to be non-resident in New Zealand and resident somewhere else would not qualify for the exemption if under domestic law he or she remained a New Zealand tax resident. 7.12 An individual would be able to benefit from the exemption only once. Therefore an individual who received the exemption and then left New Zealand would not be able to receive the exemption again if he or she returned after the specified period of time. Otherwise, it might be possible for people to string together exemptions in several countries and repeat the pattern, never paying tax on foreign-sourced income at all. 2 In 2002, 3887 New Zealand citizens aged between 25 to 50, in the category of managers, administrators and professionals, returned to New Zealand, compared with the arrival of 7242 non New Zealand citizens in the same category. 27 Previous tax residents 7.13 The exemption would apply to all returning previous tax residents who have been non-resident for the required period, and not just New Zealand citizens. People who have been in New Zealand previously as workers, students or children of people who came to work in New Zealand may now wish to return. They are just as likely as first-time residents to pass on their costs to their prospective employers. Given the rationale of the exemption, there is no reason why these people should be excluded. As with returning New Zealand citizens, a tax disincentive may be a decisive issue at the margin. Work test 7.14 The objective is to reduce the cost to business in attracting highly skilled people to work in New Zealand. To target the exemption at such individuals, it should be limited to those who actually work in New Zealand. In the absence of such requirement the exemption would potentially apply to retired people, students and long-term holiday makers. 7.15 The proposal does not aim at attracting wealthy people to New Zealand. Since it gives an exemption from tax on foreign-sourced income it does not provide any incentive to invest capital here and would be an unsuitable tool for such a purpose. 7.16 The exemption would be subject to a work test. To be eligible, people would either: • earn a set level of New Zealand-sourced income from employment, the suggested level being $70,000, just over double the average income; or • work full-time hours in employment for the whole year. 7.17 The full-time test would allow the exemption to apply to lower paid workers. Although they are less likely to have significant sources of foreign investment income, they could be affected by non-resident withholding tax and foreign investment fund rules, and even if the amounts are not large, the associated compliance costs and nuisance can be. 7.18 The qualifying income or hours must be from working for an employer who is not controlled by or associated with the taxpayer. This will prevent wealthy, non-working immigrants from obtaining the exemption by setting up a controlled company to pay themselves a salary. 7.19 A work test drafted in this way will not include the self-employed and entrepreneurs. This is because entrepreneurs and self-employed people do not have the opportunity to pass their extra tax costs on directly to New Zealand business. 28 7.20 A separate issue arises in respect of someone migrating to New Zealand to join a partnership. A partner is technically self-employed and for that reason will not be covered by the exemption. But a new partner negotiating the partnership agreement may ask to be compensated for extra tax duties at the expense of the New Zealand partnership, in much the same way as an employee. One option would be to extend the work test to include income from a partnership (excluding family partnerships). Spouses 7.21 The work test also raises issues in relation to non-working spouses who may receive foreign sourced income. Not including them in the exemption would increase the overall tax burden on the family and might undermine the effectiveness of the exemption. 7.22 We therefore propose that the work test criteria would be met if either spouse worked full-time or earned at least $70,000, provided that both are either first time residents or eligible returners. 7.23 The work test would remain at the individual level if only one spouse met the residence test. So if a couple included one worker who was a long-term New Zealand resident and one new migrant who was not a worker, neither would qualify for the exemption. Fluctuating work 7.24 If the level of New Zealand earnings fluctuated around the $70,000 mark, the individual would be able to claim the exemption for those years within the exemption period for which income was above the threshold. For example, low earnings in the second year of residence would not prevent entitlement to the exemption in the third year, if earnings were high enough. The exemption would expire by reference to the time when the person first became resident. The clock would not stop during a period when the work test was not met. 7.25 If someone was employed full-time, fluctuating income would not affect eligibility for the exemption. However, he or she would have to work full- time for the whole year for this alternative criterion to be met. International comparisons 7.26 A number of other countries limit their incentives to highly skilled employees. For example, in Belgium non-resident status is granted to non- Belgian executives or specialists who temporarily work in Belgium for an international group. Non-residents are taxed only on their Belgian-sourced income. In Finland the expatriate rules provide for a flat tax rate of 35% for those foreign employees whose work requires special knowledge. Other 29 conditions are that the monthly cash salary is at least EUR 5,800 and that the length of assignment is six to 24 months. The expatriate rules apply for a maximum 24 months from the start of the assignment and the employee must not have been resident in Finland any time during the five previous years. After that period the expatriate is taxed according to the normal rules. Implementing the eligibility tests 7.27 In implementing such an exemption, there are a couple of important principles: • If the exemption is to be effective in reducing business costs, those who are eligible must know that they are eligible at the time of agreeing their contract. • The exemption should be simple to claim, and not distracting for those to whom it is irrelevant. Self-assessment 7.28 The most obvious way to claim the exemption would be simply not to declare the exempt income. This approach is consistent with principles of self-assessment. There would be no formal claim, and no indication on the return that the exemption was being claimed. Use of the exemption by someone who was not eligible would be discovered only through audit. 7.29 On its own, this minimalist approach has a few drawbacks: • The individual would be responsible for determining whether he or she met the eligibility criteria, and may be uncertain about that. • Because the claim would be entirely in the hands of the individual, there is a risk that the exemption would not be used by all of those entitled to it. This could be dealt with by suitable notes in the return guide, but on their own such notes would be likely to stimulate mistaken claims. • There would be no data with which to monitor the take-up of the exemption. Certificate before arrival 7.30 The self-assessment approach could be enhanced by a certification requirement. Inland Revenue could issue a certificate confirming that a particular person met the residence criteria for the exemption. Final eligibility would then depend on meeting the work test, and individuals would need to decide this for themselves each year for the duration of their residence eligibility. 30 7.31 The exemption would apply only to someone who had actually received a certificate, and people could apply for a certificate before or after taking up residence. This requirement would make it easier to publicise the exemption in the return notes without encouraging mistaken claims. The certification process would also address the other two drawbacks of self-assessment alone: • It would give the potential recruit comparative certainty about eligibility for the exemption. Final eligibility would still depend on annual income from earnings, but for most tax-sensitive, internationally mobile recruits this test would be easily and obviously passed. The difficult part is the residence qualification, and this would be settled by the certificate. • Inland Revenue would be able to judge how many people are taking up the exemption. 7.32 The exemption could apply only to people arriving in New Zealand after it was introduced. Alternatively, it could apply to people already in New Zealand who would have met the residence criterion on arrival if the exemption had been in force at that time. In that case, the exemption would cover future foreign-sourced income arising in the remainder of the exemption period (treated as having begun when they arrived). 7.33 Backdating the residence criterion in this way so as to give some relief to people already in New Zealand would be justified if it relieved New Zealand business of cost. For that to happen, employers would have to renegotiate remuneration agreements, to remove those elements relating to tax. It seems rather unlikely that employers of highly skilled, mobile workers would seek to claw back a tax windfall from the employee in this way. 7.34 Nonetheless, denying the exemption to someone because they came here too soon might seem rather mean, and perhaps would harm perceptions of New Zealand’s fairness. It would be a once only cost, and might encourage some people to stay for longer than they would otherwise.

Small businesses form a more significant part of the economy in New Zealand than they do in other OECD countries. New Zealand averages around six employees per firm, whereas most other OECD countries average from ten to twenty employees. In 2000 there were nearly half a million businesses in New Zealand, 86 percent of which employed five or fewer staff. 1.2 Small businesses are important not only in number but also in the extent of their tax contribution. Self-employed individuals who work on their own and businesses that employ five or fewer staff contribute around 40 percent of business income tax revenue. Most of the remainder comes from a small number of large businesses. 1.3 Complying with the tax system is a significant contributor to business compliance costs, which are particularly burdensome for small businesses. Furthermore, as a small business grows, its number of contacts with Inland Revenue and other government departments increases dramatically. For a rapidly growing company this can be a real problem because once it begins employing staff, the number of its yearly contacts with Inland Revenue can easily double. 1.4 Small businesses say that they find it hard to budget for tax payments and that tax payments have a significant effect on their cash flows. They would like to minimise the compliance costs associated with paying tax. 1.5 Small businesses also risk exposure to use-of-money interest on underpayments of provisional tax, especially when they are required to estimate their provisional tax for the current year and their business income fluctuates. Fluctuating and seasonal income can also lead to financial difficulties when a business is required to make provisional tax payments before it has earned the income that is being taxed. 1.6 The proposals in this discussion document aim to resolve these problems by: • reducing the burden of government-imposed payroll obligations for small employers, thereby giving them more time to grow their business; • more closely aligning the payment of provisional tax with when income is earned, to reduce the financial strain that businesses face at certain times during the year; and 2 • reducing the risk that a business may be exposed to use-of-money interest. 1.7 To achieve these aims the government has had to consider a number of trade-offs in relation to the frequency of tax payments, workloads that would be placed on businesses if certain changes were made, businesses’ use of tax money versus paying tax when income is earned, and the cost to the government of implementing these proposals. We welcome feedback from businesses, their advisors and other interested parties on whether the results of the trade-offs are acceptable to them. SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS Covering part of the cost of using payroll agents (chapter 3) • The government would cover part of the costs that small employers incur when they use a payroll agent to take over their PAYE and other government-imposed payroll obligations. The subsidy could apply to as many as five employees per business. • The government would contract with payroll agents and pay the subsidy directly to those agents. • Government departments would interact directly with an employer’s payroll agent rather than the employer, thus freeing the employer to spend more time on business while giving the employer access to specialist payroll resources. • Payroll agents would largely be paid by the government to help small employers with their PAYE and other governmental obligations. • Employers could still choose whether to use a payroll agent or do the work themselves. Improving the timing and frequency of tax payments (chapter 4) • GST and provisional tax due dates would be standardised, payable on the 28th of the month. • Provisional tax would be paid with GST, which for many businesses would mean more frequent but smaller provisional tax payments. • PAYE and terminal tax payment dates would remain the same. 3 Provisional tax based on GST turnover (chapter 5) • Provisional tax would be based on a ratio of a taxpayer’s two-monthly GST- adjusted sales. It would be a voluntary option. • GST-registered taxpayers with turnover of less than $1.3 million could qualify for this option. They would have to pay both GST and provisional tax in their own right to qualify. • Provisional tax would be paid along with GST (two-monthly or six-monthly). • Businesses that adopted this method would not be subject to use-of-money interest. A discount for individuals starting a business (chapter 6) • Self-employed people would be given an incentive to pay tax in their first year of business. It would take the form of a 6.7 percent discount against their end- of-year tax liability for each dollar of tax paid during the first year. • The discount would apply to individual taxpayers in the year before they are required to pay provisional tax. • They would receive the discount only once and their entitlement to it would lapse once they became a regular provisional taxpayer. • Individuals who started a business would be able to choose whether or not to receive the discount and in which year to receive it. • The discount would be 6.7 percent of the lesser of the amount paid during the year or 105 percent of the end-of-year residual income tax liability. Electronic tools to answer questions on employment and residence status (chapter 7) • Inland Revenue would provide on-line tools to clarify employment and resident status, which would reduce compliance costs for employers. Key questions 1.8 Before making final decisions on whether to proceed with the various proposals discussed here, the government wishes to seek the views of interested people. Key areas in which we seek feedback are: • proposals in the discussion document that should or should not be adopted and why; • whether the proposed measures deliver substantial compliance cost reduction benefits; and 4 • other possible simplification measures for small businesses that the government should consider. Application date of the proposals 1.9 The proposals could be included in legislation introduced into Parliament in 2004. The actual application dates would depend on the final features of the proposals as well as the administrative work involved in implementing the changes. Furthermore, it is unlikely that all the changes could be implemented in the same income year. Finally, one of the proposals would affect payroll agents, so their views on application dates will be taken into account. Communicating your views 1.10 The government invites submissions on the proposals set out in this discussion document. Although the document often identifies specific issues for consultation, we are interested in views on any of the issues raised. Submissions should be made by 31 October 2003. 1.11 Written submissions should be addressed to: Tax simplification C/- General Manager Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 WELLINGTON 1.12 If making a submission in electronic form please put “Making tax easier for small businesses” in the subject line.

Because New Zealand is a country of mainly small and medium-sized businesses, special attention must be devoted to them. 2.2 We asked Inland Revenue to consult with these businesses, to better understand the common compliance cost concerns they face and to get feedback about initial solutions to those concerns. We wanted to know what small and medium-sized businesses saw as the priority issues – to ensure the issues the government progressed were those of real concern to them. We also wanted to know more about the compliance cost problems facing those who start up a business or try to grow a business. 2.3 It was important to ensure that businesses outside the Wellington region had an opportunity to take part in the research, both to express their concerns and present their ideas for improvements. Although a telephone survey covered the entire country, focus groups and other meetings were deliberately regionally focussed. 2.4 Our initial approach to the research was to identify as many simplification options as possible. The list was then narrowed following consideration and initial consultation. Examples of items that were removed include depreciation issues – the subject of a separate review – and the tax rules on balance day adjustments – which would result in relatively low gains but significant revenue costs. 2.5 Extensive research was undertaken, both formally and informally. As a whole, the research represents the most comprehensive consultation on the tax compliance costs faced by small and medium-sized businesses that we have undertaken. On our behalf Inland Revenue: • Held 15 formal focus groups with taxpayers as well as a number of focus groups with tax agents. The focus groups had an independent facilitator and were attended by Inland Revenue staff. • Held a number of informal focus groups and meetings with small businesses. • Commissioned a market research company to conduct telephone surveys involving 1611 businesses and 400 tax agents. This quantitative research covered 619 employers, with slightly over 50 percent being small employers. • Had five face-to-face interviews with tax agents. 6 • Placed on Inland Revenue’s website a self-completion survey on compliance costs that attracted 239 responses. • Held meetings with 30 small businesses. Senior managers of Inland Revenue were involved in these meetings, which ensured that they better understood the problems faced by small businesses. • Consulted with various industry representatives such as Business New Zealand and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand. 2.6 We would like to thank all those who participated for their generous contribution of time and ideas, especially those small businesses that sacrificed time running their business to discuss their concerns with the government. Findings from the research 2.7 It is important to bear in mind that small businesses have differing views on tax issues, and all these views have to be taken into account. A business’s approach to tax may vary from highly organised to less organised. What works for those who do their accounting work early, routinely and as information comes to hand will not work for those who rarely plan for tax matters and who collate and file returns at the same time. 2.8 The telephone surveys provided robust information on the compliance cost problems facing small businesses. The businesses consulted were asked to identify the organisations that impose compliance costs on them and rank the compliance costs in order of impact. 2.9 Not unexpectedly, the research shows that having to comply with tax obligations is clearly the largest contributor to business compliance costs, with 70 percent of those surveyed considering tax to have the biggest impact. The significance of this impact can also be judged by comparing tax compliance costs with those associated with other requirements imposed by the government – such as ACC, which was rated by only 12 percent of those surveyed as having the biggest overall impact. 2.10 On tax-related compliance costs, respondents expressed concern about a wide range of tax issues. Although some issues were clearly ranked higher than others, no single issue was dominant. Figure 1 shows the range and extent of these concerns. 7 Figure 1: Tax compliance costs – what businesses see as a problem 36% 34% 30% 26% 24% 22% 18% 43% 0%20%40%60%80%100% Time filling in forms Provisional payments not aligned with cashflow Good compliance history not considered Penalties and interest Difficulty getting information or help Having to employ an accountant Too much information IRD process too slow Not being able to interact electronically Some other issues None Don't know 2.11 Many of these concerns seem to reflect an underlying view on the part of small businesses that they are unpaid tax collectors. Some small businesses are of the view, for example, that because they collect PAYE on behalf of the government and are not paid for this work, they should be treated leniently if they pay late. In response, a tax system which minimises the compliance costs of all taxpayers sometimes necessitates placing obligations on people to collect tax and enforcing those obligations. For example, employers help others to pay tax by deducting PAYE from the salaries or wages of their staff. There is some compensation in that employers have the use of the deducted tax for a short period before it must be paid to Inland Revenue, although for some this benefit does not cover their actual PAYE running costs. 2.12 Other issues identified by the research relate to the need for more flexible tax administrative processes that take account of taxpayers’ changing circumstances; the need for the tax system to be more tolerant of mistakes; the need for less severe penalties and interest; and taxpayers’ need for assistance in using technology-based solutions. These issues have either been addressed through recent legislative reforms or are being dealt with through administrative initiatives, so they are not considered in this discussion document. For example, the government has recently enacted reforms to the late payment penalty to enable Inland Revenue to take into account a taxpayer’s previous compliance history. Similarly, the reported problem of taxpayers having difficulty getting information or help from Inland Revenue has reduced as a result of the improvement in call centre performance over the last two years. 2.13 Concerns relating to fringe benefit tax are being considered as part of the specific review of the tax, and will be the subject of a forthcoming discussion document. 8 SMALL BUSINESS COMPLIANCE COSTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES An OECD survey 1 on compliance costs in ten countries for 1998 and 1999 sought respondents’ views on employment, tax and environment regulations and the direct administrative costs of complying with those regulations for small businesses. The survey found that: • On average, small businesses spent US$27,500 a year (US$4,100 per employee) on compliance costs, of which 46 percent related to tax, 35 percent to employment regulations and the balance of 19 percent to environmental regulations. • The regressive nature of compliance costs seen in other surveys was confirmed. Smaller businesses (0-19 employees) spent on average $US4,600 per employee per year, medium-sized businesses (20-49 employees) $US1,500, and large businesses (50- 500 employees) US$900. There appear to be three reasons for this: the scale of the costs, their largely fixed nature, and diversion of entrepreneurial attention from business activity to compliance with regulations. • New Zealand was at the lowest end of the scale and had the lowest aggregate annual compliance cost per small business (US$8900) and the third lowest cost per employee (US$2,600). • When the compliance costs associated with tax regulation are considered separately, New Zealand had the second lowest tax compliance cost per employee for small businesses (one with fewer than 20 employees). For tax compliance costs per employee for larger firms (20-49 and 50-499 employees), New Zealand ranked in the middle of the ten countries. Figure 2 shows the effect of company size on compliance costs for the countries participating in the survey.

On-line services for businesses Most information needed by small businesses can be found on Inland Revenue’s website at www.ird.govt.nz. Businesses can now file income tax, GST and PAYE returns on-line and pay tax electronically. They can use on-line calculators for tasks such as finding out the depreciation rate for business assets and calculating fringe benefit tax, and they can send and receive password-secure correspondence. Business tax advice Inland Revenue’s business advisory services range from helping businesses with record- keeping through to assisting them when their first GST and PAYE returns are due. Inland Revenue is continuing to make improvements to the services, including tailoring them to meet different businesses’ needs. Streamlining start-stop processes Inland Revenue is streamlining its processes for dealing with small businesses when they stop or start employing staff, or cease operation. Improvements will see, for example, a faster departmental response to businesses when they stop employing staff, which will reduce the number of unnecessary returns that are sent to them. Industry partnerships Over a year ago Inland Revenue began an “Industry Partnership” initiative aimed at building relationships with industries in which a significant number of businesses have tax compliance concerns. The idea is to work with businesses and individuals to identify barriers to compliance, explore ways of streamlining compliance for them and tailor services to improve compliance. So far, relationships have been formed with the electrical, painting, agricultural contracting, entrepreneurial, hairdressing, collision repair, automotive repair, plumbing, and bus and coach driving industries. 10 Chapter 3 COVERING PART OF THE COST OF USING PAYROLL AGENTS Proposed policy • The government would cover part of the costs that small employers incur when they use a payroll agent to take over their PAYE and other government-imposed payroll obligations. The subsidy could apply to as many as five employees per business. • The government would contract with payroll agents and pay the subsidy directly to those agents. • Government departments would interact directly with an employer’s payroll agent rather than the employer, thus freeing the employer to spend more time on business while giving the employer access to specialist payroll resources. • Payroll agents would largely be paid by the government to help small employers with their PAYE and other governmental obligations. • Employers could still choose whether to use a payroll agent or do the work themselves. 3.1 The PAYE system was introduced in 1958 and today collects about 46 percent of the tax collected by Inland Revenue. Introduction of the PAYE system effectively moved many income tax obligations from employees to their employers. Employers were thought to be more efficient and were compensated for this burden through the right to retain the deducted PAYE until it had to be paid to Inland Revenue. 3.2 Over the last ten or so years the PAYE system has undergone many changes. They include the introduction of the ACC earner levy, child support and student loan payment obligations and replacement of the monthly summary and year-end square-up process with the employer monthly schedule. 3.3 Apart from the important commercial decisions involved when a business takes on its first employee, it also accepts a series of government-imposed obligations, including deducting PAYE from employees’ wages. This can be a large step for small businesses as the impact of government-imposed obligations is often directly borne by business owners. Furthermore, the costs tend to be regressive, meaning they fall disproportionately on small businesses. 11 How PAYE is deducted Employers are required to deduct tax from payments of salary and wages to employees and pay it to Inland Revenue on the 20th of the month in the case of small employers, and twice monthly in the case of large employers. The deducted PAYE is credited towards the income tax liability of the employee. As it represents tax payment by the employee, the employer must hold it in trust. 3.4 Significant fixed costs associated with PAYE are incurred when a business takes on its first employee. They include learning the PAYE system, completing returns and paying PAYE. Because most small businesses have two or fewer staff, these fixed costs are likely to be their main compliance costs. They are also difficult to reduce. 3.5 Figure 3 shows the increasing contact a growing small business has with Inland Revenue through its early years of growth: moving from income tax through to paying GST and, finally, PAYE as an employer. Figure 3: Increasing contact with Inland Revenue as a business grows 2 3.6 The government is especially concerned about the fact that when a small business takes on its first employee it receives an additional 19 pieces of paper from Inland Revenue and sends an additional 12 pieces of paper to Inland Revenue. This level of contact is high for small employers and represents a substantial increase over the level of contact that a small business without employees has with Inland Revenue. The significance of the level of contact must not be overstated, however. It is not a robust measure of the compliance burden imposed on a taxpayer overall, since 2 The figure represents an average of actual mailings to GST and PAYE payers. Actual mailings will vary between taxpayers. (For example, exporters who regularly receive GST refunds will get more assessment notices than others.) Special information mailings, such as the annual issue of tax tables, are estimated and there is an assumed average of one automatic seizure notice for employee arrears. PAYE detail excludes FBT information as this applies to relatively few employers. Typical annual mailings between small business and IRD (Cumulative) 3 6 18 37 2 5 11 23 0 10 20 30 40 60 70 Income Tax and Provisional Tax and GSTand PAYE Increasing business activity and tax responsibilities Cumulative annual mail From IRDTo IRD 5 11 29 60 50 12 many contacts simply provide necessary forms or information and make little demand on a small employer’s time. 3.7 In recent years there has been increasing scope for the use of information technology to provide significant compliance cost benefits. It previously made little difference in time and effort whether the PAYE process was completed by a small employer or a payroll business. Now the marginal cost for a payroll business doing the PAYE electronically for an additional employee is very low, but the cost to a small employer of doing that work manually continues to be high. 3.8 The scope for increased use of technology has not been reflected in a corresponding increase in its application in this area, however. Although around 70 percent of employers with one to five employees have Internet access, only four percent file their employer monthly schedules electronically. Moreover, only 18 percent of all employers file their employer monthly schedules electronically, and many of these are large employers, who are required to file electronically. 3.9 The opportunity presented by payroll agencies to allow small businesses to move their focus from tax compliance to running the business is not reflected in the statistics. Only eight to ten percent of employers use an accountant, tax agent or payroll business to complete their PAYE, although payroll businesses indicate they are trying to increase use of their services by small employers. 3.10 The government believes these potential gains should be realised. We want small employers to focus their efforts on their business, rather than tax, and payroll agencies to use their skill and economies of scale to help small employers. What business says 3.11 Preliminary research showed employers were affected by a wide variety of government agencies other than Inland Revenue, but they were required to have a high level of interaction with Inland Revenue. A common concern expressed by many employers was that they were unpaid tax collectors for Inland Revenue. 3.12 Many small businesses consider the time spent keeping up to date with PAYE and calculating deductions could be better spent running their business. They also commented that their payroll obligations were met outside core working hours, affecting the business owner’s time. 13 3.13 The PAYE system is an example of a tax system designed for a “stable state”: it is easy to comply with if a business’s circumstances do not change, but costs increase when they do. Our research revealed a high level of support for the current PAYE system from employers who maintained a stable state. 3.14 Employers were less accepting of their child support and student loan collection responsibilities. Much of their frustration and resentment related to their forced involvement in the private affairs of their employees, and the effort required in being involved. This is a significant issue given that only about ten percent of employers deduct child support. Fringe benefit tax was also an area of concern for larger employers, although, once again, only a minority of employers are affected by these rules. 3.15 Beyond our consultation with small employers, other research shows that the costs associated with the PAYE system are regressive, meaning they fall disproportionately on smaller businesses, which tend to have manual rather than computerised systems. 3 Furthermore, the payroll and PAYE work of a small business is often undertaken by the entrepreneur rather than a skilled wages clerk. 3.16 Our conclusion is that the solution to the current employer concerns is not further simplification of the PAYE system, since it is likely that would deliver only marginal improvements. Instead, a different approach is required. Proposal 3.17 The government is committed to ensuring its impact on a business’s decision to become an employer and then, later, to take on further employees is minimised. Therefore we propose moving much of the government-imposed payroll obligations from small employers by paying payroll agents to undertake the work for a certain number of employees. This would help cover the payroll-related obligations that the government imposes through Inland Revenue, the Accident Compensation Corporation, Statistics New Zealand, the Ministry of Social Development and the courts. The payroll agents involved would have a contract with employers and the government. The role of the payroll agent under the proposal is shown in figure 4. 3 Compliance costs of business taxes in New Zealand, Cedric Sandford and John Hasseldine, Institute of Policy Studies of Victoria University of Wellington, 1992. Sandford and Hasseldine found that PAYE compliance costs are significantly regressive and tend to be concentrated among employers with fewer than five employees, who accounted for 65 percent of the total PAYE compliance costs. 14 Figure 4: Role of payroll agent under proposed legislation 3.18 Employers’ use of a payroll agent would be voluntary. Small employers could choose to continue to meet their various payroll obligations and be compensated for this through the retention of PAYE, or use a payroll agent who meets those obligations on their behalf, but forgo the retention of the PAYE. Losing the benefits of retaining PAYE deductions may not be a significant problem for small employers, since they have indicated in discussions that that the benefit of retaining PAYE has not equalled the work the PAYE system imposes. 3.19 Those who consider that retaining the PAYE is adequate compensation for the work involved would be able to continue deducting and paying PAYE to Inland Revenue. 3.20 The proposal is limited to smaller employers because they bear the highest compliance burden and have the least access to skilled help. It is intended, if possible, to apply the proposal to the first five employees of a business. 3.21 As table 1 shows, under the proposal, 71 percent of all employers should be able to employ a payroll agent at no cost. The payment would not stop when an employer took on a sixth employee but would be capped at the five- employee level. The employer would be required to pay the payroll agent the balance of any costs. 15 3.22 The payment would stop only if a business became classed as a large employer, which is defined as one that deducts over $100,000 in PAYE and specified superannuation contribution withholding tax a year (having about ten or more employees). On this basis, a further 22 percent of employers would benefit from a payment covering part of the cost of employing a payroll agent.

Payroll agents might include existing payroll service providers, accountants and other tax professionals, and anyone providing business services. 3.24 The proposal takes into account the privacy and secrecy concerns that many businesses have. It is not proposed to increase the information provided to Inland Revenue, and the current legislative constraints on the PAYE information that Inland Revenue can provide to other government departments would remain. Limits on government subsidy 3.25 The proposal involves a considerable commitment to helping small employers with their payroll-related government obligations. Table 2 gives indicative figures showing the current level of benefit provided to employers through retention of PAYE, and a possible direct level of subsidy that would result if the proposal were implemented. The level of subsidy that the government would provide would be announced before employers engaged a payroll agency, and any future changes to the subsidy level would be signalled in advance. 16 Table 2: Level of current annual benefits from PAYE retention and possible level of direct payment Number of employees Assumed annual PAYE Current benefit from retention of PAYE Possible new payroll agent funding ($2.50 subsidy per employee) 1 $10,000 $45 $130 2 $20,000 $89 $260 5 $50,000 $223 $650 10 $100,000 $445 $650 15 $150,000 $668 $0 Note: Current benefit to employers from retention of PAYE is calculated at an interest rate of 5% net of tax and with employees paid weekly. Net benefit to employers varies with the pay- day assumption applied. The information presented is indicative only; for example, the amount of subsidy would be the subject of negotiation. 3.26 The cost of implementing the proposal is highly sensitive to the following factors: • the number of employers who ultimately take up the proposal; • the frequency that their employees are paid; • the composition of employers who use this option – small employers with one or two employees may require a higher subsidy to cover the high fixed costs of undertaking the payroll function, whereas larger employers may require a lower subsidy; and • the amount per employee a payroll agent is paid. 3.27 In the end, the desirability of promoting the use of payroll agents by small businesses will have to be balanced against the funding available to do so. Therefore it may prove necessary to reduce the number of employees per employer, or the amount paid for each employee. How the proposal would work 3.28 Employers already use payroll agents, and nothing major in that relationship – or in the relationship of payroll agents and Inland Revenue – would change as a result of implementing the proposal. The small employer 3.29 Each pay-day the employer would have to pay gross wages to a payroll agent and provide the necessary supporting wage book details. The responsibility for PAYE would move from the employer to the payroll agent, although the employer would still have some responsibility for ensuring the accuracy of information provided, including, for example, information concerning new employees and those who leave. The payroll agent would also have various 17 other responsibilities such as answering information requests from government departments. The administering department 3.30 Although the government has not yet decided who should administer the contracts with payroll agents, the administrator would have two roles. The first would be to oversee the registration process. This is likely to involve ensuring that a prospective payroll agent: • has approval from the various government departments that the agent meets their individual information technology requirements and other requirements; and • is of good character. 3.31 The second role of the administering department would be to pay payroll agents for their work and audit compliance by payroll agents with their contract. The payroll agent 3.32 The core of the proposal is that payroll agents would register with the administering department to help small employers with their PAYE and other payroll obligations in return for payment from the government. 3.33 The payroll agent’s role in helping a small employer would be to: • ensure the employer pays the gross wages and provides the payroll information to the payroll agent each pay-day; • calculate and deduct PAYE, student loan and child support payments and any deductions required by Inland Revenue, the courts, or other government departments; • pay employees their net wages on their pay-day; • file the employer monthly schedule and forward the PAYE deducted to Inland Revenue when required; • answer queries from Inland Revenue, the Accident Compensation Corporation, Statistics New Zealand and other government departments; • undertake any actions instructed by a government department – for example, if an employee does not provide a valid IRD number Inland Revenue might instruct that a non-declaration rate of PAYE applies and the payroll agent would be expected to apply this rate; • check that employees have valid IRD numbers; and • link and de-link employers for whom they are responsible in a timely manner. 18 Other government departments 3.34 Businesses are legally required to provide information to Statistics New Zealand, the Ministry of Social Development and ACC. 3.35 The legality of collecting information direct from the agent would need to be worked through. Also, to ensure that government departments did not contact employers directly if the employer had a payroll agent, the administering department would need to keep a list of payroll agents and their clients and make this information available to departments. 3.36 The proposal would potentially remove the requirement for small businesses to complete the quarterly employment survey provided additional information such as hours worked and hourly pay rate for each employee was provided by the payroll agent to Statistics New Zealand. If enough small businesses engaged a payroll agent and, therefore, provided a statistically robust sample, it should be possible to remove all small businesses from the requirement to provide quarterly employment survey information. 3.37 Payroll agents could also remove the requirement for employers to make benefit debt deductions from salary and wages and forward the payment to the Ministry of Social Development. There may also be some limited scope to reduce the information requests of employers to verify benefit entitlement. 3.38 Not all information required by other government departments relates to payroll information and could be obtained through a payroll agent. Therefore contacts with employers would remain, albeit at a reduced level. Benefits of the proposal 3.39 The principal benefit of the proposal is that it would allow small employers to devote more time to running and growing their businesses. Less time would be taken up by tax and other payroll issues. 3.40 Other benefits would be: • Increased accuracy of pay calculations. The calculation of an employee’s pay can be complex, and it is likely that the payroll agent could also help employers with these calculations. • Increased accuracy of PAYE calculation. All parties would benefit from the increased accuracy in PAYE calculation provided by payroll agents and their application of information technology. Employees would benefit by receiving the correct net pay each pay-day, reducing the need for a year-end personal tax summary or return filing to square up mistakes. Employers would gain through being removed from the risk of penalties for non-compliance, such as late payment penalties, and the government would benefit from the accompanying increase in voluntary compliance and possible reduction in processing costs. 19 • Reduced risk of PAYE payment default. Employers generally use PAYE deductions to run their business, even though it is money held in trust, until it must be paid to Inland Revenue. Sometimes an employer may not be in a position to pay the deducted PAYE to Inland Revenue, in which case penalties and recovery action will follow, with a possible significant impact on the small business involved. The requirement that the gross wages be paid to the payroll agent would reduce this risk. • Reduced bias against those with child support and student loan obligations. Some employers dislike collecting child support and student loan payments on behalf of their employees. The problem would be reduced if payroll agents did the job. • Efficient communication. Payroll agents would be required to communicate with government departments electronically, thus minimising administrative costs for the government and reducing re-work by all in resolving errors common to paper-based systems, such as transposition errors. 3.41 There may also be other, less tangible benefits. For example, the proposal would establish a regular link between payroll agents and small businesses. There may be opportunities for payroll agents to leverage off this service to provide other business services – for example, advising on occupational safety and health standards or establishing good employment practices. 3.42 Payroll agents might, over time, be able to facilitate better communication between the government and small employers and, possibly, between small employers. For example, they could raise with the government improvement that could be made by different departments in the efficiency of their processes. Payroll agents could also become a conduit for improving small business networks as they identified possible beneficial linkages. Risks of the proposal 3.43 A number of risks are associated with the proposal. 3.44 The first is that the government subsidy might simply benefit payroll agents and not be passed on to small employers by way of low or no fees for the services provided. The government would minimise this risk by considering the issue in negotiation with payroll agents. 3.45 The second risk is that the impact of the subsidy might distort the market by encouraging the use of payroll agents over other alternatives such as the increased use of payroll software. Many employers are likely to choose to continue to administer PAYE themselves, and because they use software, the government considers this risk minimal. 3.46 There is a third risk that individual employers may begin to feel locked into using a payroll agent. The government would welcome views on the scale of this risk. 20 3.47 Finally, there is a risk that a payroll agent might default on a significant tax payment. Submissions 3.48 Because this proposal was developed later than the others there has been no formal research on the proposal, especially quantitative market research. For this reason the government would particularly welcome views on this proposal, including: • whether the proposal will provide significant benefits to small employers; • the key costing factors as they apply to small businesses or payroll agents to allow the government to fine-tune its costing and minimise the need to adopt fiscal constraints; and • the extent to which employers might feel they were locked into using a payroll agent, and the associated costs to the employer if the number of employees increased beyond the level the government might subsidise. 21 Chapter 4 IMPROVING THE TIMING AND FREQUENCY OF TAX PAYMENTS Proposed policy • GST and provisional tax due dates would be standardised, payable on the 28th of the month. • Provisional tax would be paid with GST, which for many businesses would mean more frequent but smaller provisional tax payments. • PAYE and terminal tax payment dates would remain the same. 4.1 A small business paying PAYE and GST has 22 dates 4 on which tax has to be paid during the year, with payments falling due on three different dates in the month: one on the seventh – the due date for provisional tax, the 20th – the due date for PAYE, and the end of the month – the due date for GST. 4.2 The government has previously considered this issue but it has been difficult to make a decision because there are strong reasons supporting both more frequent payment dates – mainly issues of cash flow and work-flow management – and less frequent payment dates and, therefore, less contact with Inland Revenue for provisional tax purposes. For this reason we have looked to our market research and consultation to provide guidance as to ways to improve both the frequency of tax payment and the dates on which tax is paid. 5 The research focussed on improving the timing of GST and provisional tax payment and the best date or dates in the month for the payment of these taxes. 4.3 The consultation showed that small businesses generally supported aligning provisional tax payments with GST payments, with the due date for this combined payment being the end of the month to assist with budgeting. This would result in three fewer payment dates a year. 4 12 (monthly) PAYE due dates, six (two-monthly) GST due dates, three provisional tax due dates, and one terminal tax due date. 5 Aligning tax payment dates has been proposed by a number of reviews. The Ministerial Panel on Business Compliance Costs, which reported in November 1998, and the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance, which reported in December 1998, both recommended that the government investigate amalgamating tax payment dates. The government discussion document Less taxing tax, released in 1999, outlined proposals to align tax payment dates to one date, either the fifth, 20th or last working day of the month. From this work the government concluded that the problem could be resolved only by undertaking consultation and market research on the matter. 22 4.4 We therefore propose to make provisional tax payable with GST and to standardise the due date for the payment of provisional tax and GST, making it the 28th of the month. This would also assist the proposal discussed in chapter 5, to base provisional tax on a percentage of GST-adjusted sales. What business says Frequency of payment 4.5 Initial consultation with small businesses revealed very strong support for the concept of aligning the payment dates of various taxes, with two key themes emerging: • Many business operators expressed the desire to pay provisional tax more often. • Relatively few wanted to reduce their GST filing frequency. 4.6 These views were somewhat surprising given that a common concern of business was the high volume of interactions they have with Inland Revenue each year. Quarterly payment of GST and provisional tax The government’s initial starting solution was, in fact, to reduce interaction with Inland Revenue by suggesting small businesses file and pay GST less often – perhaps quarterly, as the Australians do. We researched aligning the payment of provisional tax with GST and having both payments due on a quarterly basis, but the research showed majority support for no change in the GST filing frequency. A key concern on the part of the businesses consulted was that such a change would result in a delay in receiving GST refunds. Nevertheless, quarterly payments do hold some appeal to the government, and submissions on this matter would be welcome. 4.7 The research showed the position of unchanged frequency of GST and more frequent payment of provisional tax reflected the view that: • Provisional tax, which requires the payment of three large instalments four months apart, must be diligently budgeted for. For many this is a challenge, and they think it would be easier to pay smaller amounts more frequently, reducing the chance that the tax money will be spent on something else. • Regular GST filing provides some benefits that would be diminished if a longer filing period were adopted. These benefits include: – regularly keeping bookwork up to date (including invoicing and debtor control); – regularly monitoring cash flow and profitability; 23 – being able to remember the detail of transaction within the two month period; and – a relatively short period to wait for GST refunds when a large capital item is purchased or when seasonal cash flow problems are encountered. 4.8 Because of the apparent support for aligning provisional tax payment with GST payment, the concept of aligning the GST and provisional tax dates was tested in the market research. Businesses were also asked what payment frequency they thought would be appropriate for the payment of GST and provisional tax. There was a great deal of support for tying provisional tax payments to GST and for both payments being made every two months. This is not surprising as 63 percent of GST-registered persons file GST every two months. There was much less support for paying GST quarterly, or even less frequently. Table 3 summarises the position. Table 3: Ideal frequency of GST and provisional tax payments Frequency % of businesses surveyed Every month 16 Every two months/six times a year 50 Every three months/quarterly 22 Every four months/three times a year 6 Every six months/twice a year 4 Once a year/annually 1 Other/don’t know 1 Total 100 Alignment of payment dates 4.9 Our consultation to date with small and medium-sized businesses shows that 79 percent of the businesses surveyed support a single payment date for all taxes, with 87 percent of small employers supporting a single payment date. 4.10 Businesses were asked which date in the month they would prefer to be set as the due date. At this point the consensus ceased. No one date was liked by the majority of those surveyed, although there was a strong preference for a payment date late in the month rather than early in the month, with 43 percent of those surveyed supporting the last day of the month as a due date. The results are outlined in table 4. 24 Table 4: Preferred single payment date Preferred single payment date % of businesses surveyed Last day in the month/30th 43 21st to 29th days of the month 15 20th day of the month 28 Between 2nd and 20th days of the month 7 1st day of the month 2 Don’t know 3 Would not like having one payment date 2 Total 100 4.11 More detailed analysis showed that small employers were the group most likely to support this option, while businesses with no employees are least likely to support it. Nevertheless, even in this case support for one payment date was high. Of the non-employer businesses surveyed, 76 percent rated the concept of one payment date at least a six out of ten as an idea. Finally, businesses that considered their biggest compliance cost to be provisional tax payments not being aligned to their cash flow were more likely than average to favour this option. 4.12 Although support for one payment date remained, some small businesses commented that it would put financial pressure on their cash flows. There was also comment that a single payment date for all the main taxes (GST, PAYE, fringe benefit tax and provisional tax) would also concentrate the compliance effort for businesses, tax agents and Inland Revenue into a short period of time. 4.13 Although there was support for a payment date being the 20th of the month, this date is not being proposed as half of businesses surveyed believed it would be more difficult to file GST returns on time if the payment date were changed to the 20th. The tax agents surveyed were even more concerned, with 64 percent saying that it would be more difficult for their clients who file on a payments basis to pay on the 20th. Sixty-one percent considered it would be more difficult for their clients who file on an invoice basis to pay on time. 4.14 Separate payment frequency proposals were tested in relation to PAYE. The first idea was that small employers file only every second month. The second idea was that fringe benefit tax be included on the PAYE form and payable along with PAYE. Reaction to both these concepts were relatively positive, although for a number of reasons they are not proposed at this time (including their implications for child support payment transfers). 25 4.15 We also considered whether all taxes paid by small and medium-sized businesses could be aligned to one date. We rejected this proposal on the basis that neither monthly payment of GST nor two-monthly payment of PAYE was feasible. In the latter case we were concerned about the delay in payment affecting those receiving child support payments and those repaying student loans. The size of any resulting payment was also of concern. 4.16 We concluded that there may be merit in aligning taxes of a similar nature. For example, the employment-related taxes, PAYE and fringe benefit tax, are currently due on the 20th, except for the final quarter’s fringe benefit tax return, which is due on 31 May, to allow employers more time to calculate their final liability. The question now is whether there is merit in aligning the taxes that vary with cash flow – GST and provisional tax. International comparisons Businesses in New Zealand pay provisional tax three times a year, relatively infrequently compared with businesses in other countries. In Australia, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States businesses are required to pay provisional tax four times a year, and in Canada and Sweden businesses are required to make monthly instalments. Individuals tend to pay tax less frequently than businesses. Individuals in three countries out of the seven surveyed pay tax four times a year. Individuals are required to make 12 instalments of tax in France and Sweden (although in France they have the option of making two instalments). Australia and the United Kingdom require only two instalments. In New Zealand, individual taxpayers who pay provisional tax are required to make three payments a year. The due date for the payment of provisional tax also varies, although the 15th is the most common, having been adopted in Canada, France and the United States. Only Germany, France and the United States have the same due date for individuals and companies. The proposed changes 4.17 It is proposed that GST-registered businesses generally pay provisional tax at the same time as they make their GST payments and that the due date for this combined payment be the 28th of the month. This change would result in the following: • Businesses that pay GST every two months would pay provisional tax every two months. • Businesses that pay GST every six months would also pay provisional tax every six months. • For those paying GST monthly, application of the principle would result in monthly payment of tax. We are concerned about the compliance costs associated with more frequent payments. We are therefore proposing that this group pay provisional tax two-monthly. We are also concerned about the impact of two-monthly payment on 26 the largest corporates, so the government is prepared to consider alternative payment options for this group as well. • Non-registered taxpayers whose turnover exceeds $1.3 million would be required to pay provisional tax every two months, on the 28th of June, August, October, December, February and April. • Other businesses and individuals that are not registered for GST would pay provisional tax every six months. 4.18 The 28th is being proposed as the due date, since small businesses prefer a date towards the end of the month for purposes of cash flow. Rules can be formulated for when the 28th falls on a Saturday or Sunday. The present due date for GST reverts to the earlier working date, being the Friday. Under this proposal the due date for payment would move to the Monday, which we consider small businesses would find is an easier rule to understand and comply with. 4.19 Table 5 sets out the current and proposed systems for payment of provisional tax and GST and the number of taxpayers who would be affected by the proposed changes. Table 5: Current and proposed systems Class of provisional taxpayer Number of taxpayers affected Current system New system Businesses with taxable supplies over $250,000 or that choose two-monthly payments 54,000 GST paid monthly or two monthly on last working day. Provisional tax paid three times a year on 7th GST paid monthly or two- monthly on 28th of every month or every two months and provisional tax paid along with GST on the 28th of every second month. Businesses paying GST on six-monthly basis (whose turnover does not exceed $250,000) 25,000 GST paid every six months Provisional tax paid three times a year on 7th GST and provisional tax paid twice a year on 28th of October and April or their GST period Non-GST-registered businesses with turnover over $1.3 million 358 Provisional tax paid three times a year on 7th Provisional tax paid six times a year on the 28th of every second month Businesses with taxable supplies over $24 million 1,620 GST paid monthly on last working day. Provisional tax paid three times a year on 7th GST paid on 28th of every month and provisional tax paid along with GST on 28th of every second month Non-registered businesses and individual provisional taxpayers 171,000 Provisional tax paid three times a year on 7th Provisional tax paid twice a year, on 28th of October and April 27 4.20 The alignment of payment dates for provisional tax and GST, if it were to proceed, would have to apply to all businesses. It could not be optional, since the complexity of an alternative payment date system on top of the current GST and provisional tax rules would simply be too complex, both for taxpayers and Inland Revenue. 4.21 Figures 5 and 6 show how the change in timing of payments would affect a two-monthly GST filer. The taxpayer is an individual whose taxable supplies are $300,000 and who pays $9,259 in GST and $17,270 in provisional tax a year.

The taxpayer is a sole trader with $70,000 of taxable supplies who pays $4,320 in GST and $5,963 total in provisional tax a year. 28 Figure 7: Current payment profile for six-monthly GST filer 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 AprilMayJuneJulyAugSeptOctNovDecJanFebMarchApril Due date Liability $ Figure 8: Proposed payment profile for six-monthly GST filer 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 AprilMayJuneJulyAugSeptOctNovDecJanFebMarchApril Due date Liability $ Prov tax GST 4.23 Figures 9 and 10 show how the change would affect an individual who is not registered for GST.

We have considered the options of keeping the current three provisional tax payments dates for these groups or moving them either to two payment dates or six payment dates. 4.25 Having six payment dates would mean that these taxpayers’ payments would be more closely aligned to when the relevant income is earned, although this benefit seems small. For example, taxpayers who have just exceeded the $2,500 residual income tax threshold are currently required to pay provisional tax of about $835 on three provisional tax payment dates. With six provisional payment dates the amount due on each due date would reduce to about $420. Their compliance costs would increase significantly as a result of their increased contact with Inland Revenue, an increase that would be only partially offset by two of those payment dates aligning with GST every six months. 4.26 Keeping three payment dates would prevent GST-registered businesses in this group of taxpayers from easily qualifying for the proposal outlined in chapter 5, to base provisional tax on GST sales. We have therefore concluded that two provisional tax payment dates a year is the better option for this group. It is important to note that the two payment dates proposed are the compulsory payment dates, and there is nothing stopping taxpayers who want to make earlier or more frequent payments from doing so. 4.27 This issue will be the subject of further market research, to ensure that the assumption is valid that this group of taxpayers is more concerned about the compliance costs associated with payment than with problems relating to cash flow. Our concern is that this group is significant in size, and our research to date has concentrated on somewhat larger businesses. 30 Benefits of the proposal 4.28 Alignment of payment dates would help businesses generally by making provisional tax easier to budget for by way of more frequent and smaller instalments. We see some smaller businesses, those with poor accounting systems and tight cash flows, finding it easier to comply with evenly spaced, more predictable tax payments with lower “peak” payments. They would also have fewer payment dates to remember. 4.29 We also expect that different businesses will have different views on the trade-offs involved in aligning payment dates, and whether the overall proposal would be beneficial. Businesses that want the use of tax money for as long as possible for business purposes and to reduce the need for other forms of finance are likely to find little benefit in this proposal. 4.30 In the end, we have tried to develop a proposal which deals with the problems identified by smaller businesses, benefits the majority of taxpayers, and is in keeping with the payment frequency of other countries. The research to date says this proposal is a step in the right direction; however, the government has no fixed view on the frequency of payments and takes a pragmatic view of the proposals. We seek submissions on whether the result of the trade-offs made are appropriate, especially the key decisions as to the frequency of payment for the largest and smallest of taxpayers. Risk of the proposal 4.31 Aligning the payment of provisional tax with GST could also lead to difficulties when the GST return is prepared by a small business but an external accountant prepares its provisional tax returns. This would probably not be a major problem for most small businesses, but it might be for larger businesses, where considerable effort is required to determine the amount of provisional tax payable. More frequent payment in this case may result in a compliance cost increase. 4.32 The proposed changes would affect accountants, who would be required to change systems to cater for more frequent tax payments. We are unsure as to the scale of this impact and how the transition to the proposal should be managed. We are also conscious that the role of explaining the reforms should be led by the government rather than imposed on tax agents. We would welcome comment on both the transitional and communication issues involved. At present, we envisage Inland Revenue playing a significant role in this communication by way of consultation with small businesses. 31 Submissions 4.33 The government has made a series of judgements about what it considers are the most important factors in determining the most appropriate tax payment dates. Although these judgements are based on research, the goal is a pragmatic outcome that resolves small businesses’ concerns about both the frequency and timing of tax payments. We seek submissions as to whether we have identified the appropriate trade-offs and whether a different solution should be adopted. 4.34 In particular, the government seeks the views of small business people on the following: • Would you support the proposal to pay provisional tax along with GST? • The proposed payment date is the 28th of the month for both GST and provisional tax. Are there any significant problems that would prevent you adopting a single date of the 28th for payment of GST and provisional tax? • If you currently pay GST six-monthly, or are not registered for GST, would you face any problems in paying provisional tax twice a year instead of three times a year? • If you are a six-monthly GST filer and file GST on a date other than October and April, would you prefer your filing date for provisional tax to be aligned with your balance date for income tax? • If you do not support the proposal to pay provisional tax and GST together, how could the proposal be improved to make it more attractive to you? 32 Chapter 5 PROVISIONAL TAX BASED ON GST TURNOVER Proposed policy • Provisional tax would be based on a ratio of a taxpayer’s two-monthly GST- adjusted sales. It would be a voluntary option. • GST-registered taxpayers with turnover of less than $1.3 million could qualify for this option. They would have to pay both GST and provisional tax in their own right to qualify. • Provisional tax would be paid along with GST (two-monthly or six-monthly). • Businesses that adopted this method would not be subject to use-of-money interest. 5.1 In discussion, many small businesses expressed concern as to the inflexibility of the provisional tax rules. Beyond the issues of payment dates, the subject of the preceding chapter, small businesses were also concerned that their tax payments did not match their income earning process. This was felt most by seasonal businesses, who often find it difficult to budget for their provisional tax payments. Businesses were also concerned about being exposed to use- of-money interest if they get their provisional tax estimate wrong. 5.2 Reducing these concerns is difficult because businesses are requesting a method of payment which is flexible, recognises their cash flow profile during the year, does not require use-of money interest to ensure accuracy of payment and has low compliance costs. 5.3 This chapter proposes an option which delivers many of those requested benefits, but at the cost of the proposals not being right for all and use having to be restricted to smaller businesses. 5.4 The proposal is not new – it appeared in the discussion document More Time for Business, released in 2001. However, this chapter extends that proposal in a number of ways, gives more detail on the proposal and, most importantly, highlights that it is not a panacea for small businesses’ provisional tax problems. Rather, it is merely another tool that will help in some cases and, like any tool, it needs to be used wisely for it to work well. 33 What business says 5.5 The most significant compliance cost for the small businesses surveyed was provisional tax not aligning with cash flow. This issue was rated by 18 percent of businesses as their most significant problem, and a further ten percent rated it as the second most important problem (second to the time taken to fill in tax forms). There is a clear message that a new option for paying provisional tax is desired by small to medium-sized businesses. 5.6 Our research showed strong support for aligning provisional tax payments to GST payments. Forty-eight percent of those small businesses surveyed indicate that they would take up the option if it were provided and, within this group, 29 percent indicated a very high probability of taking it up. Not unexpectedly, those businesses that have problems with provisional tax supported the option, with almost two-thirds saying they would use an option that allowed provisional tax to be based on GST turnover. 5.7 Although support for basing provisional tax on GST was lower among tax agents, 34 percent said there was still a good chance that they would recommend it to their clients. This lower support reflects a concern by tax agents that the proposal could result in their clients paying more provisional tax than at present. Anecdotal evidence also indicated there was a concern that the proposal would affect the systems that tax agents have established to help taxpayers pay their provisional tax on time. 5.8 Figure 11 shows the amount of support from the businesses and tax agents surveyed for the idea of basing provisional tax payments on GST turnover. 5.9 Of those businesses surveyed, 19 percent rated their prospects of taking up this initiative at least six to seven out of ten, and 29 percent rated it eight or higher. Figure 11: Support for allowing provisional tax payment to be based on GST 19% 18% 29% 16% 48% 34% 0%20%40%60%80%100% Business (Mean 5.1) Tax Agent (Mean 4.1) 6-78-10 Base: Business – GST registrants (N=1,589); tax agents – total sample (N=400) Source: Small Business Survey and Tax Agents Survey 34 Provisional tax 5.10 The current provisional tax system of using last year’s residual income tax figure plus an uplift factor of 5 percent is a rough gauge of the amount of provisional tax a taxpayer is liable for in the current year. Variations between years in the taxpayer’s income, other factors such as cost structure or the business activities undertaken can lead to variations in provisional tax liability from year to year. Requiring taxpayers to estimate their provisional tax liability provides a more accurate result, but there is the associated increase in compliance costs and exposure to use-of-money interest if they get their estimates wrong. How provisional tax is calculated Provisional taxpayers can choose between two methods of calculating their provisional tax: the estimation method or the standard method of using last year’s residual income tax plus an “uplift factor” of 5 percent. In both cases, a final terminal payment may be required once a taxpayer completes the end-of-year return and income tax liability is determined. Provisional tax is normally due in three equal instalments, except in the case of a new business or those changing balance dates. Individual taxpayers whose residual income tax is less than $35,000 a year and who use the standard method of calculating provisional tax are generally excluded from use-of-money interest on provisional tax payments. This is known as the “safe harbour” from use-of-money interest. Non-individual provisional taxpayers are subject to use-of-money interest on underpayments and overpayments. 5.11 To work, the proposal to base provisional tax on a percentage of GST sales would require provisional tax payment due dates to be aligned with GST due dates. Preferably, the provisional tax payment period would be the same as the GST period, to reduce compliance costs for businesses. Therefore it is conditional on implementing the previous proposal to align provisional tax payment dates with those of GST. Although theoretically feasible, without aligning the two sets of dates it would not be feasible in practice. Proposal 5.12 We are proposing that, in addition to the standard and estimation methods of calculating provisional tax, taxpayers have the option of basing their provisional tax payments on their GST-adjusted sales for the period. Taxpayers using this option would not be charged use-of-money interest on underpayments of tax, nor would they be paid interest if they overpaid their tax for the year. 35 5.13 Provisional taxpayers whose turnover is less than $1.3 million a year (excluding asset sales) would qualify to use this option. The $1.3 million threshold mainly reflects the fact that at high turnover levels, the option becomes more and more inaccurate. Furthermore, the threshold would limit the government’s fiscal risk if the option were selected only to defer tax payment rather than with the aim of integrating provisional tax payment into business processes. 5.14 The option would work only when the same entity paid both income tax and GST. It would not work where one entity paid GST and another paid income tax – for example, when a partnership paid GST but the individual partners paid income tax. It would be difficult to link the two entities to verify that they were using the correct ratio. 5.15 Two steps would be involved. First, a business would work out the ratio of its previous year’s residual income tax to its adjusted GST sales. The ratio would then be applied to GST sales for each GST period, to determine the amount of provisional tax payable. This tax payment would be added to the business’s GST liability and paid along with the GST or, if the business is due a GST refund, the provisional tax due would be offset against that refund. 5.16 It should be pointed out that this approach removes the option of a taxpayer receiving a GST refund and choosing to apply that refund to a use other than paying the tax due. Key points 5.17 The key issue in this option is determining the GST sales figure to be used in determining the ratio. It is possible to make adjustments to the GST sales figure reported on the return to improve the accuracy of provisional tax payment. However, each additional adjustment increases complexity, and some significant sources of inaccuracy cannot be incorporated into the ratio. For example, the ratio cannot readily be adjusted for changes in business structure or for the fact that the ratio of provisional tax to GST sales will not be constant for all levels of GST sales. 5.18 We have identified two different adjusted GST sales bases for the calculation of provisional tax. Option one: GST taxable supplies as the main base 5.19 This option involves using GST taxable supplies (less the GST charged) as the basis for calculating provisional tax. It involves a very simple calculation because the taxable supplies figure can be readily ascertained from the GST return. The calculation is as follows: 36 OPTION ONE FORMULA Step one: Income tax return Ratio = Last year’s residual income tax Last year’s GST sales figure The GST sales figure equals GST taxable supplies less GST on those supplies after adjustment for capital assets sold for more than $1,000. Step two: GST return Provisional = GST sales figure for each future GST period x ratio tax due 5.20 This option results in a higher overpayment of tax balanced by a lower underpayment of tax but with an overall reduction in tax payment compared with the current non-estimation provisional tax payment option. See figure 12 for the overall impact of this option. Option two: Modification for other income 5.21 This option requires adding other income not subject to GST to the GST taxable supplies base, both at the income tax return stage and at the GST return stage. This results in a more accurate outcome but at the cost of increased complexity. OPTION TWO FORMULA Step one: Income tax return Ratio = Last year’s residual income tax Last year’s GST-adjusted sales figure plus non-GST income The GST-adjusted sales equals GST taxable supplies less GST on those supplies after adjustment for capital assets sold for more than $1,000. Non-GST income equals the income earned by the business that is not subject to GST. This would include interest and dividends, partnership income, estate and trust income, overseas income, business income, self-employed income, rental income and shareholder-employee income. Step two: GST return Provisional tax liability = (GST-adjusted sales figure for each future GST period plus one- sixth 6 of last year’s non-GST income) x ratio The GST-adjusted sales figure for the GST period would not include actual income received in that period but, rather, half or one-sixth of last year’s non-GST income. 6 One or one-half of last year’s non-GST income if the taxpayer accounts for GST on a six-monthly basis. 37 5.22 To reduce compliance costs, the non-GST income would not have to be determined on a two-monthly (or six-monthly) basis. Instead, the taxpayer would use the total adjustment figure from last year’s return, divided by six (or by two for six-monthly filers) when computing the two-monthly GST- adjusted sales figure on which to apply the percentage figure to determine provisional tax liability. 5.23 As pointed out earlier, the existing system leads to significant overpayment and underpayment of tax. Figure 12 shows the number of taxpayers whose provisional tax payments differ from their end-of-year residual income tax liability under the existing system and options one and two. Option two, the more complex option, is clearly the most accurate option in preventing underpayments of tax. However, option two does produce a higher level of overpayment of tax than does the existing system. Figure 12: Accuracy of different provisional tax payment options Number of taxpayers whose provisional tax payments differ from their end-of-year residual income tax liability 5.24 The following example illustrates when using the GST-adjusted sales option would provide a more accurate result than the GST sales option. Number of taxpayers 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 -100-90-80-70-60-50-40-30-20-100102030405060708090100 current provisional tax GST based tax adjusted GST based tax % variance from end of year liability Underpayments Overpayments 38 Example A company has interest and dividends amounting to $80,000 (no tax deducted at source) which is not included in GST taxable supplies. It also has GST taxable supplies amounting to $50,000 for a year. Its residual income tax liability on a total income of $130,000 is $42,900, which produces a ratio of 0.85 (85%). The ratio and provisional tax liability under options one and two are as follows. Option one Ratio = 42,900 = 0.85% 50,000 Option two Ratio = 49,200 0.33% 130,000 The outcome under option one is that significant changes in interest or dividends would not be reflected in adjustments in provisional tax payments during the year since interest and dividends are not included in the GST base. Under option two, if GST taxable supplies increase during the year (from $50,000 to $60,000) and the amount of interest and dividends remains constant, the rate would produce the correct tax deduction ($3,300), whereas under option one too much tax would be deducted during the year relative to the increase in GST taxable supplies. (An additional $8,500 would be deducted during the year under option one, whereas the actual tax liability on the increase in taxable supplies is only $3,300.) 5.25 We seek submissions on whether businesses consider the additional compliance costs in basing the calculation on GST-adjusted sales outweighs the increased accuracy of provisional tax payments from undertaking the income adjustments. Limitation on use of the proposal 5.26 As figure 12 shows, this option can result in ratios which are inaccurate. The consequence would be that taxpayers too far from the ratios that applied to the majority of other businesses would expose the revenue to risk and result in changes in taxpayers’ income not being reflected in changes in their provisional tax payments. To reduce the extent to which this might occur, the government proposes to cap the ratio range so that taxpayers with ratios below 0 and above 1 (100 percent) would not qualify to base provisional tax payments on GST turnover. 7 7 Taxpayers whose ratio was outside the range of 0-1 (100 percent) should consult their tax agent/accountant to see which other provisional tax method would best suit them. 39 5.27 Even a ratio of 1, however, seems high, given that income tax is a maximum of 33 percent of a business’s sales or up to 39 percent of a self-employed person’s income after deducting expenses. The government seeks feedback on whether the upper threshold is too high and whether a lower threshold – say, 0.5 (50 percent) – would be more appropriate. Calculating provisional tax liability 5.28 Examples in the appendix to this report give more detail about the calculation that would be required if provisional tax liability were based on GST sales or on GST-adjusted sales. 5.29 Taxpayers would be required to elect into the scheme and advise their ratio before the due date for the first GST return during the income year. The election could be made by way of telephone, Internet or post. Once in the scheme, taxpayers would remain there in subsequent years until they elected to estimate or calculate provisional tax using the standard method. If they left the scheme part-way through the year, they would be required to estimate future provisional tax instalments, which would be subject to use-of-money interest. 5.30 If a taxpayer had an extension of time to file an income tax return, the ratio would have to be based on information from the income tax return of the year before last and the corresponding year’s GST information. This might result in the ratio not accurately reflecting the current year’s provisional tax liability, so the initial provisional tax payments might be underpaid or overpaid. 5.31 Under this option, statements would not be issued for correct payments of provisional tax. Taxpayers would be able to access their account on-line if they wanted to check account transactions and balances. Six-monthly GST filers 5.32 About 150,000 registered persons (27 percent of the total number of registered persons) file GST on a six-monthly basis. There are benefits and drawbacks to extending the scheme to these registered persons. If they earn their income solely in the latter part of the year they may make only one payment a year. The six-month GST return period could also result in a delay between when they earned the income and when they paid their provisional tax in relation to it. However, the option would provide them with a method for catering for seasonality, so the government proposes that six-monthly GST filers qualify to use it. 40 Sanctions for non-compliance 5.33 Taxpayers who underpaid their provisional tax liability could be subject to late payment penalties because the assessed amount would have been entered on the GST return. The late payment penalty would be imposed once the return was filed. 5.34 If a taxpayer failed to file and pay GST and provisional tax for a period, the last period’s provisional tax liability or last year’s residual tax liability divided by the number of instalments would be used as a basis for calculating penalties. However, if at the end of the year it was determined that the taxpayer actually paid the correct amount of tax, any penalties would be recalculated. Benefits of the proposal 5.35 The major benefit from the proposal is that tax payments made during the year would be more closely aligned with when a business earned the income, which could also reduce its end-of-year tax liability. 5.36 It would also provide greater certainty for taxpayers with seasonal income as businesses for whom the standard method is not appropriate could choose between it and the estimation method of calculating provisional tax. It could reduce the need for businesses to re-estimate their provisional tax liability during the year to take account of fluctuating incomes and could reduce their borrowing costs to finance tax payments. 5.37 The proposal could have significant benefits. Provisional tax payments would better reflect a business’s cash flow, which means that a business that had suffered a downturn would automatically have a reduced provisional tax liability, without having to make a provisional tax estimate. Correspondingly, businesses whose turnover increased during the year would pay more provisional tax than they would have under the current provisional tax rules, thus reducing their year-end tax bill and the risk of default in payment. The measure would work without the need for use-of-money interest. 5.38 Overall, the measure should reduce the level of concern business have expressed in relation to provisional tax, while ensuring the goals of provisional tax are maintained and possibly enhanced. Risks of the proposal 5.39 The key risk of the proposal is that it might be used in cases where it caused more problems than it solved. The first major problem would occur if the ratio was clearly incorrect but the business still chose to apply the option, resulting in significant overpayment or underpayment of tax. A second 41 problem would arise if the ratio was right initially but later changed and the business persisted in using the inaccurate ratio. 5.40 To keep the option simple, we have not proposed significant restrictions on its use. If significant underpayment of provisional tax was to occur as a result, restrictions could be needed – such as restricting access to the option if it looks like it might be being used for deferring tax payment rather than improving the accuracy of tax payment. 5.41 A final risk of this option is that it might be incorrectly perceived as a solution to the problem of provisional tax payment not aligning with business cash flow, rather than a tool that will allow some taxpayers, but not all, to manage their tax payments better. Submissions 5.42 The government seeks views on the following, in particular. • Do the features of the proposal provide a good balance between ensuring that taxpayers who have seasonal income can qualify and preventing abuse of the proposal? • Are the sanctions for non-payment of provisional tax under this option an effective deterrent? • If an entity was GST-registered but the provisional tax was paid by another entity, neither entity would be able to benefit from the option. If these categories of taxpayers were allowed to use the option what would be the best way of linking their payment of provisional tax with GST? • Do the additional compliance costs in basing the calculation on GST- adjusted sales outweigh the increased accuracy of provisional tax payments from undertaking the income adjustments? 42 Chapter 6 A DISCOUNT FOR INDIVIDUALS STARTING A BUSINESS Proposed policy • Self-employed people would be given an incentive to pay tax in their first year of business. It would take the form of a 6.7 percent discount against their end- of-year tax liability for each dollar of tax paid during the first year. • The discount would apply to individual taxpayers in the year before they are required to pay provisional tax. • They would receive the discount only once and their entitlement to it would lapse once they became a regular provisional taxpayer. • Individuals who started a business would be able to choose whether or not to receive the discount and in which year to receive it. • The discount would be 6.7 percent of the lesser of the amount paid during the year or 105 percent of the end-of-year residual income tax liability. 6.1 Businesses have said they want to minimise the impact of tax payments on the business by more closely aligning the payment of tax with when the associated income is earned. 6.2 Anecdotal comment and Inland Revenue’s payment default rate suggests that the first three years are the most difficult for new businesses. Figure 13 shows that the income tax default rate of businesses that are newly registered for GST peaks in their third year in business. The peak default rate is about twice the normal default rate for all businesses. There could be a variety of reasons for this, but having to pay both provisional tax and terminal tax in a short period of time at the end of the second year in operation is probably a contributing factor. This figure is conservative because not all new businesses will be GST-registered, and some newly registered businesses will have been in business before or in business for a few years before registering for GST. 43 Figure 13: Percentage of new GST-registered businesses that incur a late payment penalty for income tax 0.00% 2.00% 4.00% 6.00% 8.00% 10.00% 12.00% 12345 Years since GST registration % of new businesses What business says 6.3 A survey of small and medium-sized businesses posed the question to those who had been in business for three years or less whether they would have taken up the option of making voluntary tax payments in their first year of business had they been given a 7 percent discount on their tax bill. 6.4 Tax agents were also asked whether they would recommend this option to their clients, although the amount of the discount was not specified to them. Figure 14: Support for voluntary provisional tax payments 19% 23% 45% 55% 64% 78% 0%20%40%60%80%100% Business (Mean 6.2) Tax Agent s (Mean 7.2) 6-78-10 44 6.5 There was strong overall support for the proposal, with 64 percent of businesses indicating they would take up the option by rating it six or higher out of ten, and 78 percent of tax agents saying they would recommend it to their clients. It is interesting to note that 45 percent of businesses rated it eight or higher out of ten. 6.6 The proposal was expressed in terms of a discount, rather than a tax credit, for ease of presentation. Support for the proposal is shown in figure 14. Provisional tax on first-year income 6.7 Individual taxpayers who start up a business are not required to pay provisional tax in their first year in business. However, they are still required to pay income tax for the first year in business, but it becomes due shortly before or shortly after the end of their second year in business. If their residual income tax for the previous year exceeded $2,500 they will also be paying their provisional tax for their second year in business around this time. This combination of tax payments can have a big impact on a business’s cash flow and can sometimes cause financial difficulties. At present, these taxpayers have no incentive to make voluntary payments of tax in their first year in business, closer to when they earn the income that is being taxed. Example of how tax on first-year income is paid An individual taxpayer stops paid employment and begins to earn income from self- employment on 1 April 2000. She earns $45,000 from self-employment in her first year in business (1 April 2000-31 March 2001). She files her 2001 income tax return on 12 December 2001 (having an extension of time to file her return) and has an income tax bill of $9,720, which is due for payment on 7 February 2002. Her residual income tax for the 2001 year was $9,720, so she is required to pay provisional tax during the 2002 income year (1 April 2001-31 March 2002). As she has an extension of time to file her return, and filed it on 12 December, the whole provisional tax liability of $10,200 ($9,720 + an uplift of 5%) is due on the next provisional tax instalment date, 7 March 2002. In a one-month period (7 February 2002-7 March 2002) she is required to make two tax payments – one of $9,720 and the other of $10,200 – for a total of $19,920. This could place an individual on an annual income of $45,000 under some financial strain. 45 Proposal 6.8 The government proposes an incentive for individual taxpayers who start a business to make voluntary payments of tax on first-year income during that year. The incentive would be by way of a discount that would encourage early payment and thereby better align the payment of tax on first-year with the timing of when that income is derived. The discount would be available to individual taxpayers who receive either partnership or self-employed income. 6.9 Qualifying businesses would receive a 6.7 percent discount against their end- of-year tax liability for each dollar of tax voluntarily paid during that year. Providing a discount net of tax is broadly equivalent to giving a 10 percent pre-tax discount on tax payable for early payment. We recognise that this may mean that some businesses might pay at the end of the first year to qualify for the discount, when payment throughout that first year might better help minimise the impact of income tax. Even so, the proposed discount is the simplest way of providing an incentive to pay tax in the first year. Example of how the discount would work The taxpayer in the previous example, who started business on 1 July 2000, chooses to be part of this scheme in her 2000-01 return. She makes a voluntary payment of $11,000 on 31 March 2001. She files her 2000-01 income tax return on 12 December 2001, and the return is assessed. Her residual income tax liability for the 2001 income year is determined to be $9,720. The discount is calculated on the residual income tax amount uplifted by 5 percent ($10,200) as this is lower than the $11,000 paid during the year. The discount is 6.7% x $10,200 = $683.00, which is credited as part of the income tax assessment process. The taxpayer’s statement would be: Details Amount Payment received 31 March 2001 $11,000.00 Discount payable $683.00 Balance $11,683.00 Less 2001 tax assessed $9,720.00 Refund $1,963.00 The taxpayer must also pay provisional tax of $10,200 on 7 March 2002. The refund of $1,983 could either be refunded or go towards reducing her $10,200 provisional tax liability due on 7 March 2002. 46 6.10 If a business voluntarily paid more tax during the year than it was required to, the overpayment would be refunded. The 6.7 percent discount would be paid on the lower of: • the amount paid during the year; or • 105 percent of the taxpayer’s residual income tax liability for the year, in recognition that the amount of tax payable is uncertain. Key points 6.11 The key problem with this proposal is defining the “first year in business”. It is difficult to determine when the discount should be provided to individual taxpayers who are newly in business. If it is given strictly in the first year an individual is in business it may be of little use as the business may have a low or no tax liability or may even be in loss. These problems may occur also in subsequent years. However, if the discount is applied in a year the business is required to pay provisional tax, little benefit by way of early payment arises as the provisional tax rules ensure more timely payment. 6.12 To help target the measure, we propose that taxpayers be able to choose to receive the discount in their end-of-year income tax return for the income year to which they want to apply the discount. The amount of the discount would then be calculated on the basis of the voluntary tax payments made in that year. This would provide an opportunity for taxpayers to ensure the discount was used in a year when the business considered it was of significant benefit. For those businesses that start business slowly, the year chosen is more likely to be closer to the point when they would normally become liable for provisional tax (when the previous year’s residual income tax exceeds $2,500) than their actual first year in business. No discount would be available in subsequent years if they began another new business while continuing with a first business. However, if they stopped receiving business income for a period of four years they would again qualify should they start a new business. 6.13 A final key feature of this proposal would be the involvement of private sector advisors. We see tax and business advisors having a key role in informing new businesses of the availability of the discount, encouraging them to start saving, and recommending the best time to apply for the discount. In effect, we see the measure as a tool to be used by these groups in their work with small businesses. Without this contribution from the private sector we are concerned that the businesses that need encouragement to manage their tax affairs better would not do so. 47 Benefits of the proposal 6.14 The proposal would reduce default in tax payment by individuals starting a new business. The flow-on benefits are that the taxpayers involved could concentrate on running their businesses rather than devoting their time to managing a possibly deteriorating tax position, and there would be fewer late payment penalties. 6.15 Previous consultations with small businesses have indicated support for this proposal, with the majority indicating they would have taken up the option. Risks of the proposal 6.16 The principal risk is that the proposal simply does not work in its goal of encouraging earlier tax payment for those who need support in managing their cash flow and that the measure ends up only being used by those businesses who would naturally manage their tax affairs efficiently. This could occur because: • New small businesses remained unaware of the discount until after it was of practical use. • They considered the discount insufficient. • The discount would require businesses to be able to identify when they should make a voluntary payment to best manage their cash flow, prevent an accumulating deferral of tax and maximise the benefit of the discount. Perhaps small businesses are not in a position to make this decision in their first year. Submissions 6.17 The government seeks submissions on the following points, in particular: • whether the 6.7 percent discount (net of tax) would be effective at encouraging new small businesses to pay provisional tax during their first year in business; • whether other measures to encourage payment during the year should be considered, rather than the discount described here, which effectively encourages payment only towards the end of the year; • whether the discount should be restricted to the first year in business or available, as proposed, to be used before regular provisional tax payments begin; and • how the risks associated with the proposal could be mitigated. 48 Chapter 7 ELECTRONIC TOOLS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ON EMPLOYMENT AND RESIDENCE STATUS Proposed policy Inland Revenue would provide on-line tools to clarify employment and resident status, which would reduce compliance costs for employers. 7.1 Understanding tax law and undertaking complex tax calculations impose compliance costs on businesses – either in time or in the money they pay others to do it for them. 7.2 Some of the costs, however, could be reduced by increasing the number of on-line tools that Inland Revenue provides to businesses. It is therefore proposed to offer a service that clarifies issues of employment and residence status for tax purposes. For example, if a business had a question about whether someone was an employee or independent contractor, it could fill in an electronic questionnaire on Inland Revenue’s website. The answer it received would be legally binding, provided the information the business supplied was correct. What business says 7.3 The provision of on-line tools to clarify employment and residence status has appeal among businesses, with 48 percent of those surveyed indicating that they would take up this proposal if provided. It has most appeal to large employers and companies. Proposal 7.4 The proposal is to extend the tools provided on-line by Inland Revenue by providing an electronic calculator that would help apply certain tax laws such as determining whether someone is an employee or independent contractor. 7.5 The law would be amended to specify criteria which, when met, would provide taxpayers with certainty of tax treatment in respect of such issues as residence status and status as an employee or contractor. Taxpayers could be certain of the accuracy of the answers received from Inland Revenue, provided the information they supplied was correct. 49 Benefits of the proposal 7.6 The proposal would reduce the compliance costs for businesses in obtaining reliable information, either in seeking help from accountants or tax professionals or spending time searching out the answer. 7.7 It would also make it easier for businesses that have computer technology to have access to tax information. Risks of the proposal 7.8 Tax agents may see the move as an intrusion into their domain of providing tax advice. Although there could be a reduction in the number of enquiries to tax agents as a result, there may also be gains in that tax agents could use the electronic calculator themselves to provide certainty for their clients as to the position they have take in providing that advice. Submissions 7.9 The government seeks submissions on whether businesses would use the on- line tools to clarify the residence status or employment status. 50 APPENDIX BASING PROVISIONAL TAX PAYMENT ON GST TURNOVER – EXAMPLE OF THE CALCULATION REQURIED Example 1 - GST taxable supplies A taxpayer has self-employed income, interest and dividend income, income from a trust and rental income. He completes his 2001 income tax return and determines his residual income tax liability to be $22,080. The taxpayer advises Inland Revenue by telephone that he wants to pay provisional tax for the 2002 year based on a percentage of his GST sales figure. Calculating GST sales figure The taxpayer calculates the GST sales figure for the 2001 year as follows. GST taxable supplies (exclusive of GST) 8 $83,000 Less asset sales $nil GST sales figure $83,000 Calculating the ratio The ratio is: Residual income tax $22,080 = 0.26 (26%) GST sales figure 83,000 Calculating provisional tax liability The taxpayer’s business income for a two-monthly period is as follows. Period April/May 2002 (payment due on 28 June 2002) GST taxable supplies (GST-exclusive) 9 $7,463 Less asset sales nil Equals GST sales figure $7,463 Provisional tax liability for two-month period is GST sales multiplied by the ratio: $7,463 \* 0.26 = $1,940 This calculation would be repeated for the remaining taxable periods as follows. 28 Aug 28 Oct 28 Dec 28 Feb 28 April GST taxable supplies 10 $8334 $11534 $16834 $26334 $20334 Less asset sales $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 times ratio 0.26 (26%) equals provisional tax $2167 $2999 $4377 $6847 $5287 8 The GST-exclusive sales figure is determined by subtracting box 8 from box 5 on the GST return for each taxable period in the year. 9 Determined by subtracting box 8 from box 5 of the GST return for taxable period. 10 Determined from GST return by subtracting box 8 from box 5. 51 Example 2 – GST-adjusted sales The same taxpayer has self-employed income, interest and dividend income, income from a trust and rental income. He completes his 2001 income tax return and determines his residual income tax liability to be $22,080. He advises Inland Revenue by telephone that he wants to pay provisional tax for the 2002 year based on a percentage of his GST-adjusted sales. Calculating GST-adjusted sales The taxpayer calculates the GST-adjusted sales for the 2001 year as follows. GST taxable supplies (exclusive of GST) 11 $83,000 plus non-GST income Net rental income 12 $5,000 Interest and dividends 13 $2,000 Estate and trust income 14 $3,000 less asset sales $nil GST-adjusted sales $93,000 Calculating the ratio The ratio is: Residual income tax $22,080 = 0.23 (23%) GST-adjusted sales 93,000 The shaded non-GST income adjustments are divided by six to give the fixed amount ($1,666) to be added to GST taxable supplies each two-month period. Calculating provisional tax liability The taxpayer’s business income as well as the income adjustments for a two-monthly period are as follows. Period April/May 2002 (payment due on 28 June 2002) GST taxable supplies (GST-exclusive) 15 $7,463 plus proportionate non-GST income adjustments from 2001 return $1,666 equals GST-adjusted sales $9,129 Provisional tax liability for two-month period is GST-adjusted sales multiplied by the ratio: $9,129 \* 0.23 = $2,099 11 The GST-exclusive sales figure is determined by subtracting box 8 from box 5 on the GST return for each taxable period in the year. 12 Determined from box 20 on the IR3 return or box 18B on the IR4 return. 13 Determined from boxes 13B and 14B of the IR3 or IR4 return. 14 Determined from boxes 15B and 15C on the IR3 return. 15 Determined by subtracting box 8 from box 5 of the GST return for taxable period. 52 This calculation would be repeated for the remaining taxable periods as follows. 28 Aug 28 Oct 28 Dec 28 Feb 28 April GST taxable supplies 16 $8334 $11534 $16834 $26334 $20334 plus non-GST income adjustments $1666 $1666 $1666 $1666 $1666 equals GST-adjusted sales $10000 $13200 $18500 $28000 $22000 times ratio 0.23 (23%) equals provisional tax $2300 $3036 $4255 $6440 $5060 16 Determined from GST return by subtracting box 8 from box 5.

Often these transfers are as a result of market transactions, but there are also many instances when assets are transferred without any element of market exchange. “In-kind” asset transfers from companies and trusts and gifts are key examples of this, as are transfers of assets on a taxpayer’s death. 1 1.2 To be facilitative, the law should be clear on the consequences of these transfers. Although the general law is clear on how they are treated, the tax legislation is not. The tax legislation in some instances provides specific rules, but in most cases it is silent, leading to considerable confusion, multiple interpretations and repeated calls for greater clarity. How to address this lack of clarity is the subject of this paper. 1.3 We shall never know when Benjamin Franklin made his now famous comment that “in this world nothing can be said to be certain except death and taxes” whether he had in mind these two events occurring simultaneously. But we do know, given that the Income Tax Act 1994 is not clear in this area, that policy makers have not in the past turned their mind to the issue in any comprehensive way. 1.4 Also, given the court cases in recent years on distributions of forests and financial arrangements from companies, it seems reasonable to proceed with generic rules for distributions. 1.5 This paper has been prepared by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Treasury as part of the consultation involved in the policy development process. Subject to the results of the consultation, we aim to present the suggested solutions to the government for consideration, with the intended ultimate outcome being the introduction of amending legislation. 1.6 Specifically, the key suggestions outlined in the paper are that, for income tax purposes: • “In-kind”, or in specie, distributions by companies and trusts (including estates) should be treated as dispositions and acquisitions at market value. • Gifts should be treated in a similar fashion. 1 This is not to say that there is no exchange in these circumstances; for example, shareholders who receive an in-kind distribution may be indirectly giving up part of the value of their shares in exchange. In the case of gifts and inheritances, however, assets are transferred without the recipients having to provide any exchange. 2 • A disposal and acquisition of a taxpayer’s assets should be deemed to occur on the day of death, at market value. The subsequent transfer of the assets from the executor/trustee to the beneficiaries should be treated as a separate disposition and acquisition at market value. • There should be a special rule to ensure that a taxpayer’s death does not in itself lead to an asset being brought into the tax base merely because the ten-year period for land held on capital account has not elapsed. This exception to the suggested generic rules should apply if such land passes to an associated person and is held by that person for the balance of the ten years. • A variation from the requirement to use market value should apply to unexpired accrual expenditure, which would instead be valued at cost. These assets are typically not held for resale, and valuing at cost may reduce compliance costs. • Relief from provisional tax use-of-money interest rules should be available for the deceased’s estate in respect of any liability arising from the taxpayer’s death. 1.7 The deeming of transactions at market value does not by itself cause taxation consequences – those consequences will arise only if the asset is already inside the tax base. Thus if the asset is held on capital account there will generally be no taxation consequences.

Put simply, an increase in net assets may represent income that can be subject to tax under the Income Tax Act. 2.2 The period used to measure the change in net assets is not necessarily an income year. For assets whose market values are readily determinable, such as financial arrangements, changes in value can be recognised as they accrue and can be, therefore, measured on an income year basis. For other assets, changes in values are usually taxed only when a transaction takes place and a change of ownership occurs. One reason that the Income Tax Act takes this approach is that it is only at the time a transaction takes place that there is a clear identification of the market value of the asset. 2.3 Hence, to crystallise a taxable event, the Act requires in many cases the identification of when a transaction has taken place and values to be attributed to the taxable event. In the normal course of arm’s length trading, these requirements can generally be applied without great difficulty, and the Act is sufficiently clear on the tax implications. However, in some key areas, there is a lack of clarity and consistency as to whether a taxable event has taken place and what values should be attributed to that event. 2.4 The general principle should be that a taxable event occurs whenever a transaction takes place with another party. When appropriate, this should include transactions with related parties because the taxpayer can equally make gains or losses on such transactions. 2 The significant exception to the recognition of related party transactions under the Act is matrimonial property settlements. This reflects both the fact that matrimonial assets are held in common and the desire not to discourage such transactions by way of tax impediments. 2.5 Transactions should sometimes be deemed to take place when there has been no actual transaction. Three instances are: • when property enters or leaves the New Zealand tax base (for example, when the owner of offshore property becomes a resident of New Zealand, or revenue assets become private or domestic assets); 2 This is reinforced by the Act’s focus on individual taxpayers. Tax is generally determined on the basis of the position of each taxpayer, whether it be an individual, a company or a trust. 6 • when an asset changes its character in the hands of the taxpayer with no other party being involved (for example, if trading stock is used as fixed assets); and • when there is a non-market disposition of an asset or liability by way of a gift, legacy or distribution from a company or trust (which, for example, may result in a capital account asset transferring to a person who holds the asset on revenue account and vice versa). 2.6 These events should be treated as disposals and acquisitions for tax purposes to buttress the capital/revenue boundary and to ensure that, when appropriate, taxpayers pay their share of any tax that is due. 3 2.7 Deeming a transaction to take place is not, however, in itself sufficient. The relevant assets and liabilities must also be given a value. Logically, because the events are deemed to be market transactions, they should be generally recorded at market value. 2.8 If the assets were deemed to be transferred at other than their market value, such as at cost price, the distribution would still result in a transfer of part of the tax implications across the two parties to the transaction. Accrued capital gains, for example, might otherwise be taxable should the asset be gifted to a person who holds the asset on revenue account. Similarly, accrued taxation on an asset that is held on revenue account could be avoided by gifting it to someone who holds the asset on capital account. 2.9 Deeming a transaction to take place, such as when a taxpayer dies, alters the time at which tax is paid if the taxpayer’s assets would have otherwise been held to maturity. This means accumulated gains on revenue assets that have not already been taxed are brought to account for tax purposes earlier than might have been anticipated. However, it has to be borne in mind that this situation results from the fact that the accumulated gains were being held untaxed and from recognising transactions as a taxable event. Had the property been taxed on an accrual basis, as some assets currently are, or on an imputed return basis as floated by the Tax Review 2001, the gains would have been taxed at an even earlier stage and the deemed transaction would have had a lesser tax impact, if any. Generic policy rules required 2.10 The following discussion outlines some areas within the current legislation that are unclear or inconsistent in terms of deeming transactions to have taken place. In particular, in-kind, or in specie, distributions from companies and trusts are addressed, as are gifts and the vexed question of the tax consequences of death. 3 These events are discussed in more detail in the February 1991 discussion document Tax Accounting Issues by the Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital (the “Valabh Committee”) (pages 43-47). 7 2.11 To overcome these shortcomings in the legislation, we are suggesting the application of generic policy rules based on recognising deemed dispositions and acquisitions at market value. 9 Chapter 3 “IN-KIND” DISTRIBUTIONS AND GIFTS 3.1 In-kind, or in specie, distributions are a common form of transaction and can be made at any time as a substitute for a cash dividend or payout. A prime example of such distributions is the transfer of physical assets to a beneficiary as part of the distribution of a deceased's estate. Another area where in-kind distributions often arise is when a company is liquidated. 3.2 Treating all such distributions as dispositions and acquisitions is justified because they are non-market transactions and may result in assets entering or leaving the tax base. As discussed previously, when non-market transactions occur and assets enter or leave the tax base without recognition of any taxable event, an incorrect tax outcome may arise. 3.3 A similar situation arises when an individual makes a non-monetary gift. Clearly, these types of distributions are essentially transactions and should be recognised as events for all parties to the transaction. 3.4 Conceptually, the result of the in-kind distribution should be the same as if the provider had disposed of the asset(s) to an arm’s length party at market value and then made a cash distribution or gift. This will help to prevent inequities and to discourage avoidance that might arise from any differential tax treatment. Suggested approach 3.5 The legislation currently lacks sufficient clarity and consistency in terms of treating in-kind distributions and gifts as dispositions. We suggest this situation be rectified by including a general rule in the legislation that would: • treat an in-kind distribution made by a company or a trust, or a gift of revenue account or depreciable property as a disposition at market value at the date of distribution; • deem the recipient of the distribution to have acquired the distributed assets at the same market value; and • to the extent appropriate, still construe the proceeds to be a dividend when made by a company to a shareholder. This would make the proceeds of the disposition gross income of the distributor to the extent the assets are already in the tax base. It would also trigger depreciation gain/loss on sale calculations. 10 Comment 3.6 It may be argued that the current law already contains rules that indicate how these types of transfers should be treated. The suggested treatment already applies to all distributions of depreciable assets 4 , and to distributions of trading stock 5 from companies. Also, there are rules in respect of sale of trading stock for inadequate consideration. It may be that as part of the clarification, these rules could be brought together under a generic provision. But court cases in recent years have shown that uncertainty surrounds how asset transfers should be valued for tax purposes, particularly for non- companies, and whether a transfer is a disposal. 6 3.7 For example, there is some question as to whether a distribution of standing timber by a trust is a “disposal”. If it is a disposal, it is correct to record it as a sale at market value. 3.8 Further, there is some doubt as to whether the acquirer of revenue account property distributed in specie obtains an appropriate cost base for the property, and what that cost base is or should be. 3.9 Also, the CIR v Auckland Harbour Board case 7 demonstrated the uncertainty about what happens if financial arrangements are transferred for no consideration. 3.10 Thus there is a clear need for consistency of treatment between various types of distribution/disposal across all assets within the tax base. The suggestions described here are a step towards that consistency. 3.11 The suggested treatment is also consistent with the proposals in relation to distributions of financial arrangements by a company in liquidation, as set out in the 1997 government discussion document The Taxation of Financial Arrangements and subsequently enacted. 4 See section EG 19. The exception is section EG 17, which requires a recipient who is an associated party to value the depreciable assets at the lower of market value and the transferor's cost. This treatment would continue under the suggested treatment. 5 See section GD 2 (now including standing timber). 6 Tasman Forestry Limited v CIR (1999) (Court of Appeal, CA168/98), which dealt with the factual situation before section GD 2 was extended to cover standing timber. The suggested approach follows the tenor of that decision from the recipient's perspective. 7 CIR v Auckland Harbour Board (2001) (Privy Council, Appeal No 30 of 2000) 11 Chapter 4 TRANSFER OF ASSETS ON A TAXPAYER’S DEATH 4.1 The tax treatment of transactions arising from a taxpayer’s death is another example of where the current law would benefit from greater clarity and consistency. 4.2 A taxpayer’s tax affairs need to be settled as at the date of death, which includes bringing to account all income to that date not already accounted for and valuing the taxpayer’s assets. A key issue from a policy perspective is whether this process should include a deemed disposition of the deceased taxpayer’s taxable property. 4.3 A taxpayer’s death and the subsequent distribution of the deceased’s property are occasions when deemed dispositions are justified because non-market transactions are involved and assets and liabilities may leave the tax base. For example, the deceased’s estate might be charitable. Legal process of transmission of property from deceased to beneficiaries 4.4 On the death of a taxpayer, the estate can be dealt with in several ways, depending on whether a will exists and, when a will does exist, the taxpayer’s intentions as set out in the will (for example, whether there are to be a trust, legacies, and so on). Normally, it takes one to two years to wind up an estate and distribute the assets to the beneficiaries. There are several discrete points in this process at which a property disposition could be deemed to have occurred – on death, on transfer from executor to trustee, or on distribution to legatees and beneficiaries. 4.5 A will usually provides for the appointment of one or more executors. In the absence of a will, a court will appoint someone to administer the deceased’s estate. Legal and beneficial ownership of the deceased’s property vests in the executors or administrators from the time of death through to the end of the period of executorship or administration. The beneficiaries have a right to have the deceased’s estate administered properly during this period but do not, with the exception of specific legacies, have more than an inchoate right in the assets. 4.6 The duties of the executor or administrator are to collect the assets of the deceased, pay all debts, testamentary expenses and taxes and to distribute the legacies. At the end of the period of executorship or administration, the executor or administrator becomes a trustee of the residual assets on behalf of the beneficiaries. 4.7 Property that has been bequeathed or devised under a will may be gifted as a specific legacy, general legacy or residuary gift. Under the “doctrine of relation back”, specific legacies take effect from the date of death, whereas 12 general and residuary legacies vest in the beneficiary(ies) at the time of distribution. Current legislative position 4.8 Although there is little doubt under the general law as to the outcomes of transfers, transmissions and vestings on and subsequent to death, the tax consequences of these events are far less clear. 4.9 Tax law is not consistent in outlining the tax treatment of assets disposed of on the death of a taxpayer. For some types of assets there are express provisions covering death of the taxpayer, but for other types of revenue account assets the provisions refer only to “sale or other disposition”. 4.10 Nor is legal opinion particularly helpful in these circumstances because opinions differ as to whether a disposition occurs at death and, if a disposition does occur then, what the consequences are. Earlier reviews 4.11 In 1992 the Valabh Committee recommended that the Income Tax Act be changed to clarify the tax treatment of assets when a taxpayer dies. Although the committee specifically looked at financial arrangements, it also proposed standardising the rules for all property by deeming deceased persons to have disposed of all their assets at the date of death for market value. 4.12 The committee’s recommended changes in respect of financial arrangements were incorporated in the discussion document The Taxation of Financial Arrangements. Submissions on that discussion document reinforced the need for a comprehensive review of the tax rules governing death, and that the tax treatment of financial arrangements should be consistent with the results of the review. Suggested approach 4.13 Although there may be several transfers as a result of winding up a deceased taxpayer’s estate, from a practical perspective the two key points at which deemed transactions should be recognised are (1) on death and (2) on transfer to the beneficiaries. Moreover, as highlighted earlier, these are clear points where, from a policy perspective, disposals should be recognised because assets may leave the tax base and non-market transactions take place. 4.14 The transfer at death may result in the property moving from revenue to capital account or from a taxable holder to an exempt holder. Similarly, as discussed in the preceding chapter, the transfer of the deceased’s property from the trustee to the beneficiaries is an example of a non-market, in-kind transaction that can have similar results. Consistent with the principles 13 previously outlined, both of these transactions should be recorded at market value. 4.15 These two points 8 were chosen for the 1999 update of the accrual rules, and we suggest that they also be used for all other forms of “revenue” property so that: • A disposition and acquisition would be deemed to occur on the day of death at market value. • The subsequent transfer of the assets from the executor/trustee to the beneficiaries would be treated as a separate disposition and acquisition at market value. Coverage 4.16 We suggest that the clarification be comprehensive, covering all natural taxpayers, including their interests in partnerships, with respect to: • trading stock, including livestock; • depreciable property (plant and machinery, buildings, and so forth) 9 ; • financial arrangements; • foreign investment fund interests; and • revenue account property, including land, forests and other personal property. Exception 4.17 An exception to the suggested approach is justified when, by altering the timing of the tax recognition, it would also change the tax outcome from being non-taxable to taxable. 4.18 The particular example of when an exception is required is found in the ten-year rules in section CD 1(b), (c), (d) and (e). 10 These rules provide that the proceeds from the disposition of land by a person who is in the business of either dealing in land, developing or subdividing land, or building are income if the land is disposed of within ten years of acquisition. The proceeds are also considered income if at least 20 percent of the disposition profits result from a re-categorisation or change in the conditions applying to the land in relation to the Resource Management Act 1991. Property covered 8 Other options are discussed later in this chapter. 9 Section EG 17 would still apply, where applicable, however, so that a recipient who is an associated party would value the assets at the lower of market value and the transferor's cost. 10 This exemption would not extend to section CD 1(f), which covers schemes involving the development of land because the ten-year rule in that paragraph relates only to commencement of the scheme, not the disposition of the land. So deeming the land to be disposed of on the taxpayer’s death does not have any implications in terms of section CD 1(f). 14 by these provisions is referred to as “tainted”. To ensure that death does not lead to substantially different tax consequences than had the taxpayer survived the ten-year period, limited rollover relief is proposed. 4.19 Specifically, the exception would apply to tainted property if the property passes to an associated person or is retained by the estate, so long as the beneficiaries are associated persons. In such cases the taxpayer’s death would be ignored, with the balance of the ten years (after adjusting for the time the asset is held by the executor) applying to the beneficiary (ies) or the estate. For example, if a taxpayer dies seven years after acquiring the property and the estate takes one year to wind up, a beneficiary would need to hold the property for a further two years to prevent the proceeds being taxable. As part of the rollover, the assets would transfer to the estate and, if necessary, the beneficiary at the cost recorded in the accounts of the deceased (for this purpose only). 4.20 The reason for limiting the exception to transfers to associated persons is to cover genuine cases where property is passed on to relatives as part of a normal inheritance. Variant 4.21 “Unexpired” or “unapplied” expenditure under section EF 1(1) should also be covered by the suggested clarification of the tax consequences of death. Examples of such expenditure are fertiliser on hand and prepaid rentals and rates. As discussed earlier, this expenditure should only be deducted as the goods and services are “used”. If a person dies before the expenditure is fully “used” and the estate continues to run down the unexpired portion of the expenditure, that unexpired portion should, for tax purposes, be able to be passed on to the deceased’s estate. 4.22 Under the suggested approach, the unexpired portion of the accrual expenditure would be deemed to be disposed of and acquired both at the point of death and at the point of transfer to the beneficiary. The only difference from the rules suggested earlier for other assets is that these dispositions and acquisitions would be deemed to take place at the relevant values that section EF 1 would have used if applied at year end, except that the determination relief of section EF 1(3) 11 would not apply. 4.23 This variant is justified on the basis that the accrual expenditure is not held for resale. It should also reduce the costs of complying with the suggested new rules as market values will not need to be ascertained for the unexpired portion of the accrual expenditure. 11 Section EF 1(3) enables the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exempt a taxpayer from the requirements of section EF 1 after having regard to certain factors, such as the costs to the taxpayer in complying with section EF 1. 15 Partnerships and joint property 4.24 Death of a business partner may trigger a disposal for tax purposes. Again, the legislation is generally unclear on this point. It is proposed to confirm that for tax purposes, death triggers a disposition of the deceased’s interests in the partnership. Wider partnership policy issues are being dealt with by a separate project. In the meantime, Inland Revenue has confirmed that from an operational perspective, surviving partners will not be affected in respect of their continuing interests in partnership assets. Compliance cost implications 4.25 For assets other than “accrual expenditure”, a requirement to carry out a base price adjustment or market valuation at the date of death should not lead to added compliance costs: the estate is in an ascertainable form, and a tax return must already be filed at this date. Market values should be able to be readily estimated for many types of property, particularly where there are established secondary markets. Even in other cases valuers should be able to provide valuations. In any case, estate law often requires market values to be ascertained at the date of death. Other options considered 4.26 A disposition could be deemed to take place every time there is a change of beneficial ownership during the winding up and distribution of the estate. This could include the point at which the assets are transferred from executor or administrator to a trustee at the end of an executorship or administration period and, in some cases, on each distribution to a beneficiary. As previously noted, the vesting of different legacies can occur at different times for different beneficiaries. However, it is not proposed that these legal distinctions be reflected in the tax rules. 12 A uniform approach to all forms of distribution is therefore suggested, particularly for compliance reasons. 4.27 Whether to have only one deemed disposition point was also considered. The conclusion was that two deemed disposition points are necessary because: • At both points there is potential for assets to leave the tax base. • It may take several years to wind up an estate, and hence asset value can vary substantially between death and distribution. 13 12 The Valabh Committee was also of the view that such a requirement would be excessive and would create unnecessary complexity in income tax law. 13 The Valabh Committee also considered having only one point of disposition – at the time of distribution. But it also proposed a two-year rule whereby a disposition would be deemed to take place two years after death if no distribution had been made by then. In such cases a disposition would also be deemed to take place when the subsequent distribution also took place. The Valabh Committee subsequently replaced this set of proposals with the two points of recognition – at death and at distribution. 16 • Having a deemed disposition only at the date of death would add complexity and compliance costs in relation to financial arrangements that fall under the accrual rules because it would require additional rules for the calculation of the adjusted acquisition cost for the beneficiary. The accrual rules have incorporated two deemed disposition points since 1999 without any apparent problems. • Assets may vest in a beneficiary before actual transfer from the trustee. Some thought was therefore given to whether the point at which the property vests absolutely in interest in the beneficiary would be a better point of recognition than the point of transfer. This concept is already used in the Act in the definition of “beneficiary income”. It would overcome situations where the timing of the transfer is deferred to reduce the tax liability by waiting until asset values have declined. The problem with this approach, however, is the difficulty in verifying when property vests absolutely in interest in the beneficiary. Alternative treatment for consultation Should there be only one valuation point (the day of death) when the net assets of the estate are immediately distributable, and the following circumstances apply? • the deceased’s estate is left to close relations only; and • there is no life tenant; • the income of the estate while it is under administration is distributed as beneficiary income; and • the net assets are transferred to the beneficiaries as soon as is reasonably practicable. No rollover relief for property held to maturity 4.28 Several submissions on the proposed changes in relation to financial arrangements noted the different implications of holding the arrangements to maturity rather than realising the gains that become taxable on death. If a financial arrangement is held to maturity, there may be no net gain or loss. However, requiring it to be marked-to-market when the taxpayer dies before the arrangement matures may impose additional tax on a temporary gain. 4.29 Similarly, the rule would also mean that tax on the profits from forestry interests is brought forward when a forest owner dies before the forest is harvested. 4.30 Also, some taxpayers may be concerned about the cash implications of a requirement to pay tax when there has been no actual sale of the assets to generate cash to pay the tax liability. 17 4.31 It has been suggested that these are reasons for rollover relief, similar to that applied in Australia when a taxpayer dies with accrued capital gains. Rollover relief would enable the assets to be transferred to the estate and beneficiary at the values recorded in the books of the deceased before death so that any tax liability would not be recognised until the beneficiary subsequently sold the assets. 4.32 These are not sufficient reasons for providing rollover relief, however. In our view, rollover relief would undermine the purpose of this policy clarification primarily because of the potential for differences in the tax circumstances of the deceased and the estate/beneficiaries, which might be wholly or partially charitable. In these circumstances it seems that the forest proceeds might never constitute taxable income, even though the deceased may have deducted the costs associated with the forest in previous years. The same situation could also apply to depreciable property were rollover relief provided rather than requiring over-claimed depreciation to be squared up on the death of the taxpayer. 4.33 In overseas jurisdictions rollover relief is often associated with comprehensive capital gains taxes, which do not exist in the New Zealand tax system. The relevant assets affected by the suggested policy change are, with the exception of depreciable assets, held on revenue account, not capital account. 4.34 This distinction is important in the case of forestry. Most forestry investment occurs through the purchase of shares in a company (often a loss attributing qualifying company) and in almost all cases those shares would be held on capital account and would, therefore, be outside the tax base. In these circumstances, the suggested change would not be applicable and the taxpayer’s death would produce no tax consequences in relation to their forestry investment. The suggested change is therefore only of relevance in the forestry context to those individuals who own forests directly or who for some other reason hold the asset on revenue account. 4.35 Also, in terms of concerns about having insufficient cash to pay any tax liability, taxpayers are likely to have a number of options as to how to meet this liability, given that they still have the underlying asset. 4.36 This issue is different from the ten-year rule in relation to land. That rule envisages the gains from the sale of the land as being non-taxable after ten years and, therefore, the assets are only potentially within the tax base. In contrast, financial arrangements, forestry assets and depreciable assets are already clearly within the tax base, and it is important to ensure that the appropriate tax is paid. 4.37 Further, although the suggested approach may result in taxation at an earlier stage than had the assets been held to maturity, the taxpayer has still received a tax advantage relative to taxing on an accrual basis or on an imputed return basis. 18 Specific issue for consultation Should there be rollover relief when the only beneficiary is a spouse or de facto (same sex or opposite sex) partner in terms of the Relationship Property Act 1976, on the basis that the tax circumstances of the deceased and the beneficiary are likely to be similar? Use-of-money interest 4.38 Use-of-money interest applies to underpaid and overpaid provisional tax. The extent to which interest applies depends on whether a taxpayer is in the tax’s “safe harbour”. To be in the safe harbour taxpayers must have a residual income tax of less than $35,000 and not have estimated their provisional tax liability. 4.39 Underpayments or overpayments of provisional tax could arise as a result of a deemed disposition of assets on the death of a taxpayer. This is because the provisional tax rules assume income to be earned evenly through the year, whereas under the suggestions described here, a taxpayer’s death would bring to account, on a one-off basis, any accrued gains or losses at the date of death. 4.40 The further into the income year that death occurs, the greater the potential exposure to use-of-money interest. This is particularly an issue when the disposition gives rise to significant income. 4.41 Because death is an event for which the timing is not usually controlled, the circumstance differs from a normal asset disposition, when a taxpayer has at least some discretion over the timing of the disposal. Some modification of the use-of-money interest and provisional tax rules seems desirable to recognise this difference. 14 The suggested approach is as follows: • The income arising from the deemed disposition of assets on death would be taken out of the definition of “residual income tax”. • The income tax liability arising from the deemed disposition would still be due for payment on the terminal tax date for the income year in which the taxpayer died. • Use-of-money interest would be charged from six months after the date of the taxpayer’s death to the taxpayer’s terminal tax due date on deemed disposition amounts. 14 We are not suggesting that this approach be applied more widely. There may also be other events that generate unexpected income or losses such as changes in exchange rates, but taxpayers can hedge to reduce exposures to such events, and have chosen to enter into these arrangements in the knowledge of potential outcomes. 19 • Late payment penalties and use-of-money interest would apply to any outstanding income tax liability from the terminal tax due date for the income year in which the taxpayer died. 4.42 The suggested approach provides six months relief from use-of-money interest so as to enable the executor or administrator reasonable time to get the estate in order, including gathering the assets and establishing their value. 4.43 This approach would not affect the provisional tax and use-of-money interest on income other than that generated by the deemed disposition of assets on the death of the taxpayer. Therefore underpayments and overpayments of provisional tax in relation to “ordinary” income would still be subject to use- of-money interest as appropriate. This means that the executor or administrator would need to identify separately the magnitude and timing of the tax consequences of the deemed disposition from normal income and, therefore, provisional tax flows.

Although each of the determinations deals with slightly different financial arrangements, a problem has arisen in relation to both G9B and G14A. 1.2 Following enactment of the accrual reforms in 1999, taxpayers could elect to use determinations G9B and G14A in relation to all such financial arrangements by using the methods described within for their returns for 1998-1999, or 1999-2000. For taxpayers who did not make such an election then it is now effectively necessary to continue to use determinations G9A and G14. They are now denied access to determinations G9B and G14A, which means they have to recognise unrealised and unanticipated gains and losses each year for tax purposes. 1.3 This officials’ issues paper examines the problem and makes a number of suggestions for legislative changes to use of determinations G9B and G14A. It seeks views on the suggested changes before officials make any recommendations to the government on the matter. Depending upon the government’s decisions, amending legislation could be introduced next year. The determinations 1.4 The fundamental difference between these sets of determinations is that determinations G9A and G14 recognise both anticipated and unanticipated gains and losses arising in each year, whilst determinations G9B and G14A recognise only anticipated and realised gains and losses in each year, with unrealised, unanticipated gains/losses arising not being recognised until the last year in which the arrangement ends, or is deemed to end. In other words, determinations G9B and G14A will recognise unanticipated, but realised, gains/losses arising on interest flows or repayments of principal during the lifetime of the arrangement, as do G9A and G14, but the unrealised gains/losses arising from the change in value at the year end because of the exchange rates will not be recognised until the final year of the arrangement. 1.5 Clearly, there is a benefit in using determinations G9B and G14A in that the unexpected fluctuations which can otherwise occur are minimised. Currently, significant unrealised gains and losses can be taxable in each year, depending on the spot rate at the year end. This rate, and therefore the swing, cannot be predicted with any certainty. Using G9B and G14A means that the major unknown factor will arise in the year in which the arrangement ends when the actual costs and income are netted against the taxed sums over the whole period. This is closer to the economic reality and is closer to the scheme of the accrual legislation, which is to recognise only anticipated 2 gains and losses over the life of the arrangement, and not to require unnecessary compliance costs. Suggested changes 1.6 Officials suggest that it should be mandatory for all or most taxpayers who could use determinations G9B and G14A to do so for all arrangements and contracts which are covered by these determinations for all returns for the years ended on or after 31 st March 2006. All arrangements in existence would have to be brought into line with the determinations. 1.7 The change in method by a taxpayer would require the calculation of a transitional adjustment in the year of change. 1.8 Determinations G9A and G14 would remain in existence, providing a method of calculation to be used for arrangements with no predetermined end date when there is no forward rate so the anticipated gain cannot be calculated. 1.9 It may be appropriate to provide an exemption from this requirement for smaller corporates. Certain exemptions already exist for natural persons who satisfy the definition of a “cash basis person” under section EH 27 of the Income Tax Act 1994. An exemption for smaller corporates would be in recognition of the fact that there will be costs incurred in making the required calculations under determinations G9B and G14A. These costs would be offset by the gains in certainty, but the issue might not be so straightforward for this particular group of taxpayers. 1.10 Other benefits arising from the use of determinations G9B and G14A are that it would: • Improve the consistency of treatment between a foreign denominated loan arrangement and that of a New Zealand dollar denominated loan. • Assist all taxpayers to gain greater certainty in their calculations of provisional tax. Currently, as significant unrealised gains/losses can be taxable in each year, planning and the calculation of provisional tax payments can be a difficult exercise. Submissions 1.11 Submissions are invited on: • all aspects of the suggested mandatory application of determinations G9B and G14A; 3 • whether there should be a de minimis, or minimum value, exemption for small corporates, and if so how it should be calculated, and at what level it should stand; and • whether the period of four years before the use of a new or amended determination becomes mandatory should be reduced. 1.12 Submissions should be addressed to: Determinations The General Manager Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON Or email: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz 1.13 The closing date for submissions is 17 December 2003. Submissions should contain a brief summary of their main points and recommendations. 1.14 Submissions may be published on the web site of the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue, in the interests of making the information widely available.

The issues that led to these determinations were discussed in the 1997 government discussion document The Taxation of Financial Arrangements. 2 There was consultation on the determinations whilst they were in draft form, and then they were published in the New Zealand Gazette on 7 May 1998 and in the May 1998 Tax Information Bulletin Volume 10, No. 5. There are currently a number of concerns about the legislation as it stands. 2.2 Taxpayers who failed to elect in to determinations G9B and G14A are excluded from now doing so as the election window has closed. This means that they have to recognise unrealised and unanticipated gains and losses each year for tax purposes. They will have received a deduction for their unrealised losses against their profits, and will have been taxed on their unrealised gains. It is not possible for them to avoid this. When the two-year window for the election was introduced it was believed that taxpayers would take the opportunity to opt in sooner rather than later. 2.3 The reasoning behind the window was twofold. Firstly, it was to ensure that all taxpayers elected in sooner rather than later, so a consistency in treatment of arrangements within the accrual rules could be obtained at the earliest opportunity. Secondly, it was to minimise the opportunities for taxpayers to manipulate their choice of date of entry into the determinations, thus protecting the revenue. It was not anticipated that some taxpayers would not make the election within the permitted period, and so be denied the opportunity to access the benefits of determinations G9B and G14A in the future. 2.4 The unrealised gains and losses that fall to be taxed each year outside of determinations G9B and G14A are random. They depend on the spot rate at the year end, which can fluctuate significantly and is a rate over which the taxpayer can have no control. The sums involved, which are notional to the extent that they are not realised, can be very large. 2.5 Figure 1 demonstrates very simply the difference in how the cost is spread over three years, using each method, for a fairly straightforward transaction to which determinations G9A/G9B can apply. The full detail of the example can be found in Appendix 2. 3 1 See Appendix 2 for full details. 2 Chapter 8, “The Taxation of Foreign Exchange Loans and Forward Contracts”. 3 The example at Appendix 2 is taken from The New Zealand Accrual Regime – a practical guide, 2 nd Edition, by Susan Glazebrook, Andra Glyn-Jones, Jan James, Greg Cole (CCH New Zealand Ltd). 5 Comparison of taxation consequences of G9A and G9B 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Yr 1Yr 2Yr 3 Year of taxation Percentage of total cost G9A G9B 2.6 Beyond the practical problems for taxpayers, there is also a problem in that the scheme of the accruals legislation generally seeks to treat all forms of debt as consistently as possible, so as to minimise the impact of tax on the structuring of debt instruments. This means that, so far as possible, the treatment of New Zealand dollar denominated arrangements and foreign denominated arrangements should lead to the same results. All gains from a financial arrangement should be taxed, and the expected or anticipated gains spread over the life of an arrangement. This is what is achieved under determinations G9B and G14A, but not determinations G9A and G14. 2.7 Other problems are created as a consequence of the effect of recognition of unrealised gains and losses. The tax profit is divorced from the “cash” profit, and this makes it difficult to estimate the provisional tax that needs to be paid by taxpayers in the course of the year. The provisional tax is based on the anticipated profit or loss that the business thinks it will make for the year. The spot rate at the future balance sheet date will, of course, not be known in the year, so businesses find it difficult to guess what the value of their financial arrangements will be at the year end. This means that they are unable to quantify accurately their expected profit for the purposes of calculating their provisional tax. 2.8 Some taxpayers made the election under determinations G9B and G14A at the appropriate time. Their gains and losses which are both anticipated and unrealised are spread over the period of the arrangement. A transitional adjustment was made in the year of change, and for all years after that they have neither recognised unanticipated and unrealised exchange profits, nor unanticipated and unrealised exchange losses, for tax purposes. Their tax liability is calculated in accordance with the scheme of the accruals legislation. Figure 1: Comparison of taxation consequences of determinations G9A and G9B 6 Suggested changes 2.9 In view of the concerns raised with regard to the operation of the determinations as they currently stand, and having regard to those issues raised above, there is some merit in giving consideration to amending the determinations and legislation to enable those taxpayers who did not elect into determinations G9B and G14A in the time allowed to now opt in. In framing such an amendment, it is important to have regard to those taxpayers that did elect to use determinations G9B and G14A for 1998/99 or 1999/2000. For that reason any change will have effect only for future years. 2.10 Officials suggest amending determinations G9B and G14A under the authority of section 90AC (1) (d) of the Tax Administration Act to: • Remove the requirement in determinations G9B(3)(a) and G14A(3)(a) to make the election by using the method in the 1998-1999 or 1999- 2000 return. • Replace it with the requirement to use determinations G9B and G14A for all arrangements which may be covered by these determinations for all periods ended on or after 31 March 2006. It is appropriate to make the use of G9B and G14A mandatory to ensure that gains and losses are accounted for identically by all taxpayers from a particular date. This approach reduces a possible risk that exchange gains are excluded from the tax base whilst losses are claimed. • The amended determinations would require a transitional adjustment, as already prescribed under the determinations, to be made in the year of transition. This adjustment is calculated by reference to the amounts that have been taxed or allowed in relation to the financial arrangement under the previous method, and what would have been taxed or allowed had determinations G9B and G14A been used from day one. The difference between these sums is taxed in the year of transition. • Prime legislation in section 90AE (for Division 2) and section 90 (6) (for Division 1) will need to be amended to enable a replacement or amended determination to take effect from this date. • Determinations G9A and G14 will remain in existence providing a method of calculation to be used for arrangements with no predetermined end date when there is no forward rate, so the anticipated gain cannot be calculated. 2.11 There are two other specific issues on which comments would be appreciated. These are firstly, should there be a de minimis limit exemption for small corporates and if so, at what level should it be set. Secondly, the issues around the timing of the legislation and how this relates to the four year period relating to determinations 7 De minimis limit 2.12 It may be appropriate to have a de minimis, or minimum value threshold, as an exception to the mandatory application by corporates of determinations G9B and G14A for lower value financial arrangements. We recognise that for smaller value financial arrangements the benefits to be gained by way of ascertaining in advance the anticipated and unrealised gains and losses each year may be less. Additionally, the compliance costs are broadly similar in nature regardless of the size of the financial arrangement. The costs and income of smaller transactions will be a greater percentage of the costs and income of smaller corporates. Although compliance costs may increase, this increase should not be overstated. For example, there will not be additional record keeping costs, as the need to use determinations G9B and G14A will not require further record keeping over and above that which is already necessary. 2.13 Possible options are to phrase the de minimis limit in terms of: • the amounts payable/receivable under the arrangement; • the value of the arrangements; • the turnover of the business; • a combination of two or three of these. 2.14 These options do not include a threshold applied to individual financial arrangements but, rather, the options apply to the sum of all the financial arrangements held by a corporate taxpayer. The reason for this is that a threshold based on the individual arrangement would be inconsistent with the requirements of determinations G9B and G14A that when they are used for one financial arrangement they must be used for all. 2.15 As an illustration of the options, the tests used under section EH 27(1), for cash basis persons, are the: “(a) absolute value of the person’s income and expenditure under financial arrangements calculated under the accrual rules in that income year added together is $100,000 or less, or (b) on every day in a particular year the absolute value of each of the person’s financial arrangements added together has a value of $1,000,000 or less” 8 2.16 Phrasing similar to this could be used for corporates. For example, limits could be set as follows: • the absolute value of the amounts payable/receivable under the arrangements not to exceed $250,000; 4 • on every day in a particular year the absolute value of each of the person’s financial arrangements added together has a value of $3,000,000 or less; 5 • the turnover of the business is less than $5,000,000 (exclusive of GST) in any 12 month period. 2.17 Although using a de minimis level calculated by reference to turnover initially has attractions in seeming simple, there may well be problems in defining exactly what is meant by turnover. The smaller corporates at which this exemption is aimed will not necessarily even be required to use Financial Reporting Standards, so a simple reference to those would not be helpful. 2.18 The advantage of using one, or both, of the methods in section EH27 is that the reference point bears a direct relationship to the financial arrangements themselves, which is what the legislation in concerned with. 2.19 These are suggestions for discussion and on which feedback is sought. 2.20 Although a new de minimis rule for corporates is being suggested, it is not suggested that changes should be made to the existing exemption for natural persons under the cash basis person exemption in section EH 27. The de minimis levels used there are working satisfactorily and seem appropriate. The definition of “company” will exclude companies acting in their capacity as trustee. The exemption will not apply to trustees. 2.21 There will be some small corporates that have already elected to use determinations G9B and G14A and would, under the suggested changes, be exempt from having to use these determinations. These corporates will not be able to now claim an exemption. They will remain in determinations G9B and G14A. At first glance, this may be thought to suggest that they are being treated differently. However, these taxpayers made the decision to opt into determinations G9B and G14A when they were able to. The facts that they took into account when making that decision have not changed, just because an exemption has become available. That exemption, to the extent that they could have chosen not to use determination G9B, was always available. 4 This is 5% of $5,000,000 and is a ball park figure of what might be incurred on a loan arrangement of a small corporate. 5 If a corporate has a turnover of $5,000,000 this would suggest, for example, very simplistically, a hedging of 60% of anticipated income. 9 Timing of legislation 2.22 Some taxpayers would like a change to be made to allow taxpayers the opportunity to use determinations G9B and G14A as soon as possible. However, section 90(6) and section 90AEof the Tax Administration Act 1994 state that when the Commissioner of Inland Revenue issues a new determination, rescinds or varies a determination the taxpayer need not give effect to it until four years after the date of publication. 2.23 Should the Commissioner issue a new determination in, say, February 2004, it could not be mandatory for taxpayers to use it until the return for the period ended 31 March 2008. If the prime legislation were changed to reduce the period of time before which a new, varied, or rescinded determination could take effect, a new determination could be put in place to be used for the return for the period ended 31 March 2006. This would require the legislation to say something along the lines of “a replacement or amended determination to take effect from the date specified within the determination so long as the return to which it first applies is for a period ending no earlier than 12 months after the date of publication”. 2.24 A general amendment of the time frame for implementing determinations would allow more flexibility and it would enable taxpayers to make use of determinations G9B and G14A earlier. The price of this is a reduced period of certainty for taxpayers. Officials do not know whether, or to what extent, this is a matter of concern for taxpayers. It may be, for instance, that in view of the uncertainty in the current reporting climate arising from the adoption of the International Accounting Standards rather than the use of New Zealand Financial Reporting Standards this is not a matter of major concern. Benefits 2.25 The suggestion to make the use of determinations G9B and G14A mandatory will bring the treatment of all financial arrangements denominated in a foreign currency into the scheme of the intent of the accrual legislation. That is, it will tax all unrealised gains/losses that are anticipated over the life of the arrangement. Any unexpected gains or losses that are taxed will only be realised gains or losses, and will not be taxed until they are realised – the date the arrangement ends or is deemed to end, or at the time that interest or a repayment of principal is paid or received. This will give taxpayers consistency, and will ensure that the fluctuations in profits for tax purposes, caused by the vagaries of using the spot rate at each balance date for revaluation, will be smoothed out. It will also ensure that the tax treatment of New Zealand dollar denominated arrangements and foreign denominated arrangements will be aligned. 10 Costs 2.26 The taxpayer may incur increased costs in making the calculations necessary for determinations G9B and G14A. However, offsetting benefits are that the taxpayer’s costs of compliance will be reduced as the anticipated unrealised gains and losses will be known for each year from the date that the arrangement is entered into. This will simplify any calculations that have to be made of provisional tax payments due. Additionally, the final tax bill for each year will be more closely aligned to the actual cash position that is related directly to the arrangement. These benefits are likely to outweigh the costs. 2.27 There may be some concerns with regard to the issue of the cost of bringing the requirement to use determinations G9B and G14A into effect in a shorter time scale than is currently provided for in the legislation. At the moment, it allows for four years to pass from the date of publication of a new or amended determination before a taxpayer has to use such a determination, although the taxpayer can choose to use the determination earlier. However, the costs or time constraints caused by introducing a shorter time scale should not prove unreasonable or likely to cause a real problem. For example, it is understood that the many interested parties have expressed a preference for implementing the IAS from 2005 rather than 2007. 6 6 In a PricewaterhouseCoopers (2003) survey, 54% of respondents said that the requirement to adopt should be effective from 2005, 9% were in favour of 2007, and 38% did not comment (taken from Chartered Accountants Journal Vol 82, No 6 July 2003 p7). 11 Appendix 1 CURRENT LEGISLATION Primary legislation For financial arrangements entered into after 20 May 1999, 7 the Division II rules, found in sections EH 20 to EH59 of the Income Tax Act 1994, detail the accrual rules to be followed for tax purposes. The purpose of the division is described in section EH20 as: “... To require parties to a financial arrangement to accrue over the term of the arrangement a fair and reasonable amount of income derived from, or expenditure incurred under the arrangement, and so prevent deferring income and advancing expenditure”. Section EH 22 (1) defines a financial arrangement as: (a) a debt or debt instrument, including a debt that arises by law; (b) an arrangement (that may include a debt or debt instrument or an excepted financial arrangement) under which a person receives money in consideration for a person providing money to any person (i) at a future time, or (ii) when an event occurs in the future or does not occur (whether or not the event occurs because notice is or is not given). The primary legislation found in Division 2 allows for spreading using a yield to maturity method, 8 a straight line method, 9 and a market valuation method. 10 The straight line method applies only to taxpayers who are party to a very small amount of financial arrangements at all times in the year. Section EH33 details which method must be used. See table 1. 7 The rules are slightly different for arrangements entered into on or before 20 th May 1999, which are governed by Division I. 8 EH 34. 9 EH 35. This applies only to persons who are party to financial arrangements where the face value of those instruments is less than $1,500,000 on any day in the year. 10 EH 36. 12 Table 1: Spreading Methods Can you use the straight line method under section EH 35? (SL) You may use SL. You must use YTM or you may use an alternative under section EH 34. Is there a determination? You must use a determination under seciton EH 38(1), or an alternative under section EH 38(2). Do you meet the criteria of section EH 39? Do you meet the criteria of section EH 40? You must use a method that complies with section EH 39. You should apply to the Commissioner for a determination under section 90AC of the Tax Administration Act 1994. You must use a method that complies with section EH 40. Can you use the yield to maturity method under section EH 34? (YTM) Can you use the market valuation method under section EH 36? (MV) You may use MV. SPREADING METHODS You may use either method, outlined in Box A and Box B, if you satisfy the legislative criteria. Otherwise, you must apply section EH 34. Yes No No Yes YesNo Yes Yes Yes No No No This flowchart illustrates the process a person should follow to determine which spreading method to use. AB 13 A yield to maturity method can be used when the arrangement is for a fixed period. Effectively, this will spread the income and expenditure over the period of the arrangement. A market valuation method will charge or allow the income/expense arising from the arrangement in the year but will additionally effectively tax the gain or loss arising on the change in value of the arrangement in the year at the end of each year. If a yield to maturity method cannot be used, and neither a straight line method nor market valuation method can be used or is chosen, then section EH 38 applies, and determinations G9A: “Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency or commodity other than New Zealand dollars” and G14: “Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities” must be used. This is unless an election was made for 1998/1999 or 1999/2000 to use G9B: “Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach”, and G14A: “Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach”. There are certain “excepted financial arrangements” defined in sections EH 23 and EH24. The determinations G9B and G14A apply only to certain types of financial arrangements. Types of arrangements covered by determinations G9A, G9B, G14 and G14A Determination G9A is a method for calculating the income or expenditure in respect of a financial arrangement where any rights and obligations of the parties are expressed in a “base currency” 11 other than New Zealand dollars: this base currency may be a foreign currency or a commodity. It must not be fixed in New Zealand dollars. It does not apply to a forward or future contract, a futures contract, a swap contract, an option, or a security arrangement. Determination G9B is applicable to essentially the same arrangements and may be used when a business holds financial arrangements where the rights and obligations under the financial arrangement are fixed or otherwise determined in a currency other than New Zealand dollars, including variable rate arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars. The determination only applies, however, to financial arrangements where the payment dates are known not later than the first balance sheet date after becoming a party to the financial arrangement; and forward rates for the currency in which the financial arrangements are denominated can be determined. 11 G9A (5) defines base currency “in relation to a financial arrangement means the currency or commodity in which rights or obligations under the financial arrangements are fixed.”. 14 Determinations G14 and G14A may be used when a taxpayer is a party to a forward contract for foreign exchange and commodities. A forward contract for foreign exchange or commodities is a contract to buy or sell specified amounts of foreign currency or commodities at some future date at a specified contract rate. For example, a forward contract for currency is a contract to buy or sell specified amounts of currency at a future date at a price fixed (in terms of another currency) at the time that the contract is entered into. Each party contracts simultaneously to sell one currency and purchase another currency. The same forward contract can always be viewed as either the sale of one currency or the purchase of the other currency. A forward contract has characteristics that are very similar to those of a swap contract. In fact, swaps are often structured as a series of forward contracts. If a taxpayer is party to a swap, however, these determinations must not be applied. Instead, determination G27 should be used. The only exception is a swap for fixed amounts, to be exchanged at a single fixed date. This type of swap is, in substance, a forward contract. Therefore a party to this type of financial arrangement should apply determination G14 or G14A, not G27. Practical effects of G9A, G14, G9B and G14A Determination G9A broadly follows the accounting treatment of foreign exchange loans to the extent that changes in the spot value of the loan are brought into account for tax on each balance sheet date. This is achieved by returning the difference between the opening and closing book value of the loan as income or expenditure in the year, along with any consideration given or received in the year. Determination G14 treats the difference between the forward value and the spot value of the commodity or currency at the start of the contract as a premium or discount. This is spread over the term of the contract. At subsequent balance sheet dates the change in the spot value of the currency or commodity is brought into account for tax as a loss or gain. Determination G9B spreads the expected income or expenditure over the life of the arrangement, and brings the unexpected gains or losses into account when the arrangement ends or is deemed to end. (Gains or losses realised at the date of payments of interest or principal will also still be recognised as in G9A and G14.) To calculate the expected component, at the date at which the arrangement is entered into the taxpayer converts the base currency payments into expected New Zealand dollar payments on the basis of the forward rates at that date, and spreads the expected New Zealand net amount over the term of the financial arrangement. The unexpected component is calculated at the end of the arrangement by comparing the actual New Zealand dollar amount with the expected New Zealand dollar payments. Determination G14A operates in the same way as G9B. The base currency payments are converted into expected New Zealand dollar payments on the basis of the forward rates at the time the taxpayer becomes a party to the forward contract, and by spreading the expected New Zealand dollar amount over the term of the contract. The unexpected component is calculated at the end of the arrangement by comparing 15 the actual New Zealand dollar amount with the expected New Zealand dollar payments. It is not possible to use the determinations under determinations G9B and G14A if an election was not made for the 1998-1999 or 1999-2000 years. It is also not possible to use G9B without using G14A or vice versa. If such an election was not made then G9A and G14 must be used. The exception to this is when a financial arrangement covered by either G9B or G14A is entered into in a subsequent year for the first time, in which case the election can then be made by using that methodology for the first accounting period in which the taxpayer was subject to such an arrangement. Practical differences between G9A and G14, and G9B and G14A The significant difference between G9A/G14 and G9B/G14A is that under the latter the income or expense (including the anticipated exchange gains or losses) is spread over the period of the arrangement, and the unexpected and unrealised gains/losses are brought into account under a Base Price Adjustment only when the arrangement matures or ends. The Base Price Adjustment is an adjustment in the year in which the arrangement ends, is disposed of, or matures, 12 and which effectively charges or allows any income or expense which has not been taken into account in previous years. 13 Realised gains and losses on actual payments made or received will be recognised at the point of payment, which ever determination is used. 12 EH 45 defines the circumstances when such an adjustment is required. 13 EH 47 details the calculation required. 16 Appendix 2 A DETAILED EXAMPLE DEMONSTRATING THE USE OF G9A AND G9B (Taken from The New Zealand Accrual Regime – a practical guide, 2 nd Edition, by Susan Glazebrook, Andra Glyn-Jones, Jan James, Greg Cole (CCH New Zealand Ltd)) This example demonstrates the potential difference in the tax treatment of foreign currency loans, using a relatively simple example, using first G9A and then G9B. 1. Using G9A It is assumed that a New Zealand resident borrows for a $US100 discount a $US1,100 three-year note paying $US100 pa coupons payable in arrears. Cash flows, in US dollars, are: Year Cash flows 0 1,000 (initial borrowing) 1 (100) 2 (100) 3 (1,200) The US dollar yield (i.e. The discount rate at which the net present value of the cash flows equals zero) is approximately 12.94% pa. Spot US/NZ rates are assumed to be: End of Year 0 0.5 End of Year 1 0.55 End of Year 2 0.45 End of Year 3 0.5 The spot rate at the beginning of a year is assumed to be the spot rate at the end of the previous year. In this example, all figures are rounded to the nearest dollar. In year 1: (a) The closing tax book value in US dollars is $1,000 plus $129 (being the accrued interest of $1,000 x 12.94%) minus $100 coupon interest paid - a total of $1,029. (b) The opening tax book value in US dollars is $1,000 (c) Closing tax book value in New Zealand dollars at 0.55 spot rate is $1,871 (d) Opening tax book value in New Zealand dollars at 0.5 spot rate is $2,000 (e) Coupon payment at 0.55 spot rate is $NZ182. 17 (f) Accrual expenditure in New Zealand dollars is, therefore: • closing tax book value = $1,871, plus • coupon payment = $182, minus • opening tax book value = $2,000 Total = $53 This figure can be interpreted as expenditure of $258 (being the yield of $US 129 at the initial spot rate of 0.5) minus an exchange gain of $205 (being the “reduction” in liability of $US1,129 at the end of year 1 caused by the spot exchange rate increasing by 0.05 points). In year 2: (a) The closing tax book value in US dollars is $1,029 plus $133 (being the accrued interest of $1,029 x 12.94%) minus $100 coupon interest paid - a total of $1,062. (b) The opening tax book value in US dollars is $1,029. (c) Closing tax book value in New Zealand dollars at 0.45 spot rate is $2,360. (d) Opening tax book value in New Zealand dollars at 0.55 spot rate is $1,871. (e) Coupon payment at 0.45 spot rate is $NZ222. (f) Accrual expenditure in New Zealand dollars is, therefore: • closing tax book value = $2,360, plus • coupon payments $222, minus • opening tax book value = $1,871 Total = $711 This figure can be interpreted as expenditure of $242 (being the yield of $US133 at the spot rate of 0.55) plus an exchange loss of $469 (being the “increase” in liability of $US1,162 at the end of year 2 caused by the spot exchange rate decreasing by 0.1 point). In year 3: The taxpayer must apply the base price adjustment formula. This involves determining the consideration paid to the person less the consideration paid by the person, less income already recognised and plus expenditure already recognised. (a) Consideration provided to the taxpayer was $NZ 2,000. 18 (b) Consideration provided by the taxpayer is (in New Zealand dollars): S Year 1 182 Year 2 222 Year 3 2,400 Total 2,804 (c) Expenditure incurred in Years 1 and 2 was (in New Zealand dollars): S Year 1 53 Year 2 711 Total 764 Thus, expenditure in year 3 is (in New Zealand dollars): $2,000 - $2,804 + $764 = $40 This figure can be interpreted as expenditure of $307 (being the yield of $US137 at the spot rate of 0.45) plus an exchange gain of $267 (being the “decrease” in liability of $US1,199 at the end of year 3 caused by the spot exchange rate increasing by 0.05 points). Over the three-year term, accrued expenditure in US dollars amounts to $400 ($300 coupon plus $100 discount). In New Zealand dollars it is $804, being coupon payments of $604 and discount of $200. The eventual cash flows, in New Zealand dollars, were: S Year 0 (2,000) Year 1 182 Year 2 222 Year 3 2,400 Net 804 Actual cash flows (in New Zealand dollars) resulted in net expenditure to the borrower of $804. This is the amount of expenditure calculated under the full accrual method set out in determination G9A. However, the use of spot rates resulted in the $804 expenditure being spread unevenly as follows (in New Zealand dollars): S Year 1 53 Year 2 711 Year 3 40 Net 804 19 2. Using G9B The same example using G9B produces very different results. Using the same facts as above (i.e. A New Zealand resident borrows for a $US100 discount a $US1,100 three-year note paying $US100 pa coupons payable in arrears), it would be calculated as follows : Cash flows, in US dollars, are: Year Cash flows 0 1,000 (initial borrowing) 1 (100) 2 (100) 3 (1,200) The US dollar yield (i.e. The discount rate at which the net present value of the cash flows equals zero) is approximately 12.94% pa. Spot US/NZ rates are assumed to be: End of Year 0 0.5 End of Year 1 0.55 End of Year 2 0.45 End of Year 3 0.5 The spot rate at the beginning of a year is assumed to be the spot rate at the end of the previous year. In this example, all figures are rounded to the nearest dollar. Assume forward rates for each year at the time the arrangement was entered into are 0.5. Expected cash flows in New Zealand dollars under the arrangement, using the forward rate of 0.5, are as follows: Year Cash flows 0 2,000 (initial borrowing) 1 (200) 2 (200) 3 (2,400) Again, this gives a yield of approximately 12.94%. This would give rise to expected New Zealand dollar expenditure in each year of: Year Expenditure I $258.8 (being S2,000 x 12.94%) 2 $266.4 (being S2,058.8 x 12.94%) 3 $275 (being S2,125 x 12.94%) 20 The unexpected component for each year is as follows: Year 1 Actual value of $US100 payment at the spot rate of 0.55 = $NZ182 Expected value of $US100 payment at the forward rate of 0.5 = $NZ200 This gives an unexpected “gain” of $8. Therefore, in year 1 the expenditure recognised would be $258.8 less $8 = $250.8 Year 2 Actual value of $US100 payment at the spot rate of 0.45 = $NZ222 Expected value of $US 100 payment at the forward rate of 0.5 = $NZ200 This gives an unexpected “loss” of $22. Therefore in year 1 the expenditure recognised would be $266.4 plus $22 = $288.4 Year 3 The taxpayer must apply the base price adjustment formula. This involves determining the consideration paid to the person less the consideration paid by the person, less income already recognised and plus expenditure already recognised. (a) Consideration provided to the taxpayer was $NZ2,000. (b) Consideration provided by the taxpayer is (in New Zealand dollars): S Year 1 182 Year 2 222 Year 3 2,400 Total 2,804 (c) Expenditure incurred in years 1 and 2 was (in New Zealand dollars): S Year 1 250.8 Year 2 288.4 Total 539.2 Thus, expenditure in year 3 is (in New Zealand dollars): $2,000 - $2,804 + $539.2 = $264.8 As can be seen this method produces a much more even income and expenditure flow than the full accrual method used in determination G9A.

The Review indicated that New Zealand’s rules relating to the taxation of offshore portfolio investment by New Zealanders were a priority area for reform. The problem identified by the Review was the inconsistent treatment of different types of offshore portfolio (or non-controlled) investments. 1.2 The Review suggested that the risk-free return method (RFRM) could be applied to replace the current rules that tax non-controlled offshore investment in listed shares and retail unit trusts. The recommendation was that the RFRM would apply to all offshore investments in these assets – no matter the country of investment. 1.3 Under this method of taxation, taxable income would be based on an imputed rate of return to an asset. The return would be calculated by applying an assumed risk-free rate of return to the value of the asset at the start of the year. The investor’s personal tax rate would then be applied to taxable income to calculate the RFRM tax liability. 1.4 Since the Review released its final report, tax policy officials from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue and from the Treasury have been considering the issue of the tax treatment of non-controlled offshore investment in equity. This paper examines the issue, and suggests options for change. It seeks views on the suggested changes before officials make recommendations to the government on the matter. 1.5 At present, the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules provide a system to tax non-controlled offshore investments. The FIF rules were developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The rules were the product of some difficult trade-offs, and as a result, there have always been weaknesses in the rules. Moreover, the New Zealand economy and investment environment have changed considerably over the last ten or so years. In particular, New Zealanders regard offshore equity investments as much more of a normal part of their investment portfolio. Corporate residence has become more mobile as have people. New Zealand is increasingly a migration destination for people from outside Western Europe and North America, and new migrants often bring with them substantial offshore investments. These developments have highlighted the inherent weaknesses of the existing tax rules. 1.6 One weakness of the current rules is the distinction they make between the so-called “grey list” countries – countries whose tax systems are similar to New Zealand’s, as specified in Schedule 3 of the Income Tax Act 1994 – and those that are not on the grey list. As a result, equity investments in non-grey list countries can be subject to comprehensive income tax treatment (under an accrued capital gains tax), whereas similar investments in grey list 2 countries are taxed only on dividends and, in certain cases, revenue account gains (on realisation). 1.7 Not only does this distinction distort how and where New Zealanders invest, it has also created base maintenance problems. This has occurred most notably in the area of Australian unit trusts that are owned by New Zealand investors and invest in New Zealand debt instruments, such as New Zealand government stock. The returns to the funds are tax-free in Australia (because of the Australian tax treatment of trusts) and virtually tax-free in New Zealand (where only a 2% approved issuer levy is deducted from interest payments made to the unit trust). Comparatively, a New Zealander investing directly in New Zealand government stock would be subject to full taxation on the interest income derived. 1.8 At the same time that the current rules can create low levels of New Zealand tax on some investments and base maintenance problems, they have also been seen as imposing an unfair level of tax on those investments subject to the full force of the FIF rules. This may encourage New Zealanders to migrate and discourage people from migrating to New Zealand. 1.9 The base maintenance issue raised by New Zealanders investing in Australian unit trusts that in turn invest in New Zealand debt instruments could possibly be countered by a targeted measure. As the Australian unit trust problem is caused by the ability of New Zealanders to invest in funds virtually not subject to tax in Australia or New Zealand, a measure could be developed to bring such investments into, for example, the FIF rules. It would not, however, be easy to do this. A measure that made subject to the FIF rules unit trusts that were not taxed on beneficial income overseas would significantly change the New Zealand tax treatment of investment vehicles in Australia, the United Kingdom and elsewhere. Moreover, it would leave unchanged the underlying problems of the FIF rules. Therefore more far- reaching options are being canvassed in this paper. 1.10 Two options are presented in this paper. The first approach is referred to as the “standard return rule”, and the second approach is referred to as the “offshore portfolio investment rules”. 1.11 The standard return approach would apply a version of the Tax Review’s RFRM proposal to non-controlled offshore equity investment in a non- business context. As with the RFRM proposal, taxable income would be calculated by applying a statutory deemed rate of return to the opening value of a qualifying asset. The current tax rules for non-controlled offshore investment would apply for investment in a business context. The aim of the standard return approach is to ensure that non-controlled offshore investments held outside a business context are taxed at a level that equates to a reasonable dividend yield. 1.12 The offshore portfolio investment rules would provide a series of income calculation methods for non-controlled offshore investment in equity. The main method would calculate taxable income as a portion of the change in 3 share value and distributions derived. This option would provide rules that would apply to all non-controlled offshore investments in equity, irrespective of the country of investment or the legal form of investment. The aim of the approach is, first, to minimise the influence of tax on investment decisions by providing as much consistency as possible and, second, to provide rules that are not unduly costly to comply with by providing income calculation mechanisms that are simple to use. 1.13 These options should be evaluated by the extent to which they are effective at countering the identified base maintenance issue and the extent to which they narrow the differences between domestic and various types of offshore investment (including differences between different offshore investments). 1.14 In a related development, representatives of the New Zealand savings industry have suggested that consideration should also be given to extending a RFRM approach to unit trusts and similar investment vehicles resident in New Zealand. The government has agreed that officials should include a broad option developed by the industry in this issues paper, shown in Appendix 1. Summary of the options and evaluation A standard return rule Offshore portfolio investment rules The option Investments would be taxed on an imputed 4% standard return rate (distributions such as dividends would not be taxed when derived) It would broadly apply to non-business investments in foreign companies, unit trusts, foreign superannuation schemes and life insurance (qualifying assets) The standard return rate would apply to the opening market value of qualifying assets (if available, otherwise approximated market values) Acquisitions and realisations of qualifying assets during an income year would be accounted for in the income tax calculation as part-year adjustments. (The standard return rate would be reduced to reflect part-year holding periods.) The option These rules would apply to holdings of non- controlled offshore equity investments which cost more than NZD$15,000. Broadly, investors with non-controlled interests of 10% or greater in foreign companies would be taxed on: – a branch equivalent basis (taxable income calculated as if the company were a NZ branch); or – a foreign accounts basis (taxable income based on the share of the company’s after-foreign tax income prepared under the accounting rules of the foreign jurisdiction); or – a revised comparative value basis (70% of the sum of the yearly changes in value of the interest plus dividends would be taxable); or – an imputed rate of return (only available for smaller taxpayers or those unable to use the other methods – taxable income calculated using a rate of return based on the five-year government stock rate – dividends would not be taxable when derived) Investors with non-controlled interests of less than 10% in a foreign company or interests in assets other than companies would be restricted to using either a revised comparative value basis or an imputed rate of return 4 Issues addressed It addresses the low-effective tax rate that can arise in respect of certain grey list investments as it assumes taxable income based on a reasonable dividend of 4% each year, irrespective of whether a dividend is actually paid out It addresses the Australian unit trust issue as New Zealand investors’ share of the income derived by the unit trust would be taxable at a deemed 4% rate It addresses liquidity issues that can arise under the FIF rules as steep increases in the value of investments during a year would not be brought to tax Issues addressed It addresses the low effective tax rate that can arise in respect of certain grey list investments as near- full economic income to these investments would be taxable. If offers consistent treatment of different types of offshore investment – the same tax treatment for grey list/non-grey list; revenue account/capital account; and passive/active investments It addresses the Australian unit trust issue as New Zealand investors’ interests in these unit trusts would be taxable on a change-in-value basis each year as well as dividends derived Submissions 1.15 We invite submissions on the options discussed in this issues paper.

This included equity, debt and other investments. 2.2 The equity component comprised around NZD$35 billion, as shown in figure 1. Equity investments include interests in listed and unlisted offshore companies and overseas institutions such as foreign retail unit trusts, superannuation funds and life insurance policies. Investment type 2.3 An investor’s interest is defined as a direct investment, for the purposes of this data, if the investor has an interest of greater than 10% in an entity. Total direct investment in offshore entities made up around NZD$15 billion, with around NZD$12 billion of this being equity investment. 2.4 An investor’s interest is defined as a portfolio investment if that investor has an ownership interest of 10% or less in an entity. Total portfolio investment in offshore entities was around NZD$34 billion, with around NZD$23 billion of this being equity. 2.5 Around NZD$37 billion was held as other offshore investments, such as financial derivatives and reserve assets. Figure 1: NZ offshore investment by type (as at June 2003) 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 OtherEquity Type NZD$ billions Portfolio Investment Direct Investment 6 Investor type 2.6 Offshore portfolio investments are held by individuals, fund managers and other entities such as companies. 2.7 With regard to equity investment, fund managers and other entities accounted for approximately NZD$17 billion of portfolio investment, as shown in figure 2. 2.8 Around NZD$15.2 billion of the portfolio equity investment was made by fund managers. This included around NZD$1.9 billion of investment that was held by small funds that are not included in official statistics. 2.9 We estimate that around NZD$2 billion of investment undertaken through managed funds was made by passive funds – funds that track a recognised stock market index. The remainder of investment was made by funds that are actively managed. 2.10 In addition, Statistics New Zealand has estimated that individuals hold around NZD$5.5 billion of overseas portfolio equity investments directly. Around 60% of this investment (NZD$3.3 billion) is held in Australia. 2.11 Thus the data indicate that fund managers account for almost 66% of the stock of offshore portfolio equity investment.

In considering efficiency, the impact of policies on the domestic economy as a whole must be considered. In general, the most efficient tax system will be a system that minimises the effect of tax on individuals’ decisions. Therefore, in relation to an income tax, efficiency generally implies that all sources of income should be taxed in the same manner. However, this goal needs to be balanced against other concerns such as the compliance costs faced by taxpayers from having all forms of income taxed in the same manner, as well as equity considerations. 3.3 Equity considerations are normally expressed in terms of horizontal equity and vertical equity. Horizontal equity implies that individuals with equal incomes should be subject to the same level of tax. Vertical equity involves judgements about the treatment of individuals with different incomes. The treatment of foreign taxes 3.4 In order to attain the maximum benefit for the domestic economy, the international tax rules should create incentives to ensure that when investors make decisions that maximise their private returns, they simultaneously maximise the national return to New Zealand. Given that cross-border flows of income are potentially subject to tax in two countries, it is important to keep the distinction between returns to the individual and returns to the economy as a whole in mind when considering the appropriate treatment of foreign taxes. 3.5 From the point of view of attaining the maximum benefit to the domestic economy, payments of foreign tax by New Zealanders are best considered as a cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. This is because the return to New Zealanders from investing offshore does not include taxes paid to foreign governments. However, payments of New Zealand tax are part of the return to the domestic economy, as is the after-“all-taxes” return to New Zealand investors. This implies that from an efficiency point of view residents should be given a deduction for taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions. 9 Source versus residence taxation 3.6 International tax rules are usually described as source-based or residence- based. Source-based rules would tax all income earned in a country, without consideration of the residence of the individual or entity earning the income. Residence-based rules would tax the worldwide income of residents of the taxing country and would not tax the income of non-residents. In practice, most tax systems, including New Zealand’s, are a combination of source- based and residence-based taxation. 3.7 From an efficiency point of view, a small country like New Zealand is generally likely to do best by following residence-based taxation. This indicates that residents should be taxed at the same rate of New Zealand tax on all sources of domestic and foreign income, recognising foreign taxes as a cost of business by allowing them to be deductible. This approach can be described as the residence principle. 3.8 The rationale for taxing residents on all sources of income is that if a resident has the choice between two investments that provide the same return to the domestic economy and differ only in that one is onshore and one is offshore, the tax system should not influence the investor’s decision as to which investment to take up. 3.9 If the after-foreign tax returns to offshore investment were taxed more lightly than the domestic returns to onshore investment, New Zealanders might choose offshore projects in preference to domestic projects that provided the same return to the domestic economy. From an efficiency point of view, investment decisions would not be made to provide the maximum return to the domestic economy. Also, this might make it more difficult for New Zealand firms to gain access to funding. Constraints in the international context 3.10 A number of issues arise when considering the extent to which the residence principle can be applied in the international context. 3.11 First, the principle needs to be balanced against the fact that New Zealand residents are mobile. If residents were taxed in a way that was particularly onerous in comparison with the taxation of residents of other countries New Zealand residents might leave New Zealand. This limits the extent to which the New Zealand government can tax residents. 3.12 Second, in the domestic context, equity investments are often subject to tax at two levels. Tax is often levied at the entity level, with the entity level tax acting like a withholding tax. Investors are then taxed on income they derive from the entity, with a credit provided in certain circumstances for tax paid at the entity level. A key difference in the international context is that the entity invested into cannot be taxed as part of the New Zealand tax base. 10 3.13 Third, when New Zealand investors own small interests in offshore entities the amount of information available on the income of the entity will generally be so limited that the tax liability must be based on proxies for income. 3.14 Fourth, domestic investments are treated differently, depending on whether they are held on revenue or capital account. This results in the total effective tax rate on a domestic investment varying depending on the form of investment. It also means we cannot implement rules that treat all offshore investments in the same manner while being consistent with the treatment of onshore investments. 3.15 These constraints imply that the practical approach to the taxation of offshore investment is to design rules that attempt to minimise the influence of tax on the decision of whether to invest domestically or offshore and on the decision of where to locate offshore investment. Such rules would provide income calculation methods that represent a reasonable approximation of how similar investments are taxed domestically, while minimising the compliance costs associated with calculating income. Taxing actual income versus expected income 3.16 Proxies to calculate taxable income could be of two types. First, the proxy could seek to tax the actual income from an investment once that income has been earned – that is, it could tax on an ex post basis. This is consistent with how income is taxed in the domestic context. Second, the proxy could seek to tax an investment on the basis of the expected return from the investment – that is, on an ex ante basis. As the only information needed to tax an asset on an expected return basis is the initial value of the asset, this method is advantageous in cases of limited information. 3.17 Subject to certain assumptions, an investor would be equally happy to be taxed under rules that tax full income on an ex post basis and rules that tax an ex ante risk-free return. This is because, for the same asset, ex ante taxation of risk-free returns places more risk on the investor than does ex post taxation of actual returns, since an investor’s tax liability would not vary with the actual income derived within the period that the tax liability is assessed. The compensation for assuming this extra risk is that the investor’s tax liability would be expected to be lower under ex ante taxation of risk-free expected returns. 3.18 If investors were unhappy with the new, higher level of risk, they would be able to return to their initial risk position by reallocating their portfolio in favour of lower risk assets, thus lowering both their expected return and risk. 11 3.19 It is unlikely that it would be possible to set a risk-free rate of return that resulted in taxpayers being completely indifferent between ex ante and ex post taxation. However, if ex ante taxation were to be used as a proxy for income, the goal would be to levy tax at a rate that provided a reasonable trade-off between the additional risk that the taxpayer bears under this method and the lower expected tax liability that the taxpayer would be subject to. The options within the framework 3.20 In implementing the residence principle, a trade-off will always need to be made between accuracy and compliance costs. This trade-off means that, even if the residence principle is accepted as the correct framework, there is no “correct” way to tax non-controlled offshore investment. Judgments will need to be made as to the appropriateness of different proxies. 3.21 This issues paper presents two options. They each take a different approach to the problems in relation to the current rules applying to non-controlled offshore investment. A standard return rule 3.22 The standard return approach maintains broadly the current approach to taxing non-controlled offshore investment. That is, the tax rules applying to investments in a business context would remain the same, and for non- business investments a taxable “standard return” of 4% would be imputed to the investor. If adopted, this approach would represent an incremental step towards the residence principle, since imputing a 4% return should address the areas that currently provide the most significant opportunities to minimise New Zealand tax. Offshore portfolio investment rules 3.23 The rationale of the second option is to apply the residence principle by providing rules that apply to all non-controlled offshore investment. Its purpose is to minimise the influence of tax on the decisions of whether to invest domestically or offshore and where to locate offshore investment. In doing so, it seeks to provide income calculation mechanisms that provide a reasonable approximation of the effective tax rate on similar domestic investments while minimising compliance costs. This option applies the same rules to different forms of offshore investment, irrespective of the country of investment or type of investor. 12 Chapter 4 THE CURRENT RULES FOR NON-CONTROLLED OFFSHORE INVESTMENT AND PROBLEMS 4.1 Two sets of tax rules can apply to non-controlled interests in offshore equity. Which set of rules applies will generally depend on whether or not the investment is in a so-called “grey list” country. The grey list refers to certain investments in seven countries – Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, Norway, the United States, Germany and Japan. Grey list countries are countries that are considered to have tax systems similar to that of New Zealand. 4.2 Around 80% of non-controlled offshore investment in equity occurs in grey list countries. The current tax rules for non-controlled investment in grey list countries 4.3 The main difference between investments in non-controlled offshore entities and onshore entities is that the income earned by offshore entities cannot be taxed within the New Zealand tax base. Ideally, the New Zealand tax rules should address this by approximating the income earned by the foreign entity and attributing it to the New Zealand investor. However, for investments in foreign companies and unit trusts that are resident in a grey list country (“grey list investments”) no approximation of entity level tax is made. 4.4 At the level of the investor, grey list investments are subject to the general tax rules that apply for equity investments. That is, the tax treatment will depend on whether the investment is held on capital account or on revenue account. 4.5 If a grey list investment is acquired with the purpose of resale, or the sale of the asset could be considered to be part of the ordinary business of the investor, then that investment would be considered to be held on revenue account. The consequence of this is that the investment would be subject to tax on changes in value on realisation as well as on dividends derived. 4.6 On the other hand, if the investment is purchased with the dominant purpose of deriving dividend income, it would generally be considered to be held on capital account. In this case the investor would only be subject to tax on dividends derived. 13 4.7 Individuals who hold grey list investments directly, New Zealand funds that passively track foreign indices with grey list resident companies and New Zealand companies that hold grey list investments that do not form part of their business will generally hold their interests on capital account. These investments represent around a third of non-controlled offshore investment in equity. 4.8 Institutions that actively manage investors’ funds and individuals that trade in offshore equities (most New Zealand retail unit trusts), on the other hand, are likely to hold grey list investments on revenue account. Institutional investors account for the majority of non-controlled offshore revenue account investment. 4.9 Although these are the broad principles that apply in this area, the boundary between an investment on capital or revenue account is often very difficult to define. Problems with the grey list 4.10 The different treatment of grey list and non-grey list investments (the treatment of which is discussed later) and the different treatment of capital and revenue account grey list investments gives rise to significant economic costs as it results in tax being a significant factor in investment decisions. This varied treatment also gives rise to compliance costs – for example, as happens when companies migrate from a grey list to a non-grey list country. Grey list investments held on capital account 4.11 The treatment of grey list investments held on capital account provides, from the point of view of maximising returns to New Zealand, a tax incentive to invest offshore as opposed to onshore and to invest in grey list as opposed to non-grey list countries. This incentive has economic costs as money is not directed towards investments which yield the highest pre-tax returns. The treatment also provides a more favourable treatment for individuals that invest offshore directly, rather than through an institution. This is because, generally, the institution will hold the investment on revenue account, whereas a direct investor is likely to hold the investment on capital account. 4.12 The bias to invest offshore in the grey list occurs as capital account investment is only subject to New Zealand tax on the dividends derived from the investments. This means that the effective New Zealand tax rate on the total return to the domestic economy (economic income after foreign tax) from these investments can be significantly lower than on an equivalent domestic investment. To illustrate, the dividend yield on the Morgan-Stanley Capital International (MSCI) index for grey list countries, which several passive funds track, is around 1.6%. 14 4.13 This results in a lesser New Zealand tax burden than that applying to domestic investments. This is because, while an equivalent investment in a domestic entity would also only be taxable on dividends in the hands of the investor, the domestic entity would nevertheless be subject to tax in New Zealand on the income from which the distribution is made. Grey list investments held on revenue account 4.14 The taxation of grey list revenue account investments on realisation, rather than on an accrued basis, gives taxpayers the opportunity to lower their effective New Zealand tax rate on the economic income from these investments by deferring realisation. 4.15 Under the current rules, however, a significant deferral of tax does not appear to be occurring in practice. This is because it would appear that at least the larger institutional investors realise their grey list investments on a regular basis, such that any New Zealand tax deferral is not large. Other problems with the grey list 4.16 Another significant problem that arises because of the grey list is that taxpayers are able to use offshore companies and unit trusts resident in the grey list to reduce the amount of New Zealand tax that would otherwise be payable on domestic or non-grey list investments. 4.17 New Zealand residents can use certain United Kingdom managed unit trusts or Australian unit trusts to access non-grey list investments or avoid tax on investments back into New Zealand. As these vehicles are subject to low or no tax in their home jurisdiction, and investments in the vehicles are subject to very low tax in New Zealand (by virtue of being resident in the grey list), investment through these entities produces a more favourable tax result than investment through a similar New Zealand entity. This creates an incentive to invest in offshore managed funds rather than New Zealand managed funds. 4.18 For example, certain Australian unit trusts offer investment products aimed at New Zealand investors that claim virtually to remove any tax being paid on the resulting income. An example of one such structure is when a New Zealand resident purchases units in an Australian unit trust, which then uses those funds to buy New Zealand Government bonds. Interest from the bonds is paid to the Australian unit trust, with only a 2% approved issuer levy deducted. Because Australia, unlike New Zealand, taxes the entity as a trust, rather than as a company, the interest income is not taxed in Australia under Australian tax rules because it is not sourced in Australia and does not relate to an Australian beneficiary. The unit trust then distributes its income by way of non-taxable bonus issues so that the New Zealand investor ends up holding more units in the entity. Given the way New Zealand and Australian tax law interrelates, no New Zealand or Australian tax is payable at this stage. Gains that New Zealand investors derive from the eventual sale of their units may also not be taxable, depending on whether the investment was 15 held on capital or revenue account. An identical investment through a New Zealand vehicle would be clearly subject to New Zealand tax. The current tax rules for investment in non-grey list countries 4.19 New Zealand investors who hold non-controlled interests in foreign entities resident in countries outside the grey list are generally subject to tax on the income earned from those investments under the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules. Income derived in relation to certain interests in foreign superannuation schemes and life insurance policies (irrespective of country) are also subject to tax under the FIF rules. 4.20 New Zealanders with controlling interests in a foreign entity are subject to the controlled foreign company (CFC) rules. However, it is possible for quite large ownership interests in foreign entities to be non-controlled interests and thereby subject to the FIF rules 4.21 The FIF rules seek to apply the residence principle by attempting to tax, on an accrued basis, the full economic income of the foreign entity invested into. The rules provide four different income calculation mechanisms. The methods vary in terms of the level of information required for compliance and are discussed below. The methods are listed in descending order of the level of information required: The branch equivalent method 4.22 The branch equivalent method can be used only to calculate income from interests in foreign companies. Under this method, a taxpayer’s income or loss is determined as if the foreign company were a branch of a New Zealand company. That is, it requires the company’s financial accounts to be adjusted to reflect New Zealand tax legislation. The branch equivalent method is the most accurate income calculation method, but owing to the degree of information required, few taxpayers are able to use the method for non- controlled interests. 4.23 Under this method, tax credits are available for foreign non-resident withholding tax deducted from dividends derived and also for the foreign tax paid by a foreign company on its underlying income (if a taxpayer’s ownership interest in the company is greater than 10%). The accounting profits method 4.24 Under the accounting profits method, a taxpayer’s share of a foreign company’s net, after-tax accounting profit (or loss), as calculated in the foreign jurisdiction, is deemed to be the taxpayer’s FIF income (or loss) for the relevant income year. Tax credits, under this method, are also allowed only in respect of foreign non-resident withholding tax deducted from dividends derived. 16 4.25 There are a number of restrictions on using this method, including the requirement that the interest be an interest in a foreign company listed on a recognised exchange and the after-tax profits be calculated under the generally accepted accounting principles operating in the foreign jurisdiction. The comparative value method 4.26 Broadly, under the comparative value method, the net change in the market value of a FIF interest during the income year and any distributions derived is deemed to be the FIF income (or loss) for the year. Tax credits for foreign tax paid are allowed in respect of foreign non-resident withholding tax deducted from dividends derived from the FIF interest. A credit for the underlying foreign tax paid by the foreign entity is not allowed. Owing to the lower information requirements of this method, it is used in the vast majority of cases under the FIF rules. The deemed rate of return method 4.27 This method calculates the income from a FIF interest by applying a deemed rate of return to the book value of the interest at the start of the year. The deemed rate of return can be used only if there is insufficient information to use any of the other calculation methods or by individuals with small holdings. The deemed rate of return method is typically used to calculate income from interests in foreign superannuation schemes and life insurance policies. The deemed rate of return is currently 9.90%. Exemptions 4.28 In addition to the exemption for companies and unit trusts resident in grey list countries, there is a de minimis rule which exempts from the FIF rules taxpayers whose total cost of acquiring FIF interests is NZD$50,000 or less. There are also a number of exemptions for certain foreign investment schemes, such as employment-related superannuation schemes and foreign superannuation schemes or life insurance policies held before a taxpayer becomes a New Zealand resident. Problems with the current rules 4.29 One of the main criteria for establishing whether the FIF rules are an appropriate method for calculating income from offshore investment depends on how well the rules approximate the effective tax rate on a similar domestic investment. 4.30 The comparative value method, for example, would on average approximate the economic income of the entity invested into. However, in certain cases it may not be an accurate proxy of what the taxable income of a particular entity would be under New Zealand tax law. Equally, the deemed rate of return taxes on the basis of an imputed rate of return, so taxable income will often depart from actual income. 17 4.31 The comparative value and deemed rate of return methods have also been criticised for causing liquidity problems and being harsh in certain circumstances. These criticisms are levelled at the comparative value method when, for example, the underlying value of an investment increases steeply over a year and the investor is required to pay tax on the increase in value on an accrued basis. 4.32 The main criticism of the accounting profits and branch equivalent methods is that they can be compliance-cost intensive. Consequently it would appear that few taxpayers use these methods under the FIF rules. 18 Chapter 5 OPTIONS FOR REFORM AND COMMON FEATURES 5.1 We have identified a number of problems with the current tax rules for non- controlled offshore investment in equity. We have also identified two approaches which we consider would address these issues. The first is referred to as the “standard return rule”, and the second is referred to as the “offshore portfolio investment rules”. 5.2 The two approaches have several features in common: in the areas of the assets covered, the definition of “non-controlled interest”, and the countries covered. Assets covered 5.3 The offshore portfolio investment rules would apply to offshore investment by New Zealand residents in assets that are currently covered by the FIF rules. The FIF rules apply to non-controlled interests in foreign companies and unit trusts and interests in foreign superannuation schemes and foreign life insurance. A standard return rule would also broadly apply to assets currently covered by the FIF rules. 5.4 The following exemptions from the FIF rules would also be exemptions under either approach: • interests in employment-related foreign superannuation schemes; • interests in foreign life insurance policies or foreign superannuation schemes acquired by natural persons before they become resident in New Zealand for the first time; and • certain foreign private pensions and annuities derived from an interest in a qualifying foreign private annuity. Exceptions to assets covered 5.5 The standard return approach would not apply to certain shares in foreign companies that are not listed on a recognised exchange and for which a market value cannot be ascertained in an “approved” market (discussed in detail in chapter 6). In addition, the rules would not apply to shares in foreign companies, where the share is a fixed rate share, and the dividend payable is above the standard return rate. 19 5.6 A fixed rate share is defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 as, broadly, any share issued by a company where the only dividend payable in respect of that share is payable at a rate which is a specific fixed percentage of the amount subscribed in respect of the issue of the share or an amount that is determined by a fixed relationship to economic, industrial, commodity or financial indexes, or to banking rates or general commercial rates of interest. 5.7 If a fixed rate share in a foreign company yields a dividend that is less than the standard return rate, it is reasonable to assume that the shares are expected to generate other returns. The standard return approach should tax more appropriately the returns to those interests. For fixed rate shares that yield dividends above the standard return rate, the current taxation rules would apply. Definition of “non-controlled interest” 5.8 Under both approaches, the boundary between controlled and non-controlled investment would remain the same for investments in foreign companies and unit trusts. That is, the distinction would continue to be governed by the provisions that separate the FIF rules from the CFC rules. 1 5.9 An interest in a foreign company or unit trust is removed from the FIF rules if it is an investment in a CFC and the ownership interest that the investor has in the CFC is 10% or greater. An interest will be an investment in a CFC if the foreign company has, during the relevant accounting period: • a total of five or fewer New Zealand residents whose individual or aggregate interests in the company are greater than 50%; or • a single New Zealand resident holding an interest greater than 40% in the company and no other resident, or persons associated with the single New Zealand resident, have a comparable or greater interest; or • a total of five or fewer New Zealand residents have the power to exert control over shareholder decision-making in relation to the company. Countries covered 5.10 Both approaches would apply to investments in entities resident in all foreign jurisdictions. In other words, the grey list would be repealed for non- business, non-controlled offshore investments under the standard return rule and for all non-controlled offshore investments under the offshore portfolio investment rules. 1 See sections CG 4(1) and CG 15(2) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 20 Chapter 6 A STANDARD RETURN RULE 6.1 A standard return rule is a method to determine taxable income for certain non-controlled offshore investments in equity. The rule would operate by applying a statutory rate of return to a qualifying asset’s value at the beginning of an income year to determine the taxable income for that asset. Any returns from the asset, such as dividends or capital gains, would not be subject to tax. 6.2 The rule would apply to assets that were held outside a business context. It would, therefore, apply mainly to individuals holding qualifying assets. Objectives of the proposal 6.3 As discussed in Chapter 4, the main problem that we have identified with the current rules is the low effective New Zealand tax rate that can apply in respect of grey list investments held on capital account. We did not identify any significant problems with the current tax rules as they applied in a business context. 6.4 For this reason, a standard return rule would target non-business investment, while leaving unchanged the rules applying to investment in a business context. 6.5 The approach also attempts to align the treatment of non-business taxpayers’ investments within and outside the grey list by applying a standard return rule to most non-business investment currently covered by the FIF rules. 6.6 The standard return approach attempts to address these problems as far as possible within the existing taxation framework that applies to capital account investment domestically. This explains the standard return rate being set at a real risk-free rate of 4% which, broadly, reflects a reasonable dividend yield on an equivalent domestic investment held on capital account. 21 Alternative income calculation method 6.7 We consider that a standard return rule would be the main income calculation method that would be used for investment in qualifying assets. However, if an investor’s interest is in a foreign company, and they have access to sufficient information, they would have the option of applying the branch equivalent income calculation method currently provided under the FIF rules. This option would continue to be available as the branch equivalent method is the most accurate mechanism to calculate income from a foreign company. 6.8 All the tax rules that apply as a result of using the branch equivalent method (such as conduit tax relief and underlying foreign tax credits) would continue to operate. As is the case under the current FIF rules, there would be strict rules preventing investors from changing between income calculation methods. 22 Explanation of the business test Under this option, non-controlled offshore investment held in a: • non-business context would be subject to a standard return rule; and • business context would be subject to current tax rules. 6.9 Under a standard return rule a “business” test would distinguish between non-controlled offshore equity investments that are to be subject to a standard return and those that are to be subject to the current rules. 6.10 Under this test, if income from an investment was considered to be derived from a business (in accordance with section CD 3 of the Income Tax Act 1994) the investment would be subject to the current rules. However, if income from an investment was not considered to be derived from a business, the investment would be subject to the standard return rule. 6.11 An alternative to the business test would be a boundary based on whether the investment was held on capital or revenue account. Under this test an investment that was held on capital account would be subject to the standard return rule, while an investment held on revenue account would be subject to the current rules. Broadly, an investment would be considered to be on revenue account if it was purchased with the dominant purpose of resale, if the proceeds were part of the investor’s business income or if the proceeds were derived from a profit making scheme. 6.12 The main problem with a capital-revenue test is that certain investors with grey list investments might have incentives to argue that their investments were held on revenue account. Such taxpayers could prefer current revenue account rules over the standard return rule because, for investments held over a long period of time, tax would be payable only on derivation of dividends and realisation of the investment, rather than on an accrued basis. It might be relatively easy for taxpayers to argue successfully that an investment was held on revenue account because one of the tests, “acquisition for the purpose of sale”, is subjective and therefore difficult for Inland Revenue to challenge. 6.13 These arguments would be more difficult to make under a business test because the investor would be required to demonstrate that the proceeds from the sale of an investment were part of the investor’s business profits. Section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 defines “business” to include: ...any profession, trade, manufacture, or undertaking carried on for pecuniary profit. 23 6.14 The approach of the New Zealand Court of Appeal to determining whether a business exists for the purposes of this definition has been the development of a two-fold test 2 that requires an examination of the nature of the activities carried on and the intention of the taxpayer in engaging in those activities. When determining whether activities were undertaken for pecuniary profit, objective evidence such as the volume of transactions and the commitment of time, money and effort are relevant. 6.15 Therefore significant weight is put on objective evidence in both legs of the two-stage business test. This should ensure that a business or non-business boundary in the context of the standard return rule is relatively robust. 2 The leading case on the definition of “business” is Grieve v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,682. 24 Setting the rate Under this option, the standard return rate would be set at 4%. 6.16 The Tax Review, when considering the risk-free rate of return method (RFRM), recommended the adoption of a risk-free rate of return based on New Zealand government stock interest rates, adjusted for inflation. The rationale for this was to approximate the rate of return from a risk-free investment. The Tax Review considered that New Zealand government stock was an appropriate approximation of risk-free lending. Consequently, it considered a nominal rate of 6% (the relevant government stock interest rate at the time) less an inflation component of 2%, resulting in a real risk- free rate of return of 4%. 6.17 The standard return approach is consistent with the assumptions underlying a risk-free rate of return: that investors should not be taxed, on an ex ante basis, on the returns to their investments that are compensation for risk. Our tax system is not inflation-adjusted and thus a nominal (6%) rather than a real (4%) rate seems prima facie more justifiable. The objective of the standard return approach, however, is to align more closely the tax treatment of investors who hold non-business (capital account) investments. 6.18 In the domestic context, the capital-revenue boundary results in returns to risk being taxed relatively comprehensively if an investment is held on revenue account, but this is not the case if the investment is held on capital account. As noted earlier, the reason for this is that a domestic investment held on capital account is taxable, in the hands of the investor, only on dividends derived. Given that the average dividend yield on New Zealand equities is around 4%, much of the compensation for risk is in the form of capital gains. A real risk-free rate of 4%, therefore, seems an appropriate approximation of how domestic capital account investments are taxed in the hands of the investor. If the approach was extended to include non-controlled offshore investments held in a business context, the standard return rate for those investments would need to reflect that gains on realisation are taxable in respect of equivalent domestic investments. This would suggest that a more appropriate standard return rate for business investments, in the offshore context, is 6%. 6.19 A standard return rate of 4% also has the advantage of not being out of line with the average dividend yield in countries where the vast majority of New Zealand individual investors’ non-controlled offshore investment is located. For example, average dividend yields for Australian listed companies are between 3 and 4%, while in the United Kingdom, average yields range from 3 to 3.5%. Dividend yields in the United States are typically lower, at around 1.8%, but this can be attributed to a number of factors, including the United States taxing company income and dividends without providing a credit for company tax paid. 25 6.20 A 4% standard return rate should, therefore, ensure that investors generally have enough dividend income to meet their tax liability under a standard return rule. Assuming an investor’s marginal tax rate is 39%, an investment would need to yield a 1.56% dividend for the investor to be able to meet the associated tax liability, under a standard return approach, out of dividends derived (4% x 39% = 1.56%). 26 Treatment of debt Under this option: • as a general rule, the current interest deductibility rules would continue to apply to interest costs on funds used to purchase qualifying assets; and • an anti-avoidance rule would need to be considered to deny interest deductions on borrowed funds if the funds are used to finance investments in a foreign entity investing in New Zealand debt. 6.21 A standard return rule would impute tax on the full value of a taxpayer’s qualifying asset. Expenses incurred in acquiring the asset, such as interest costs on borrowed funds, would be deductible according to normal income tax rules. This would mean that interest on a loan used to purchase a qualifying asset would be fully deductible because the interest would be “payable in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income”. 3 6.22 This approach is different from that suggested by the Tax Review in relation to the application of a RFRM. The Tax Review suggested that a RFRM asset’s opening value should be limited to the net equity component of the asset, with no deduction for interest costs. 6.23 One of the problems of allowing full deductibility of interest costs is the incentive for taxpayers to finance acquisitions of qualifying assets using debt. This is because, under a standard return rule, the imputed rate of return would typically be less than the cost of borrowed funds used to purchase qualifying assets. 6.24 Although this incentive would arise under a standard return rule it is worth noting that the same incentive exists at present for assets producing returns that are not fully taxable. For example, a taxpayer that purchases shares on capital account using borrowed funds would receive a full deduction for interest costs, even though the only component of the return that is taxable is any dividends derived. 6.25 We considered a number of approaches to determine a taxpayer’s net equity in a qualifying asset. Any approach would need to identify which part of a taxpayer’s tax-deductible debt portfolio relates to the qualifying asset. Once this was identified, interest deductions in respect of this debt could be disallowed and the value of the debt subtracted from the opening value of the asset. 6.26 The options that were considered and the problems associated with each are discussed in Appendix 2. We do not consider that any of these options should be adopted as they would add an unacceptable, additional layer of complexity to the rules. 3 Section DD 1(b)(i) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 27 6.27 A relatively low standard return rate could also create opportunities to borrow in New Zealand and invest in offshore entities that invest directly back into New Zealand debt instruments. Here, the investor would receive a deduction for interest costs incurred, typically, at a rate higher than the standard return rate. An anti-avoidance rule may therefore be needed to deny interest deductions to the extent that borrowed funds are used to finance interests in a foreign entity investing in New Zealand debt. Submission point We invite submissions on: • the need for an anti-avoidance rule to deny interest deductions on borrowed funds if the funds are used to finance investments in a foreign entity investing in New Zealand debt, and what form it might take; and • approaches that can limit the application of a standard return rule to the net equity component of a qualifying asset that do not give rise to significant compliance costs. 28 Valuation of assets Under this option, the opening value for: • easy to value assets would be their market value; • hard to value assets for which values can be calculated in an “approved” market would be the value calculated in that market (excluding interests in unlisted foreign companies for which an approved market cannot be verified); and • hard to value assets (excluding interests in foreign companies) for which it is difficult to approximate market values using an “external” market would be a value based on the asset’s cost price. Interests in unlisted foreign companies for which an approved market cannot be verified would be subject to tax under the current FIF rules. 6.28 A standard return rule would calculate taxable income on the opening value of a qualifying asset. Therefore, for the rule to operate, it must be possible to establish an opening value for qualifying assets. Easy to value assets 6.29 In the case of interests in foreign companies and retail unit trusts, market values could generally be used to calculate opening values. Market values are appropriate for interests in foreign companies and unit trusts that are listed on recognised foreign exchanges. 4 Consequently, the opening value of an interest in a foreign company or retail unit trust that is listed on a recognised exchange would be calculated by multiplying the number of shares or units held by the market value per share or unit at the start of the relevant taxable period. Hard to value assets 6.30 Hard to value assets fall into two broad categories. The first category comprises assets that are not listed on a recognised exchange. Nevertheless, their market value can be approximated by reference to an “approved” market, an arm’s-length price or the price an investment vehicle is prepared to pay to purchase the asset from the investor. 6.31 The second category comprises assets for which it will not be appropriate or practical to deem a value by reference to an external market. For these assets a market value will need to be approximated by reference to the asset’s cost. 4 Section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 defines “recognised exchange” for the purposes of a number of provisions in the Income Tax Act. 29 Assets for which values can be calculated in an “approved” market 6.32 In the case of interests in foreign companies which are not listed on a recognised exchange, market values may still be ascertainable. For example, in the case of certain interests in foreign companies the Commissioner of Inland Revenue may be satisfied that, even though the asset is not listed on a recognised exchange, the interest can be valued using a market-type mechanism. It is suggested, therefore, that investors should have the option of approaching the Commissioner to determine whether for such assets a market, for tax purposes, exists. If a market is found to exist, the investor will be able to use an opening value calculated in the market to apply the standard return approach. 6.33 The broad criteria that could be used by the Commissioner to approve a market include: • the number of participants in the market or having access to the market; • the frequency of trading in the market; • the nature of trading in the market – how the price or rate is determined and how the relevant investment assets are traded on the market; • the existence, in relation to the market, of an appropriate regulatory body established by law; • the potential or demonstrated capacity of a person or group of persons to significantly influence the market; and • significant barriers to entry into the market. 6.34 Once a market has been approved by Inland Revenue, in respect of a particular asset, it would be added to a list of approved markets. This list would be made widely available for the benefit of all investors. 6.35 If no market is found to exist, or an investor chooses not to approach the Commissioner, the current FIF rules would apply to those interests. This requirement is based around the need to ensure that, for example, investors with interests in unlisted companies situated in low (or no) tax jurisdictions that have low dividend distribution policies – in other words, “cash box”- type companies – pay tax at a more appropriate rate than 4% under the standard return approach. Given that in these cases no market value can be verified, it is almost certain that the investor would be required to calculate taxable income under the deemed rate of return method in the FIF rules. 30 6.36 An alternative to this may be allowing use of values calculated under an arm’s-length valuation rule. An arm’s-length principle is used under New Zealand’s transfer pricing tax rules. 5 The rationale for the arm’s-length principle is that it is considered to provide the most accurate measurement of the fair market value, and thereby the true economic value, of a transaction. This is because parties transacting at arm’s length would be expected to endeavour to make efficient use of their resources and in doing this, would seek to earn the full return to their economic activities. 6.37 The arm’s length principle uses the behaviour of an independent firm as the benchmark for what would be expected of a firm seeking to earn the true return from a transaction. In the case of interests in foreign companies, this would be what an independent party is willing to offer by way of consideration to acquire the interest and what the party holding the interest would require to be compensated for parting with the interest. Therefore if a taxpayer is able to satisfy the Commissioner that an arm’s-length value can be established in respect of an interest in a foreign company, that value could be used to determine an opening value under a standard return rule. 6.38 The key concern with the use of an arm’s-length valuation rule is that it often requires reference to be made to the tradability of the asset being valued. Consequently, if a sufficiently wide market for the interest does not exist, arm’s-length values may be difficult to determine, at best, and inaccurate, at worst. 6.39 For interests in foreign life insurance and superannuation we have considered the use of surrender values and account values, respectively, to approximate market values in respect of these assets. 6.40 A surrender value is effectively the price the issuer of a life insurance policy is willing to pay to redeem the policy. One of the concerns arising from the use of surrender values to approximate the market value of a policy is that they can incorporate a penalty for surrendering the policy before maturity, or a bonus for holding the policy to term. This can result in the surrender value underestimating significantly a policy’s underlying value. In addition, surrender values may be difficult to obtain as it is unlikely that these values are regularly published or sought by investors. 6.41 We are currently considering whether it would be possible to determine a mechanism whereby it would be possible to use surrender values for certain interests in foreign life insurance. One potential mechanism for determining whether surrender values could be used for a particular interest could be based on those policies that were issued by insurers resident in countries where the regulatory framework for life insurance is likely to yield surrender values that represent reasonably accurately a policy’s underlying value. 5 See “Transfer Pricing Guidelines” in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12 No 10, October 2000 for a complete description of these rules. 31 6.42 Account values (sometimes referred to as accumulated values) represent the aggregate contributions made to a superannuation scheme and the earnings attributable to those contributions. These values may be available for superannuation schemes where the investor’s entitlement is linked directly to contributions made by the investor or on the investor’s behalf (“defined contribution schemes”). 6 6.43 It may be possible to use account values to approximate the value of an investor’s underlying interest in a superannuation scheme – for example, if the account values are published on an investor’s statement. Submission points We invite submissions on: • potential mechanisms for using surrender values for certain interests in foreign life insurance policies; and • whether reliable account values are widely available in respect of defined contribution superannuation schemes. Market value approximated by reference to “cost” 6.44 As noted earlier, for certain interests in foreign superannuation schemes and foreign life insurance, it may be difficult to determine market values by reference to an external market. It is necessary, therefore, to devise a method that can approximate market values for such interests (and any other hard to value assets, excluding interests in foreign companies, which may be non- marketable). 6.45 We suggest that the valuation of these assets be based on the relevant asset’s cost price in the year of acquisition. In subsequent years taxpayers would be required to increase that cost price by the cost of any acquisitions and by a pre-determined percentage to account for investment growth in the previous year. (The mechanics of this are discussed in more detail later on.) 6.46 To be consistent with the treatment of qualifying assets for which a market value is available, the pre-determined percentage by which taxpayers would need to grow the value of this category of assets each year should approximate average investment growth in foreign equity markets. Average investment growth in most years is likely to be greater than the proposed standard return rate of 4%. It is proposed, therefore, that a rate of 10% be used to proxy for investment growth of interests in foreign superannuation schemes and life insurance policies and other hard to value assets in this category. 6 These values will not generally be available for superannuation schemes where an investor’s entitlement is not linked to the investor’s contributions (“defined benefit schemes”). 32 6.47 The 10% rate reflects broadly the long run average Morgan-Stanley Capital International (MSCI) index gross rate of return. The MSCI tracks the performance of a number of the world’s largest companies (which foreign superannuation schemes and life insurance policies are likely to invest into to derive capital growth) and represents a gross return (a return inclusive of dividends) on equity. 6.48 The following example illustrates how this would work in a simple case: In the 2005-06 income year Bob purchases a non-marketable asset for NZD$45,000. The opening value, when applying the standard return rule in the 2005-06 income year, will be the acquisition cost of NZD$45,000. If Bob retains this interest in the following year, the opening value for the 2006-07 year will be NZD$49,500. That is, the acquisition cost of NZD$45,000 would be increased by 10% to account for investment growth in 2005-06. Submission point We invite submissions on the valuation rule, based on an asset’s cost, suggested for interests in foreign superannuation schemes and life insurance policies, and on the potential for use of surrender and account values (if any). 33 Part-year adjustments Under this option, qualifying assets held for part of an income year would be subject to a standard return rule. 6.49 For assets held for an entire income year, taxable income under a standard return rule would be calculated by multiplying the opening value of the qualifying asset by a standard return rate of 4%. 6.50 If a person holds an asset for only some of the year, however, the tax liability should reflect the asset’s holding period. If it did not, there would be both undertaxation and overtaxation in certain circumstances. The example below illustrates how a standard return rule that did not recognise part-year adjustments would undertax a person who purchases a qualifying asset part- way through the year. Bill has no qualifying assets at the start of the 2005-06 income year (on 1 April 2005). However, he buys NZD$40,000 of shares in a foreign company on 31 June 2005. If a standard return rule did not take into account assets purchased part-way through a year, Bill would have a zero tax liability for the 2005-06 income year. 6.51 Similarly, a standard return rule that did not recognise part-year adjustments would overtax if qualifying assets were held at the beginning of the income year and sold during the year. The following example illustrates this: Jane has a qualifying asset with an opening value of NZD$5,000 at the start of the 2005-06 income year (on 1 April 2005). However, on 1 July 2005, she sells the entire asset. If a standard return rule did not take into account the fact that Jane sold her investment three months into the year, she would face a tax liability based on holding the asset for 12 months. 6.52 We propose, therefore, to recognise acquisitions and realisations of qualifying assets that occur during an income year. We have identified two methods for recognising part-year adjustments in the standard return calculation. 34 New part-years for acquisitions and realisations of qualifying assets Under this option: • Each acquisition and realisation of a qualifying asset during an income year would result in a new part-year (with the old part-year ending on the date of the acquisition or realisation). • Acquisitions and realisations during a year would be valued at the per-unit value of the qualifying asset at the start of the relevant income year. • The standard return rate would be adjusted to reflect the portion of the income year that is equal to the length of each part-year. • For qualifying assets when a market value is used as the opening value, the asset would be revalued at the start of each income year. • For qualifying assets when the opening value is based on cost, the value for subsequent income years would be based on cost adjusted for acquisitions and realisations of the asset, distributions and deemed investment growth. • For interests in foreign superannuation schemes and life insurance policies, if an investor makes regular and equal contributions, the opening value of these interests would be calculated using a simplified formula. • Bonus issues of shares or units provided for nil consideration would not give rise to a new part-year. However, a new per-unit value would need to be established for subsequent part-years. • Bonus issues of shares or units when the investor provides consideration would give rise to a new part-year as the additional shares would increase investor wealth – they would constitute a purchase of a qualifying asset. 6.53 Under this approach, whenever an acquisition or a realisation occurred, a new part-year would begin. The standard return rule would apply to each new part-year. Each new part-year would last until the next transaction. Therefore, under this approach, a new opening value would need to be calculated for each part-year, with the standard return rate adjusted for the length of each part-year. This is our preferred approach for dealing with purchases and sales of qualifying assets during an income year, as it would not require taxpayers to track market values of affected assets during the year – an issue that arises under the alternative method that we considered for dealing with part-year adjustments (discussed later). 6.54 The key issue when determining opening values for new part-years is how best to value acquisitions and realisations of qualifying assets falling in those part-years. The most accurate valuation method for acquisitions and realisations of qualifying assets would be to use the market price of the acquisitions and realisations. Under this approach, the value of an acquisition during a year, whether the acquisition is a new asset or an addition to an existing asset, would be the per-unit cost of the asset at the time of purchase 35 multiplied by the number of units purchased. Similarly, realisations would be valued at the sale price on the day. This is illustrated as follows: John purchases 50 shares in a foreign company at a price of NZD$100 per share at the start of the 2005-06 income year. The value of John’s acquisition for the purposes of the standard return rule would be NZD$5,000. Later in the year John sells 25 of the shares, at a price of NZD$120 per share. The value of the realisation for the purposes of the standard return rule would be NZD$3,000. 6.55 In the case of realisations, however, instances may arise when a qualifying asset has significantly increased in value during the year and, upon realisation, is worth considerably more than at the start of the year. In such a case, if only part of the asset is realised but the value of the sale exceeds the value of the asset at the start of the year, no tax liability would arise for the new part-year (in which the realisation falls) under a standard return rule. Taxpayers would, therefore, escape tax on the remainder of their qualifying assets for the remainder of the income year. This is illustrated as follows: In the previous example, assume the price per unit of John’s 50 shares in the foreign company, acquired at a cost of NZD$100 per share, were to double during the year to NZD$200. If John were to sell half of his holding of the asset, then, at a price per share of NZD$200, the value of his realisation would be NZD$5,000, enough to offset his entire acquisition cost. This would be the case even though John still held 25 shares. 6.56 Consequently, when valuing a realisation, we suggest that taxpayers have regard to the proportion of the asset that is sold rather than the sale price per unit. Under this rule, the opening value for a new part-year would be the proportion of the asset that remains following the realisation multiplied by the opening value calculated for the most recently ending full income year (in the case of no prior part-year adjustments) or most recently ending part- year. The following simple example illustrates this: Tracey holds 500 units valued at NZD$10 each on the first day of the 2005-06 income year. She sells 250 of the units for NZD$20 each six months into the income year. The aggregate value of the asset for the new part-year is 50% of the value at the beginning of the income year – NZD$2,500 (NZD$5,000 x 50%) – not zero (NZD$5,000 less 20 x NZD$250). 6.57 By valuing realisations as a proportion of the qualifying asset that is sold, this rule would ensure that the ultimate tax liability reflects the appropriate percentage of the asset that is held during a year and the duration of that holding. 6.58 Another way of achieving the same result is to value realisations of qualifying assets during the year at the per-unit value of the asset at the start of the relevant income year, if held at the start of that year, or at the cost price per-unit if the asset is first acquired during that year. In the latter case, the first part-year would be deemed to have begun on the date of acquisition. 36 To be consistent with the valuation of realisations during the year, purchases of qualifying assets during a year would, under this approach, also be valued in the same manner – either at the per-unit value of the asset at the start of the year or at the cost price per unit if the asset is newly acquired. This is the preferred approach as it addresses the problems arising from both valuing realisations at the sale price and valuing sales as a proportion of the value at the start of the year, or a part-year. Calculating the tax liability under a standard return rule with part-year adjustments for assets for which reliable market values can be ascribed 6.59 The method proposed to calculate an investor’s tax liability under a standard return rule can appear complex. Much of the perceived complexity can be removed if a four-step methodology is used for determining the tax liability. These steps for interests in foreign companies and unit trusts that are listed on recognised foreign exchanges and certain hard-to-value assets for which market values are able to be determined in an approved market are discussed here. Step one: establishing the value of a qualifying asset at the start of the year 6.60 For assets that are held in one income year and rolled over to the next year, the opening value of the asset would be its market value. The opening value would be calculated by multiplying the price of each unit that is quoted in the relevant market on the first day of the income year by the number of units held on that day. Step two: establishing an opening value for the relevant part-year 6.61 As noted earlier, an acquisition or realisation of a qualifying asset during a year would result in the creation of a new part-year. The opening value for a new part-year would be the opening value calculated for the most recently ending part-year, using this methodology (or if the acquisition or realisation is the first transaction of the year, the value of the asset at the start of the year) plus the acquisition or less the realisation in the new part-year. As discussed, both acquisitions and realisations would be valued at the per-unit price of the asset at the start of the income year, or if the asset being adjusted was first acquired during the income year, the cost price per-unit of that initial acquisition. Step three: apportioning the standard return rate to reflect the length of each part- year 6.62 To avoid overtaxation it would be necessary to adjust the 4% standard return rate applied to the opening value calculated for the relevant part-year, to reflect the length of that part-year. Therefore the appropriate standard return rate for part-years would be calculated by multiplying the 4% standard return rate by the proportion of the income year that the part-year represents. For example, if the part-year represents six months, the standard return rate would be adjusted as follows: 37 6 (months) x 4% = 2% 12 (months) Step four: determining the taxable income for the year 6.63 Once the opening value and adjusted standard return rate for each part-year has been determined, the taxable income for each part-year would be calculated simply by multiplying the opening value by the rate. To determine the taxable income for the entire year, the taxable incomes for each part-year would be aggregated. 6.64 An example of how this method would work is provided in Appendix 3. Calculating the tax liability under a standard return rule with part-year adjustments for assets for which market values must be approximated (non-marketable assets) 6.65 Taxable income for these assets would also be calculated by splitting each income year into different part-years, with a new part-year for each acquisition and realisation. The standard return rate, adjusted for the length of the relevant part-year, would then be applied to the opening value of the asset in each part-year. 6.66 The only difference between the method that would be used for these assets and that applying to assets where market values are available would be the need to approximate a market value for the asset at the start of the next year, or any new income year. Calculating an opening value for the next income year for non-marketable assets 6.67 It would be necessary to calculate an opening value for non-marketable assets for a subsequent year with reference to part-year adjustments in the previous year. In this way, provided that distributions and investment growth were also accounted for, it would be possible to provide an approximation of an asset’s opening value in the following income year. 6.68 Under this method, the opening value for the next income year would be calculated by taking the opening value calculated for the most recently ended part-year and reducing this amount by the value of distributions, such as any dividends derived in the previous year. This figure would then be increased by an amount that would approximate the asset’s investment growth in the previous year. 6.69 The need to reduce the opening value for the most recently ended part-year by any distributions, such as dividends derived, in the previous year is a reflection that if genuine market values were available, the distribution would generally be accounted for in a lower market value of the asset at the start of the succeeding income year. 38 6.70 The need to increase the opening value for the most recently ended part-year by an investment growth component is to ensure that the tax value of the investment approximates the actual investment growth that would, on average, occur across investments of the type in question. The easiest and most accurate way to do this would be to use the taxable income calculated for past years under the standard return approach to calculate investment growth. This is because aggregate taxable income for a year would represent approximately 4% of the asset’s actual opening value in that year (the value taking into account part-year adjustments). Consequently, to calculate investment growth at 10%, it would simply be a matter of dividing taxable income by 4 and multiplying the result by 10. 6.71 The following example illustrates the calculation that would need to be undertaken: In the most recently ended part-year of the 2005-06 income year, Tom had an opening value of NZD$9,500 for his non-marketable asset. When calculating his opening value for the 2006-07 income year, Tom will need to adjust this value for dividends paid out in 2005-06 and for investment growth. If a dividend of NZD$380 was paid out in the 2005-06 income year, the opening value for the most recently ending part-year of that year would be reduced to NZD$9,120 (NZD$9,500 - NZD$380). In terms of investment growth, this would simply be the taxable income for the 2005-06 year under the standard return approach – NZD$380 (assume NZD$9,500 x 4%) – divided by 4 and multiplied by 10 – NZD$950. Consequently, the opening value in the 2006-07 income year would be NZD$9,120 plus investment growth of NZD$950 – NZD$10,070. Treatment of dividends 6.72 Dividends would not be treated as a part-year adjustment in the year they are derived. Although, a dividend is a distribution from a company and will therefore affect the value of a taxpayer’s qualifying asset (in much the same way as a purchase or an acquisition), taking dividends into account will result in a number of taxpayers who would otherwise not be required to make part-year adjustments because they do not undertake transactions during a year being required to do so. We consider the compliance costs that would be imposed from accounting for dividends as a part-year adjustment would be disproportionate to the increased accuracy of the standard return income calculation. 6.73 The effect of dividends derived would, nevertheless, be accounted for in the valuation of the asset in the following income year, either automatically (in the case of assets for which reliable market values can be ascertained) or in the opening value calculation (in the case of assets for which market values must be approximated). 39 Treatment of bonus issues for nil consideration 6.74 There may be instances, for example, when a foreign company makes an issue of bonus shares to its shareholders for no consideration. Such a bonus issue of shares would result in investors holding more shares with no increase in wealth because the share price would be expected to be diluted to reflect no change to the company’s available subscribed capital. Consequently, a bonus issue of shares or units for nil consideration should not trigger a part-year adjustment under a standard return approach as it would not result in a change in the economic value of an investor’s underlying investment. 6.75 Under the approach proposed for calculating tax under the standard return approach, however, both the price of an asset and the number of units held as at a particular date are important. This is because changes in the number of units during a year (as a result of sales and acquisitions) will need to be valued at the per-unit price of the asset at the start of a year under the proposed method. This standardisation of price per unit for transactions means that the change in the number of units as a result of the bonus issue of shares will affect the value of the asset on which a standard return rule applies. 6.76 The problem in relation to bonus issues of shares and units for nil consideration is that while the number of “units” of the qualifying asset will have changed, so too (generally) will the price per “unit”, such that there is no overall change in the value of the asset. However, because transactions must be valued at the per-unit price of the asset at the start of the year, if no correction is made any sale or purchase of units after the bonus issue will result in an overvaluation of the sale or purchase price. The example below illustrates this. Alastair holds 40 shares in a foreign company at the start of the 2005- 06 income year at a price of NZD$5.00 per share. Six months into the year, Alastair receives a bonus issue of 40 shares for which he provides no consideration, increasing the number of shares he holds to 80. The price per share, however, falls to NZD$2.50, such that the value of his holding remains unchanged at NZD$200. After the issue, Alastair sells 40 shares. Under the proposed approach, with no adjustment to per-unit price to reflect the bonus issue, the sale of 40 shares would be valued at the price per share at the start of the year – NZD$5.00. Consequently, the value of the sale would be NZD$200, which is sufficient to offset his initial opening value. This would occur even though Alastair has only effectively sold half of his holding. The value of the sale should be NZD$100 (40 x NZD$2.50) and Alastair should be subject to tax on the 40 remaining shares held, at a price of NZD$2.50 per share. 40 6.77 The proposed solution is to recognise any transactions after a bonus issue of “units” for nil consideration at a new per-unit value. The new per-unit price would be calculated by keeping the value of the holding after the non-taxable bonus issue constant with that before the issue and dividing by the number of “units” held after the issue. So, in the preceding example, the value of the holding before the non-taxable bonus issue was NZD$200 (40 x NZD$5.00). The value of the holding after the non-taxable bonus issue is also NZD$200 but the number of “units” has doubled (to 80). Consequently, the new per- unit price will be NZD$2.50 (NZD$200 / 80 units) for valuing subsequent part-year adjustments. 6.78 Appendix 4 provides a more detailed example of how bonus issues of “units” for nil consideration could be dealt with under the suggested method for recognising part-year adjustments. Treatment of bonus issues that increase investor wealth 6.79 A bonus issue could also arise, for example, when a foreign company or foreign unit trust operates a dividend re-investment policy. That is, instead of the dividend being explicitly paid out, it is re-invested in the entity, thereby increasing the investor’s interest in the company or unit trust. Such a bonus issue will therefore result in an increase in the number of “units” held by an investor but, unlike a bonus issue for nil consideration, with an accompanying increase in the investor’s wealth – the company’s available subscribed capital. Consequently, a bonus issue of units which increases an investor’s wealth will trigger a part-year adjustment as this is equivalent to a purchase of additional units during the year, as illustrated in the example below: At the start of the 2005-06 income year, Megan has 15,000 units in a foreign unit trust (at a price of NZD$1.50 per unit) which operates a dividend re-investment policy. On 1 October, she derives a dividend of NZD$800 which is re-invested, resulting in a 500 unit increase in her holding (assume the price per unit has increased to NZD$1.60 per unit at the time the new units are created). Megan would need to treat the re-investment and subsequent increase in her holding as a new acquisition for the purposes of applying a standard return rule. The re-investment would be valued at NZD$750 (500 units x value at start of year: NZD$1.50 per unit) for standard return purposes. Consequently, Megan’s taxable income would be NZD$450 for the first part-year (NZD$22,500 x 2%) and NZD$465 for the second part- year (NZD$23,250 x 2%). Calculating taxable income for interests in foreign superannuation and life insurance – a simplified method 6.80 Investors with interests in foreign superannuation schemes and foreign life insurance policies are likely to make regular and equal contributions and premium payments, respectively, to these schemes and policies. To apply a standard return rule strictly accurately to these interests, it would be 41 necessary to treat each contribution and premium payment as giving rise to a new part-year. This would clearly create compliance costs for investors 6.81 We therefore consider that the following simplified formula should be used to calculate an opening value based on contributions made and premiums paid in a year: Contribution or premium payment x No of contributions or payments in year 2 Note: the simplified formula would be applicable to interests in foreign superannuation schemes and life insurance policies only when the investor makes regular and equal contributions and premium payments. 6.82 The following example illustrates how this simplified formula would apply in the first year an investor starts contributing to a superannuation scheme. Peter starts investing in a foreign superannuation scheme in the 2005- 06 income year, making regular contributions of NZD$200 each month towards the policy. Peter’s opening value for the 2005-06 income year would be NZD$1,200, based on the simplified formula ((NZD$200 x 12)/2). The simplified formula is available to Peter because he has made regular and equal contributions. 6.83 When the simplified formula is used a separate method will be necessary to determine the opening value of the investment in the second and subsequent income years. 6.84 In the second income year the opening value of the investment would be the aggregate contributions in the preceding year (the first income year), minus distributions in the previous year, plus an amount to account for investment growth in the preceding income year. Investment growth would be the opening value in year one, as calculated under the simplified formula, multiplied by the investment growth percentage. The following example, that builds on the preceding one, illustrates this: In the 2006-07 income year Peter continues to make regular and equal contributions to the scheme. The opening value of Peter’s policy in the 2006-07 income year will be the value of his contributions in that income year, calculated under the simplified formula –NZD$1,200 – plus the aggregate value of contributions in the 2005-06 income year –NZD$2,400 – plus the investment growth between years –NZD$120 (NZD$1,200 x 10%). Consequently the opening value in the 2006-07 income year would be NZD$3,720. (In this example there are zero distributions in the 2005-06 income year.) 42 6.85 Similarly, in the third income year, the opening value would be aggregate contributions in the first and second income year (minus any distributions in those years) plus investment growth in those years, plus the value of contributions in the third year (calculated under the simplified formula). 6.86 The formula for calculating the opening value on which the standard return rule would apply is: Opening value in current year \[Value of contributions in current year (calculated under the simplified formula)\] + \[Value of contributions in previous years, if any\] – \[Distributions in previous years, if any\] + \[Investment growth in previous years\] 6.87 The formula for calculating investment growth in previous years is: Year One (for calculating OV in Year Two) Opening value in Year One x investment growth percentage of 10% where Opening Value in Year One = \[Value of contributions in year one (calculated under the simplified formula)\] Year Two (for calculating OV in Year Three) Opening value in Year Two x investment growth percentage of 10% where Opening Value in Year Two = \[Value of contributions in year two (calculated under the simplified formula) + aggregate value of contributions in year one – any distributions in year one + investment growth in year one\] Year Three (for calculating OV in Year Four) Opening value in Year Three x investment growth percentage of 10% where Opening Value in Year Three = \[Value of contributions in year three (calculated under the simplified formula) + aggregate value of contributions in years one and two – any distributions in years one and two + investment growth in years one and two : : : 43 Year Y (for calculating OV in Year Z) Opening value in Year Y x investment growth percentage of 10% where Opening Value in Year Y = \[Value of contributions in year Y (calculated under the simplified formula) + aggregate value of contributions in years 1...X – any distributions in years 1...X + investment growth in years 1...X\] 6.88 The following example illustrates the use of the formula in determining an opening value for Peter’s interest in the foreign superannuation scheme in income years three and four: In the 2007-08 income year, Peter continues to make regular and equal contributions to the foreign superannuation scheme. The opening value of his policy in that income year will be: (a) The value of contributions in the 2007-08 income year under the simplified formula: \[NZD$2,400 / 2\]; plus (b) Contributions made to the scheme in the 2005-06: \[NZD$2,400\] and 2006-07 income years: \[NZD$2,400\]; plus (c) Investment growth in the 2005-06: \[(NZD$1,200 x 10%) = NZD$120\] and 2006-07: \[((NZD$1,200 + NZD$2,400 + NZD$120) x 10%) = NZD$372\] income years NZD$1,200 + NZD$4,800 + NZD$492 = NZD$6,492 In the 2008-09 income year, the opening value of Peter’s policy will be: (a) The value of contributions in the 2008-09 income year under the simplified formula: \[NZD$2,400 / 2\]; plus (b) Contributions made to the scheme in income years 2005-06: \[NZD$2,400\], 2006-07: \[NZD$2,400\] and 2007-08: \[NZD$2,400\]; plus (c) Investment growth in the 2005-06: \[NZD$120\], 2006-07: \[NZD$372\] and 2007-08: \[((NZD$1,200 + NZD$2,400 + NZD$2,400 + NZD$120 + NZD$372) x 10%) = NZD$649\] income years NZD$1,200 + NZD$7,200 + NZD$1,141 = NZD$9,541 (Assume zero distributions in the 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08 income years.) 6.89 The calculation of opening values using this formula will result in some overtaxation in income years in which distributions have been derived, as these distributions will not be accounted for in the opening value calculation. This is similar to the treatment of dividends derived in respect of interests in foreign companies (for which reliable market values can be ascribed). The value of any distributions would, however, be subtracted from the opening value in the following year. This will result in a lower tax liability in that 44 subsequent year. The calculation of opening values using this formula will also mean that the calculation of investment growth will result in some overtaxation in income years in which distributions have been derived. 6.90 As noted earlier, one way to address this relatively minor overtaxation would be to require a part-year adjustment to be carried out in respect of each contribution to and distribution from a foreign superannuation scheme or foreign life insurance policy when calculating investment growth. This may, however, add a level of complexity that is disproportionate to any improvements to the accurate calculation of income. Submission point We invite submissions on whether it would be feasible for part-year adjustments to be carried out in respect of contributions and distributions when calculating investment growth for interests in foreign superannuation schemes and foreign life insurance policies. 45 Opening value calculated as the average of values over a 12-month period 6.91 We have also considered the approach of taxing the average value of an investor’s holding of a qualifying asset, over a 12-month period (comprising the yearly income under a standard return rule) as a way of dealing with part- year adjustments. The average value of the asset over the 12-month period would be calculated having regard to the value of the asset at the start of each month in that period. 6.92 This method avoids explicitly taking into account acquisitions and realisations of qualifying assets in the standard return calculation. Instead, these part-year adjustments would simply be reflected in the value of the asset holding at the start of a month in the form of a higher or lower value. The following example illustrates how this method would work in practice. Helen holds 100 shares in a foreign company at a price of NZD$1 per share. At the start of the 2005-06 income year, the value of her asset is NZD$100. The value of her shares at the start of each month in the 2005-06 year is shown in the table below: Mth Price per share at start of month Mth Price per share at start of month 1 NZD$1.00 7 NZD$1.23 2 NZD$1.05 8 NZD$1.19 3 NZD$1.12 9 NZD$1.07 4 NZD$1.18 10 NZD$1.01 5 NZD$1.20 11 NZD$0.98 6 NZD$1.25 12 NZD$0.95 Six months into the 2005-06 year she purchases another ten shares and two months before the end of the income year, sells 60 shares. 46 Under the 12-month average approach, Helen’s opening value for the income year will be the average of the values of her qualifying asset at the start of each month in the year: Mth Value of holding at start of month Mth Value of holding at start of month 1 NZD$100 (100 units held x NZD$1.00) 7 NZD$135.30 2 NZD$105 8 NZD$130.90 3 NZD$112 9 NZD$117.70 4 NZD$118 10 NZD$111.10 5 NZD$120 11 NZD$49 (sale of 60 units: 50 units held x NZD$0.98) 6 NZD$137.50 (purchase of 10 units: 110 units held x NZD$1.25) 12 NZD$47.50 The 12-month average value would be NZD$107. Consequently, the standard return rate of 4% would apply on NZD$107. 6.93 This method has the significant disadvantage, however, of requiring taxpayers to value their asset at the start of each month in an income year. This may result in significant costs for those taxpayers who do not undertake sales and purchases of the asset during the year and therefore do not regularly track asset values (such as share prices). For this reason we do not support using this approach. 47 Monthly or daily asset holding period Under this option, investors would have a choice of determining the length of a part- year by reference to the number of days or months that a qualifying asset is held during the part-year. 6.94 Bringing to account part-year changes to qualifying assets raises the issue of how the holding period for these assets should be calculated. The holding period is used to adjust the standard return rate to reflect the length of a part- year. One option is calculating the holding period on the basis of the number of days the asset was held. Another option is calculating the holding period on the basis of the number of months the asset was held. 6.95 The two approaches have different advantages and disadvantages. A monthly holding period would, in certain cases, be simpler to use as investors would not be required to track the exact date of acquisitions and realisations. On the other hand, a daily holding period would result in a more accurate calculation of taxable income, thereby reducing potential opportunities for overtaxation. This is because, under a monthly approach, a part of a month during which a qualifying asset is held would be deemed an entire month. This is necessary in order to prevent investors reducing their tax liability by reducing the qualifying assets held at the start of a month. 6.96 Although it would be possible to develop rules to increase the accuracy of an approach where the asset holding period is denoted in months, this would add a layer of complexity to the standard return rule. 7 Equally, while a days approach would be more accurate, it may not be suitable where investors do not transact often and cannot recall the exact date changes to holdings of qualifying assets were made. Consequently, it is considered that a choice of how the asset holding period is defined, whether in months or days, should be available to taxpayers. In this way it is expected that taxpayers will be able to choose the method which best suits their requirements. 7 For example, a possible rule would be to deem a qualifying asset, purchased after the middle of a month and sold before the middle of the subsequent month, to be held for only one month (as opposed to two). Such a rule would, however, be arbitrary as there is still scope to argue that the asset is in fact held for less than a month – for example, if purchased in the last week of a month and sold in the first week of the subsequent month. Any further rules to increase accuracy would ultimately result in a something akin to a days approach. 48 Conversion of income into New Zealand dollars Under this option, investors would calculate taxable income for qualifying assets in the relevant foreign currency and convert this to New Zealand dollars at the average of the close of trading spot exchange rate for the 15th of each month falling within a taxpayer’s income year. 6.97 Under the FIF rules, FIF income or losses must be calculated in the currency in which the FIF interest is held. It is converted to New Zealand dollars at the average of the close of trading spot exchange rate for the 15th of each complete month falling within a FIF’s accounting period (if the accounting profits method is used) or the investor’s income year (if the comparative value or deemed rate of return income calculation methods are used). 8 Inland Revenue publishes exchange rates which apply on the 15th day of each month (including a cumulative average for the previous 12 months) for a number of countries. Taxpayers can also use an average rate from one of New Zealand’s major trading banks if, for example, Inland Revenue does not publish an exchange rate for a particular currency. 6.98 We consider that under a standard return rule, taxpayers should continue to calculate income from qualifying assets in the relevant foreign currency and convert this to New Zealand dollars at the average of the close of trading spot exchange rate for the 15th of each month falling within a taxpayer’s income year. 6.99 The main reason for maintaining an average exchange rate is to reduce the risk of an investor’s tax liability being affected by short-term exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, for most affected investors the relevant exchange rate information is already published by Inland Revenue and readily available, making it a relatively low-cost way of complying with the foreign currency conversion requirements. 8 Section CG 16(11) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 49 Treatment of credits for non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) Under this option, subject to certain restrictions, a credit would be allowed for foreign non-resident withholding tax deducted from any foreign dividends derived, to offset tax payable under a standard return rule. 6.100 As discussed earlier, a standard return rule would tax an asset at a rate that approximates a reasonable dividend yield. In other words, the rule would tax an assumed rather than an actual gain, with the result that actual gains such as dividends would not be subject to tax. 6.101 Under our double tax agreements, New Zealand is obliged to allow a credit for foreign non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) withheld on dividends derived from companies resident in partner countries. The taxpayer can use the credit to offset New Zealand tax payable on the dividend income. This treatment is confirmed in our domestic law by section LC 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. 6.102 The wording of our double tax agreement articles that provide for the credit 9 and section LC 1 suggest that the credit is only available if it offsets New Zealand tax payable on the particular form of income derived (in this case the dividend). Therefore, given that the dividend would not be subject to New Zealand tax under a standard return rule, there is an argument that the investor should receive no credit for the foreign NRWT paid. 6.103 This result does not appear to be appropriate. The policy underlying the tax credit rules in our double tax agreements and domestic law is to prevent income being subject to two layers of tax, one layer applying in the country of source and the other applying in the country of residence. 6.104 Under a standard return rule, the deemed income will usually be different from actual dividends derived. In cases where the actual dividend is greater than the standard return income and the dividend includes credits for foreign NRWT deducted, the issue arises as to what proportion of the credits should be allowed against tax on standard return income. 6.105 If an amount less than the actual dividend derived is taxable, the credit allowed should be in proportion to the income that is taxed in New Zealand under the standard return rule – the lesser amount. For example, if foreign NRWT is withheld at, say, 15% on a dividend, the amount of the NRWT that is creditable would be 15% of the income calculated under the standard return approach. An example illustrates this: 9 See, for example, Article 24 of the New Zealand / United States of America DTA. 50 Mary (whose personal tax rate is 33%) has a qualifying asset of value NZD$100,000 at the start of the 2005-06 income year. Her imputed income for the year under the standard return rule would be NZD$4,000 (NZD$100,000 x 4%). In the same year, Mary receives a dividend of NZD$5,000 with foreign NRWT deducted at 15% – a net dividend of NZD$4,250 and foreign NRWT of NZD$750. NZD$600 (NZD$4,000 x 15%) of the foreign NRWT would be creditable against tax payable under the standard return – NZD$1,320 (NZD$4,000 x 33%). The total New Zealand tax payable by Mary on the qualifying asset would, therefore, be NZD$720 (NZD$1,320 less NZD$600). The excess credits (NZD$750 less NZD$600), which relate to non-taxable receipts, could not be offset against other income or carried forward. 51 Trans-Tasman recognition of imputation credits Under this option, subject to certain restrictions, imputation credits for New Zealand tax paid that are attached to dividends received from an Australian company could be offset against tax payable under a standard return rule. 6.106 Australia and New Zealand have recently reformed their imputation laws to reduce a longstanding problem of the double taxation of certain trans- Tasman investments. From the perspective of a New Zealand shareholder of an Australian company, double taxation can occur if the Australian company derives income from New Zealand. The income is taxed in New Zealand but, before the introduction of the new rules, no portion of the New Zealand tax paid could be credited to the New Zealand shareholders. 6.107 The new rules aim to reduce this problem by allowing Australian and New Zealand shareholders of trans-Tasman companies that choose to access the other country’s imputation rules to be allocated imputation credits representing New Zealand tax paid and franking credits representing Australian tax paid, in proportion to their ownership interests. However, each country’s credits can be claimed only by its residents. 6.108 Under a standard return rule, actual dividends derived by New Zealand shareholders of Australian companies would not be subject to tax. Therefore there would be no taxable dividends against which any imputation credits representing New Zealand tax paid could be offset. 6.109 Although the actual dividend flow would not be taxed under a standard return rule the dividend will, in substance, already be taxed by attributing a reasonable standard dividend yield of 4%. It would, therefore, be appropriate to allow investors to offset their tax liability under a standard return rule, with imputation credits representing New Zealand tax paid. 6.110 Under a standard return rule, the deemed return will usually be different from the actual dividend derived. When the actual dividend is greater than the standard return income and the dividend has imputation credits (representing New Zealand tax paid) attached, the question arises as to what proportion of the imputation credits should be allowed as a credit against tax on standard return income. 6.111 A key principle underlying dividend imputation is that dividends can be imputed only up to a maximum of the company tax rate. This means that the ratio of imputation credits to dividends cannot exceed 33:67. (In other words, imputation credits cannot exceed 33/67 of the cash dividend paid.) 52 6.112 It follows, therefore, that if an amount less than the actual dividend derived is taxable, the maximum imputation ratio should be applied to that lesser amount. Therefore imputation credits attached under the trans-Tasman imputation rules would be creditable to the extent they do not exceed the 33:67 ratio when applied to income calculated under a standard return rule. It should be noted, however, that a situation when the imputation credits exceed the 33:67 ratio, as applied to standard return income, is unlikely to arise often. However, the following example is provided for illustrative purposes: Paul (whose personal tax rate is 33%) has an investment of NZD$25,000 in an Australian company. His taxable income under a standard return rule would be NZD$1,000 (NZD$25,000 x 4%). Paul receives a net dividend of NZD$1,250 from the Australian company with NZD$536 of imputation credits for New Zealand tax paid by the company attached (the amount of the credit is based on the maximum Australian imputation ratio of 30:70 = 30/70 x NZD$1,250). Under the proposed approach, the maximum imputation ratio of 33/67 would be applied to standard return income of NZD$1,000 to calculate the maximum imputation credit allowed – approximately NZD$492 (33/67 x NZD$1,000). Paul would have no tax liability under the standard return approach once the credits allowed have been offset against tax payable ((NZD$1,000 + NZD$492) x 33% less NZD$492). The credits that relate to receipts that are not taxable (NZD$536 less NZD$492) could not be offset against other income or be carried forward. 53 Treatment of companies under a standard return rule Application of the dividend withholding payment rules 6.113 The main group of investors that would hold investments subject to the standard return rule would be individuals. However, the standard return approach would also apply to New Zealand resident companies that hold non-controlled interests in foreign companies and the interests would, if sold, not comprise part of the company’s business income. 6.114 Generally foreign dividends derived by New Zealand companies are deemed to be exempt income, under section CB 10 of the Income Tax Act 1994. However, foreign dividends derived from interests in foreign companies which are subject to tax under the comparative value or deemed rate of return method in the FIF rules are deemed not to constitute a dividend by section CG 16(6). The reason for this is to prevent double taxation, as foreign dividends are effectively taxed under these FIF income calculation methods. 6.115 The effect of deeming these distributions not to constitute a dividend is that the distributions are not treated as exempt dividends under section CB 10. This is important because foreign dividends derived by New Zealand companies, that are exempt under section CB 10, are subject to the dividend withholding payment (DWP) rules. 10 Under the DWP rules, a withholding payment at the rate of 33% of the dividend must be deducted. If a New Zealand company elects to operate a dividend withholding payment account (DWPA), the DWP paid is credited to this account and can be attached as credits to dividends paid to its shareholders. 11 DWP credits are similar in nature to imputation credits. The key difference, however, is that DWP credits in excess of a tax liability are refundable to the shareholder. 6.116 It is proposed that dividends derived from qualifying assets subject to the standard return rule would not be subject to DWP. This is the same approach as that adopted in the comparative value and deemed rate of return methods under the FIF rules. That is, the standard rate of return should encompass the portion of the return to a qualifying asset that comprises dividends. Therefore, double taxation can be avoided under a standard return rule by adopting the section CG 16(6) approach and deeming a foreign dividend not to constitute a dividend, thereby removing such distributions from the ambit of the DWP rules. 10 Section NH 1 of the Income Tax Act. 11 If the company does not operate a DWPA, then the DWP paid is credited to the company’s imputation credit account. 54 Treatment of underlying foreign taxes 6.117 Currently, in certain circumstances a New Zealand resident company may be allowed an underlying foreign tax credit (UFTC) to offset DWP liabilities arising from dividends derived from the foreign company. The UFTC is available for all controlled interests in foreign companies of 10% or greater. It is also available for non-controlled interests in foreign companies of 10% or greater, if the interest is a grey list investment or is subject to the FIF rules and the investor applies the branch equivalent income calculation method. The UFTC represents the underlying tax paid by the foreign company in the foreign jurisdiction. 6.118 Under a standard return rule, UFTCs would not be allowed. This is because, as noted earlier, no DWP liability will arise in respect of dividends derived from qualifying assets under a standard return rule. 12 12 However, as noted earlier, the current rules would apply for investors using the branch equivalent method. 55 Entry and exit from a standard return rule Under this option, as a general rule, qualifying assets would enter and exit the standard return rule at market value. However, for assets where ascertaining a market value is not practical or appropriate, and therefore must be approximated, we suggest entry and exit rules as follows: • Assets entering the standard return rule from other rules in the Income Tax Act would enter at their tax-book value. • Qualifying assets such as interests in foreign superannuation schemes and foreign life insurance policies that newly enter the standard return rule and for which no tax-book value exists would enter at the aggregate value of the contributions (and premium payments) made. • Assets exiting the standard return rule would exit at their tax-book value, calculated for standard return purposes. 6.119 Rules to cater for the various situations where an asset becomes subject, or stops being subject, to the standard return rule will be necessary. These situations can occur as a result of changes in the tax status of the asset, the taxpayer, or the entity into which the investment is made. The main function of such entry and exit rules would be to assign a value to the asset when it moves in and out of the rule. Ascribing appropriate values for such assets would enable the standard return rule, and other tax rules to which the asset may become subject, to function properly. 6.120 As with the current FIF rules, it is considered that entry and exit from a standard return rule should, where possible, occur at market value. Entry and exit of assets for which market values are not ascertainable and must therefore be approximated 6.121 There will, however, be assets for which ascertaining market values may not be practical or appropriate. These assets will include: • Interests in certain foreign superannuation schemes • Interests in certain foreign life insurance policies 6.122 For these assets the appropriate value for entry and exit will depend on whether the asset is entering the standard return rule or exiting, the type of asset and on the particular circumstances of the entry or exit. 56 Entry 6.123 An asset for which it is not appropriate or practical to ascertain a market value could enter the standard return rule from another set of New Zealand tax rules that required a value to be ascribed to the asset in order to operate. For these assets it would be appropriate to continue applying the same value for the purposes of the standard return rule. The clearest example where this could occur in the context of the standard return rule is entry into the rules from the FIF rules. This could arise if, for example, a person holding a FIF asset ceases to meet the business test in relation to the asset. In these circumstances, given that the market value of the asset will not be readily ascertainable, it is likely that the person would have used the deemed rate of return method under the FIF rules. If this is the case, the rules should treat the person as having sold the asset at book value immediately before entry into the rules, with a subsequent purchase having occurred immediately after entry into the rules. 6.124 There will also be situations when neither a market nor tax-book value exists for an asset. This could occur in a number of circumstances, including when a person holding such an asset becomes a New Zealand resident. In such a situation it will be necessary to approximate the asset’s market value. A number of approaches could be used when making such an approximation. 6.125 One approach that could be used to value an interest in a foreign life insurance policy or a foreign superannuation scheme is to use surrender values (for an insurance policy) or the account value (for superannuation schemes). As noted earlier, we are currently considering whether it would be possible to determine a mechanism whereby surrender values and account values could be used to approximate the value of policies and schemes. Even if this proves to be possible for some interests, there will be others for which these values cannot be used. 6.126 Another approach is to determine an entry value simply by aggregating a person’s gross contributions to a superannuation scheme and premium payments to a foreign life insurance policy. This approach has the advantage of simplicity and should be relatively easy for people to comply with. This is the method currently used in the FIF rules for interests in foreign superannuation when it is not reasonably practicable to ascertain a market value in any other manner. 13 6.127 Clearly, the main problem with this approach is that it will, in many cases, be a very crude approximation of an asset’s market value. This is because earnings from the scheme, sales of part of the asset, or distributions from the scheme will not be taken into account. Depending on the circumstances, this would result in either undertaxation or overtaxation. While more accuracy could be achieved if sales, distributions and earnings were taken into account when ascertaining a value, this would add a significant layer of complexity and result in additional compliance costs. 13 Section CG 23(9)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 57 6.128 Therefore, for assets entering the standard return rule, for which it is not practical or appropriate to ascertain a market value, or if no tax-book value is available, we would favour a rule whereby the value of the asset, for standard return purposes, was equal to the aggregate gross contributions made by or on behalf of the person holding the asset. Exit 6.129 The appropriate exit value of these assets would be the asset’s tax-book value as determined under the standard return rule. The person holding the asset should be treated as if they had sold the asset immediately before exit and reacquired the asset immediately following the exit from the rule at the asset’s tax-book value. Submission point We invite submissions on an approach that would determine an entry value for assets when it is not practical or appropriate to ascertain a market value by aggregating gross contributions. 58 Evaluation 6.130 The key objective of a standard return rule is to tax capital account offshore investments in a manner broadly similar to that of equivalent domestic investment. The standard return rule would achieve this by deeming qualifying offshore investment held in a non-business context to yield a real risk-free return of 4% per year. The 4% rate is broadly consistent with average domestic dividend yields. 6.131 As well as meeting this broad objective, a standard return rule would also address many of the key problems identified with the current tax rules for non-controlled offshore investment in equity. These are outlined below. The grey list Low effective tax rate 6.132 The application of a standard return rule would address the low effective New Zealand tax rate that can arise in respect of capital account grey list investment. Under the standard return approach, taxable income of 4%, equivalent to a reasonable dividend yield, would arise in respect of these investments each year, independently of whether a dividend was paid. In addition, by deeming a standard rate of return each year, the rule would remove the tax incentive to invest in assets that yield capital gains rather than dividend returns. Tax-advantaged offshore investments 6.133 This approach would also address the current tax advantage that arises in respect of capital account investments into certain United Kingdom managed trusts and Australian unit trusts. By taxing these investments at the rate prescribed under the standard return rule, much of the tax incentive that currently exists to invest in these vehicles over equivalent New Zealand vehicles would be reduced. This should assist to level the playing field for New Zealand managed funds operating in similar markets. Passive funds 6.134 A standard return rule should, to some extent, also ensure that the investments of funds that track passively offshore indices in grey list countries are subject to a more appropriate level of New Zealand tax. Because these funds are considered not to be in business, the standard return rule would apply. 6.135 We acknowledge that there is a risk that, following the introduction of a standard return rule, certain passive funds may deliberately restructure in order to meet the definition of “business” and, thereby, be subject to the current revenue account rules rather than the standard return. This may be preferable for some funds because, depending on the dividend yield and the degree to which their portfolio of assets is realised each year, the effective 59 tax rate under the revenue account rules may be lower than a 4% standard return rate. 6.136 It is difficult to predict the number of passive funds that would deliberately restructure in this manner. It would depend on a number of things such as the average dividend yield for the index that is tracked and the volatility of the particular index (the more volatile the index the more likely that a fund will realise its assets). In addition, there are a number of non-tax factors that might result in a fund not restructuring even though the effective tax liability would be less if it did. One of the most significant of these is the fact that, for accounting purposes, the fund would need to account for tax on an accrued basis every year if it held its assets as part of a business. This might have a negative effect on the fund’s reported rates of return. 6.137 Even if a passive fund did restructure to hold its investments as part of a business, the effective tax rate would be higher than it is currently. This is because profits on realisation would be taxed as well as dividends under the revenue account rules. If a standard return rule was introduced, however, Inland Revenue would monitor the extent to which any passive funds restructured with a view to strengthening the business test if necessary. FIF rules 6.138 A standard return rule would address, to a large extent, the liquidity problem that can currently arise under the comparative value method in the FIF rules. This problem can occur when the value of an investment rises steeply over a year with tax levied on the increase on an accrued basis. Although the standard return rule would still tax the investment on an accrued basis, it would be levied on the asset’s value at the beginning of the year. This would ensure that the change in value of steeply appreciating assets would not be brought to tax. Instead, the increased value would be reflected in an increased opening value for the following year. 6.139 Furthermore, in most cases the fact that an investor’s tax liability would essentially be known at the beginning of an income year should allow taxpayers to better plan for their tax liability. In addition, the non-taxation of actual dividends will assist in providing sufficient cash-flow to meet an investor’s tax liability under a standard return rule. Business investment not affected 6.140 The standard return approach would confine any changes to tax rules to non- controlled offshore investment in a non-business context. When such investment occurred in a business context, the rules would not change. 60 Losses 6.141 Under a standard return rule an investor holding a qualifying asset would be subject to a standard return of 4%, each year, even if the asset declined in value. This could be perceived as unfair because the rule will have the effect of deeming the asset to have returned a gain of 4% to an investor when, in fact, the investor may have incurred an economic loss. 6.142 Although this argument has some merit, the same result can occur under the current tax rules that tax an investor on dividends derived. That is, a company whose share price declines during a year is still likely to pay a dividend that is currently taxed at the shareholder level. In addition, in most years investors would expect to derive a greater than 4% return from qualifying assets. Returns in excess of the 4% would not be subject to tax. 61 Chapter 7 OFFSHORE PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT RULES Under this option: • Investments in non-controlled offshore equity would be subject to the same set of tax rules, no matter the country of investment or whether the investment was held on capital or revenue account. • Broadly, investors holding a 10% or greater interest in a foreign company would have the following four methods to determine taxable income: – the branch equivalent method; – a method based on the accounts of the foreign company as prepared in the foreign jurisdiction; – a revised comparative value method (under which 70% of the change in value of the interest plus distributions would be taxable); and – an imputed rate of return method (broadly the same as the standard return approach but with a nominal rather than a real statutory rate of return). • Broadly, investors holding less than a 10% interest in a foreign company or interests in other types of assets would be restricted to the last two methods. • For interests above and below 10%, the imputed rate of return method would be available only when the other methods could not be used or when the total cost of an investor’s portfolio of offshore assets was less than NZD$50,000. • The restrictions on offsetting FIF losses against other income would be removed for interests in foreign companies listed on a recognised exchange. • Investors holding interests totalling less than NZD$15,000 in cost would be exempt from the rules. 7.1 As seen in chapter four, the current rules relating to non-controlled offshore investment in equity give rise to significant compliance costs, have a significant influence on investment decisions and provide opportunities to avoid the payment of New Zealand tax. The largest area of economic distortion arises as a result of the grey list treatment of capital account investments, which are subject to a low effective New Zealand tax rate on the economic return to the domestic economy. The compliance and economic costs associated with these rules would be reduced if a consistent set of tax rules applied to all non-controlled investment, whether within or outside the grey list. 62 7.2 The option presented in this chapter has the following objectives: • to provide tax rules that do not influence an investor’s decision as to whether to invest in offshore or onshore investments that provide the same return to the domestic economy (the return after foreign taxes); • to provide tax rules that do not influence an investor’s decision as to where to locate offshore investment or the legal form of that investment – in particular, the rules would apply within and outside the grey list; and • to reduce the current tax-favoured treatment of investments undertaken through certain offshore managed funds. 7.3 Furthermore, these objectives should be achieved in a way that does not impose undue compliance costs on investors. 7.4 The first two of these objectives would be implemented if income from an investment was subject to the same effective tax rate on the return to the domestic economy (after foreign tax) no matter where that investment was located or the legal structure through which that investment was made. The most effective way to achieve these objectives would at first appear to be to apply domestic tax rules in the offshore context. However, in the case of non- controlled interests, two main difficulties prevent the full application of domestic laws offshore. The domestic versus the offshore rules 7.5 To tax the full return to the domestic economy (economic income) from investments, tax could either be levied at the level of the entity invested into or in the hands of the investor. In the domestic context, investments treated as companies for tax purposes are first taxed at the entity level. In this sense the company tax acts as a withholding tax paid on behalf of the ultimate investor. To the extent that the entity level tax is comprehensive, this brings the economic income from such investment within the tax base on an accrued basis. 7.6 At the investor level, the tax treatment depends on whether an investment is held on capital account or revenue account. Capital account investments are taxed only on dividends derived, with an imputation credit given for tax paid at the entity level. Investments held on revenue account are also taxed on the gains obtained on the sale of the asset. 7.7 In order to levy equivalent New Zealand tax on the after-foreign tax return to non-controlled offshore investments on an entity basis, the after-foreign-tax income of the entity into which an investment is made, as calculated under New Zealand tax rules, would need to be calculated and attributed to the New Zealand resident. (This is referred to as “entity level taxation”.) However, in the case of non-controlled interests, taxpayers would often not have access to enough information to enable them to recalculate entity level 63 tax. This means that the domestic entity level tax rules cannot simply be transported to the offshore environment. 7.8 When entity level taxation is not possible, investments can still be taxed at the level of the investor. However, in the absence of entity level taxation, the mechanism to calculate tax on an investor level basis needs to ensure that income is taxed when it is earned. If this is not the case, the effective tax rate applying to the economic income from different investments would differ depending on how long the investment was held. Neither domestic revenue nor capital account treatment at the investor level provide for taxation on an accrued basis, however. This is because capital account treatment taxes only a portion of economic income (dividends), and revenue account treatment allows for the payment of tax on changes in value to be deferred until realisation. 7.9 Therefore, when it is not possible to approximate entity level taxation for non-controlled offshore investments, the aim is to provide mechanisms that tax a reasonable portion of the economic income investors earn from offshore investments on an accrued basis. These mechanisms will be based on the value of the investment. (This is referred to as “investor level taxation”.) Suggested approach 7.10 Given the information constraints in the non-controlled offshore environment and the differential treatments that exist domestically, this option takes a two-step approach. 7.11 Investors holding interests of 10% or greater in foreign companies would have four income calculation mechanisms available – the branch equivalent method, a method based on foreign accounts, a revised comparative value method and an imputed rate of return method. The first two of these methods provide proxies for company taxation (entity level taxation) and thus require access to detailed information. The second two methods provide taxation at the investor level and require access to a lesser amount of information. 7.12 Investors with holdings of less than 10% in a foreign company, or those who have investments in entities other than companies, however, would be restricted to the use of the last two methods. 7.13 Holdings of less than 10% are generally considered to be portfolio holdings for statistical purposes. Investors with portfolio holdings are unlikely to have access to detailed and reliable information on the income of the company into which they invest. As very few of these investors would be able to use the accurate income calculation methods, we consider it desirable to limit the methods they could use to the less accurate methods, in order to treat these investors consistently and reduce compliance issues associated with choosing between methods. 64 7.14 The income interest test in the CFC rules (section CG 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994) would be used to calculate whether an investor held an interest of 10% or greater in a foreign company. 7.15 Under this test, the interest held by a person at a particular time would be taken as the highest percentage of certain specified rights held in the company at that time. These rights are: • the available shares of the foreign company (calculated by reference to the available subscribed capital); • the percentage of the total rights to vote or participate in decision- making; • the percentage of income of the foreign company that the investor would be entitled to receive or control; and • the percentage of net assets of the foreign company that the investor would be entitled to receive or control. Submission points What problems or advantages would arise from applying one set of rules to all non- controlled offshore equity investments – no matter the country of investment and no matter whether it is a business or non-business investment? Does it make sense to distinguish between investors that have small and large holdings? Investors with limited access to information 7.16 The treatment of investors with limited access to information would provide taxation on an investor level basis – that is, based on the value of the investment as opposed to the actual income of the entity. This category would cover: • investors with holdings of less than 10% in foreign companies; • investors with holdings of 10% or greater in foreign companies who could not use more accurate income calculation measures; and • investors with holdings in assets other than companies. 7.17 The income calculation mechanisms available for these investors would not be subject to the same information requirements as mechanisms which attempt to proxy the actual income of the entity into which an investment is made. 65 7.18 In the absence of taxation at the entity level, taxation at the level of the investor needs to apply to income as it is earned, in order to ensure consistency of treatment between different investments. 7.19 The main income calculation mechanism available for these investments would be a revised comparative value method. This method would tax 70% of income as calculated using the comparative value method in the current FIF rules. An imputed rate of return method, similar to the risk-free return method proposed by the Tax Review, would also be available for smaller taxpayers or when taxpayers had insufficient information to comply with the revised comparative value method. 7.20 We would expect that the vast majority of taxpayers would use the revised comparative value method. Revised comparative value method 7.21 The comparative value method in the FIF rules currently taxes the full change in value of an interest, on an accrued basis, and distributions received from that interest. This mechanism is likely to provide the best unbiased estimate of the full return (economic income), after foreign taxes, of the foreign entity invested into. However, fluctuations in share values mean that the method is not accurate in all cases. This is one reason why it is perceived by many as not being a fair way to tax offshore income. For this reason we do not recommend applying the current comparative value method more widely under this option. 7.22 As discussed earlier, we see the current treatment of offshore revenue account investment in the grey list as broadly appropriate. We consider that it would be reasonable to assume that the average offshore revenue account investment is subject to tax on a basis equivalent to taxing 70% to 90% of economic income on an accrued basis. Although these investments are taxed on realised changes in share value, most of the investments are held by institutions that turn over their portfolios reasonably frequently. Note that taxation of realised changes in value would not tax a reasonable portion of the income from grey list capital account investments as these investments are often held for long periods of time. 7.23 Figure 4 shows how much the effective tax rate on economic income (changes in value on an accrued basis and distributions) reduces by as a result of the deferral of realisation. Assume investors discount future income at a rate of 10%. Assume that there are three investors, investing in three different companies. The companies distribute either, 0%, 10% or 20% of income earned in a particular year. This is taxed in the year of distribution. The remaining income is reinvested in the company and this is reflected in its share value. This is taxed when the shares are sold (on realisation) – the longer the investor holds the shares, the lower the effective tax rate on economic income. For example, if a company distributes 20% of its income and the investor holds the investment for four years, the effective tax rate 66 will be reduced to around 75% of the effective tax rate that would have applied under annual taxation on an accrued basis. Figure 4: Percentage of economic income taxed 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 12345678 Years Held Percentage Taxed 0% distributed 10% distributed 20% distributed 7.24 Offshore investment outside the grey list will often be taxed at a higher effective tax rate than offshore revenue account investment within the grey list. This is because the majority of this investment is taxed on the full annual change in value of shares plus distributions. Offshore capital account grey list investment is taxed at a lower effective tax rate than offshore revenue account investment, as this investment is only taxed on distributions. As discussed, this differential treatment gives rise to economic and compliance costs. 7.25 Given that we have concluded that the average offshore revenue account investment is taxed at an acceptable rate, we consider it reasonable to seek to align the effective tax rate on all offshore investments with that applying to the average revenue account investment, in order to achieve a consistent treatment of non-controlled offshore investment. This would result in consistent treatment between revenue account, capital account and non-grey list investments offshore. 7.26 We suggest that this be achieved by allowing all taxpayers to use a revised comparative value method. Taxing accrued gains is preferable to taxing realised changes in value as it ensures a consistent tax treatment of the full returns to offshore investments by taxing those returns as they arise. This would be important for a method that would apply to a diverse range of investment products, such as passive and active funds. 7.27 As discussed, we consider that it would be reasonable to assume that the average offshore revenue account investment is subject to tax on a basis equivalent to taxing 70% to 90% of economic income on an accrued basis. The revised comparative value method would be available for all non- controlled offshore investments at a rate of 70% of the sum of the change in 67 share value and distributions. This is at the low end of what we consider would be the effective rate applying to offshore investments held on revenue account at the moment but we consider that acceptable as it is “high enough” so as not to result in a large incentive to invest offshore rather than onshore or in a large incentive to invest in equity as opposed to debt. Furthermore, this rate would result in this option being broadly revenue neutral. Further issues 7.28 The formula for calculating taxable income under the revised comparative value method would be: 0.7\[(a+b) – (c+d)\] + e where a is the market value of the interest at the end of the income year (or nil if the interest is no longer held); b is the aggregate of all gains, including dividends, derived by the person during the income year (after foreign taxes for which foreign tax credits are available); c is the market value of the interest at the end of the preceding income year (or nil if the interest was not held then); d is the aggregate of all expenditure incurred by or on behalf of the person in acquiring the whole or any part of the interest during the income year; e is the value of any tax for which foreign tax credits are available. 7.29 Dividends would not be separately taxable. Foreign tax credits would remain available for non-resident withholding tax on dividends. 7.30 An example follows: John (who has a 39% personal tax rate) owns 100 shares in a foreign company as at 1 April 2005. At that date the shares are valued at NZD$2.00 each. The value of John’s investment is thus NZD$200. Over the year the shares increase in value to NZD$3.00 each. As at 31 March 2006, the value of the holding is NZD$300. During the year the company also makes a distribution of NZD$0.50 per share, which is subject to non-resident withholding tax in the foreign country at a rate of 15%. This means the taxpayer receives an after-foreign-tax dividend of NZD$42.50 and is eligible for foreign tax credits to the value of NZD$7.50. 68 John’s taxable income at the end of the year, calculated under the preceding formula, will be: 0.7\[(NZD$300+NZD$42.50) – NZD$200\] + NZD$7.50 = NZD$107.25 and John’s tax liability for the year will be: (NZD$107.25 x 39%) - NZD$7.50 = NZD$34.32 7.31 This approach could be applied when a market or arm’s length value was available. In most cases, the method should be simple to apply, as the information necessary to make the calculation is readily available. 7.32 The 70% comparative value rate would not flow through to New Zealand investors who hold investments in New Zealand entities that then invest in offshore qualifying interests. This retains the current treatment of these investments. 7.33 We also suggest that losses be made more widely available. However, the desirability of treating losses and gains in the same way must be balanced against policy-makers’ need to be confident that reported losses are real losses. 7.34 Under the current legislation, taxpayers are allowed to offset a FIF loss in any given year against FIF income from that year and, when the loss does not exceed prior years’ FIF income, other non-FIF income. Currently, taxpayers are not able to deduct the loss in the year it arises if the FIF loss is more than the FIF income earned in current or previous years, even if they have other income sources. 7.35 We consider that when taxpayers invest in shares listed on a recognised stock exchange the risk that losses are being fabricated is low. We therefore suggest extending the ability to use losses under the revised comparative value method, such that when taxpayers hold shares in a company listed on a recognised stock exchange they will be able to offset those losses against non-FIF income, whether or not the losses exceed past years’ FIF income. Imputed rate of return method 7.36 As the revised comparative value method requires information on the market value of the asset, it could not be used for all assets currently covered by the FIF rules. The comparative value method is also viewed as unfair when shares sharply appreciate in value over a year. This is more likely to be a concern for those with smaller, less diversified holdings. 69 7.37 For these reasons, under this option: • if a taxpayer is unable to use any other income calculation mechanism for a given investment (for example, if no market value is available) in any given year that taxpayer would calculate income using the imputed rate of return method; and • if a taxpayer (or associated persons) held non-controlled offshore equity assets which cost less than NZD$50,000 that taxpayer may choose to use the imputed rate of return method. 7.38 If the NZD$50,000 threshold is passed all of the taxpayer’s investment would be subject to the revised comparative value method (or, if possible, one of the more accurate methods discussed later) unless market values were not available. 7.39 It is likely that most individuals who hold their investments directly would have the choice of the revised comparative value method or the imputed rate of return method. 7.40 The imputed rate of return method would operate in the same manner as the standard return approach, apart from two differences. 7.41 In determining the imputed rate of return to apply to these investments, the aim is to leave taxpayers in a situation where they are more or less indifferent between ex ante taxation at an imputed rate and ex post taxation of full returns. The aim is also to ensure consistency with the way other forms of income are taxed, which would limit the extent to which tax influences investment decisions. 7.42 As previously discussed, in theory and under certain conditions, a taxpayer will be indifferent between ex ante taxation which assumes a risk-free imputed rate of return to an asset and ex post taxation of the full return actually realised. This is because the reduced tax liability in the former case is offset by the higher risk that the taxpayer bears as a result of the tax liability varying less with the actual performance of the investment. Given that domestic and debt investments are generally taxed on nominal returns, setting a nominal risk-free rate would thus approximate this trade-off for taxpayers. 7.43 We suggest that the five-year government stock rate would provide an appropriate risk-free rate. This means that taxpayers investing into offshore equity and using the imputed rate of return method would be taxed at the same rate as if they had, alternatively, invested into government stock with a term of five years. This method thus differs from the standard return approach and that recommended by the Tax Review in that a nominal rather than a real rate of return would apply. 70 7.44 The second difference between this method and that applying under the standard return approach is that it would also apply to unlisted shares for which no market values can be obtained. Under the standard return approach, the current FIF rules would apply to unlisted shares when a market or arm’s length valuation could not be obtained. This means that under the standard return approach these investments would in most cases be subject to the deemed rate of return. It should not be necessary to apply the FIF rules under this option as tax minimisation concerns would be lessened by setting the imputed rate at a nominal rate. Unlisted shares would, therefore, be treated using the imputed rate of return method, with a tax-book value calculated on the basis of cost adjusted for an annual investment return and distributions. 7.45 As with the standard return method, actual returns to the investment – for example, distributions derived – would not be subject to tax. Credits would be granted for foreign non-resident withholding tax withheld on dividends in the source country. Submission points What problems would arise from allowing the revised comparative value method (which calculates taxable income as 70% of income calculated under the current comparative value method) to be used by all investors holding non-controlled offshore equity investments? What advantages are there to relaxing the rules relating to losses under the revised comparative value method? What problems would arise from allowing taxpayers to use an imputed rate of return method in cases of limited information or when they have smaller holdings? What problems would arise from applying the imputed rate of return method to unlisted shares? Investors with access to detailed information 7.46 Investors with holdings of 10% or greater in a foreign company would have the choice of using, in addition to the two preceding methods, income calculation mechanisms that seek to approximate domestic entity level taxation. This would provide consistency with how investments into entities are treated domestically. 7.47 The mechanisms available would be the branch equivalent mechanism and a method based on foreign accounts. We expect that only a very small portion of taxpayers with non-controlled interests would be able to use these mechanisms. 71 Branch equivalent method 7.48 The retention of the branch equivalent method within the rules for non- controlled interests provides a bridge between the treatment of controlled and non-controlled interests. This would ensure that when there were two interests that were economically equivalent but one was considered a controlling interest and the other was not, each would be able to use the same income calculation method. Foreign accounts 7.49 We have considered two options here: • The first option would retain the current approach of basing taxable income on the net, after-foreign-tax accounting profits of the entity invested into. • The second option would be to modify the accounting profits method so that it is based on the net, after-foreign–tax, taxable income of the entity into which an investment is made, in order to provide greater comparability with how similar entities are taxed domestically. This approach would be restricted to countries that have tax systems similar to New Zealand’s, such as the grey list countries. 7.50 A method based on foreign accounts would give rise to higher compliance costs than the revised comparative value method and imputed rate of return method. We are interested in receiving submissions on options to reduce compliance costs associated with methods based on foreign accounts. 7.51 In particular, we are interested in submissions on: • Whether there is scope to relax the restriction on the use of the accounting profits method whilst still ensuring the integrity of the accounting information used. The current restrictions for use of the accounting profits method require that: – the taxpayer hold an interest in a foreign company; – the interest in the company be quoted on a recognised stock exchange; – the interest in the company be offered widely to the public; – the net after-tax profits of the company be calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles; – the net after-tax profits be detailed in financial statements audited and verified by a chartered accountant; – the net after-tax accounting profits or losses be calculated on a consolidated basis; – the net after-tax accounting profits include any extraordinary items; and – the taxpayer has no reason to believe that the net after-tax accounting profits or losses of the company do not fairly represent the net after-tax profits or losses of company. 72 • Whether making dividends paid from the foreign entity exempt from New Zealand tax would simplify the accounting profits method. Given the aim of a method based on foreign accounts is to tax on an entity level basis, to the extent that this is done, dividends do not need to be taxed. • Whether there is scope to simplify the income interest test. Submission points What problems would arise from restricting the use of the accounting profits and branch equivalent methods to interests in foreign companies of 10% or greater? Why do few investors currently use the accounting profits method? What problems would arise if the accounting profits method was changed to a method based on foreign accounts but restricted to countries with tax systems similar to New Zealand? How could the compliance costs associated with a method based on foreign accounts be reduced? 73 Further issues Under this option: • Investors with non-controlled offshore holdings that cost less than NZD$15,000 would not be subject to the offshore portfolio investment rules. • Once an income calculation method has been chosen, investors would be required to continue using that method subject to specific exclusions. • Assets entering the rules would be valued at market value when available. • Investors would have the option to offset their tax liability using any imputation credits allowed for New Zealand tax paid. Exempting very small holdings 7.52 The de minimis threshold would be lowered to exempt only holdings that cost less than NZD$15,000. Once the cost of an investor’s holding exceeded NZD$15,000, the entire holding would be subject to the new rules. The de minimis threshold would thus exist to minimise compliance costs associated with only very small holdings. The holdings of most unsophisticated investors are likely to fall below the threshold. 7.53 Smaller investors with holdings that exceed the threshold would have the imputed rate of return method available to them. If they chose this treatment they would be taxed at broadly the same rate as unsophisticated investors who invest in government stock in the domestic context. Given that this treatment is considered to be appropriate for onshore investment, we do not consider it to be harsh in the offshore context. Requirement to use method 7.54 As under the current FIF rules, once a taxpayer chooses to use a particular method that taxpayer will be required to continue to use it except when: • the taxpayer cannot obtain the information to use the method; • the taxpayer no longer meets the criteria to use the method; • the taxpayer applies to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and is changing to or from the branch equivalent method for the first time; or • there has been a change in factual circumstances. Entry and exit 7.55 Under the revised comparative value method or imputed rate of return method, rules would be needed to determine the value of an interest upon entry or exit. 74 7.56 On entry into or exit from the rules, an investor who used the revised comparative value method would be considered to have purchased or sold the interest at market value, respectively. 7.57 The same rules would apply under the imputed rate of return method as under the standard return rule. For assets entering the imputed rate of return method, the value of the asset would be calculated as: • market value, or if no such value exists: • the previous year’s tax-book value, or if no such value exists: • the aggregate of gross contributions made by or on behalf of the person holding the asset. 7.58 The exit value under the imputed rate of return method would be the asset’s tax-book value. 7.59 When the accounting profits or branch equivalent method was used, taxable income for that year would be equal to the total income of the entity for the year multiplied by the proportion of days in the accounting year that the interest was held. Trans-Tasman recognition of imputation credits 7.60 The changes introduced in the recent reform of New Zealand and Australian imputation laws to address the double taxation of certain trans-Tasman investments would be preserved under this option. Namely, New Zealand investors would still be able to offset their tax liability under these rules with imputation credits representing New Zealand tax paid. 75 Evaluation 7.61 This option is expected to be broadly revenue neutral, although it would result in a redistribution of tax liabilities. In particular, there would be a reduction in tax collected from non-grey list investments and an increase in the amount of tax collected from grey list investments. 7.62 The option would provide a consistent treatment of non-controlled offshore investment income whilst reducing the distortion between the domestic and offshore boundary by taxing a portion of economic income that is reasonably comparable to that taxed domestically. The main gains are expected to arise through: • a reduction in the incentive (from the point of view of the domestic economy) to locate capital account investment offshore rather than onshore; and • a consistent tax treatment of the economic income of different offshore investments. This would be achieved because: – The tax rules would be neutral as to which country an investment was made into, since there would be no grey list exemption under this option. – The tax rules would be neutral as to whether the investment was considered to be on revenue or capital account (or business or non-business), which would reduce the extent to which the tax system favours investment that provides returns in the form of capital gains, rather than taxable distributions. – The tax rules would be neutral as to the holding period of the investment, so investments of different holding periods would be subject to the same effective tax rate on economic income. 7.63 A more consistent treatment of offshore investment would reduce the economic costs associated with the tax system distorting investment choices. 7.64 Applying one set of rules irrespective of the country of investment or type of investment would also reduce compliance costs associated with, for example, changing between tax treatments when a company migrates and determining whether an investment should be held on revenue or capital account. 7.65 The application of tax on an accrued basis would also remove opportunities for investors holding investments on capital account to avoid the payment of New Zealand tax through the use of offshore entities. 7.66 This option does not address problems associated with the differential treatment of various investment forms domestically. For example, it does not address the issue of the differential treatment of direct investments by individuals in relation to investments through entities such as managed funds. Nor does it address issues associated with the differential tax rates applying to different savings and investment entities. 76 Non-grey list investment 7.67 This option would clearly result in non-grey list investment being treated more favourably than at present. We expect that tax collected from outside the grey list would decrease by around NZD$20 million per year. 7.68 We see the advantage of the option for non-grey list investment as consistency of tax treatment between grey list and non-grey list investments. Apart from removing the disincentive to invest in entities outside the grey list, this is expected to reduce compliance costs. As links between non-grey list countries and New Zealand increase, it is becoming more important to treat investment in these countries in a similar manner to investment in grey- list countries. Grey list revenue account investment 7.69 Grey list revenue account investments are currently taxable on the realised change in value of an asset and on distributions. Our expectation is that if the revised comparative value method were applied to revenue account investment, much of this investment would be subject to a similar or more favourable treatment than at present. This is because the majority of this investment is held by institutions, which can be expected to turn over their portfolios reasonably frequently. 7.70 Funds and investors at the conservative end of the spectrum may, however, be subjected to a higher effective tax rate under this method than at present. 7.71 We would expect that the amount of tax collected from this sector would decrease by around NZD$20 to NZD$30 million per year. Grey list capital account investments 7.72 Grey list capital account investments are currently taxed on distributions only. 7.73 Larger investors, such as passive funds, would generally be subject to the revised comparative value method under this option. These investors account for around NZD$2 billion worth of investment. It is likely that around NZD$20 to NZD$25 million extra tax revenue would be collected from these funds each year. From an economic perspective, the advantage of bringing these funds within this mechanism is that it would align the tax treatment of these funds with that applying to active funds investing offshore. Furthermore, this option would better align the effective tax rate on the return to the domestic economy from investment in offshore passive funds with that applying to investments made in domestic entities (which are taxed under the company tax rules). 77 7.74 Investors with smaller holdings, who in the main would be individuals, would be subject to either the imputed rate of return or the revised comparative value method. These investors hold around NZD$6 billion worth of investment. We would expect that around NZD$15 to NZD$20 million extra tax revenue would be collected from this group. However, the economic gain from the option is that it provides a similar tax treatment of the domestic returns to international investments as to domestic investments, which are taxed at the entity level within the New Zealand tax base. Furthermore, the option would provide a more consistent treatment between investments because tax liability would not depend on the distribution policy of the company invested into. It would also remove the incentive that currently exists for individuals to invest offshore directly, rather than through an institution. 7.75 Applying this method to individuals would also remove the current incentive that exists to invest in certain offshore vehicles that are free from both New Zealand and offshore tax. For example, under the imputed rate of return method taxpayers would be indifferent between investing in New Zealand government stock directly or through an offshore managed trust. 78 Appendix 1 TAXATION OF DOMESTIC SAVINGS VEHICLES The suggestions outlined in this issues paper focus on the low or zero tax that can apply to investments in offshore-based funds rather than the inconsistencies in the tax treatment of domestic savings entities. A working group made up of representatives from the savings industry and officials has considered the broader issues facing the savings industry. As outlined here, one possible method of evening up the tax treatment of offshore and domestic funds could be to apply the risk-free rate of return method to domestic savings vehicles. Both the government and industry representatives recognise that there will be problems with this approach that will need to be worked through and at this stage cannot reach a firm conclusion as to its desirability. It is an option that is considered to be worth exploring, however, and for that reason an account of those discussions is set out here for people to comment on. Current state of domestic taxation of savings vehicles The savings industry is currently subject to a number of different tax rules that depend on several factors, including the following: • whether an investment is made indirectly through a savings vehicle or directly; • whether an investment is onshore (domestic) or offshore; • the type of investment (capital or revenue); • the type of investor; and • the type of savings vehicle. The extent of these differences means that tax costs or benefits will vary across investment stakeholders, some having a competitive advantage in some circumstances and others having that advantage in others. This means that all vehicles face competitive pressure to develop tax-effective savings products in order to defend or expand market share. Examples of these products include passive funds, UK open- ended investment companies, the targeted Australian unit trusts, wrap accounts and partnership-structured investments. This state of affairs poses a significant risk that the tax system distorts the quality of savings by ushering resources to relatively inferior investments. Taxes can artificially cause a ranking of investments different from that based on pre-tax returns. In addition, these tax-effective solutions are affecting the size of the New Zealand tax base. 79 The industry would prefer a more consistent tax treatment of savings vehicles, irrespective of: • whether they are direct or through a savings vehicle; • whether onshore or offshore; • the type of investor; • the type of savings vehicle; and • capital-revenue distinction. At the same time, the industry is conscious of feasibility and practical constraints. The industry accepts that the tax problems identified cannot be eradicated, only mitigated. An optimal reform should involve appropriate trade-offs and an acceptance that some anomalies will remain. Key tax issues The following issues are considered by industry representatives to be the most important to be addressed by tax reform, namely: • differing tax treatment across savings vehicles; • tax rate alignment between savings vehicles and investors; • the capital-revenue boundary; and • the treatment of cross-border investment. Differing tax treatment across savings vehicles Industry representatives have identified the following widely held savings vehicles, many of which are taxed in different ways: • unit trusts (both open-ended and closed); • superannuation schemes (including schemes available to retail investors, employee sponsored schemes and master trusts); • category A group investment funds; • category B group investment funds (both designated source funds and designated investments); • life insurance entities; • companies; • non-entity vehicles (for example, partnerships and wrap accounts); and • foreign vehicles. Unit trusts Unit trusts are taxed as companies. Capital gains are not specifically taxed but depend on common law principles, which means in practice that tax is paid on realised and unrealised capital gains in most circumstances Distributions, including unit redemptions, are taxed as dividends, which gives rise to many issues. 80 Superannuation schemes Superannuation schemes are taxed as qualifying trusts with benefits and distributions being free of tax to the recipients. Capital gains are not specifically taxed but depend on common law principles, which means in practice that tax is paid on realised and unrealised capital gains in most circumstances. Group investment funds The taxation of group investment funds depends on the nature of investments and the source of the funds invested. Category A group investment funds are taxed as companies. Capital gains are not specifically taxed but depend on common law principles. Distributions, including unit redemptions, are taxed as dividends giving rise to many issues. Category B group investment funds are taxed as qualifying trusts, whereby income distributed during the income year or six months following is taxed to the recipients (less resident withholding tax, where applicable). Income not distributed and taxable capital elements not distributed are taxed to the trustee at 33%. Life insurance Life insurance companies are taxed on a two-tier tax base system. The first, being the life office base, taxes the life insurer on elements that include investment income. On the second base, being the life insurance company, tax is a proxy for policyholders and amounts distributed to policyholders are not taxable to them. Companies Companies that are regarded as savings vehicles are taxed according to ordinary principles, including the imputation system. This allows credits to be provided to investors in such savings vehicles for taxes paid. Non-entity vehicles The income of non-entity vehicles such as partnerships and wrap accounts is taxed in the hands of the investors. Offshore vehicles New Zealand generally has no taxing rights over offshore vehicles unless they can be regarded as New Zealand tax resident. Tax is usually payable at the individual investor level. Other countries have different ways of taxing savings vehicles, which can create tax arbitrage opportunities but further complexity where these vehicles are accessible by New Zealand investors. 81 Tax rate alignment between savings vehicles and investors There is no specific tax rate alignment between savings vehicles and investors. Individual tax rates (adjusted for the low income earner rebate) are as follows: Income threshold Tax rate Income to NZD$9,500 15% Income from NZD$9,501 to NZD$38,000 21% Income from NZD$38,001 to NZD$60,000 33% Income above NZD$60,000 39% Savings vehicle tax rates are as follows: Unit trusts: 33% company tax and imputation Superannuation schemes: 33% final tax Group investment funds: Category A: Category B: 33% company tax and imputation Beneficiary income: taxed at investor rate Trustee income: 33% final tax Life insurance: 33% final tax Companies: 33% and imputation Non-entity vehicles: Taxed at investor rate Foreign vehicles: No entity tax. Distributions taxed at investor rate. There is a problem aligning the tax rate of individual investors with the underlying fund vehicle, as can be seen from the tables above. Most collective investment vehicles are taxed at 33%. Where distributions are exempt, and the underlying income is taxed at 33% (such as superannuation schemes and certain group investment funds), the 33% rate paid by the fund is a final tax. Because imputation credits distributed by unit trusts are not refundable, the 33% tax can, effectively, become a minimum tax in practice. The treatment of cross border investments Although New Zealand residents are taxed on their worldwide income, the treatment of domestic investment and offshore investment is not identical. As is demonstrated by the Australian unit trust investment scheme, it is possible to invest through certain offshore vehicles in such a way that no tax is payable at the vehicle level, even though the investment may be taxable if it had been made directly by the fund rather than through the offshore vehicle. On the other hand, offshore investment into certain countries may be taxable on the basis of accruing capital gains, even though the gains, if made in New Zealand, may only be taxable on distributions or not at all. These differences in tax treatment are likely to lead to an inefficient allocation of investment funds between New Zealand and offshore, and between alternative offshore investments. 82 The capital-revenue boundary Most individual investors are not taxable on capital gains made from direct investments. Most collective investment vehicles (with notable exceptions, such as passive funds) are taxable on most or all of the gains made on the disposal of investment assets because they fall on the revenue side of the common law capital- revenue boundary. Life insurance companies are taxed on some accrued capital gains by the operation of specific statutory provisions. This causes problems for the savings industry because: • Different investment vehicles are taxed differently, leading to competitive disparities. • Collective vehicles generally pay tax on gains that would not be taxable had the investor made a direct investment, discouraging what may otherwise be the efficient pooling of funds and risk. • Uncertainty as to the operation of the capital-revenue boundary leads to compliance costs for funds and difficulties in properly providing for tax when distributing returns to investors. The issue of the capital-revenue boundary is connected with rate alignment (since tax revenue is a function of both the tax rate and the base on which it is paid). If the argument that rates between investors and funds should be aligned where possible is accepted (that is, that collective investment vehicles are a proxy for direct investment), there are strong grounds for aligning the tax base of funds with the investors. On this basis, where capital gains would not be taxable to the investor, they should not be taxable to the fund. Considering the application of RFRM domestically as a starting point As noted above, the application of the risk-free rate of return method to domestic savings vehicles has, as a starting point, been considered as an option to remove the relative disincentives under the current tax rules. The following matrix is a suggested framework: Foreign NZ Investment vehicle RFRM RFRM Direct non-business RFRM Existing rules Direct business Existing rules Existing rules RFRM scenario The base principles developed to consider the application of a domestic RFRM are as follows: • Funds vehicles would not be subject to tax themselves (only resident withholding). 83 • Investors in funds vehicles would be subject to tax based on their investment in a funds vehicle at the inflation-adjusted risk free rate. • The funds vehicle would account to Inland Revenue for resident withholding tax (RWT) at 33% for tax on the RFRM income. Imputation credits and credits for foreign withholding tax received by the funds vehicles would offset the RWT liability. • Investors would return their RFRM income and claim a credit for the RWT paid on their behalf to Inland Revenue by the funds vehicle. Example: • An investor contributes NZD$250,000 to a funds vehicle at the start of the year. • Over the year the investor receives NZD$15,000 as dividends and has a NZD$7,000 increase in the value of the investment. No imputation credits are attached to the dividends or foreign withholding tax deducted. • The inflation-adjusted risk free rate is 4%. • The investor’s taxable income on an RFRM basis is NZD$10,000. The funds vehicle accounts for RWT of NZD$3,300 to Inland Revenue. The investor returns this NZD$10,000 for tax purposes and claims a credit for the RWT against the tax liability on this. Other Distributions made by a savings vehicle would be ignored in calculating RFRM except they would, in effect, reduce RFRM in the following year through reducing the opening market value of the investment upon which RFRM is calculated. In general terms, units acquired or disposed of during the income year would attract a time-based apportionment. With daily unit pricing, RFRM income would be calculated daily. Revenue and expenses of savings vehicles generally should not directly affect the RFRM calculation, other than through a valuation impact in the following period. This would apply to foreign taxes as well. Significant RFRM application considerations A number of issues have been identified in relation to applying RFRM to investments in domestic savings vehicles. While applying RFRM domestically is a starting point for removing the current tax anomalies associated with domestic savings vehicles, its practical application raises similar issues that will require further consideration along with other options. While some of the issues are more detailed, the following issues are significant. 84 Savings vehicles subject to RFRM A significant issue is the scope of a domestic RFRM in terms of those savings vehicles that would be subject to it. As noted above, savings vehicles include the following: Unit trusts • open-ended and closed; • listed and unlisted; and • wholesale and retail. Superannuation schemes • wholesale and retail; • employee based schemes; and • master trusts. Category A group investment funds • wholesale and retail. Category B group investment funds • designated investments; and • designated source funds. Life insurance companies • investment linked business; and • profit participating policyholder business; and • non-profit participating policyholder business. Companies • listed and unlisted; • open-ended and closed; and • wholesale and retail. Non-entity vehicles • partnerships; and • wrap accounts. Foreign vehicles As an initial proposition, the RFRM could apply to widely held vehicles that manage investments on behalf of shareholders, unitholders and beneficiaries. This would encompass widely held unit trusts, Category A group investments funds and superannuation schemes. This should likely extend to Category B group investment funds and life insurance. 85 Some companies, such as investment companies, can be described as collective investment vehicles. An issue is whether these companies should be within the regime. The inclusion of widely held unit trusts would include listed property trusts. On the one hand, vehicles such as these can be considered collective investment vehicles. On the other hand, they are generally closed, which can differentiate them from open- ended vehicles. Depending on the view taken as to whether closed vehicles and non-entity vehicles should be included within the rules, there is the question of whether investment partnerships should be subject to RFRM. An example could be a forestry partnership comprising loss attributing qualifying companies. Life insurance Some industry representatives are of the view that life insurance should be within RFRM. Many investor savings are via life insurance policies. Many superannuation schemes invest in policies of life insurance, which provides added support for their inclusion. The inclusion of life insurance is in line with adopting a consistent approach to the taxation of savings vehicles. Life insurance is currently taxed via a two-tier tax base system, the life base (tax on the life insurance company) and the policyholder base (the life insurance company taxed as a proxy for the policyholders). Some industry representatives are of the view the existing two-tier tax base system technically could be subjected to an RFRM. Category B group investment funds Some industry representatives consider that Category B group investments funds which attain such status owing to funds being invested in “designated investments” (such as mortgages and cash) should not be taxed via a RFRM. These funds are currently taxed as qualifying trusts (on a flow-through basis). The reason for their exclusion is that they are essentially akin to bank accounts and should be taxed in the same way. Definition There would need to be a definition of those vehicles that would be taxed on an RFRM basis. The key criteria are the concept of “widely held” and having an “active business” exemption. A question is whether only open-ended vehicles are subject to RFRM. Given this, the likely component points of the definition would include the following: • “widely held” (a possibility being 100 or more investors and covering wholesale funds); 86 • “open-ended”; and • “eligible investment activity” (the effect of this would be to have an “active business” exemption which would cover vehicles including listed property trusts). Transitional issues There are major transitional issues with a change to RFRM, including: • treatment of existing savings vehicles; • treatment of savings vehicles withdrawals that include pre and post-RFRM elements; and • the determination of the opening value upon which RFRM would be based. The treatment of losses is a significant issue. Many savings vehicles have substantial realised and unrealised losses. Accounting and market values will have been placed on these losses, which are an asset of particular savings vehicles. Industry representatives consider that for the industry to support RFRM it would need to maintain the value of these realised and unrealised losses. While realised losses are known, unrealised losses could be quantified by a notional wind-up calculation being made at a particular point in time. Attribution of RFRM income and RWT One of the key tax issues noted above for the industry is alignment of the tax rate of savings vehicles with that of investors. The general proposition should be that either RFRM income and the associated RWT accounted for is attributed to the underlying investors in savings vehicles or RWT is paid at an investor’s marginal rate. Attribution of RFRM income and RWT raises compliance issues for investors and may have other consequences, such as being attributed what would be taxable income from savings vehicles (like superannuation schemes and life insurance) where they do not receive taxable income from such vehicles under the current rules. The alternative is having RWT paid at the investor’s marginal tax rate and possibly treating this as a final tax. A consideration is whether information systems could realistically accommodate tax being paid in this way. Negative returns The base position is that tax on an RFRM basis continues to be paid even if an investor suffers negative returns. This can pose cash flow problems. 87 While this outcome is theoretically correct, under an RFRM basis of taxation, a possible high-level modification is whether in periods that an investor suffers negative returns, no RFRM tax arises but rolls up to be paid during a later period of positive returns. Concluding comment While, as noted above, neither the government nor the industry are yet in a position to reach a firm conclusion on the merits of a broader application of RFRM to domestic savings vehicles, submissions are invited on the merits of such an approach. 88 Appendix 2 MAIN APPROACHES CONSIDERED FOR ATTRIBUTING DEBT The approaches we have considered are: Debt tracking rules Under these rules, a taxpayer who has borrowed funds in order to purchase a qualifying asset would apply those borrowed funds to reduce net equity in the asset. The rationale is to directly link the borrowed funds with the purpose for which they were applied and to determine the tax treatment accordingly. However, for this method to function effectively it would be necessary for a taxpayer and Inland Revenue to be able to identify which funds were applied to fund qualifying assets and which funds were applied to fund other business assets. This would give rise to compliance costs for many taxpayers that do not, in their normal business, track what funds are used for what purpose. For such taxpayers, on any given day, funds can come in from a variety of sources and be applied in a number of different ways. Taxpayers’ key concerns are unlikely to be matching debt to particular assets but rather ensuring that the overall debt level is consistent with commercial guidelines. Debt apportionment rules This approach would allocate the portion of a taxpayer’s tax-deductible debt portfolio to qualifying assets that is equal to the portion calculated by comparing the value of the taxpayer’s standard return rule assets to their total gross income producing assets. The portion of the debt portfolio attributable to the qualifying assets would reduce the net equity in those assets and would not attract an interest deduction. While this method would provide an approximation of a taxpayer’s total debt portfolio that should be allocated between qualifying assets and other assets within the tax base, it is likely to give rise to significant compliance costs. It is envisaged that these costs will arise mainly in the area of valuing a taxpayer’s assets within the tax base. For example, intangible assets are notoriously difficult to value and Inland Revenue is likely to have problems verifying these valuations. 89 Deductibility of interest costs only where relationship with asset is clear This method would require taxpayers to apply debt to reduce net equity in a qualifying asset only where it is very clear that the funds were borrowed to purchase the asset. For example, where taxpayers use qualifying assets as security for borrowed funds, the funds would be applied to reduce net equity in those assets and the interest incurred on the borrowing would not attract a deduction. This is likely to be difficult, however, with offshore equity investments as these assets may not be able to be as easily linked with borrowed funds. For example, it would be unlikely that an offshore investment would be accepted as collateral for a loan. Debt stacking rules Under a debt stacking rule, a taxpayer’s total portfolio of deductible debt would be allocated, first, to offset the value of any standard return assets, with no deductions for interest costs arising from this debt. If total available debt exceeds the value of standard return assets, any interest costs arising from the excess would be deductible. The idea behind such a rule is to ensure that any interest costs are allocated, first and foremost, to any qualifying assets. However, like the other three methods, such a rule would impose compliance costs on taxpayers as under a standard return rule that recognises part-year adjustments, investors would be required to track changes to their total debt portfolio after each adjustment. 90 Appendix 3 EXAMPLE – CALCULATION OF STANDARD RETURN INCOME FOR EASY-TO-VALUE ASSETS Amanda owns 100 shares in A Co at the start of the 2005-06 income year. A Co is listed on a recognised international stock exchange. At the start of this income year, the shares are quoted on the exchange at NZD$100 each. During the 2005-06 income year, Amanda makes the following adjustments to her portfolio of these assets: • On 1/08/05, Amanda increases her portfolio of qualifying assets by 50 units at a cost of NZD$110 per unit • On 1/12/05, Amanda reduces her portfolio of qualifying assets by 25 units at a price of NZD$109 per unit • On 1/01/06, Amanda increases her portfolio of qualifying assets by 15 units at a cost of NZD$105 per unit • On 1/02/06, Amanda reduces her portfolio of qualifying assets by 75 units at a price of NZD$98 per unit In the above scenario, Amanda’s taxable income under a standard return rule would be calculated by splitting up the year into different periods, with each period being denoted by one transaction, an acquisition or a realisation. The different periods would comprise different part-years. Amanda’s sales and purchases during the year are valued at NZD$100 (the value on 1/04/05) First part-year (1/04/05 to 31/07/05) What is the opening value for the part-year?
