UNCLASSIFIED Revenue Alert Questions and Answers Q. We are planning to restructure our company-owned business and we’re worried that the Commissioner will think it is tax avoidance and that there is a dividend. Is there a way we can find out what the Commissioner thinks of the restructuring before it goes ahead? A. Yes, you can apply for a binding ruling from the Commissioner. A binding ruling is the Commissioner’s formal view on how a tax law (like section BG 1 or section GB 1) applies to a particular arrangement. Please see the attached link to the Inland Revenue website: http://www.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/binding-rulings/ . Q. How can there be a dividend when we haven’t received any cash from the restructuring transactions? A. The Commissioner considers that value can be transferred to a shareholder even if they have not received any cash. This will most commonly be the case if a debt has been created in the shareholder’s favour. This is consistent with the High Court’s view in Beacham v CIR. Q. I did a restructure similar to the examples in the Revenue Alert more than five years ago. Will the Commissioner be concerned with that restructure? A. Yes. While the restructure is outside the four year time bar limit on reassessments, the Commissioner can ‘re-open’ assessments more than four years old if income of a particular source or nature has not been disclosed in a tax return or if the return was fraudulent or misleading. Q. Will the Commissioner consider transactions are part of a tax avoidance arrangement if there are commercial reasons for the restructure? A. Maybe. The issue is whether the commercial reasons really explain why the steps in the arrangement were used. General explanations which don’t adequately explain aspects of the restructure will not usually mean that the tax avoidance was merely incidental. For more detail on the Commissioner’s views on tax avoidance, and the merely incidental test in particular, please see her Interpretation Statement on Tax Avoidance at: http://www.ird.govt.nz/resources/1/0/10876180402363a989fbef5d802abedf/is1301.pdf Q. My company has enough imputation credits to fully impute the dividend resulting from applying the avoidance provisions to this type of arrangement. Will the Commissioner reassess the 5% dividend withholding tax (33% less the 28% imputation rate) the company will have to pay if the dividend can be fully imputed? Or will I or the company be liable for the full tax on the dividend? A. The High Court’s view in Beacham v CIR was that the dividend was assessable income and the recipients were subject to tax at 33%. Also relevant is that imputation credits cannot be retrospectively attached to dividends except in very limited cases. While the Commissioner might counteract the tax avoided by seeking full tax on the amount of the dividend even where the company had imputation credits at the time, a voluntary disclosure may be treated more favourably by the Commissioner. Use of money interest and shortfall penalties will also need to be considered. UNCLASSIFIED Q. I have participated in one of these arrangements but received repayments of the debt created over four years. Can I spread the dividend over the four years on a cash basis to match when I received the benefit of the cash funds? A. No. The Commissioner considers that a dividend is assessable to a shareholder at the date of the transaction that transfers value from the company to the shareholder, even if they have not received any cash. This is consistent with the High Court’s view in Beacham v CIR. Q. How many investigations into these types of arrangements is the Commissioner carrying out? A. It is not appropriate for the Commissioner to disclose operational details, however, we can say that there are current investigations underway nationwide and that additional risk reviews will be commenced to address this compliance issue. We are currently assisting a number of customers to rectify the tax effect of these types of arrangements. We can assist if you would like to make a voluntary disclosure or you would like to talk to us about these types of arrangements.

Ngā paearu ōwehenga utu kaimahi ki ngā whakapaunga rangahau me te whakawhanake R&D wage intensity criteria
==========================================================================================================

In order to be eligible you must spend 20% or more of your total labour expenditure on R&D.  
  
The formula to calculate your percentage of R&D labour expenditure is:

total R&D labour expenditure ÷ total labour expenditure x 100

Total R&D labour expenditure is defined as the total of:

*   salary or wages paid to employees for carrying out R&D
*   amounts paid to shareholder-employees as income for carrying out R&D, and
*   the costs of R&D carried out by a contractor excluding GST x 0.66 (the multiplier is intended to exclude profit and non-wage cost components of the contract price).

R&D labour expenditure does not include labour on activities excluded from eligibility.  
  
Total labour expenditure is the total of:

*   salary or wages paid to employees
*   amounts paid to shareholder-employees as income, and
*   the costs of research and development carried out by a contractor excluding GST x 0.66.

The total R&D labour expenditure and total labour expenditure can also include:

*   attributed fringe benefits
*   fringe benefit tax on attributed fringe benefits
*   employer superannuation cash contributions, and
*   [employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT)](/api/glossary/item?id={B1FC84AD-4393-48A3-92EF-2EF29C640520})
    .

You need to include all of the above in your equation for both total labour expenditure and R&D labour expenditure or none at all.  
  
In cases where an employee divides their time between business-as-usual duties for the company, and the R&D project, the total expenditure on the above listed items for each employee should be the same proportion as their total R&D labour expenditure.

Calculating your eligible R&D wage intensity
--------------------------------------------

Find out how to calculate your eligible R&D labour expenditure and how you meet the wage intensity criteria here:

[R&D wage intensity criteria](/research-and-development/loss-tax-credit/eligibility/rd-wage-intensity-criteria)

Example: Eligible expenditure

For the 2015-16 tax year, Company A calculated their total labour expenditure and R&D labour expenditure as: 

**Total labour expenditure (including R&D labour expenditure):**

Contractor R&D excluding GST x 0.66 $49,500

Salary or wages paid $645,000

Amounts paid to shareholder-employees $120,000

Total labour expenditure $814,500

**R&D labour expenditure:**

Contractor R&D excluding GST x 0.66  $49,500

Salary or wages paid $240,000

Amounts paid to shareholder-employees $50,000

Total R&D labour expenditure $339,500

**R&D wage criteria calculation**

$339,500 / $814,500 = 0.4168 x 100 = 41.68%

For the 2015-16 tax year, Company A meets the wage intensity criteria as their R&D expenditure is greater than 20% of their total labour expenditure.

Example: Employee with time split over usual duties and R&D project

Tony receives an annual salary of $49,400 and contributes to KiwiSaver for which the employer pays an employer superannuation cash contribution of 3%. His total labour expenditure for the year will include:

Salary $49,400

Net employer superannuation cash contributions $1,227.20

ESCT $256,80

**Tony's total labour expenditure for the year $50,884**

Tony spends 60% of his time carrying out R&D. The rest of his time is spent carrying out normal duties for the company. In this case, 60% of his salary, net employer superannuation cash contribution and ESCT would be included as the company's R&D labour expenditure as:

$49,400 x 60% = $29,640

$1,227.20 x 60% =  $736.32

$256,80 x 60% =  $154.08

**Tony's total labour expenditure for the year $30,530.40**

Extension of time applications from taxpayers without tax agents (Dec 97) (WITHDRAWN)
=====================================================================================

Withdrawn statement RDC-1 Extension of time applications from taxpayers without tax agents (1997). Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

Introduction
------------

Legislation provides that any taxpayer who is unable to file their income tax return by the due date may apply for an extension of time. This policy outlines how Inland Revenue will consider extension of time applications from taxpayers without tax agents.

Legislation
-----------

The legislative references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. The legislation relating to extensions of time is -

**Section 37(3) Extension of Time  
**"Subject to subsection (5) where any taxpayer satisfies the Commissioner that the taxpayer is unable to furnish the required return by the due date required under this section, the Commissioner, upon application by or on behalf of the taxpayer on or before that date, or within such further period as the Commissioner may allow in any case or class of cases, may extend the time for furnishing the required return to such date as the Commissioner thinks proper in the circumstances."

**Section 37(5) Final Dates**  
"For the purposes of subsections (3) and (4), -

1.  Where the return required to be furnished by any taxpayer is a return for a year ended on 31 March, the time for furnishing that return shall not be extended or further extended to a time later than the 31 March that immediately succeeds that 31 March:
2.  Where the return required to be furnished by any taxpayer is, by consent of the Commissioner under section 38, a return for a year ending with the date of the annual balance of the accounts of the taxpayer, the time for furnishing that return shall -
    1.  Where that date is between 30 September and the next succeeding 31 March, not be extended or further extended to a time later than the 31 March next succeeding the 31 March that immediately succeeds that date:
    2.  Where that date is between 31 March and the next succeeding 1 October, not be extended or further extended to a time later than the 31 March that immediately succeeds that date."

**Section 38 (2) Balance dates up to 30 September**  
"For the purposes of this section and section 39, 30 September in any year shall be deemed to be nearer to the last preceding 31 March than to the next succeeding 31 March."

Comments on the Legislation
---------------------------

These sections of the legislation clearly provide that **any** taxpayer may apply (verbally or in writing) for an extension of time for their annual income tax return, provided they satisfy the Commissioner that they are unable to furnish the return by the due date.

The period of the extension cannot be extended beyond the following 31 March. If a taxpayer has a balance date of 31 March, the date for filing an income tax return may not be extended beyond the following 31 March. For example, an IR 3 income tax return for the year ended 31 March 1997 is due on 7 July 1997. The time for filing this return can not be extended beyond 31 March 1998.

Policy Issues
-------------

The legislation clearly provides that any taxpayer may apply for an extension of time for their income tax return. To ensure all taxpayers who are not represented by a tax agent are treated fairly, applications for an extension of time will be considered on a case by case basis.

**Application verbally or in writing**  
The legislation has recently been changed to allow for an application to be made verbally as well as in writing. However taxpayers should ensure that they are requesting “an extension of time arrangement” for clarity.

**Reasons for requesting an extension**  
The following are _examples_ of reasons that Inland Revenue considers appropriate for extending the filing date:

*   Taxpayer/entity is unable to obtain the necessary information to file the return e.g., awaiting IR 12/13s from an employer
*   Taxpayer has been overseas and time is needed to prepare a return (dependent on dates of leaving and returning)
*   Ill health, hospitalisation or injury of the taxpayer or taxpayer's family member (partner or dependant)
*   Awaiting the finalisation of accounts for a related taxpayer/entity with a different balance date.

**Return filing history**  
Inland Revenue will also take the taxpayer's return filing history into account. If the previous two years' returns have not been filed then it is unlikely that an extension of time will be granted for the current year. However, we will also consider whether the current year's reason for requesting an extension of time could apply to the previous years' returns.

**Period of the extension**  
The maximum period for an extension of time for the current year's income tax return is to 31 March. However, most individuals would probably only require an extension for a few weeks or months.

**Confirmation - extension of time granted or declined**  
Inland Revenue will send the taxpayer a letter confirming the granting or declining of the extension of time arrangement, and update details on our computer system.

**Timing**  
The legislation states that an application should be made on or before the due date for filing. However, there is room for discretion. Inland Revenue will consider extension of time requests for 1998 income tax returns after the due date to encourage taxpayers to seek a formal arrangement with us. For 1999 and future years, approval after the due date will be on a case by case basis, depending on the reasons given.

If a late filing penalty has been imposed before the approval of an extension of time arrangement the penalty _will not be cancelled_. The penalty may be remitted in certain circumstances; once the return has been filed the taxpayer will then be able to apply for a remission of the late filing penalty. (The same applies to taxpayers who become a client of a tax agent after the late filing penalty has been imposed.) The criteria for remission of the late filing penalty in this instance are outlined in section 183A.

If a default assessment has been imposed before the approval of an extension of time arrangement the default assessment will be reversed. A new default assessment will be scheduled for action after the extension of time has expired.

Summary
-------

*   Applications for an extension of time will be considered from those taxpayers/entities who are not represented by a tax agent.
*   Applications can be in writing or verbal.
*   Examples of granting reasons for an extension of time include:
    *   ill health, hospitalisation or injury of the taxpayer and/or a taxpayer's close family member
    *   awaiting information/lost records, eg IR 12/13 details from an employer
    *   ill awaiting finalisation of a related taxpayer/entity with a different balance date.
*   The period given for an extension will be set at the discretion of the officer reviewing the case. When agreeing to an extension of time Inland Revenue will give reasonable regard to the facts of the case. The maximum period is from the due date of the return until the following 31 March.
*   A letter confirming the extension of time arrangement will be issued to each applicant.

Remission of penalties and interest (Dec 97) (WITHDRAWN)
========================================================

Withdrawn statement SPS RDC-2 Remission of penalties and interest. Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

Introduction
------------

Legislation introduced in 1997 consolidates the rules for remissions. The changes apply to all taxes and duties, but not to student loan and child support repayments.

The objective of imposing a penalty is to maximise voluntary compliance. Taxpayers who have complied see that non-complying taxpayers are penalised. Non-complying taxpayers are provided with an incentive to comply in the future. The penalty regime is therefore principally about fairness.

When considering these remission provisions the Commissioner considers it important to have in mind fair treatment for both the taxpayer requesting the remission as well as all other taxpayers. A lenient remission policy penalises complying taxpayers and may ultimately affect voluntary compliance. However, allowing an unfair penalty to stand will also impact on voluntary compliance. The issues are complex and this practice statement will assist the decision making process.

This standard practice statement sets out the relevant legislation, practical issues and the Commissioner's policy.

Application dates
-----------------

This policy applies to:

*   remission requests received before 23 September 1997 and the penalty / interest was charged after 1 April 1997
*   remission requests received on or after 23 September 1997 for all penalties / interest, other than those charged in relation to ACC employer and earner premiums.
*   remission requests received for ACC employer and earner premiums for periods starting on or after 1 April 1997.

Strict criteria must now be met
-------------------------------

All applications must be made in writing. There are two main grounds for remission:

*   Remission may occur if an event or circumstance provides the taxpayer with reasonable justification for not meeting their obligations.
*   Remission may occur if it is consistent with the collection of highest net revenue over time. Interest remissions can only be considered under this ground.

Shortfall penalties can't be remitted. The taxpayer's circumstances will have already been taken into account when considering the imposition of the penalty.

All legislative references in this statement are to the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Remission for reasonable cause
------------------------------

**_(Legislation - Section 183A)_**

> "(1) The Commissioner may remit a late filing penalty or late payment penalty or any imputation penalty tax imposed under section 140 b or any dividend withholding payment penalty tax imposed under section 140 c if -
> 
> 1.  The Commissioner is satisfied that the late filing or late payment was caused by an event or circumstance beyond the control of the taxpayer that provides the taxpayer with a reasonable justification or excuse for not providing the tax return or paying the tax on time; and
> 2.  The taxpayer files the required tax return or pays the unpaid tax as soon as practicable.
> 
> (2) Without limiting the Commissioner's discretion under subsection (1), an event or circumstance may include -
> 
> 1.  an accident or a disaster; or
> 2.  illness or emotional or mental distress.
> 
> (3) An event or circumstance does not include -
> 
> 1.  An act or omission of an agent of a taxpayer, unless the Commissioner is satisfied that the act or omission was caused by an event or circumstance beyond the control of the agent -
>     1.  That could not have been anticipated; and
>     2.  The effect of which could not have been avoided by compliance with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct; or
> 2.  A taxpayer's financial position."

**_Practical issues_**

Remissions under this section apply to late filing penalty, late payment penalty or any imputation penalty (imposed under section 140B) or any dividend withholding payment penalty tax.

*   Application can be made under Section 183A, regardless of the Act under which the penalty was imposed (except for penalties on student loan and child support repayments).
*   The request must be in writing and the taxpayer may be required to produce relevant information (Section 183H). It is envisaged that Inland Revenue would request additional information only in circumstances when there is insufficient information available in the original application and there is difficulty deciding if the case meets the "reasonable cause" criteria.
*   There is no right to dispute the Commissioner's decision.

**_Policy_**

Remission will only occur if the taxpayer is able to provide reasonable justification for the failure.

The term "reasonable" must be applied to the event or circumstance. This is an objective test, which requires that it be reasonable for an average person in the taxpayer's position not to have complied.

_Application of Policy_

In deciding whether remission is appropriate the Commissioner will consider:

1.  Has the penalty been correctly imposed?
2.  Has the taxpayer paid the tax (or filed the return) in question?
3.  Why did the taxpayer pay (or file) late?
4.  Was the failure caused by an event or circumstance that was -
    
    *   an accident or a disaster?
    *   illness or emotional or mental distress?
    
    When considering the above-mentioned circumstances or events the Commissioner will use the following definitions:
    *   accident - an event that is without apparent cause or unexpected
    *   disaster - sudden or great misfortune or a calamity
    *   illness - state of being ill
    *   emotional distress - disturbance of the mind, mental sensation or state
    *   mental distress - of the mind, done by the mind, affected with mental disorder.
5.  Has this reason been used before? Were measures put in place to ensure that this situation does not recur in the future (where appropriate)?
6.  Was the tax paid or return filed as soon as "practicable" (as soon as it can be done, and as soon as is feasible and realistic)? This will depend on each case, specifically was the default corrected as soon as possible after the event or circumstance passed?
7.  Was the failure an act or omission of the taxpayer's agent? Did an event or circumstance beyond the control of the agent cause it? Could the default have been avoided by compliance with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct?
8.  Any other information that the Commissioner considers relevant in assessing the application.

**_Examples_**

**_Emotional or Mental Distress_**

Taxpayer's return was due on 7 July. The return was near completion and the taxpayer's previous compliance history was exemplary. However, leading up to the due date his daughter became seriously ill and was hospitalised. Her condition steadily deteriorated and the family spent a great deal of time at the hospital where she was in intensive care until the first week in September.

During this time a reminder notice had been issued advising the taxpayer that a late filing penalty would be imposed if his current year's income tax return was not filed within 30 days. He ignored the notice but filed the overdue return in the middle of October along with documentation verifying his daughter's illness/hospitalisation after the penalty had been imposed.

In these circumstances, the taxpayer filed the return three months after the due date, but given the "circumstances and events" this would be considered a "practicable" time frame.

**_Circumstance Beyond Agent's Control_**

An agent was entrusted to pay a client's income tax by the due date of 7 February, as the taxpayer would be overseas at the due date. The cheque was made out for the correct amount, signed and post-dated. The cheque was given to the agent and placed in the office safe. The night before 7 February the office was burgled and the safe blown up – the safe's contents were destroyed. The client's agent produced supporting documentation. This is considered to be an event beyond the agent's control.

Remission consistent with collection of highest net revenue over time
---------------------------------------------------------------------

**_Legislation - Section 183D_**

> "(1) The Commissioner may remit -
> 
> 1.  A late filing penalty; and
> 2.  A late payment penalty; and
> 3.  Interest under Part VII -  
>       
>     payable by a taxpayer if the Commissioner is satisfied that the remission is consistent with the Commissioner's duty to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law.
> 
> (2) In the application of this section, the Commissioner must have regard to the importance of the late payment penalty, the late filing penalty and interest under Part VII in promoting compliance especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers with the Inland Revenue Acts.
> 
> (3) The Commissioner must not consider a taxpayer's financial position when applying this section."

**_Practical issues_**

*   Remissions under this section apply to late filing penalty, late payment penalty or any imputation penalty (imposed under section 140B) or any dividend withholding payment penalty tax and interest payable under Part VII. There is no requirement to remit all three (late filing penalty, late payment penalty, interest). Each case will be considered on its merits.
*   Application can be made under Section 183D, regardless of the Act under which the penalty was imposed (except for penalties on student loan and child support repayments).
*   The request must be in writing and the taxpayer may be required to produce relevant information (Section 183H). It is envisaged that Inland Revenue will request additional information only in circumstances when there is insufficient information in the original application and the Commissioner needs to substantiate the assertion made by the customer to be able to make an informed decision.
*   There is no right to dispute the Commissioner's decision.

**_Policy_**

The Commissioner is required by law to collect over time as much revenue as possible in a timely manner, but with underlying emphasis on voluntary compliance by all taxpayers. The commissioner recognises that pursuing the collection of penalties in some circumstances will not meet his legal duty. Those circumstances are where a penalty is charged because of:

*   a genuine error
*   a "one-off" situation
*   wrong advice given by an officer of Inland Revenue which has directly resulted in the failure.

Interest will only be remitted if an Inland Revenue officer has given incorrect advice to the taxpayer, and that advice has directly resulted in the failure. Interest will not be remitted when the cheque has gone astray in the post.

Section 183D expressly prevents a taxpayer's financial circumstances being taken into account. The hardship provisions deal with such situations.

Remissions under section 183D apply to recent events. It was not intended that this section be used to remit penalties remaining from longstanding arrears when the taxpayer has financial difficulties and eventually can only pay the core tax or the core tax plus minimal penalties. These cases are dealt with under the hardship provisions.

**_Application of Policy_**

In deciding whether remission is appropriate the Commissioner will consider:

1.  Has the penalty or interest been correctly imposed?
2.  Has the taxpayer paid the tax (or filed the return) in question?
3.  Why did the taxpayer pay (or file) late?
4.  Was the failure because of a genuine oversight or a one-off situation? Remitting a penalty for a "reliable" taxpayer who failed to comply due to a genuine oversight or "one-off" situation recognises that penalising a compliant taxpayer for a small failure is counter-productive and may actually reduce voluntary compliance.  
      
    Requests for remission because of a genuine oversight or a one-off situation apply to penalties only. The Commissioner will not remit interest in these cases as he considers interest is compensation to the Revenue for the loss of funds on timely deposit.  
      
    Interest charged because of a default by a third party does not fall into this category. In this situation the Commissioner considers the taxpayer should look to the third party for compensation.
5.  Has Inland Revenue given incorrect advice to the taxpayer, which has resulted in the failure? If an officer(s) of Inland Revenue has given the wrong advice, the imposition of the penalty may adversely affect future compliance by the taxpayer or other taxpayers. This is due to the adverse impact that imposing a penalty would have on a taxpayer's perceptions of the integrity of the system eg where the taxpayer has been given the incorrect date, or amount, for payment and can substantiate to Inland Revenue's satisfaction that they were given the incorrect advice. The tax must be paid in full as soon as the error is established.  
      
    Section 183D is the only provision under which interest can be remitted. Interest will only be remitted if Inland Revenue has given a taxpayer incorrect advice which caused a return or payment to be made late and the taxpayer can substantiate to Inland Revenue's satisfaction that they were given the incorrect advice. The tax must be paid as soon as the error is established.
6.  Any other information that the Commissioner considers relevant in assessing the application.

**_Examples_**

The following are all examples where the penalty would be remitted.

**_Wrong advice_**

A small business person registered for GST and was a six-monthly payer. However as business improved the person elected to file GST returns two-monthly. The person sought the advice from the nearest Inland Revenue office but unfortunately confusion arose over the date the next return was due to be filed, resulting in the imposition of a late payment penalty.

**_One-off situation_**

An employer has a computer system set up for PAYE/wage records. A virus is detected on the 19th day of the month when the IR 66N was due to be filed and paid on the 20th. The software developer was called but had not fixed the problem until the 21st when the monthly data was extracted and the IR 66N completed and forwarded to Inland Revenue with payment. The late payment penalty had been imposed and a request was made for remission.

**_Genuine Oversight_**

A new office person had been hired by an employer as a wages clerk. The new person's duties included preparing the wages, maintaining the wage records and preparing the end of year reconciliation.

The new person arrived in early March and found the wage records in a terrible mess. The person completed and balanced the reconciliation and forwarded it to Inland Revenue by 20 April, and had intended to enclose the monthly PAYE for March in the same envelope. Unfortunately the IR 66N and the cheque were caught up in some papers and were not discovered until 22 March. The IR 66N and cheque were promptly delivered to the nearest Inland Revenue office with supporting documentation and an accompanying letter requesting remission.

**_Interest_**

A taxpayer is advised of an incorrect date for PAYE and incurs interest and a late payment penalty. As the late payment penalty was caused by Inland Revenue error; both interest and the late payment penalty would be remitted. However the taxpayer would be expected to provide evidence to support the contention that the incorrect information was given by Inland Revenue.

Automatic cancellation/remission
--------------------------------

There are two provisions for automatic cancellation of penalties and remission of interest:

1.  Section 183B - Cancellation of late payment penalties under instalment arrangement. Broadly, if a taxpayer meets all obligations under an instalment arrangement all incremental penalties incurred after the date that the instalment arrangement is entered into are cancelled at the successful completion of the instalment arrangement.
2.  Section 183E - Remission of interest if unpaid tax remitted. Where the underlying tax is remitted the interest is also remitted.

The Commissioner will also reverse interest in the very unlikely situation when a retrospective change to legislation caused the position taken by a taxpayer to become incorrect after it was taken. In this situation a new due date for payment would be made, and the interest would be cancelled.

Difference between remission, cancellation and reversal
-------------------------------------------------------

**Remission:** occurs when the tax, penalty or interest is correctly imposed at the time but a decision has been made to relieve the taxpayer of the liability to pay.

**Cancellation:** occurs when the tax, penalty or interest was correctly imposed at the time but a provision of the legislation relieves the taxpayer from the obligation to pay, such as the successful completion of an instalment arrangement.

**Reversal:** the tax, penalty or interest should not have been charged in the first place.

Summary
-------

1.  Penalties exist to provide fairness to the tax system.
2.  Remission provisions are needed to allow the Commissioner to accommodate circumstances in which a penalty is not appropriate. Because penalties encourage customers to feel that the tax system is fair, the procedures used in handling cases by Inland Revenue should cause customers to feel that they have been justly treated, regardless of the outcome. Inland Revenue will weigh the particular circumstances that exist in each individual case against policy. The circumstances of the taxpayer will be taken into account.
3.  The legislation will be applied in a manner that is not only fair to compliant taxpayers but is seen to be fair. Inland Revenue recognises that penalising a compliant taxpayer for a small failure is counterproductive and may actually reduce voluntary compliance.
4.  Application for remission must be made in writing.
5.  Late payment penalty and late filing penalty will be remitted if the Commissioner is satisfied that the failure has been caused by:
    *   an event or circumstance that provides reasonable justification for the omission.
    *   genuine oversight and confusion or a one off situation.
    *   incorrect advice given by Inland Revenue.
6.  Interest will be remitted only if Inland Revenue has given a taxpayer incorrect advice which has directly caused a return or payment to be made late, and the taxpayer can substantiate to Inland Revenue's satisfaction that they were given the incorrect advice.
7.  Remission applications will be considered only when the return and tax have been paid.
8.  The legislation does not permit a remission to be granted under Section 183A or 183D for financial reasons.

Payment of debt by compulsory deductions from bank accounts (Aug 99) (WITHDRAWN)
================================================================================

Withdrawn statement SPS RDC-3.1 Payment of debt by compulsory deductions from bank accounts. Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

Introduction
------------

This Standard Practice Statement outlines Inland Revenue's practice on the use of Notices to Deduct.  This statement covers:

*   monitoring of bank accounts
*   overdraft facilities
*   investments
*   joint bank accounts
*   interest
*   prosecution

This Standard Practice Statement has been updated to include new legislation.

Application date
----------------

This Standard Practice Statement replaces Standard Practice Statement RDC 3, published in TIB Vol Ten No.10 (October 1998).  This amended Standard Practice Statement applies to all deduction notices issued on or after 1 September 1999.

Legislation
-----------

Section 157 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to issue a Notice requiring compulsory deductions to be made from amounts that are, or become payable by any person to a defaulting taxpayer.  The Notice may require deductions to be made by way of a lump sum or instalments.  The Notice may also require that daily interest be deducted, from the date of the written notice, until the amount in default has been deducted.

**_Other Legislation_**  
The following legislation is similar in content to section 157 of the Tax Administration Act 1994:

*   section 43 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985
*   section 154 of the Child Support Act 1991
*   section 46 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992
*   section 12L of the Gaming Duties Act 1971
*   section 46 of the Accident Compensation Act 1982
*   section 130 of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992
*   section 313 of the Accident Insurance Act 1998.

Monitoring of bank accounts
---------------------------

A Notice to Deduct may require deduction from amounts held on the date of the Notice or from amounts deposited after the date of the Notice.  However Inland Revenue and the Bankers' Association have agreed that banks will generally not be required to monitor accounts on a daily basis.

If there is an exceptional case where Inland Revenue considers daily monitoring to be necessary, Inland Revenue will ask the bank to monitor the account for a specific period.  Inland Revenue's requirements will be discussed with the bank at the time.  Unless there are exceptional circumstances, the maximum period a bank will be required to monitor an account is ten working days.

**_Example_**  
The taxpayer has a large debt, which has been outstanding for some time.  Inland Revenue is aware that the taxpayer is expecting to receive funds from an overseas source.  It is known that payment of the funds, to the bank, will be made in the first week of the month, but the exact day of payment is not known.  Inland Revenue will consult with the bank concerned and request that the account be monitored for the first week of that month.

Overdraft facilities
--------------------

Inland Revenue cannot, by requiring a deduction to be made from a bank account, put a taxpayer into, or further into overdraft.

If Inland Revenue issues a Notice to Deduct for an account which is in credit and the taxpayer attempts to evade it by transferring funds to an account in overdraft, then the Notice will take priority.

Investments
-----------

Compulsory deductions may be made from money that is held in a term investment before the date that the investment is due to mature.  This may result in a reduced rate of interest on the investment.

Joint bank accounts
-------------------

**_General information_**  
Previously the Commissioner issued Notices to Deduct for joint accounts if the signatory was "either or".

In _ANZ Banking Group (New Zealand) Limited v CIR_ (1998) 18 NZTC 13,643 the High Court held the Commissioner could not issue a Notice to Deduct to obtain funds from a joint account in respect of the income tax debt owed by one of the joint bank account holders, because there was no authority to do so.

Inland Revenue will not issue Notices to Deduct for joint accounts, in respect of a debt owed by only one of the account holders except where the Commissioner has specific authority (eg for family assistance and child support).

**_Family assistance debts_**  
When an overpayment for family assistance has occurred the person who received the overpayment (the recipient) and their partner or spouse (if they were the partner or spouse throughout the income year to which the overpayment relates) are jointly and severally liable for the overpayment (section KD 4(4) Income Tax Act 1994).  The Commissioner is therefore able to issue a Notice to Deduct for an account in the name of the partner or spouse or for a joint account in the name of the recipient and the partner or spouse.

**_Child support debts_**  
The Child Support Act 1991 allows the Commissioner to require deductions from money payable to liable parents for a child support debt.  Section 155 of the Act extends this to money held in joint accounts in the name of the liable parent and one or more other persons, where the liable parent can draw from that account without the signature of the other person.

Interest
--------

A Notice to Deduct may require deductions to be made to cover daily interest.  The interest starts on the date of the Notice to Deduct and ends on the day on which the amount required to be deducted, has been deducted.

Prosecution
-----------

If a bank fails to make the required deductions and there was an amount payable, or an amount that became payable, Inland Revenue has the power to prosecute for not complying with the terms of the deduction notice.

This Standard Practice Statement was signed by me on 9th August 1999.

Arrangements for payment of debt (Apr 01) (WITHDRAWN)
=====================================================

Withdrawn RDC-6.1 Arrangements for payment of debt (Apr 01). Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

Introduction
------------

This Standard Practice Statement states the Commissioner's practice on providing relief by way of an arrangement when taxpayers are in debt with Inland Revenue. It does not relate to arrangements for payment of child support arrears.

The legislation that allows the Commissioner to enter into arrangements for payment of tax debt was amended on 10 October 2000 to:

*   dispense with the requirement that applications for arrangements be made in writing;
*   extend the relief provisions to include all taxes and duties (limited exceptions apply);
*   remove the requirement to obtain approval from the minister of finance where the amount of relief sought exceeds $50,000.

This Standard Practice Statement refers in part to _Tax Information Bulletin Volume Six, No 14 (June 1995)_, taxpayers in financial difficulties. The TIB should be read as if updated for the legislation changes described above.

Application
-----------

This Standard Practice Statement replaces Standard Practice Statement RDC 6 originally published in _Tax Information Bulletin Volume Twelve, No 3 (March 2000)_. This amended Standard Practice Statement applies to applications for relief by way of arrangement made on or after 1 April 2001.

Summary
-------

Section 177 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 specifically allows for relief by way of arrangement for taxpayers who are, or are likely to become liable for payment of tax.

An arrangement can be for one lump sum payment or 2 or more payments (instalment arrangement).

Applications for relief by way of arrangement may be made orally or in writing.

The taxpayer must be in financial difficulties at the time of application. The Commissioner will require relevant financial information to be provided in support of the application.

When considering an application, section 177 requires Inland Revenue to ensure that the relief granted will maximise net present value for tax debts, or will lead to the collection of highest net revenue over time for Student Loan repayment obligation debts.

There is no legislative time limit for an arrangement. However, arrangements will generally be over the shortest period of time in order to maximise the net present value of any recovery.

Penalties and interest will continue to accrue during the term of an arrangement. However, if a taxpayer adheres to the conditions of an arrangement, the penalties will be cancelled from the date the arrangement was entered into. Interest cannot be cancelled and will remain payable.

When Inland Revenue accepts an arrangement, Inland Revenue will issue written confirmation of the arrangement that will set out the taxpayer's obligations and Inland Revenue's obligations.

Legislation
-----------

All legislative references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) unless otherwise stated.

Section 177 provides:

177.  Discretion to grant relief in cases of financial hardship

1.  A taxpayer, or a person on a taxpayer's behalf, may apply for relief if the taxpayer -
    1.  Is, or is likely to become, liable for payment of tax; and
    2.  Is at the time of applying, in financial difficulties.
2.  An application for relief by way of remission must be in writing.
3.  If subsection (1) applies, the Commissioner may, if the Commissioner considers it necessary or desirable to do so to maximise the net present value, calculated on the date of the application, of recovery or likely recovery from the taxpayer of the tax, or part of the tax, grant relief to the taxpayer by—
    1.  Remitting all or part of the tax; or
    2.  Entering into an arrangement with the taxpayer for the payment of all or part of the tax in one or more payments; or
    3.  Applying both paragraphs (a) and (b).
4.  The Commissioner may, if the Commissioner thinks fit, issue an amended assessment to give effect to any action taken under subsection (3).
5.  The Commissioner may cancel all or part of the relief granted under this section if—
    1.  The Commissioner has reason to believe that the information provided by the taxpayer to enable the Commissioner to apply this section is misleading in any respect such that the Commissioner considers that it was inappropriate for all or part of the relief to have been granted; or
    2.  The Commissioner receives further information relating to the taxpayer's affairs, as they were on the date on which relief was granted, such that the Commissioner considers that it was inappropriate for all or part of the relief to have been granted.
6.  If subsection (5) applies, the taxpayer is liable for the payment of the tax as if relief had never been granted.
7.  A Commissioner's decision to grant or cancel relief may not be objected to or challenged

Other relevant legislation is contained in:

*   section 3 TAA - definition of "tax";
*   section 6A TAA - the care and management of taxes;
*   section 156 TAA - the mode of recovery of unpaid tax;
*   section 183B TAA - cancellation of late payment penalties under instalment arrangement.

Standard Practice
-----------------

**Application for relief by way of arrangement need not be in writing**

Inland Revenue is able to enter into arrangements for payment of tax debt over the telephone or following written application. In doing so, it must be established that the taxpayer is in financial difficulties and that the proposed arrangement maximises net present value.

In all cases it will be necessary to obtain financial information, either over the telephone or in writing, to enable these decisions to be made. In some cases, it will be necessary for Inland Revenue to obtain written financial information to verify or further support the information already supplied by the taxpayer.

A taxpayer may start making voluntary payments immediately, before an arrangement has been agreed to (refer to IR262 _Let us help you pay your bill_). However, any cancellation of penalties only applies from the date the arrangement is agreed to (refer below "Entering into an arrangement").

**Amount that is, or is likely to become, liable for payment**

A taxpayer may make application for an arrangement for any amount that is in arrears, or any amount that will become due for payment.

In practical terms, a taxpayer making payments towards a tax debt before that amount is due, does not need to enter into an arrangement unless the amount owing will not be paid prior to the due date (refer to IR 262 _Let us help you pay your bill_ ).

If a taxpayer determines that an amount will be outstanding after the due date, then that taxpayer should apply to Inland Revenue prior to the due date for a pre-emptive arrangement to receive the full benefits of the cancellation provisions (refer to "Cancellation of penalties" below for more information).

**Definition of "tax"**

Section 177 of the Tax Administration Act allows for relief in cases of financial hardship if the taxpayer is, or is likely to become liable for payment of tax. Tax is defined in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act but does not include:

*   financial support as defined in the Child Support Act 1991;
*   a student loan repayment obligation.

"Tax" also includes use of money interest and civil penalties (late payment, late filing, shortfall and non-electronic filing penalties).

**Financial difficulties at the time of application**

Section 177 provides for relief for taxpayers who are in financial difficulties at the time of application. Inland Revenue considers "financial difficulties" arise when a taxpayer's financial position is such that debts cannot be paid on time, and either:

*   there is a real prospect that creditors will be able to have the taxpayer put into liquidation, or adjudicated bankrupt; or
*   the taxpayer's debts are a substantial limitation in carrying out normal income producing activities.

For further discussion on 'financial difficulties' refer to _Tax Information Bulletin Volume Six, No 14 (June 1995)_.

In order for Inland Revenue to determine if a taxpayer is in financial difficulty, Inland Revenue will request details of the taxpayer's financial position, which would normally include details of income and expenditure, assets and liabilities. It may be necessary for Inland Revenue to obtain this information in writing.

On reviewing the information provided, and depending on the amount of debt and/or the length of time of the proposed arrangement, Inland Revenue may request a more detailed breakdown or further information. For example, asset valuations, profit and loss statements, balance sheets, lists of debtors and creditors.

If a taxpayer has the ability to realise assets (eg the ability to refinance, sell property, or surrender insurance policies) to pay the debt, then an arrangement may not be appropriate. However, the size of the debt and the length of time of the proposed arrangement will be taken into account by Inland Revenue when considering an application for an arrangement.

In addition, Inland Revenue will recognise a spouse's "protected interest" in a matrimonial home or any rights protected by the _Joint Family Homes Act 1964._

Where the debt is only a few hundred dollars and will be paid within a short period of time, Inland Revenue would not expect property, such as a house to be sold before accepting an instalment arrangement.

**Net present value**

When considering an application for an arrangement Inland Revenue will consider the net present value of the proposed payments.

The net present value calculation recognises the time value of money — interest, as well as the probability of payment — risk. The proposed payments are discounted for the time value of money and for the likelihood of receiving the money. Inland Revenue needs to determine the amount, date, and probability of each payment and apply an appropriate discount rate. The discount rate is calculated from published Government stock rates. Inland Revenue uses a calculation that involves:

*   the amount of payment, multiplied by
*   the probability of payment (for risk), divided by
*   the discount factor appropriate to the term (for interest).

In order to ensure the net present value of a recovery is maximised, the proposal then needs to be compared to the net present value of other viable options. To achieve this Inland Revenue will compare the net present value of an arrangement against the net present value of other actions ie deferred collection or legal.

Where a proposed arrangement is for an amount less than $10,000 and for less than 12 months duration the Commissioner considers net present value to be maximised when the following conditions are met:

*   the proposed arrangement would lead to a monetary return to Inland Revenue;
*   write-off or remission would produce less return than the proposed arrangement;
*   legal proceedings would produce less return than the proposed arrangement over the same duration;
*   Inland Revenue would incur costs by taking legal proceedings.

Where the debt is greater than $10,000 or the proposed arrangement is for longer than 12 months, then a net present value calculation will be required if there are other viable options. A detailed explanation (and examples) of the net present value calculation can be found in _Tax Information Bulletin Volume Six, No 14 (June 1995)_ which sets out Inland Revenue's practice for hardship relief applications.

**Other considerations**

When considering a request for an arrangement, Inland Revenue will also take into account the following factors:

*   whether the proposal is realistic;
*   the taxpayer's compliance history;
*   the likelihood of future compliance;
*   whether the taxpayer previously had and adhered to an arrangement;
*   whether the taxpayer has filed all required returns;
*   protection of the integrity of the tax system (if a taxpayer is continuing in business, or has a continuing income stream which is not subject to source deductions, then future compliance must also be considered).

### Entering into an arrangement

**Date arrangement is entered into**

The date the arrangement is "entered into" is taken into account when cancelling penalties. Inland Revenue considers two possible dates that can be used are:

*   the date the application is received (telephone call or letter); or
*   the date that additional information is received in support of the application.

If an application is incomplete Inland Revenue will require any additional information to be received by a set date. Therefore a date will need to be agreed to by Inland Revenue and the taxpayer, otherwise for practical purposes, the arrangement will start on the date that the complete information is received.

**Length of arrangement**

There is no legislative time limit for an arrangement. However, the Commissioner considers it necessary and desirable, in order to maximise the net present value of any recovery, that arrangements are over a shorter period of time, rather than a longer period of time. This is because the longer the period of time the greater the risk of non-payment and the greater the loss for time value of money.

**One or more payments**

Relief by way of an arrangement can be by one lump sum payment or payment by instalments. Instalments need not be at regular time intervals or of regular amounts however this may be preferable for ease of payment.

**Cancellation of relief**

Section 177 (5) provides for relief to be cancelled if:

*   information provided by the taxpayer is misleading;
*   Inland Revenue receives further information relating to the taxpayers affairs, as they were on the date on which relief was granted; and
*   the Commissioner considers it was inappropriate in light of the information received to have granted relief.

By way of examples:

*   if a taxpayer advises they were paying rent but in fact they were paying a mortgage on their own home, and had equity in that home, it may not have been appropriate for the Commissioner to have granted relief;
*   where a taxpayer has a vested right to income or assets of a trust, and this was not disclosed to the Commissioner.

**No right of objection or challenge**

There is no statutory right to challenge or object to any decision of the Commissioner to grant or cancel relief under section 177(3) or 177(5).

However if a taxpayer does not agree with the Commissioner's decision not to grant relief, the taxpayer has other review options open to them eg a request for review can be initially made to the Inland Revenue officer involved or their reporting officer, or to the Office of the Ombudsmen. Judicial review may also be an available option.

**Arrangements for Student Loan repayment obligations**

The definition of tax in section 3 TAA specifically excludes student loan repayment obligations. Therefore Inland Revenue cannot enter into arrangements with taxpayers for repayment of student loan repayment obligations under section 177 TAA.

Inland Revenue considers that when the general recovery provisions, as provided for in section 156 TAA are exercised in conjunction with the Commissioner's discretion under section 6A, the Commissioner is allowed to enter into arrangements for student loan debt, if in the circumstances, there is a reasonable basis for believing that such steps will result in the collection of the highest net revenue over time, having regard to the factors listed in section 6A(3).

To ensure consistency, it is appropriate to have substantially the same criteria and processes for all arrangements. Therefore the criteria the Commissioner will use for arrangements for outstanding student loan repayment obligations are:

*   any application for relief by way of arrangement may be made orally or in writing;
*   an application for relief must be for an amount that is, or is likely to become, liable for payment;
*   the taxpayer must be in financial difficulties at the time of application;
*   an arrangement must result in the collection of highest net revenue over time;
*   an arrangement can be for one lump sum payment or two or more instalments.

**Collection of highest net revenue over time**

The "collection of highest net revenue over time" is not defined in the Tax Acts and has yet to be absolutely defined by the Courts. However, it would appear to be more than just collecting "as much as possible in as short a time as possible"; consideration also needs to be given to the continuing collection of revenue over a longer period of time.

For example, a taxpayer may be able to repay a student loan debt by instalment over nine months by continuing in business, and by continuing in business will be able to pay future taxes on time.

However, in a similar example, a taxpayer may be able to repay a student loan debt by instalment over nine months by continuing in business, but the future prospects of that business show that the taxpayer will not be able to meet future taxes on time. This creates the risk of future debt arising. In this instance, some other form of action (such as issuing legal proceedings) may result in the collection of highest net revenue over time.

When considering the collection of highest net revenue Inland Revenue will take into account the factors listed under "Other Considerations"

### All arrangements

**Cancellation of penalties**

If an arrangement has been complied with, section 183B TAA allows the Commissioner to:

*   reduce the first late payment penalty by 60% if the arrangement was agreed to before the due date; and
*   cancel any late payment penalties incurred on the debt during the term of the arrangement.

Cancellation applies where a debt has been paid by way of one or more payments under an arrangement with the Commissioner.

As cancellation of penalties only applies if a taxpayer has complied with the taxpayer's obligations under the arrangement, the penalties are cancelled at the end of the arrangement. Penalties will continue to be shown on _Statements of account_ until the end of the arrangement.

Interest will continue to accrue and be payable on the debt, throughout the term of the arrangement, as provided by legislation.

Pursuant to section 6A TAA Inland Revenue will also cancel penalties applicable to arrangements for payment of student loan repayment obligations.

**Conditions**

Any arrangement entered into with Inland Revenue will be subject to certain conditions including:

*   all current taxes must be paid, and returns filed, by the due date;
*   termination of the arrangement if the terms are not adhered to without prior agreement;
*   interest will be charged and payable up to the date of payment in full (taxpayers should contact Inland Revenue for the final instalment amount);
*   any credits that arise in the taxpayer's account will be offset against the amount owed;
*   late payment penalties incurred during the course of an instalment arrangement will be cancelled, providing all payments are made on time

**Adhering to the arrangement**

If a taxpayer cannot meet one of the payments by the agreed date, they should contact Inland Revenue to advise the reason that the payment will not be made on time. Any late payment is a breach of the arrangement and Inland Revenue may cancel the arrangement, depending on the reason for the late payment and the number of payments missed.

**Reviewing arrangements**

Where arrangements are over a long period of time, eg over 12 months, Inland Revenue considers it appropriate to review the arrangement and the taxpayer's circumstances. Such a review will consider whether the arrangement is still appropriate to the taxpayer's financial circumstances and may therefore require updated financial information from the taxpayer.

#### Making the payments

Inland Revenue prefers that taxpayers pay their instalment arrangement on a regular basis by automatic payment from their bank account. Another option is to make payments to any WestpacTrust branch with cash or by cheque, or to send cheques to Inland Revenue by the agreed dates.

**Confirmation**

Inland Revenue will issue confirmation of an arrangement in writing. This will include the terms and conditions and the commencement date of the arrangement. If the taxpayer disagrees with any of the terms and conditions they should contact the Inland Revenue officer who issued the confirmation immediately.

Information from the outer ruby and burnt orange sections of the dart board can provide useful context for the R&D, but you cannot solely rely on that information. Examples of questions you should be seeking to answer when completing your general approval are from the dark teal bullseye and may include (but are not limited to): • What is the scientific or technological problem you are trying to overcome? • What is the gap in knowledge that you have (in a scientific, engineering or technological context)? • What methods or experiments do you plan to undertake to solve the problem? • What is your R&D plan and milestones? • What are your metrics and success parameters? e x p e r i m e n t s Information from the outer ruby and burnt orange sections can provide useful context for the R&D – but you cannot solely rely on that information. The information required to process your claim must hit the dark teal bullseye. All features in the lighter teal circle must be present to be R&D.

It is important to understand what gets funded and what does not. Preliminary step: Identify technology(ies) used for R&D To understand how the RDTI framework applies to this sector, it is useful to first consider the underlying technology that underpins the R&D within your business. Examples may include: Demonstrated in page 7 examples Machine learning2 Application software1, 2, 3 Embedded software4 Digital hardware4 Image processing3 Cloud1 Drones3 The focus is purposely drawn to the technology used in the R&D, rather than the commercial product developed. In many cases, businesses may be using a combination of technologies to undertake their R&D. Once you have considered what technologies the business uses to undertake its R&D, you now need to consider whether the R&D meets the general principles of RDTI eligible activities. Refer to the ‘Refresher’ on page 8. We have developed a number of examples focusing on different aspects of technology development to bring the tax legislation to life for the digital technologies sector. These examples are detailed below, with a guide to show you which focus area of the RDTI rules are demonstrated\*. 76 Refresher General principles of RDTI eligible activities At a glance Eligibility testsQuestions What is the technological uncertainty?

We recommend reading the applications in examples 1a and 1b in the Appendix before continuing. The highlights The commercial project The commercial project was to develop a solution to ensure security of personnel on building sites in different locations with a minimum impact on workers. The technical problem To develop a security solution that uses artificial intelligence (AI) facial recognition, a cloud-based server and cameras to identify personnel. The project had technical constraints of accuracy, speed and hardware cost. How the technical problem became a technological uncertainty Interconnected technological uncertainties resulted from the technical constraints of speed, accuracy and hardware costs and related to: • image compression • acutance • resolution • facial recognition engine selection. Further details are provided in example 1a of the general approval application in the Appendix. Remember – the colour coding represents the different levels of the dart board tool. The dark teal layer (being the bullseye) is the critical information required to efficiently process the funding application. The following diagram demonstrates the progress of the project from its commercial objectives, to its technological uncertainties.

The following table and diagram demonstrate how to benchmark the technological uncertainties. Points to note Remember – the General Approval application example provides a full description of the eligible RDTI activities. This is the expected level of detail required by us. You must focus on the bullseye (dart board tool) and be technical in nature. The publicly available test There is a known solution for facial recognition and security. For example, e-passport scanning at Customs. Therefore, it is important to explain why this R&D is different. The competent professional test This test is demonstrated in the scientific and technological methods required by the business to resolve the uncertainty through the systematic course of investigation and experimentation. Example demonstrating when these tests are not met If the competent professional is only undertaking tests to confirm that a common solution to a common problem could be resolved, then the R&D is not eligible for funding under the RDTI. This is demonstrated in example 1b of the general approval application in the Appendix. 1514 Initial info gathering – literature reviews and Patent searches Engagement with solution providers Testing available tech Minor improvements to existing computer software Software development – communication/ DB integration Project management Patent filing work Routine software maintenance Feedback during commercial phase Selling the solution to customers 1.

Routine computer maintenance Supporting activity Excluded activity Core activity Commercial project 17 Core & supporting R&D Points to note Refresher Core vs supporting R&D Eligible R&D activities must involve core R&D activity. There may also be supporting activities. Excluded activities Certain activities are ineligible core R&D activities. A smaller number are ineligible supporting R&D activities. Further information on supporting R&D activities can be found on the IRD website. Go to www.ird.govt.nz/ Enter keywords: ‘r&d eligible activities’ or ‘r&d ineligible activities’ in search box. To demonstrate the core and supporting R&D activities for the security systems example, and the ineligible excluded activities, we have included the following table and diagram. Type of activity Definition Core activity An activity that has the material purpose of creating new knowledge or new or improved processes, services, or goods. It must also attempt to resolve scientific or technological uncertainty using a systematic approach. Supporting activity An activity that has the only or main purpose of supporting the core activity. Core & supporting activities Only core and supporting activities are funded under the RDTI. Excluded activities – do not get funded Certain activities the business undertook in the security systems example are ineligible for funding. Commercial project vs RDTI funded activities The whole commercial project does not get funded, only the core & supporting activities are funded, being a slice of the wider project. 1716 19 When does the R&D start and finish? Points to note Refresher Beginning and end of core activities The Core R&D starts when you have identified your scientific or technological uncertainty and decided to take a planned approach to resolving that problem. The Core R&D activities are expected to end when you cease to measure and evaluate the extent to which your activities have resolved the scientific or technological uncertainty. Further information on when R&D activities start and finish can be found in the Research and Development Tax Incentive IR1240 Guidance. Go to www.ird.govt.nz/ Enter keywords: ‘r&d eligible activities’ in search box. The following diagram demonstrates at what time the R&D started.

The performance parameters of the project are: • timely (sub 3s) search results • high accuracy • close to 0 false negatives with a minimum of false positives. How the technical problem became a technological uncertainty Constraints like a limited corpus, unknown required and achievable semantic depth, and varying legal interpretations render success uncertain.

In this case to develop a new service. 22 23 Benchmarking the technological uncertainties Remember, a key matter to consider is how to demonstrate that the knowledge required to resolve the technological uncertainties are not publicly available, or deducible by a competent professional in the relevant field. The purpose of this example is to mainly demonstrate the application of the general principles of RDTI eligibility through tabular and diagrammatic form. However, further detail of how to benchmark the uncertainty can be found in the general approval application Appendix, example 1a. The security systems example, also provides further detail regarding benchmarking the technological uncertainty and is demonstrated above (pages 14 & 15) in tabular and diagrammatic form. Points to note Core & supporting R&D Points to note Refresher Core vs supporting R&D Eligible R&D activities must involve core R&D activity. There may also be supporting activities.

To demonstrate the core and supporting R&D activities for the legal search platform example, and the ineligible excluded activities, we have included the following table and diagram. Core & supporting activities Only core and supporting activities are funded under the RDTI. A number of business-as-usual activities can be funded as supporting R&D activities. To get funding the main purpose of these activities MUST be to support the core R&D activity (in other words, the R&D could not go ahead without these activities). Excluded activities – do not get funded Certain activities the business undertook in the legal search platform example are ineligible for funding. Commercial project vs RDTI funded activities The whole commercial project does not get funded, only the core & supporting activities are funded, being a slice of the wider project. 26 Initial info gathering – literature reviews Identifying the range of users & scoping work Engagement with legal expert data taggers Minor improvements to existing computer software Management, planning & coordination activities Engagement with authorities and research institutes Complying with statutory requirements Routine software maintenance Feedback during commercial phase Selling the solution to customers Routine computer maintenance Resolving the technological uncertainties using the systematic approach to develop a semantic search engine that can identify relevant legal passages using a mixed semantic model Testing algorithms that are known to work Documentation & reporting Beta testing Prototype design & development Developing a graphic for user testing Supporting activities may happen at the same time as the core R&D.

The following diagram demonstrates at what time the R&D started. Supporting R&D activities can still be claimed before the core R&D starts, after the core R&D finishes or during the core R&D activities (for example, integrated documentation & reporting on the uncertainties is a supporting activity happening alongside the core R&D). 2829 A drone based computer vision (CV) platform for wheat growing The business applied for a 3-year approval of funding using the general approval method. They had not completed their R&D at the point of applying. We recommend reading the eligible application (example 3) in the Appendix before continuing. Example 3 We have also included the following diagram to aid with the understanding of the project. Please note, it is not a requirement that you provide a visual representation of your project when applying for the RDTI.

The technical problem To develop a CV model that automatically identifies the percentage of flowering wheat heads (anthers) well enough to optimally time application of treatment (fungicide) to the plants. The performance parameters of the project are to identify the time when 75% of the plants have passed from Feekes 10.5.0 (where the wheat head has completely emerged) to Feekes 10.51 (the beginning of flowering) in a narrow time window of up to 7 days. How the technical problem became a technological uncertainty Background • In the early growth stages of wheat and the onset of flowering, the anthers may only take up a few pixels on an image. • This makes it difficult to distinguish by colour from other parts of the plant. • In turn, this makes the accuracy of a CV model challenging, particularly under real conditions. This technical problem becomes technological uncertainties from both the complexities regarding the quality of the data collected (STU 1a & 1b), and how that data can influence the CV model development and its accuracy (STU 2). Further details are provided in example 3 of the general approval application in the Appendix. Remember – the colour coding represents the different levels of the dart board tool. The dark teal layer (being the bullseye) is the critical information required to efficiently process the funding application. The following diagram demonstrates the progress of the project from its commercial objectives to its technological uncertainties. The commercial projectThe technical problemThe technological uncertainties Commercial objective: precision technology To develop a precision technology service using CV for optimising wheat yield. Problem Statement: high accuracy CV model To develop a CV model that automatically identifies the percentage of flowering wheat heads (anthers) well enough to optimally time application of treatment (fungicides) to the plants. Background • In the early growth stages of wheat and the onset of flowering, the anthers may only take up a few pixels on an image. • This makes it difficult to distinguish by colour from other parts of the plant. • In turn, this makes the accuracy of a CV model challenging, particularly under real conditions.

Performance parameters STU 1b: Field research Collection of data under real conditions (variable environmental conditions) using drones to consider the trade-off between image resolution and object distance. STU 1a: Laboratory research Collection of data for CV model development in: • Ideal conditions • Controlled variation of simulated environmental conditions to determine the optimal camera specifications regarding height, placement and image resolution. STU 2: CV model development The main technological challenge results from the colour resolution between the object and its background. The goal is the continued improvement of the accuracy of the CV model using increasingly more complex and realistic inputs. 32 33 The general principles of RDTI eligibility The general principles of RDTI eligible activities require all 3 aspects of the eligibility requirements to be met. The following table and diagram demonstrate the relationship between them using the approach of Problem > R&D Plan & Investigate > Outcome. Points to note The technological uncertainties The technological uncertainties in this example are interrelated demonstrating the “problem” is twofold. This problem has technological principles underpinning it for both the quality of the data collected (due to variable environmental conditions) and the flow on effect for CV model development and its accuracy. The systematic approach The “plan’ and “investigate” phases are directly related to the relevant technological uncertainties. The R&D plan involves undertaking investigative steps to work towards resolving the specific technological uncertainties. Further detail is provided in the “Systematic approach” section of this example. The new or improved... The resulting outcome is clearly stated. The “why” the R&D was undertaken. In this case to develop a new service. Remember – the general approval application example 3 provides a full description of the eligible RDTI activities. This is the expected level of detail required by us. You must focus on the dark teal bullseye (dart board tool) and be technical in nature.

A systematic approach can be flexible and adaptive, changing in response to results, but the approach remains logical and focused on solving the problem. In this example the R&D is yet to happen. However, the systematic approach still demonstrates how the business expects to resolve its technical problems and the technical knowledge gap it anticipates. The business has used the systematic approach to help provide further context to the technological uncertainties. It has proposed several solutions to technological problems it plans to undertake. This is not essential but can help provide additional substance to the activities planned when explaining the eligibility of the R&D project.

The following table demonstrates how to benchmark the technological uncertainties. Points to note Remember – the general approval application example 3 in the Appendix provides a full description of the eligible RDTI activities. This is the expected level of detail we require. You must focus on the dark teal bullseye (dart board tool) and be technical in nature. The publicly available testThe competent professional testExample demonstrating when these tests are not met There are known solutions for CV models and detection algorithms. For example, ImageNet and Detectron. It is recognized that R&D activity can build on prior knowledge and solutions. So it is important to explain how this R&D builds on these publicly available solutions, what is different and why. This test is demonstrated in the scientific and technological methods required by the business to resolve the uncertainty through the systematic course of investigation and experimentation. The detail provided in the systematic approach helps support the complexities of the work required, providing an insight into the problem solving required to resolve the technological uncertainties. If the competent professional is only undertaking tests to confirm that a common solution to a common problem could be resolved, then the R&D is not eligible for funding under the RDTI. Note: To help determine where your activities fall, the diagram \[below\] demonstrates how you might compare a “common solution to a problem” versus “investigate and/or experimentation”. You may consider several factors when coming to your conclusion, and on balance demonstrate that sufficient activities are undertaken to “tip the seesaw” towards technological uncertainty. General examples are narrated in the dotted line and then applied to the CV model example (along with the publicly available test). If the competent professional is only undertaking tests to confirm that a common solution to a common problem could be resolved, then the R&D is not eligible for funding under the RDTI. This is demonstrated in example 1b of the general approval application in the Appendix.

It must also attempt to resolve scientific or technological uncertainty using a systematic approach. Supporting activity An activity that has the only or main purpose of supporting the core activity. Competent professional Common solutions to common problems Investigation & experimentation Problem solving Text book Unpredictable Predictable Unsure Obvious Unknown Known Technological uncertainty R&D General examples: Competent professional A competent professional (CP) is aware of the current state of knowledge in the field but is unsure how to solve the scientific or technological problem A CP may be confident that an objective can be achieved but do not know how to achieve it There may be unpredictable results creating uncertainty from a scientific or technological perspective as to whether the product specifications can be achieved A CP would need to undertake a systematic course of investigation to resolve the uncertainty using investigative problem solving Technically complex problem 4041 Refresher Excluded activities Certain activities are ineligible core R&D activities. A smaller number are ineligible supporting R&D activities. Further information on supporting R&D activities can be found on the IRD website. Go to www.ird.govt.nz/ Enter keywords: ‘r&d eligible activities’ or ‘r&d ineligible activities’ in search box. To demonstrate the core and supporting R&D activities for the CV example, and the ineligible excluded activities, we have included the following table and diagram. Core, supporting and excluded activities STU 1a: Laboratory research STU 1b: Field research STU 2: CV model development What are core and supporting R&D activities? What are excluded activities? Supporting activity: supporting activities may happen at the same time as the core R&D. For example, integrated documentation and reporting on the uncertainties. Key Excluded activity Core activity Initial info gathering – literature reviews Plan and perform lab research Plan and perform NZ field trails Minor improvements to existing computer software Management, planning & coordination activities Analyse data and report on results Complying with statutory requirements Market research Feedback SR&D during in field commercial use Selling the solution to customers Commercialisation planning Purchase test drones with 4k capability Applying for patents Plan and perform Australian field trials 4243 Step plan: Overseas R&D activities To determine what activities undertaken outside of New Zealand are funded and by how much, you must follow the steps as outlined below. Step 2: How much of that expenditure gets funded under the RDTI? Once you have determined whether the overseas activities are eligible for funding as a supporting activity, you must then determine how much of that expenditure can be funded. Where you incur expenditure on a supporting R&D activity outside of New Zealand, your eligible expenditure is the lesser of your actual expenditure incurred on the activity overseas, and 10% of your total eligible expenditure. Step 2 answer: the expenditure funded for the Australian field trials is limited to 10% of the total R&D eligible expenditure (or the actual amount if lower). Step 1: Are the activities undertaken outside New Zealand eligible for funding? To determine if the activities undertaken outside New Zealand are eligible for funding you must demonstrate the following: TestComputer vision example: Australian field trials The core R&D activity is performed in New Zealand The core R&D activities performed in New Zealand are demonstrated in the systematic approach (milestones I-IV) and relate to the development of the CV model accuracy through increasingly complex data sets. The only or main purpose of the activities are to support the core R&D activity The purpose of the Australian field trials is to collect new data specific to that environment which is integral to the development of the accuracy of the CV model as a global precision technology service. Step 1 answer:The activities are eligible for funding under the RDTI as supporting activities. Core & supporting activities Only core and supporting activities are funded under the RDTI. Some business-as-usual activities can be funded as supporting R&D activities. To get funding the only or main purpose of these activities MUST be to support the core R&D activity (in other words, the R&D could not go ahead without these activities). Supporting R&D - outside of New Zealand The Australian field trials are part of the data collection required to improve the accuracy of the CV model. The outcome is to develop a robust global CV model that will operate in multiple environmental settings. In the CV example, the Australian field trials are funded as a supporting R&D activity. Note: It is important to remember that you do not receive automatic funding for overseas R&D expenditure as they are excluded from being a core activity. To help determine the amount of funding available for overseas activities, follow the “Step plan: overseas R&D activities”. Excluded activities – do not get funded Certain activities the business undertook in the CV example are ineligible for funding. For example, market research and applying for patents in respect of any new software would not be eligible. Commercial project vs RDTI funded activities The whole commercial project does not get funded, only the core & supporting activities are funded. The project narrative included in the general approval (example 3 in the Appendix) focuses on the RDTI funded activities. For example, the company’s market research and commercialisation and sales strategy are not included within the General Approval application because these activities are not funded under the RDTI. Core, supporting and excluded activities 4445 A low-cost, satellite-based Internet of Things (IoT) location tracker This example looks at a hypothetical end-to-end system for an IoT tracking device attached to an animal’s collar or people out hunting or tramping, utilising positioning technology to track latitude, longitude, and height. The applications include tracking over long time periods in remote locations with no access to other communication networks. The RDTI example is focused on the development of an IoT tracking device (including hardware and software) required to create the product and service offering. The scope of this project does not include the cloud storage, or the application used to track the device. Example 4 Satellite ground network Scope of project: Development of tracking device Communications network Cloud storage Server architecture Applications Client applications IoT tracking device on an animal or person Low earth orbit satellite Please note, it is not a requirement that you provide a visual representation of your project when applying for the RDTI. Stage F: Manufacture Overview: The core activities Stage E: Optimisation Stage D: Development Stage C: Understanding Stage A: Ideation Year 1Year 2Year 3 Core: System Performance Core: DFM Core: Battery Life Core: Battery Solution Stage B: Technology Research Core: Antenna Design Supporting: Discovery & Planning R&D The business is undertaking a 3-year product development phase where the intended product specifications, scientific or technological uncertainties (STU), and core and supporting activities evolve over the course of the project. The business will initially apply for general approval of its activities, and then either apply for a variation of its approval (if materially different to the original application) or apply for a new approval of new activities. Instead of including several general approval applications with this example, Appendix: A step-by-step guide to the dimensions of the challenge contains a summary of the core research and development, the uncertainties in the core and the systematic approach to the activities undertaken as the project progressed. This tool is intended to guide you through the example and how this would form the respective parts of a general approval application. Before continuing, to more fully understand the evolving technical issues arising in this example we suggest you read the Example 4 general approval application on page 82 of the Appendix. 4647 The highlights The commercial project To develop a low-cost, satellite based, IoT tracking device for animals or people in remote locations with no access to other communication networks. The technical problem Product specifications Problem statement: to develop an IoT end-user tracking device within the following product specifications: • device size 4cm x 3cm x 1cm • device weight <300g • design for manufacture (DFM) to achieve 30 secs assembly time • cost of goods to produce <$20 per unit • internal antenna preferred. The product specifications create constraints that affect the technological uncertainty. The specific uncertainties identified at the start of the project are below. Battery life Problem statement: to develop long-lasting battery life within defined technical constraints. Performance parameters: the performance parameters of the project are: • battery size 4 cm3 • battery life > 5 years • a specified usage pattern - one location report per hour. Communication link budget Problem statement: to develop link power within defined technical constraints. Performance parameters: the performance targets of the project are: • transmit power 200mW (23dBm) • device antenna gain is 3dBi at the operational frequency. How the technical problem became a technological uncertainty The technical problems created by the product specifications may create scientific or technological uncertainty (STU). This is because the technology needed to meet all product specifications simultaneously is unknown. The trade-offs between product specifications and the technology needed to achieve these goals is iterative throughout the product development life cycle. This means the STU can evolve and flex based on the results of the investigative steps undertaken. The development may be affected by the commercial reality that compromises will have to be made due to cost and time constraints. This does not preclude the product from qualifying from RDTI if the product is still of a quality sufficient for sale. Explaining technological uncertainties in the diagram below The outer dark teal line in the diagram demonstrating the technological uncertainty on page 50 represents the ideal product specifications that the business wants to achieve. It is likely this line will flex and evolve during the stages of product development. The dark teal dotted line and heads of the arrows represent where the current knowledge is for each technology in the product specification. The product specification within the dark teal dotted line is not a STU as it is known to be possible. Instead, the STU arises beyond the dotted line. 4849 Energy density Battery life >5 years A specified usage pattern Battery size >4 cm 3 Antenna design and transmit power 200mW (23dBm) Current level of knowledge for product specification Final product specifications Gap in knowledge creating STU Transmit power 200mW (23dBM) Antenna gain 3db Communications link budget: product specifications Battery life: product specifications Energy density >200Wh/kg Volumetric Energy Density >400Wh/L Battery chemistry Usage pattern 1 locaction report per hr Battery life >5 years Battery size 4 cm 3 ??

The following table introduces an example of a product development lifecycle and how it could apply to the general principles of RDTI eligibility. This approach steps through the process of the Problem > R&D Plan > Investigate > Outcome. Points to note The technological uncertainties These are the technological problems with “unknowns”. This example shows how uncertainty can exist because of competing product specifications. The systematic approach ‘How’ the problems causing the technological uncertainties are addressed. The ‘plan’ and ‘investigate’ phases are directly related to the relevant technological uncertainties. The R&D plan involves undertaking investigative steps to work towards resolving the technological uncertainties. We provide further detail in the ‘Introduction to a step-by-step guide to the dimensions of the challenge’ (and its respective Appendix). The new or improved... The resulting outcome is clearly stated. The “why” the R&D was undertaken. In this case, to develop a new product and service. Remember – the general approval application example provides a full description of the eligible RDTI activities. You must focus on the dark teal bullseye (dartboard tool) and be technical in your description. This diagram uses the dartboard colours where the dark teal bullseye demonstrates the critical RDTI information. It tracks the project’s progress from the ruby commercial objectives to the dark teal technological uncertainties.

The stages are only used for reference purposes and are not specifically required for the RDTI application. Overview: A product development lifecycle This is a hypothetical example of a product development lifecycle. You may use alternative methods depending on your industry. This example simply demonstrates the practical application of the RDTI in a digital product development environment. Please note: Only core (dark teal) R&D and supporting (brown) R&D activities are eligible for the RDTI, excluded activities (grey circles on white) are not eligible. Core, supporting and excluded R&D activities can arise at any stage of the product development life cycle. Further detail on supporting and excluded R&D activities are detailed in the respective sections of this document.

The inner dark teal dotted line shows where the current knowledge base sits for each product specification, and the outer dark teal line shows where the knowledge needs to grow to achieve the product goals. There is a clear knowledge gap. The Appendix includes a step-by-step guide demonstrating how the dimensions of the challenge can result in an evolving STU throughout the stages of the product development lifecycle from stage A through to stage E. There are several trade-offs and decision points based on the success of the new technology and changes in the ultimate product specification (the outer dark teal line of the diagram). Throughout the product development lifecycle both the product specifications change (reflected by the movement in the outer dark teal line) and the new knowledge to meet the specification grows (reflected by the movement in the dotted line). The second diagram to the right shows the end result for product release, with more product specifications added and the growth of the knowledge base. The dotted line is what was achieved at the end of the R&D with that final knowledge achieving more or less than the final amended plan.

The systematic approach must relate to the resolution of the uncertainty. This includes possible solutions, the proposed or actual activities and the results of tests or experiments (if known). For a multi-year application, the activities should reflect the plan for the whole period of the application (accepting it will develop and change as the years progress). In this example the R&D is iterative. Regardless, the systematic approach still demonstrates how the business expects to resolve its technical problems and the technical knowledge gap it anticipates as it flexes and evolves.

The following table demonstrates how to benchmark the technological uncertainties. Points to note The publicly available testThe competent professional test There are known solutions to meet product specifications to a lesser standard. It is recognised that R&D activity can build on this prior knowledge and solutions. Therefore, it is important to explain how the R&D builds on these publicly available solutions, what is different and why. This test is demonstrated in the scientific and technological methods required by the business to resolve the uncertainty through the systematic course of investigation and experimentation. The detail provided in the Appendix “Introduction to the step-by-step guide to the dimensions of the challenge” helps support the complexities of the work required, providing an insight into the problem solving required to resolve the technological uncertainties. Note: To help determine where your activities fall, the diagram to the right demonstrates how you might compare a “common solution to a problem” versus “investigation and/or experimentation.” You may consider several factors when coming to your conclusion, and on balance demonstrate that sufficient activities are undertaken to “tip the seesaw” towards technological uncertainty. If the competent professional is only undertaking tests to confirm that a common solution to aecommon problem could be resolved, then the R&D is not eligible for the RDTI credit. General examples are narrated in the dotted line and then applied to the IoT example in the Appendix. Competent professional Common solutions to common problems Investigation & experimentation Problem solving Text book Unpredictable Predictable Unsure Obvious Unknown Known Technological uncertainty R&D General examples: Competent professional A group of experienced engineers have compared the product specification to that which is tecnologicallly possible today and were unsure if the specification could be achieved. The project identifies a number of challenges where it is unknown how to achieve them. The product specifications identify constraints that collectively compete against one another. This created a situation where the results are unpredictable. A group of experienced engineers have reviewed the identified uncertainties and concluded they would need to undertake a systematic course of investigation to resolve the uncertainty using investigative problem solving. Technically complex problem 5657 Core & supporting R&D Points to note Refresher Core vs supporting R&D Eligible R&D activities must involve core R&D activity. There may also be supporting activities. Type of activity Definition Core activity An activity that has the material purpose of creating new knowledge or new or improved services or goods. It must also attempt to resolve scientific or technological uncertainty using a systematic approach. Supporting activity An activity that has the only or main purpose of supporting the core activity. Supporting R&D activities To be a supporting R&D activity, the only or main purpose of these activities MUST be to support the core R&D activity. At the same time, the R&D could not go ahead without these activities. The diagram below shows that supporting activities could happen at any stage of the product development lifecycle. In the IoT example they occur in stages B to E. The diagram also gives a brief description of why the activity supports the core R&D. Patent searches Establish state of the art \*You will note that patent activities are normally excluded. The distinction is discussed further in the excluded activities on the following page of this document. Support: Establishing the state of the art of considering architectural options may represent an eligible supporting activity in that they seek to further establish the technological boundaries. Stage E: Optimisation Stage D: Development Stage B: Technology Research Stage A: Ideation Stage C: Understanding Architectural options: design of antenna & battery chemistry Publicly available or competent professional tests Support: Writing technical specifications can represent an eligible supporting activity in that they identify constraints that may affect the core activities in the product development. Technical product specification Outline technical specification Support: Benchmarking technological uncertainties. Literature searches have not identified existing solution. The engineers cannot deduce the solution without experimentation. Planning and discovery Support: Activities occurring prior to the start of a core activity may be eligible to develop a testable hypothesis. Improve firmware algorithms to extend battery life Support: In this example firmware is shown as a supporting activity however if the technological uncertainty extends to the firmware, this may also be a core activity. It depends on what technological uncertainties are being resolved. Design for Manufacture (DFM) constraints Design for Manufacture (DFM) Support: Manufacturing can place constraints on the development of a product. Establishing such constraints can represent an eligible supporting activity to the extent they are required to resolve the uncertainty described in the core activity. Performance testing Systems testing Support: Testing of the product is eligible to the extent that it is requiured to resolve the uncertainty described in the core activity. Regulatory and industry compliance Pre-compliance testing Support: Regulatory and Industry testing may be eligible if the product is new. Supporting R&D activities 58 59 Refresher Excluded activities Certain activities are ineligible core R&D activities. A smaller number are ineligible supporting R&D activities. Further information on supporting R&D activities can be found on the IRD website. Go to www.ird.govt.nz/ Enter keywords: ‘r&d eligible activities’or ‘r&d ineligible activities’ in search box. Excluded activities are not eligible for the RDTI. The diagram below shows that excluded activities could happen at any stage of the product development lifecycle. In the IoT example, they occur in stages A to F. The diagram also gives a brief description of why the activity is excluded. Note: patent-related activities are normally excluded. The distinction lies in what the activities in relation to the patents involve. • Possible eligible (supporting) activities: patent searches which are part of understanding your technology and identifying technological uncertainties. • Ineligible (excluded) activities: researching, preparing, and filing applications for your own intellectual property registrations. This includes any associated costs. Stage F: Manufacture Stage E: Optimisation Stage D: Development Stage B: Technology Research Stage A: Ideation Stage C: Understanding Not eligible: The market analysis is excluded by Schedule 21 Part A Clause 6 and Part B Clause 6 relating to market research, market testing, market development, or sales promotion, including consumer surveys. Not eligible: This activity is excluded by Schedule 21 Part A Clause 7 and Part B Clause 7 related to patenting. Specifically related to ‘researching, preparing and filing applications for intellectual property registrations’. Not eligible: The above is excluded by Schedule 21 Part A Clause 15 related to minor adaptions, cosmetic or stylistic changes or improvements. Post product release: market feedback has revealed an opportunity for different coloured devices, especially bright yellow. The manufacture r is able to change the material colour easily so a new product variant is quickly released. Not eligible: The above activities are excluded by Schedule 21 Part A Clause 6 and Part B Clause 6 relating to market research, market testing, market development, or sales promotion, including consumer surveys.

Activities excluded from R&D 6061 When does the R&D start and finish? Points to note Refresher Beginning and end of core activities The core R&D starts when you have identified your scientific or technological uncertainty and decided to take a planned approach to resolving that problem (Stage B: Technology Research). The core R&D activities are expected to end when you cease to measure and evaluate the extent to which your activities have resolved the scientific or technological uncertainty. Further information on when R&D activities start and finish can be found in the Research and Development Tax Incentive IR1240 Guidance. Go to www.ird.govt.nz/ Enter keywords: ‘r&d eligible activities’ in search box. The following diagram demonstrates when the core R&D started. Supporting R&D activities can still be claimed in the Ideation Stage A before the core R&D starts and after the core R&D finishes at the end of the Optimisation Stage E. It cannot be claimed as support activity unless the project goes ahead, and the core activity commences in Stage B. A timeline for the application is included for reference purposes only. The core R&D activities are expected to end when you have resolved the uncertainty The core R&D starts when you have identified your scientific or technological uncertainty and decided to take a planned approach to resolving that problem.

Rather they are intended to show the types of information needed in an application that will help us assess the eligibility of the activities. The level of information needed will depend on the nature and complexity of the R&D activities you are applying for. 65 Example 1a A security system for a building site Projects An eligible & approved application Project identifier The real-time staff site identification (RSSI) project Start date: 1 April 2021End date: 31 March 2022 Appendix 6564 66 Project objective Develop a smart facial recognition security system to identify authorised personnel entering multiple building sites in New Zealand. This requires: • Security cameras with a full http stack to capture facial images, • An investigation into existing technology for small businesses using edge processing and security cameras with an http stack. This demonstrated the limitations of the existing technology and a preference for a cloud based matching system. Thus, a new system was approved for development to upload facial images into a cloud-based server to perform the facial recognition matching technology, • For a successful recognition match send an approve signal to open the automated gate or, if no successful recognition, send a request to the site manager to consider ‘validating manually’. Feasibility studies reveal staff have accepted the privacy implications of their photographs being held in the cloud but are concerned about the possibility of false negative or positive results impacting safety and timeliness of entry. Staff have commented that ‘nobody wants to wait outside in the rain and cold for a computer to decide that somebody who’s worked for the company for 20 years is okay to get into work’. Core activity Related project with a core activity involving 3 interrelated activities The real-time staff site identification (RSSI) project The primary objective is to identify personnel on building sites in different locations with a minimum impact on workers. We set a requirement for automatic and secure real-time identification and confirmation of a person visiting a particular site is on an approved list. Secure is defined as ‘<1 false positive per month with an assumed 300 visitors per month.’ This core activity and the technological uncertainty is to resolve whether it is possible to develop a facial recognition engine to match images taken by an on-site security camera with images stored in a database of images, within the required parameters. The technical requirements for an automatic and secure real-time facial identification and confirmation security system are: • Develop compression algorithms that would provide the smallest possible file sizes while maintaining accurate and real time results. • The camera must take an accurate picture in changeable and challenging weather and light conditions. • The facial recognition needs to be processed either on the edge or through secure and fast transmission of the image to a facial recognition/ inference engine in the cloud. • The recognition needs to be in near real-time with the decision to use cloud processing made relatively early in the project. It was necessary to research acutance and resolution performance tests required to establish the standards necessary to meet the required recognition performance metrics. • We undertook Investigative and experimental activity in facial recognition engines, acutance and image resolution requirements, compression and transmission optimisation using a systematic approach designed to resolve our technological uncertainties. Benchmarking the technological uncertainties: 1. Is the knowledge to resolve the uncertainty publicly available? We conducted literature reviews, patent searches, scoured online journals and engaged with providers of solutions. This included reviews of both Example 1a 67 edge or cloud based facial recognition engines and models, transmission technology, and compression algorithms. We established through tests with available technologies that there was no solution currently available that would meet the technical requirements – recognition rates were too low, or throughput speed did not meet the business requirements. 2. Is the knowledge to resolve the uncertainty deducible by a competent professional in the relevant scientific or technological field? We established that a competent professional in the field could not deduce the outcome of the scientific or technological uncertainty without undertaking an investigative and experimental approach to create new knowledge in this field and to develop this new or improved process and service. Activity 1. Development of compression algorithms to enable cooperative 1:N matching, capture and pre-processing on the edge, training and inference in the cloud. Scientific or technological uncertainty It was unknown what level of image compression was required to resolve the trade-off between transmission speed vs inference speed and accuracy. We had a requirement to meet the following performance parameters: • a total identification throughput turnaround of less than 3 seconds from capture to decision to allow or deny access: and • as the site had no internet connections site data needed to be transmitted from a mobile connection at the work site, with a minimum of a 3G connection using TCP/IP and SSL protocols: and • transmission time to be less than 1 second, with less than 2 seconds of inference time (the time to process and recognise): and • less than 5% false negatives and less than .5% false positives, with an average 300 visits per month. Systematic approach to resolve uncertainty We undertook a systematic approach of research and development of novel compression algorithms for images so that a decision could be made which settings would provide the best overall performance. We conducted tests in various environmental conditions of throughput speeds for different compression algorithms while satisfying the requirement for accuracy, developing a matrix showing the various accuracies with various compressions compared to throughput speeds. Describe new knowledge; new or improved processes, services or goods Through the development of new knowledge in compression algorithms, new processes and services have been developed with the intention of enabling online facial recognition comparison at speeds not achieved previously. Activity 2. Research and development of acutance and resolution standards for security camera images for facial recognition. Scientific or technological uncertainty It is unknown what acutance (constrained by cost of hardware) and resolution (constrained by cost in hardware and total identification time) would be needed to meet the required recognition performance metrics while still meeting the time and cost constraints. Systematic approach to resolve uncertainty We undertook a systematic approach of research and development to establish the minimum acutance and resolution of images that could still achieve the required accuracy results. Based on reviews of available technology we chose three different camera Example 1a 6766 68 systems which presented varying acutance levels and tested the minimum acutance for recognition in lab conditions using ISO12233 charts to measure MTF and confirm manufacturer claims. We then tested the cameras under differing environmental conditions (weather, lighting) to determine how they impacted on the image acutance. We performed tests at different resolutions to determine the impact on recognition accuracy and throughput in the inference engine. Describe new knowledge; new or improved processes, services or goods The outcome of this activity was to establish new knowledge of which cameras offering secure data transfer via a 3G connection: • produced the best results through various facial recognition engines in the majority of environmental conditions, • had the acutance levels and resolution to meet the required recognition performance metrics for recognition and identification. Activity 3. Development of facial recognition engine for cooperative 1:N matching- capture and pre-processing on the edge, training and inference in the cloud. Scientific or technological uncertainty We were uncertain: • which facial recognition engines/models were suitable for use with the images we were capturing: • which facial recognition models worked best in changing and challenging environments: • what was most efficient for speed of throughput - edge based facial recognition vs cloud engines for facial recognition. We had a requirement to meet the following performance parameters: • a total identification throughput turnaround of less than 3 seconds from capture to decision to allow or deny access: and • as the site had no internet connections site data needed to be transmitted from a mobile connection at the work site, with a minimum of a 3G connection using TCP/IP and SSL protocols: and • transmission time to be less than 1 second, with less than 2 seconds of inference time (the time to process and recognise): and • less than 5% false negatives and less than .5% false positives, with an average 300 visits per month. Systematic approach to resolve uncertainty We undertook: • a significant literature review of facial recognition engines and models, establishing the requirements and possibilities of edge-based processing of images, which showed that the current technology in security cameras did not allow us to provide recognition services at a quality and speed that would satisfy our requirements, and we quickly pivoted to a cloud- based approach for recognition. • a systematic approach of research and iterative development of a novel facial recognition engine. This involved the creation of a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) utilising a MongoDB on AWS which provided detection of images that contain a face, image segmentation to locate and mark the face on an image, facial alignment and normalisation, feature extraction and face recognition. • an iterative approach of testing, modifying and retesting - matching face images against multiple known faces in a prepared database, testing edge- based processing against processing in a dedicated cloud- based server to measure throughput times, while training the recognition models and optimising hyperparameters through seven steps of machine learning. 69 Describe new knowledge; new or improved processes, services or goods Through the development of new knowledge in facial recognition services, new processes and services have been developed with the intention of enabling accurate online facial recognition comparison at speeds not previously achieved. Supporting activities Camera MTF evaluation In order to confirm that the manufacturer specifications matched the product, we needed to conduct tests to ensure the veracity of the manufacturer’s MTF claims. Without confirming the MTF performance of the cameras, we could not be certain we were accurately measuring the impact of acutance of image recognition and inference. Research and development of acutance and resolution standards for security camera images for facial recognition. Literature reviews and patent searches In order to establish whether we could use existing technology, or would have to develop our own, we needed to know the state and limitations of the technology.

Example 1aExample 1a 6968 70 A security system for a building site Projects An ineligible and declined application Project identifier The real-time staff site identification (RSSI) project Start date: 1 April 2022End date: 31 March 2023 Appendix 71 Project objective Develop a smart facial recognition security system to identify authorised personnel entering multiple building sites in New Zealand. We conducted an intensive investigation into possible solutions in the facial recognition systems for small businesses, assessing and evaluating possible solutions before choosing and adapting the best solution for our business. The project required: • Security cameras with a full http stack to capture facial images, • An investigation into existing technology for small businesses using edge processing and security cameras with an http stack. This demonstrated the limitations of some of the existing technology and a preference for a cloud based facial matching system. • The acquisition of a new cloud-based system which would upload facial images into the cloud server to perform the facial recognition matching technology. • A successful recognition match to send an approve signal to open the automated gate or, if no successful recognition, to send a request to the site manager to consider ‘validating manually’. Feasibility studies reveal staff have accepted the privacy implications of their photographs being held in the cloud but are concerned about the possibility of false negative or positive results impacting safety and timeliness of entry. Staff have commented that “nobody wants to wait outside in the rain and cold for a computer to decide that somebody who’s worked for the company for 20 years is okay to get into work.” Hence, the key performance requirements for a facial recognition security system for this company are speed, accuracy, reliability, and affordability. Core activity Installation, configuration, and assessment of facial recognition systems for use in security applications. The real-time staff site identification (RSSI) project We embarked on an R&D project with the primary objective of solving the problem of ensuring identification of personnel on building sites in different locations with a minimum impact on workers. We set a requirement for automatic and secure real-time identification and confirmation that a person visiting a site is on an approved list. This core activity was to resolve the technological uncertainty of finding a facial recognition product that would match images taken by our on-site security cameras with images that are stored in a database of images. Feasibility discussions resulted in a process being developed to use security cameras to capture facial images and send the images to a cloud-based server to perform the facial recognition and matching technology. The camera must take an accurate picture in all weathers to ensure the facial recognition software can produce an accurate result. We conducted reviews of possible solutions in the facial recognition market and established there were five potential products that might meet the requirements. It was unknown which product would be the most appropriate for our needs. Each solution had a multitude of configuration possibilities and we set about a systematic process to determine which was most likely to meet the requirements. It was established that our competent professionals would require an investigative and experimental approach to create new knowledge in this field that would lead to a new or improved process and service. Example 1bExample 1b 7170 72 Benchmarking the technological uncertainties 1. Is the knowledge to resolve the uncertainty publicly available? We have researched the available products available in the market and have found there are five potential products in the market. We are reviewing the performance of each of the products to determine whether any can be configured to meet the criteria for our business circumstances including installation areas at out building sites. 2. Is the knowledge to resolve the uncertainty deducible by a competent professional in the relevant scientific or technological field? On reviewing the manuals of each product our expert was not able to deduce whether it was possible to reconfigure the parameters to meet our business requirements. Scientific or technological uncertainty We were uncertain which facial recognition product was most suitable for our use to capture images which would produce the most accurate results for our business. The manuals that came with the software, while incredibly detailed and complicated, did not provide the information to enable us to choose the best solution without undertaking a systematic process of investigation involving significant trial and error. Our scientific or technological uncertainty was: • how best to configure the applications to produce the best results, learning and creating new knowledge for the company as we went through the activity. • the software configuration was technically challenging, and it was uncertain at the start of the activity whether we were going to even have a working solution to meet our needs. • we spent many hours researching potential configurations provided by the chosen software vendors. We tested the different configurations to see whether they met our required performance parameters, i.e.: • a total identification throughput turnaround of around 3-5 seconds from capture to decision to allow or deny access: and • as the site had no internet connections site data needed to be transmitted from a mobile connection at the work site, with a minimum of a 3G connection using TCP/IP and SSL protocols: and • transmission time to be less than 2 seconds, with around 4 seconds of inference time (the time to process and recognise): and • less than 5% false negatives and less than .5% false positives, with an average 300 visits per month. Systematic approach to resolve uncertainty We undertook a systematic approach of research and iterative testing of five separate facial recognition software products. This involved: • the installation and configuration of software which provided detection of images that contain a face, • image segmentation to locate and mark the face on an image, • facial alignment and normalisation, • feature extraction, and • face recognition. We followed an iterative approach of testing and retesting each product and the different configurations available to discover the throughput times and accuracy of the alternative configurations. Describe new knowledge; new or improved processes, services or goods Through the development of new knowledge in installation and configuration of facial recognition services, we now understand which of the different types of facial recognition systems can provide the best results for security on our building sites. 73 Supporting activities Installation of Facial Recognition software on cloud server architecture Software installation on cloud server architecture. Without installation of the software, we would be unable to test different configuration options.

Without knowing what is available in the market it is not possible to know which applications would be best to test. Installation, configuration, and assessment of facial recognition systems for use in security applications. Security camera installation In order to test the facial recognition software, we had to install some security cameras first to capture the images. You need cameras to create images, so without the cameras, the testing could not be performed. Installation, configuration, and assessment of facial recognition systems for use in security applications. AWS server and MongoDB setup To test the facial recognition software, a cloud-based software platform needed to be established.

Example 1bExample 1b 7372 74 Example 2 A legal search platform for the building code Projects An eligible and approved application Project identifier Legal search platform and interpretation tool for the interrelated rules and language in the NZ building legislation and regulation Start date: 1 April 2023End date: 31 March 2024 Appendix 75 Project objective Complex and interrelated legislation and regulations govern all building work in New Zealand. The primary legislation is the New Zealand Building Act 2004 (the Building Act) for building and construction and the New Zealand Building Regulations 1992 (the Building Code) which lists minimum building and performance standards required. The building rules change as new materials or techniques are integrated. Building quality and performance have trended downwards over recent years, highlighting stakeholders’ legal exposure. Human expertise is required to navigate the legislation, identify relevant passages, and understand roles and obligations. This application is for R&D work on a legal search platform using a mix of machine learning based natural language processing (NLP) and rule- based models to make the Building Act accessible to users with little to no legal background, while providing a valuable and useful tool to legal and construction professionals. The aim is to provide better building code look up and automatic interpretation for a large variety of users including owners, builders, and local authorities. Core activity The modelling and lookup functionality technical problem to be solved The ultimate solution is to develop a machine learning based NLP algorithm to allow an automated lookup. Although the amount of raw data is limited to the contents of the Building Act, the Building Code and relevant case law, the preparation of the relevant text (corpus) suitable for NLP is complex and expensive. Without such a modelling and lookup tool experts in building law familiar with the Building Code handbooks currently work manually through the primary literature (Building Act and Building Code) and tag semantic meaning of words and concepts against these texts. This is a costly exercise. This means constraints must be placed on the size of the corpus used, which impacts the accuracy of the tool. Important modelling constraints and opportunities: • Balancing the relative importance of different rules and classes of building work requires statistical analysis to ensure the rules focus on the most important. i.e., the number of irrelevant passages may far outweigh the number of relevant passages, or vice versa. Thus, the corpus for the tool can be limited to and focus on the relevant passages. • NLP engines require fine tuning to model complexity to achieve viable model performance with limited training data. Whereas rule-based engines are generally more robust but rely on human expertise. Therefore, this project is designed to apply a mixed semantic model by: 1. Investigating an automated NLP, and 2. Developing and evaluating rule-based models that require more human expertise but have a better chance of providing useful performance for the search function when dealing with a limited data set. This will help to make the most of the available data for the building code search and recommendation platform and inform future NLP models for other applications. This financial year we are working on lookup functionality and will start with preliminary work for automatic text summarisation. Benchmarking the technological uncertainties 1. Is the knowledge to resolve the uncertainty publicly available? NLP techniques and algorithms have been applied globally to corpuses in many fields including legal text. To our knowledge, this is the first practical application to the NZ building legislation and regulations. Example 2 7475 76 2. Is the knowledge to resolve the uncertainty deducible by a competent professional in the relevant scientific or technological field? This is a hard task for a bespoke legal search platform and interpretation tool which requires informed statistical analysis and significant problem solving. This means it cannot be predicted with certainty the most accurate and efficient mix of the models (being the automated NLP or rule-based models) will be sufficiently accurate, speedy, and cost efficient within the search platform criteria. The work will involve several experts who will research and systematically investigate the chosen data sets included in the corpus to find the plain English answer to expected search questions. Thus, the answer to resolving the core activity is not able to be deduced by competent professionals in the relevant fields without undertaking a systematic course of investigation and experimentation. Scientific or technological uncertainty This raises uncertainty about achievable lookup accuracy and if the achievable model performance and inference speed are going to be sufficient for the use case. While POS tagging and other lexical attributes are well solved, the biggest challenge is the unknown domain-dependent context sensitivity or semantic depth needed. Therefore, the technological uncertainties to be resolved are: • Whether the semantic structure in the legislation is suitable for tagging by a rule based or other system and a set of rules can be identified that covers the relevant sample set of documents. • Whether a machine learning model: • can resolve inconsistencies arising from the innate ambiguity in natural and legal texts which is reflected in competing legal interpretations and opinions: and • can discover the relevant semantic structure (auxiliary words etc) better than random, especially when common keywords might account for 70% of the majority class. Success will be achieved when relevant legal passages for a particular role can be extracted automatically at close to 100% completeness while minimising false negatives. Systematic approach to resolve uncertainty • Preliminary work on rule encoding and annotation. This will help define what exactly should be annotated in the context of the building code search engine. Identify roles and obligations. • Annotate corpus and ensure a variation of legal opinions (at least two different lawyers) and semantic structure are captured. Pre- and post-processing (for example, using NLTK, Word2vec etc): • POS tagging (nouns, verbs etc). • Named entity recognition. • Text summarisation techniques. • Try out a range of technical encoding standards and pre-processing to identify optimum format for machine learning and rule-based engine (for example, regular expressions). • Develop benchmark for manual performance. Statistical sampling: • Random sampling of cases, identify strata and use stratified examples to refine cases. • Adjust weights to oversample relevant minority classes to improve model performance. • Create rule-based models at sentence, paragraph, clause levels. This will guide machine learning input. • Evaluate utility of ML models that can represent context (for example, explore application of transformer models). • Run and evaluate models against each other and against manual benchmarks. 77 Describe new knowledge; new or improved processes, services or goods This R&D work is part of the development of a new legislation lookup service aimed at a variety of users in New Zealand. Supporting activities • Engagement with authorities (for example, councils) and research institutes (for example BRANZ) • Engagement with legal expert data taggers • Planning, management, and coordination activities • Identifying the range of users and scoping work • Preliminary research and literature review (including key documents - building code, Building Act 2004, etc.) • Prototype design and development - system set up, pre & post processing • Documentation and reporting. Example 2Example 2 7677 A drone-based computer vision (CV) technology for wheat growing Projects An eligible & approved application Project identifier Drone based computer vision (CV) technology identifying wheat flowering stages Start date: 1 April 2023End date: 31 March 2026 Appendix Example 3 Project objective This project is aimed at the development of a computer vision (CV) based technology for identification of wheat flowering stages. This will help with detection of certain diseases and allow application of fungicides at the optimal time. Due to the growth patterns of the plants, there is often low spatial resolution as they overlap substantially. By combining 2 existing methods (2 different feature detection algorithms) we anticipate increasing the accuracy of automatic observation or decreasing the absolute error. Our prototypical detection algorithm needs to be robust enough to work in outdoor light conditions and other environmental variations. In recent years precision technology has been developed and used to accurately plan and manage operations in agriculture. We have set out to develop a precision technology service using CV for management of Fusarium head blight (FHB) in wheat. Fusarium head blight (FHB) Fusarium head blight of wheat, also known as head scab, is most easily recognised on immature heads where 1 or more spikelets in each head appear prematurely bleached. Sometimes large areas of heads may be affected, and where infection is severe, pink or orange spore masses can be seen on diseased spikelets. This disease can cause yield losses of 30-70% where conditions favour the disease, but more importantly grain from affected crops may be less palatable to stock than healthy grain and may contain mycotoxins. Wheat is most susceptible to primary infection during flowering when florets are infected, especially during wet, warm conditions. While most New Zealand wheat crops have a low risk of serious levels of FHB, climate change studies suggest that these conditions will become more prevalent throughout New Zealand, affecting areas like the South Island which were not previously affected. Overseas and New Zealand research suggests that some fungicides such as Bavistin and Folicur may control FHB if applied close to mid-flowering. This work is intended to create a new precision technology service using CV for optimising crop yield for wheat growers.  The project initially focuses on establishing technological feasibility of a fully automated heading stage monitoring system with computer vision using: • 4k drones, • convolutional neural networks (CNN), and • statistical modelling. If successful, later stages will go beyond monitoring with the addition of an agricultural expert recommender system. Core activity Development of CV model/machine learning (ML) algorithms The core activity is the development of a CV model and algorithms that can recognise the various stages of wheat ear development and identify indications of disease. This will involve an initial study to probe the known and unknown technological limitations of the proposed solution and ascertain if accurate monitoring is achievable under controlled conditions. The initial steps include lab tests under ideal conditions in combination with CV model development followed by further lab testing of the prototype under simulated suboptimal conditions including: Example 3 7879 • variation in lighting, • variation in camera angles, and • occlusion (eg simulating sudden wind gusts, effect of rainwater on the plants). The setup in the lab will utilise a single ultra-high resolution digital single lens reflex (DSLR) camera. This allows down sampling experiments to investigate resolution boundaries. The initial setup will have the plants on a turntable to take still images of plants from day 4 through to day 8 of the heading stage. (e.g. images every 6 hours in 45-degree increments). The initial convolutional neural networks (CNN) model will be set up after a literature review. It is likely this will be an off-the-shelf network (eg ImageNet, Yolov5, etc) that might be adapted with transfer learning on the last couple of layers. Later we will optimise accuracy with more specialised/sophisticated models for each processing step (pre-processing, feature detection, images segmentation etc). Following the initial lab tests, field trials will be undertaken to further develop the CV model and improve the accuracy under real environmental conditions. Scientific or technological uncertainty There are numerous applications of computer vision technology in agricultural automation. These include yield estimation, disease detection, and weed identification. Such methods tend to be based on: • colour segmentation, • spatio-temporal analysis, or • image segmentation. The main technological challenge that persists is when there is negligible colour difference between the object and its background. This is evident in the early growth stages of wheat where the new ears cannot be distinguished from the existing leaves. At onset of flowering the protruding part of the wheat ears may only take up a few pixels on an image and is difficult to distinguish by colour from other parts of the plant, so the existing camera specifications (height, placement and image resolution) may have an impact on our ability to determine heading stages. There is natural colour variation due to changes in the lighting conditions. Under real conditions, drones are limited by a minimum altitude. This creates a trade-off between image resolution and object distance. The boundaries of these parameters are unknown for our application, and it is not clear if ear detection accuracy under suboptimal conditions will be sufficient. The aim is to identify the time when 75% of the plants have passed from Feekes 10.5.0 (where the wheat head has completely emerged) to Feekes 10.51 (the beginning of flowering). The flowering begins in the middle of the head and progresses up and down the head. This is the optimal stage to apply fungicides to protect against head diseases. Applications earlier than this stage are not as effective as applications after this stage. There is a narrow time window of up to 7 days in which fungicide is most efficacious. Systematic approach to resolve uncertainty Year 1 – Laboratory research and model development (Milestones I, II, III) Milestone I - Laboratory (Lab) environment under ideal conditions to establish boundaries for parameters (image resolution, object distance). Off-the-shelf CNN model (eg ImageNet) with transfer learning on the last couple of layers, maybe Yolov5. Outcome: Go/no go decision on resolution and flight distance requirements. Milestone II - Machine learning (ML) model development. Pixel level segmentation: • use Amazon MTurk to prepare training, validation and test data • test feasibility using existing models/frameworks, eg Detectron to analyse segmentation results, eg ROC chart (sensitivity versus specificity). Investigate a variety of feature detection algorithms. Outcome: ML model optimised for ideal conditions and learnings for strategy to improve monitoring accuracy in outdoor conditions. Aim: 70-80% accuracy for lab conditions. Milestone III - Simulate real environmental conditions in the lab including lighting, rainwater on the lens/plants, effect of plants moving in wind (sudden gusts), occlusion. This stage includes further model refinement. Outcome: reports and recommendation for business decision to continue with field trials. Aim 90% accuracy for simulated non-ideal conditions. Year 2 – New Zealand field trials and model development (Milestone IV) Milestone IV - New Zealand Field trials & model refinement. A test field to be prepared which will be used for the trails. Testing potential flight patterns to discover optimal path. Testing on larger scale. Outcome: real world data, first CV model optimised for real New Zealand conditions, go/no go decision for Australian field trials. Aim to achieve 90% accuracy for real conditions. Year 3 – Australian field trials and model development (Milestone V) Milestone V - Australian field trials & final model refinement. If New Zealand field trials are successful, we will undertake Australian field trials. This will provide data for Australian environmental conditions, further increase robustness of the CV model and prepare future use of this new service in the Australian market. Aim to achieve >95% accuracy. Describe new knowledge; new or improved processes, services or goods The aim is to make the results of our R&D available as a new monitoring service for New Zealand and international wheat growers. There are many existing CV-based methods but none that can easily observe low-contrast scenarios. To our knowledge no ML models for determining head stages of wheat exist. There are no off-the-shelf commercial products that can be applied to such agricultural requirements. Supporting activities • Preliminary research including literature review of models for machine vision in outdoor environments • Plan lab research (DSLR camera, drone camera machine learning models). • Analyse data and report on results • Purchase test drones with 4k capability • Plan and conduct field trials in New Zealand and Australia.

The business would apply for an initial general approval for its activities, and then either apply for a variation of its approval (if materially different to the original application) or apply for a new approval of new activities. This appendix provides a summary of the core R&D activities, the uncertainties in the core activities and the systematic approach to the activities undertaken as the project progressed. It will guide you through the example and how this would form the respective parts of a general approval application. In addition, the diagram below shows how the core R&D activities extend across the product development life cycle. The stages of the product development lifecycle are included for reference purposes only and are not a required part of the RDTI. Describe the core activity The diagram below demonstrates that the core activity to resolve the STU for the location tracker antenna design and transmitting power starts in stage B and is expected to be completed during the third year. The initial ideation stage A when the product is being developed qualifies as a supporting activity as it is an essential precursory activity needed before the core R&D commences. Systematic approach The light and dark teal highlighted investigative steps help demonstrate a systematic approach to product development focusing on resolving the STU. Each are important pieces of information to demonstrate the Problem > R&D Plan > Investigate > Outcome, showing how aspects of a product specification can be interdependent and can pull against one another. Stage F: Manufacture Overview: The core activities Stage E: Optimisation Stage D: Development Stage C: Understanding Stage A: Ideation Year 1Year 2Year 3 Core: System Performance Core: DFM Core: Battery Life Core: Battery Solution Stage B: Technology Research Core: Antenna Design Supporting: Discovery & Planning R&D Example 4Example 4 8283 Project objective The company has identified a new niche product opportunity for a retail low-cost small satellite tracking device for remote areas with no access to other communication networks. The tracking device could be attached to an animal’s collar or on a person out hunting or tramping. The engineers have looked at the proposed product and have identified two main technological problems, antenna design and transmitting power. The team have some answers to solve these problems, but the risks of failure are high. Prior to investing in a full product development, the company undertakes R&D to reduce that risk. There may be no technical solution to achieve the aspired target performances. If the risks cannot be reduced, the product development will not start. Stage A: Ideation Pre-core activity Discovery and planning R&D for a new product opportunity A product manager describes a new product opportunity to the engineers whose literature searches did not identify an existing solution. The team worked through the technical requirements to produce a product specification and the engineers identified how the product technological uncertainties might be solved, developing a R&D plan for that purpose. If the antenna design fails, the project may be scrapped. This is preparation work before the start of the proposed core activity. It cannot be claimed as support activity unless the project goes ahead, and the core activity commences in stage B. Benchmarking the technological uncertainties 1. Publicly available We have researched similar product technology around the world and not found such an affordable, small, durable IoT tracking device for use in challenging outdoor situations and conditions with no access to other communication networks. 2. Competent professional test Our engineers have reviewed the specifications and do not know if it is possible to meet all the design constraints and are expecting to have to re- evaluate and experiment with unexpected solutions, changing the product design as the project progresses. Stage B: Technological R&D begins with antenna design Project objective The team is committed to the idea of this new product, with its first focus on undertaking R&D to explore the key features of antenna gain and transmit power, within the power constraints. Core activity Antenna design The product manager has defined an outline specification for the product to have an internal antenna of 3dBi gain and power with battery constraints of a size of 4cms by 3cms by 1cm and longevity of >5 years. Scientific or technological uncertainty The initial engineering hypothesis proposes a transmit power of 23dBm and an antenna gain of 3dBi. The question causing the technological uncertainty is can such a tracker target performance be achieved when attached to an animal or person and still achieve a suitable radiated power? One design is to use an internal patch antenna with a prototype transmitter and bench power supply. Systematic approach to resolve uncertainty We undertake the following activities: 1. Simulate potential antenna designs and transmitters by building 3D print mock-ups for different internal antenna designs and transmitters. 2. Test each design and identify which approach might reach the internal target specifications. 3. Consider using different antenna designs. Identify possible candidates and experiment to find out which antenna can achieve the required 3dB criteria. Describe new knowledge; new or improved processes, services or goods Applying advanced knowledge in antenna development, design a unique small internal antenna for a small IoT device for tracking animals or people in difficult terrain and weather conditions. The antenna must conform with product size, functionality, and longevity constraints, adapting technology in new ways. Example 4Example 4 8584 Stage C: Understanding Project objective The core activities focus on two areas in the context of all the product constraints; antenna design and the development of a battery solution. The antenna types need to include an external design option for flexibility to improve the feasibility of all other constraints and reduce the chance of product failure. Core activity Antenna design The antenna type, whether internal or external, needs to perform within a 3dB gain across the target frequencies and meet its target specification as a component of a product with other constraints. Scientific or technological uncertainty All other electronic and mechanical components, including the introduction of other transmitters, (Wi-Fi and Bluetooth) affect the performance of the proposed antenna. We expect significant performance degradation due to these constraints and the presence of interference between different or competing components. Systematic approach to resolve uncertainty 1. Develop systems designs by: • producing electronics/printed circuit boards (PCBs), and • creating 3D prints for each internal and external option. 2. Assemble designs and performance test on the system. 3. Simulate model antenna performance using new knowledge gained from physical experimentation. 4. Based on observed results iteratively change components and their placement in the design. 5. Pre-compliance test to find out if the designs are likely to pass regulatory requirements. Core activity Battery chemistry and design technology We estimate we need a specific energy density of more than 300Wh/kg and volumetric energy density of greater than 600Wh/L. This is beyond the current battery chemistry and design technology used for this type of product. Scientific or technological uncertainty Our battery chemist has a hypothesis that the tracker target performance may be possible using the new battery chemistry and design technology for electric vehicles (EV). Systematic approach to resolve uncertainty 1. At the direction of our NZ battery chemist, build battery test units in South Korea to investigate EV technology for use in an IoT tracker device. 2. Consider battery performance results by designing tracker prototypes to test performance. 3. For each design, the South Korean team undertakes pre-compliance tests to confirm the design may pass regulatory compliance. Describe new knowledge; new or improved processes, services or goods We are beginning the process of designing a small, PCB to test the antenna and its battery solution working together, applying other known science and technologies never used in such a product with such constraints. Alternative methods for the key product functions are evaluated against the criteria. Stage D: Development Project objective This is the main development stage where new technological uncertainty is created by upgrades made to the product specifications. These new constraints include a reduction in product size effecting the antenna and mechanical designs, and the uncertain impact on target battery life. Core activity Antenna design Despite an internal antenna preference, the IoT tracker device size has been reduced to 3cms by 2cms by 0.5cm, with an external antenna an acceptable option if no more than 2cms long. The transmitter team have achieved 30dBm rather than the original target of 23dBm. The core activity will: • investigate the performance impact of reducing the product size and using an external antenna • continue working on the design of an internal antenna. Scientific or technological uncertainty Technological uncertainty now arises from: • the design of the external antenna after reducing the device size and the size constraints • continuing experimentation on the internal antenna design with the more powerful transmitter. Systematic approach to resolve uncertainty 1. Design and measure the external antenna performance for a smaller product size and electronic design. 2. Investigate the internal antenna in the context of the improved transmitter power. Consider embedding the antenna in a panel (see the core activity Design for Manufacture (DFM) on page 88). 3. Assemble the designs and undertake system performance testing. 4. Simulate antenna performance based on new knowledge gained from physical experimentation. Core activity Battery life The transmitter results show it is possible to increase the transmit power to 30dBm. While the increased power improves the range of the antenna, it creates uncertainty in reaching the desired battery life. This needs further investigation to identify solutions. Example 4Example 4 8687 Scientific or technological uncertainty The new battery technology was designed for transmitter power of 23dBm whereas the new proposal to operate at 30dBm consumes more power, creating significant battery life uncertainty. We propose developing battery management algorithms to selectively shut down system components when not in use, expecting these shutdowns to have minimal performance impact on tracking the animals. Systematic approach to resolve uncertainty 1. Measure battery areas inside the product (i.e., space needed for battery). 2. Model power usage to estimate battery life and compare to other known measurements. 3. Estimate systems components to be shut down, creating software algorithms to manage power. 4. Test the proposed algorithms in both model simulations and benchmark measurements. Core activity Design for manufacture (DFM) The cost of goods sold (COGS) for building the product at less than $20 and an assembly time of 30s is 50% lower than similar sized company products. Establishing technological solutions to meet the target COGS may also impact the other technological uncertainties. Scientific or technological uncertainty Technological uncertainty arises during the manufacturing and assembly process, including the choice of durable low-cost materials. The antenna assembly is time consuming with mechanical components screwed together. Investigate changing the technological design to attach each section to the PCB, clipping together during assembly. This new assembly technique creates technological uncertainty when sealing the edges to achieve the original target specification of IP65. Robot automation could speed up assembly time and reduce cost. Systematic approach to resolve uncertainty 1. Benchmark and estimate the assembly time. 2. Develop new mechanical components for automated assembly using prototype tooling. 3. Investigate automated assembly methods to seal around the mechanical components. 4. Measure technological performance according to IP65 rating requirements for dust protection and waterproofing. 5. Measure the automated assembly time, increase the assembly speed, and observe the impact on technological performance. 6. Tune assembly methods and choose a sealing technique. Describe new knowledge; new or improved processes, services or goods At this stage upgrades are made to the product specifications with modifications to design constraints, including a reduction in product size affecting the antenna and mechanical designs, and solutions using planned shutdowns to optimise battery life. Costs are evaluated including alternate assembly alternatives. A viable product is identified for sale with most of the key STUs resolved. Stage E: Optimisation Project objective This activity seeks to resolve the remaining aspects of system uncertainty focusing on three principal areas; battery, DFM, and system performance. Core activity Battery life The component shut down algorithm (firmware) has increased the battery life. The product manager has reduced the target battery life from >5 years to >3 years. We are still 0.2 years short of the target battery life and will continue to work on algorithm improvement. Scientific or technological uncertainty Technological uncertainty arose due to the battery saving firmware improvements. The next step is to identify and selectively shut down components with no observable user impact to reach the >3-year target battery life. Systematic approach to resolve uncertainty 1. Identify product areas to shut down when not needed, even when impacting performance. Identify and model potential solutions to improve battery life. 2. Develop the battery management algorithms further while minimising user impact. 3. Test the algorithm changes iteratively to shut down different system components. Core activity Design for manufacture (DFM) The optimisation stage E technological design changes were successful. However, the manufacturer has advised some of the smaller mechanical components, e.g., injection mouldings are challenging to make, and the proposal is to use metal pins instead, creating further technological design uncertainty impacting antenna performance. Scientific or technological uncertainty The change of technological design has caused technological uncertainty by introducing metal components, impacting the antenna performance and product compliance.

Pre-compliance testing has revealed a weakness in the product’s mechanical shielding performance and improvements are proposed to increase performance success. Example 4Example 4 8889 Supporting activity System performance testing In the final optimisation stage pre-compliance and compliance testing is required for the new product candidate to complete the core R&D activity and ensure regulatory standards are met prior to commencing commercial production. Such tests are support activities to the extent of having the main purpose of completing the core R&D. This activity can also reveal more elements of a core activity if technological modifications are required to resolve newly discovered uncertainties. Scientific or technological uncertainty System uncertainty can arise for a new product where the components are known but the outcome is unknown until the entire system is complete. Pre-compliance tests are undertaken on the product’s regulatory constraints using the available test equipment to improve the chances of passing the requirements. Once the product has officially passed a region’s regulatory requirements, the technological uncertainties caused by those regulations are considered resolved. The engineers have reviewed the design and identified the riskiest aspects for the interference effects of the Wi-Fi transmitter and any weakness in electromagnetic interference (EMI) performance. The engineers suspect mechanical shielding improvements are needed. Systematic approach to resolve uncertainty 1. Build complete units for pre-compliance testing. Based on the results, make changes to the system including the mechanical shielding. 2. Build complete units for actual compliance testing, making final necessary design changes. Describe new knowledge; new or improved processes, services or goods At this stage algorithms are being fine-tuned, accepting product modifications to complete the R&D core activity and produce a new product.

The IoT tracker conforms to the final criteria for the product size, functionality, longevity, and price constraints, adapting old and recent science and technology in new ways. Regulatory compliance has been undertaken representing the final step for the new product. Stage F: Manufacture At this stage the product is being manufactured, is fit for first release and sale. The original product specification is partly amended, and the product manager yielded on some performance specifications. All the STUs are resolved, and the company is commercialising its R&D result.

Real estate sector the focus of new Inland Revenue campaign
===========================================================

**15 March 2021**

Inland Revenue is turning its hidden economy focus on to the real estate sector, including both the under reporting of income and the overstating of expenses.

Inland Revenue spokesperson Richard Owen says “Real estate is one area that is booming during COVID and our analysis of the sector suggests real estate salespeople/agents commonly claim high level of expenses relative to their income.

“Inland Revenue believes the issue is widespread and we must act. People are claiming private expenditure but not keeping logbooks or other business records to support the claim.

“If we are concerned that someone has overclaimed expenses, they will receive a letter from us requesting they prove the expenses claimed.  Things like bank statements, invoices, a logbook and any other information to confirm the expense is deductible.

“After all, tax pays for the essential things that make New Zealand a great place to live.  If we all pay our fair share there’ll be more money to help with things like the health and education systems.

“Inland Revenue is undertaking significant business transformation and modernisation of the tax revenue system.  One of the intended benefits is making more intelligent use of the big data we are collecting so we can identify trends in a timely manner.

“Our approach is to raise awareness and self-help materials first.  We would far rather encourage customers to do the right thing from the start.   In this respect we have several tools available to assist, including providing in house presentations.

“So, we recommend people approach us before we contact them”, Richard Owen says.

As a business owner, you can also tell Inland Revenue voluntarily about your own tax situation especially if you think there’s something wrong with your tax returns because you’ve overclaimed expenses [https://www.ird.govt.nz/tasks/make-a-voluntary-disclosure](https://www.ird.govt.nz/tasks/make-a-voluntary-disclosure)
 .”

If you think someone’s not being honest about their tax you can anonymously report tax evasion [https://www.classic.ird.govt.nz/tax-crime/report/report-tax-evasion.html](https://www.classic.ird.govt.nz/tax-crime/report/report-tax-evasion.html)

Inland Revenue is also working with the Real Estate Authority (REA) and the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand (REINZ) to engage and educate their members.

[Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2011](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-tax-administration-and-remedial-matters-act-2011 "Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2011")

Rearrangement of forestry interests to facilitate a treaty settlement
=====================================================================

2011 amendment covers income exemption following the rearrangement of forestry interests to facilitate a treaty settlement. Applies from 1 April 1995.

**_Sections CW 1B, DP 9B and DP 11(4B) of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections CW 1B, DP 8B and DP 10(4B) of the Income Tax Act 2004; and sections CB 17 and DL 1(16), (17) and (18) of the Income Tax Act 1994_**

Income tax legislation is amended to provide for the exemption of any income which arises when a forestry interest is extinguished and re-granted solely for the purposes of facilitating a Treaty of Waitangi claim settlement process. These amendments were introduced by Supplementary Order Paper No. 254 during the passage of the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Bill.

### Background

Many Treaty of Waitangi settlements involve forestry land owned by the Crown over which forestry interests have been granted to commercial foresters.

#### _Original situation_

![Diagram illustrating the original situation of forestry interests.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/5/5/55c2dc8048e2dce0b279ba3b74528e99/original-situation.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214415&hash=6E6172566120673BC3639D9A45560A7F)

This issue will usually arise with land which is in Crown ownership. It may also arise when the land is held by an interim entity to facilitate the Treaty process at the time of the surrender. The new legislation is designed to deal with both situations.

These large blocks of land sometimes need to be divided into smaller blocks of land which will then be transferred to different iwi claimant groups. To enable each of those iwi claimant groups to manage their relationships with the commercial foresters separately, the commercial foresters are being asked to surrender their existing interests in exchange for the issue of multiple interests. These multiple interests will have the same basic terms and cover in aggregate the same area as the original right, but match the new land boundaries for individual blocks.

#### _Future situation_

![Diagram illustrating the future situation of forestry interests.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/f/2/f25b038048e2e152b287ba3b74528e99/future-situation.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214414&hash=7320381E381271FF27068A9CB744675F)

Under the law which existed prior to this amendment, a tax liability could arise when the commercial foresters surrender their original forestry interests with no immediate offsetting deduction for the grant of the replacement forestry interests. A tax liability may also arise to the person who grants the new rights. Taxation of these transactions which take place purely to facilitate Treaty settlements and which are not motivated by the commercial interests of the parties was not consistent with the policy intent of the original legislation.

### Key features

A new exempt income rule is created which treats any income arising from a rearrangement of existing forestry rights to enable the implementation of a Treaty settlement as exempt income.

### Application date

The amendments apply from 1 April 1995.

### Detailed analysis

For the purposes of this section, the Income Tax Act 2007 statutory references are used, although the amendments to the 2004 and 1994 acts are identical.

Section CB 24 provides that an amount derived from disposing of a right to take timber is income.

New section CW 1B provides that this income is exempt income where:

1.  the sole reason for the new rights replacing the old right is to facilitate a Treaty of Waitangi claim settlement process; and
2.  the rights and obligations of the new rights are equivalent to the old rights, ignoring differences that are solely for the reason set out in the paragraph above.

These paragraphs restrict the exemption to situations where the sole reason for the new rights replacing the old rights is to facilitate a Treaty settlement. This means that the exemption will not apply where old rights are replaced with new rights for another reason, such as where the parties wish to enter into new commercial arrangements.

The exemption will also not apply if the parties take the opportunity of the issue of the new rights to simultaneously document new commercial arrangements which are over and above replacing the existing rights.

However, there are four situations where what might appear to be differences between the old right and the new rights will still fall within the exemption.

The first is where the old right was a Crown Forestry Licence, and the new right is a forestry right under the Forestry Rights Registration Act. This change is made in reflection of the fact that the land-owner when the original right was granted was the Crown, but the new land-owner will be iwi. This difference falls within the last part of paragraph b) - it is solely for the reason in paragraph a) - so the exemption applies.

The second situation is where the old right was a Crown Forestry Licence and a new forestry right under the Forestry Rights Registration Act is granted over part of the land the Crown Forestry Licence originally covered, with the remainder of the land still being subject to the Crown Forestry Licence. In this case, the exemption is still available because the person holding the rights has the same rights and obligations after the transaction as before it.

The third situation is where the new rights contain additional provisions which deal with wahi tapu - culturally sensitive areas comprised in the area which the forestry rights cover. Variations of this sort are also considered to fall within the exemption, as they are made to facilitate the Treaty of Waitangi claim settlement process.

The fourth situation is where variations to the original rights, such as giving the ability to replant, have been agreed between the commercial forester and the iwi which eventually acquires the land prior to the grant of the replacement rights (and these variations constitute rights in themselves). These variations are not documented in the original rights, but may be documented in the replacement rights. If this occurs, then the exemption is still available. This is because the test compares the rights which existed prior to the redocumentation with the rights which existed afterwards - where those rights were documented is not relevant.

Receivers liable to return and pay GST on mortgagee sale
========================================================

2011 case note - receivers liable to return and pay GST on mortgagee sale - GST, special return, caveat, liability.

Case

Simpson and Downes as receivers of Capital + Merchants Investments Ltd (in receivership) v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985

### Summary

Messrs Simpson and Downes, as receivers of Capital + Merchants Investments Ltd (in receivership), were personally liable to account to the Commissioner for the output tax on mortgagee sales.

### Impact of decision

The Court affirmed a purposive approach to the interpretation of tax statutes.

A receiver of a mortgagee must personally account to the Commissioner for any output tax on any mortgagee sales and, it appears, must file the special return required by s 17 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) as the person "selling the goods".

### Facts

On 18 December 2006 Capital + Merchants Investments Limited (CMI) entered into a general security agreement in favour of Fortress Credit Corporation (Fortress) over all the assets of CMI. These assets included loans to five different borrowers, secured by mortgages over six properties.

After CMI defaulted on its obligations to Fortress, Richard Simpson and Tim Downes of Grant Thorton were appointed receivers ("the Receivers") of CMI on 23 November 2007. There were instances of default by the mortgagors and the Receivers exercised the powers of sale contained in the mortgages. CMI's indebtedness exceeded the gross realisation of all assets including the proceeds of the mortgagee sales.

GST was charged on each mortgagee sale. CMI completed s 17 of the GST Act special returns but did not pay the output tax returned in those returns.

### Decision

Having traversed the factual background, the Court turned to consider the approach to the interpretation of taxing statutes. Having considered the Supreme Court decision in _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd & Ors v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_, the Court concluded that both judgments (the minority and majority) in _Ben Nevis_ recognised the appropriateness of a purposive interpretation to specific taxing statutes.

The Court then went on to consider s 5(2) of the GST Act and determined that the evident purpose of the subsection is to address the consequences of supplies occurring where the owner has granted security and the secured creditor effects the supply of the goods to a third party (ie, the secured creditor realises his/her/its security).

The aim of the provision is to match a buyer's entitlement to an input credit against the seller's obligation to account for output tax on the sale. To facilitate this matching, s 5(2) deems supplies in the name of the secured creditor to be supplies by the mortgagor. The critical element is not the identity of the person empowered to sell, but the identity of the person practically responsible for the power of sale being exercised.

The Court found that, were it necessary, it would be prepared to consider adopting the wider interpretation of s 5(2) that in circumstances such as the present, receivers would have standing as the "second person" where they exercised commercial and practical control over the transaction involving a taxable supply.

The Court, however, went on to determine the case on the basis of ss 17 and 58(1A) of the GST Act.

Section 17 imposes an obligation to file a special return on the "person selling the goods", whether or not the person is registered. The Court considered that it is a "fair assumption" that Parliament imposed this obligation because of an expectation that the person completing the return and effecting the sale will be the person who has received the consideration for the supply, including the GST.

The Court considered it relevant that caveats were lodged by Fortress on the properties and that Fortress purported to make it a condition of providing releases of the caveats that it be paid all monies available from the mortgagee sale, including any amounts paid by the purchaser in relation to GST. However, CMI as the mortgagee was only entitled to the net proceeds of the mortgagee sale after the payment of all expenses (which include GST, see _Edgewater v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_). Fortress could not assert any claim greater than that of CMI, which it was purporting to do by making the release of the caveats conditional on payment of all monies including the GST.

The Court went on to consider the further argument of the Commissioner that the Receivers were personally liable under common law and the equitable doctrine of the duty to account.

The Court accepted that, in public policy terms, it is undesirable to permit receivers to charge GST and pay that GST to their appointer (Fortress) when the mortgagee (CMI) would be required to pay the GST as an expense of sale to the Commissioner (_Edgewater_). This would demonstrate an indifference to the consequences for CMI (mortgagee) of being found in breach of obligations to account for the GST. The prospect of abuse of the provisions of the GST Act by engineering a receivership for the sake of the GST premium on recoveries in such situations and the equivalent cost to Inland Revenue could not be lightly dismissed.

The Court, however, was reluctant to impose a liability on the Receivers merely as a matter of public policy. The Court went on to consider, with it being inappropriate to attempt any definitive ruling without further evidence and argument, that there may be a credible cause of action against the Receivers in tort for having procured or been a party to a breach of a statutory duty.

Ultimately, the Court did not need to reach a decision that the Receivers were personally liable on these grounds as it had already found the Receivers liable under ss 5(2), 17 and 58 of the GST Act.

The Court concluded that the answer to the Receivers' application for directions was that they are liable to account to the Commissioner for the GST charged as an output tax on the respective sales of the relevant properties.

Receivers obliged to pay GST on mortgagee sales
===============================================

2012 case note – receivers obliged to pay GST on mortgagee sales to the CIR - creditor, liability, receivership.

Case

Simpson and Downes as receivers of Capital & Merchant Investments Ltd (in receivership) v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, Receiverships Act 1993, Property Law Act 2007

### Summary

This case was an appeal from the High Court which had found the receivers were personally liable for goods and services tax ("GST") payable by Capital & Merchants Investments Ltd (in receivership) ("CMI") in relation to five mortgagee sales. The Court of Appeal held that the receivers do not have "personal liability" for the payment to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue of GST payable by CMI but are obliged as receivers of CMI to pay GST to the Commissioner.

### Impact of decision

This decision confirms that receivers are not "personally liable" for payments of GST when conducting mortgagee sales as agents of companies in receivership. However, the receivers are obliged to pay GST on mortgagee sales to the Commissioner.

### Facts

Capital & Merchant Investments Ltd was placed into receivership by the general security agreement holder, Fortress Credit Corporation (Australia) II Pty Ltd ("Fortress"). Simpson and Downes, of Grant Thornton New Zealand Ltd, was appointed as receivers.

Five properties, which CMI held mortgages over, were sold by mortgagee sale and GST was incurred in respect of each sale. CMI filed returns under section 17 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ("GST Act") but no GST was paid with the returns.

The Commissioner and the receivers agreed that the receivers would pay GST to the Commissioner and the receivers would apply to the High Court for directions under the Receiverships Act 1993. The issue agreed upon in the application to the High Court was whether the receivers had "personal liability" to the Commissioner for the GST payable by CMI in relation to the mortgagee sales. If the receivers were not personally liable, the GST would be refunded within seven days.

The High Court[1](#1)
 found the receivers had "personal liability" to the Commissioner for the GST incurred in the five mortgagee sales. The receivers appealed to the Court of Appeal.

### Issues

The Court of Appeal considered three issues:

1.  Did the receivership of CMI mean that the Commissioner became an unsecured creditor for the GST with Fortress, as secured creditor, entitled to receive the GST in priority?
2.  Did the receivers have "personal liability" to pay the GST to the Commissioner as the High Court held?
3.  What answer should be given to the agreed issue in the context of an application for directions under section 34 of the Receiverships Act 1993?

### Decision

#### _Does CMI's receivership mean Fortress is entitled to GST?_

The Court determined that Fortress was not entitled to the GST and CMI was liable for the GST for the following reasons:

*   Even though CMI, as a finance company, was not registered for GST they were still required to pay the GST. This is because under sections 5(2) and 17 of the GST Act, CMI was required to return and pay the GST regardless of whether it was registered for GST or not.
*   Under section 185 of the Property Law Act 2007, CMI must pay all amounts reasonably paid by CMI "with a view to the realisation of the security", which includes the GST.
*   Lastly, GST paid to a mortgagee on a mortgagee sale must be paid by the mortgagee to the Commissioner.

Applying _Edgewater_ [2](#2)
, the GST payment must be made to the Commissioner as a cost of sale and "simply does not reach the general funds of the mortgagee". The differences between section 104 of the Land Transfer Act 1952 (which has been repealed) and section 185 of the Property Law Act 2007 (which replaced section 104) are immaterial.

The Court found that the application of sections 5(2) and 17 of the GST Act and section 185 of the Property Law Act 2007 in accordance with _Edgewater_ is not altered by the appointment of receivers because of the following:

*   The judgment in _Edgewater_ makes it clear that there is no policy in the GST Act of protecting secured creditors and the Commissioner is in a better position than secured creditors with respect to GST.
*   Under clause 12.1 of the general security agreement between Fortress and CMI, Fortress was entitled to receive the "net proceeds of the sale" which excludes GST and any other payments made to third parties on the sales of the properties. Fortress therefore had no contractual right to the GST payments on the mortgagee sales and the GST payment must be made to the Commissioner as separate from the general funds of the mortgagee. The GST simply did not reach the general funds of the mortgagee.
*   The Court distinguished the facts of _Stiassny_[3](#3)
     because that case did not involve a mortgagee sale nor the application of section 185 of the Property Law Act 2007. The Court also distinguished the Australian case of _PM Developments_ [4](#4)
     because in that case there was no provision equivalent to section 185.
*   The view that as a matter of principle a receiver is obliged to account to the Commissioner for the GST received on a mortgagee sale is consistent with the English case of _Sargent v Customs and Excise Commissioners_ [5](#5)
     and there is force in the view that a receiver is obliged to pay GST even if no personal liability is imposed.

Because of these reasons, the Court found that the receivers were obliged to pay the Commissioner GST under sections 5(2) and 17 of the GST Act and not to the secured creditor. The terms of agreement by which the secured creditor released its caveats could not influence the application of the statutory provisions.

#### _The personal liability of the receivers_

The Court did not consider the receivers had "personal liability" for the payment of GST:

*   Section 58(1) of the GST Act provides that a receiver is personally liable for the payment of GST incurred during the receivership; this does not apply to a mortgagee sale made by a company not carrying on a taxable activity and therefore is not relevant in this case.
*   Section 5(2) requires that goods shall be deemed to be sold by the first person (the mortgagor) if sold by a second person who can exercise the power to sell the property. The receivers were acting as agents of CMI and therefore could not be the person by whom the power to sell can be exercised as referred to in section 5(2).
*   Section 17 requires that "the person selling the goods" file a return and pay GST. As agents for CMI, the receivers did not, themselves, sell the properties. Therefore, the receivers have no personal liability to pay the GST.
*   Because section 51B only applies to Parts 3 and 6 of the GST Act, and not to section 58, CMI cannot be deemed to be a registered person for the purposes of section 58.
*   CMI was never registered for GST and never conducted any taxable activity in its own right. The mortgagee sale was taxable activity of the mortgagor (the first person) under section 5(2), not CMI.
*   Finally, because the receivers have an obligation to pay GST to the Commissioner under sections 5(2) and 17 of the GST Act and section 185 of the Property Law Act 2007, it is unnecessary to impose personal liability on the receivers. It would be unlikely that Parliament would intend liability under the GST Act to be implied.

#### _The answer to the agreed issue_

Simpson and Downes, as receivers of CMI, does not have "personal liability" for payment to the Commissioner of the GST payable by CMI.

However, the Court found that, while the agreed issue referred to the "personal liability" of the receivers in their capacity "as receivers" to account for the GST, in the view of the Court, the question is whether the receivers "as receivers" are obliged to account. The Court found that the receivers are obliged to account to the Commissioner for the GST received.

The Court took a wide interpretation of section 34 of the Receiverships Act 1993, approached the issue as a matter of substance over form and gave a direction that Simpson and Downes, as receivers of CMI, is obliged to pay the GST received on the five mortgagee sales to the Commissioner.

Te whiwhi painga kaupapa hea ā-kaimahi Receiving employee share scheme benefits
===============================================================================

If you receive shares in your employer's company for free or below market value because of your employment relationship then you will generally have an employee share scheme (ESS) benefit.

If, instead of receiving an ESS benefit in shares, you receive a payment for the cancellation or transfer of your shares or share rights, that payment will be an ESS benefit.

The benefit is treated as income
--------------------------------

Regardless of whether you receive shares or cash, your ESS benefit is treated as income.

The amount of income you receive is broadly equal to the market value of the shares on the share scheme taxing date less any amount paid for the shares or share rights.

However, if your shares or share rights are cancelled or transferred to a non-associated person, it is the amount you received for the cancellation or transfer less any amount you paid for the shares or share rights.

An ESS benefit is treated as your income even if the benefit is provided to an associate of yours (for example your spouse or family trust).

Paying tax
----------

In most cases your employer will report the value of your ESS benefit to us in their employment information.

In some situations your employer must deduct tax from your ESS benefit. In other situations your employer can choose whether to deduct tax. If they do not deduct tax, you are responsible for paying tax on this benefit at the end of the year.

The exception is if you receive shares under an exempt ESS, in which case the benefit is exempt income. This means you do not need to include it in your income tax return or pay tax on it.

[Exempt ESS](/employing-staff/deductions-from-other-payments/exempt-employee-share-schemes)

Separating out non-taxable income
---------------------------------

If, during the time you earn your ESS benefit, you are non-resident and not receiving New Zealand sourced employment income, then part of your ESS benefit will be treated as non-residents' foreign-sourced income. This means it is not taxable in New Zealand.

Use this formula to work out the amount of your ESS benefit that is not taxable.

Benefit before reduction x offshore period ÷ earning period

The **benefit before reduction** is the total value of the ESS benefit.

The **offshore period** is the amount of time you were both a non-resident and any income received from your employer was foreign-sourced.

The **earning period** is the period the benefit was earned over (this period usually ends with the vesting of the shares or rights to shares and typically starts on the grant date).

Example: Carey is employed by Parent Co in Australia

On 1 January 2019 Carey is employed by Parent Co in Australia. She is granted Restricted Stock Units (RSU) at no cost for 100 shares vesting over a 1-year period in December 2019.

On 1 March 2019 she moves to New Zealand to work for Child Co (a subsidiary of Parent Co). The RSU vesting arrangement stays the same.

On the 31 December 2019, 100 shares vest with a market value of $1.50 each.

$150 (benefit before reduction) x 59 (1 January to 28 February - offshore period) ÷ 365 (1 January to 31 December - earning period) = $24.25

The $24.25 is treated as non-residents’ foreign-sourced income and is not taxed. The remaining $125.75 is taxable.

--------------------------------------------

After the end of the tax year we work out if you’ve paid the right amount of tax. Either we automatically assess you, or you need to file an IR3 return.

You will receive an automatic income tax assessment when both of the following apply.

*   Your employer has provided us with the taxable value of your ESS benefit.
*   You have no other reason to file an IR3.

You should file an IR3 if either of the following apply:

*   Your employer has not provided us with the taxable value of your ESS benefit.
*   You want to change the value of the ESS benefit reported by your employer because part of it is non-residents' foreign sourced income and not taxable in New Zealand.

Any dividends paid to you will form part of your taxable income and should be included in your tax assesment in the year you received them. 

### Transitional residents

If you are a transitional resident, make sure you know about any tax liability you have for ESS benefits received. To the extent your ESS benefit is New Zealand sourced income you will need to pay tax in New Zealand. To the extent your ESS benefit is foreign sourced it may not be taxable.

### Provisional tax implications

You may have provisional tax to pay if both of the following apply.

*   You receive an ESS benefit where tax is not deducted.
*   Tax to pay on your ESS benefit is more than $5,000.

Read more on our Tax Technical website about when you may need to pay provisional tax.

[QB 23/05: Provisional tax – impact on salary or wage earners who receive a one-off amount of income without tax deducted](http://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/-/media/project/ir/tt/pdfs/questions-we-ve-been-asked/2023/qb-23-05.pdf?modified=20230512033445&modified=20230512033445)

ESS benefits affect deductions and entitlements
-----------------------------------------------

Your ESS benefit may affect your other deductions and entitlements. This is because it is treated as income for:

*   student loan repayment deductions
*   child support payments
*   FamilyBoost
*   Working for Families entitlements.

If you're entitled to FamilyBoost or Working for Families, you need to let us know about your ESS benefits. If you wait for this information to come from your employer, you may have to pay us back.

Voluntary disclosures
---------------------

If you have not told us about ESS benefits received from past years, let us know as soon as you can so we can fix it. You may wish to make a voluntary disclosure.

Recent weather events - Cyclone Gabrielle update
================================================

20 February 2023

Important Update

On 15 February 2023, Minister of Agriculture, Damien O’Connor, and Minister for Rural Communities, Kieran McAnulty, declared a large-scale adverse event for the Northland, Auckland, Waikato, Bay of Plenty, Gisborne and Hawke’s Bay regions and Tararua district because of Cyclone Gabrielle. 

On 20 February 2023 Cyclone Gabrielle was declared to be an emergency event for the purposes of use of money interest remission (UOMI) rules. This declaration allows Inland Revenue to remit interest charges on late payments of tax. The declaration identified the Northland, Auckland, Waikato, Bay of Plenty, Gisborne and Hawke’s Bay regions and Tararua district as affected areas. 

There is also localised flooding and damage across other regions and districts which is affecting customers’ ability to comply with their tax obligations, including filing and paying on time. 

If you or your clients have been affected, you do not need to call us right now – focus on the clean-up – but when you are able to please contact us in myIR using the word ‘cyclone’ or call us on our disaster line 0800 473 566.  Using these communication methods allows us to prioritise our support to affected customers. 

We have a range of relief available to customers affected by adverse events.

[Tax relief for emergency events](/topics/tax-relief-for-emergency-events)
 

The following is an outline of the additional support and relief we have made available to customers affected by Cyclone Gabrielle, it is also in addition to relief made available for earlier weather events.

Interest remission
------------------

The declaration of Cyclone Gabrielle as an emergency event allows affected customers remission of use of money interest (UOMI) on late payments of tax until 30 June 2023. Remission applies to taxpayers who have been adversely affected by the event. 

[Tax Administration (February Cyclone Event) Order 2023](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2023/0010/latest/whole.html?search=y_regulation%40regulation_2023__rc%40rinf%40rnif_an%40bn%40rn_25_a&p=1#LMS817299)

31 March filing date 
---------------------

There is no extension of the 31 March 2023 due date for 2022 income tax returns, however customers affected by the recent adverse weather can apply for remission of any late filing penalties after they have filed their return. 

Tax agents can use our deferral status (D-status) tool to delay the automated policing of their overdue returns because of exceptional circumstances. D-status also removes the affected clients from the agent’s filing percentage. 

Cost of Living payments 
------------------------

There is no extension of the 31 March 2023 requirement for a customer to file their 2022 individual income tax return - IR3 in order to be entitled to the Cost of Living payment. 

Donated trading stock 
----------------------

The donated trading stock concession has been extended from 31 March 2023 to 31 March 2024. The temporary relief ensures that donations of trading stock to approved donee organisations and public authorities will qualify for an income tax deduction. Disposals of trading stock below market value to other non-associated organisations will benefit from relief from the anti-avoidance rule, but will only qualify for an income tax deduction if they can show they have a business purpose for making the disposal.

Tax relief for donations of trading stock

Donations and donee organisations 
----------------------------------

We understand that people want to help out their fellow New Zealanders affected by Cyclone Gabrielle. If you’re supporting by making donations, you may be entitled to a tax credit if you donate to an approved donee organisation. 

Find out more, including whether the organisation you’re giving to is an approved donee organisation.

[Tax credits for donations](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/individual-tax-credits/tax-credits-for-donations)

[Donee organisations](https://myir.ird.govt.nz/tools/?LINK=DONREQ)

Income equalisation 
--------------------

To help affected farmers and growers we are allowing late deposits for the 2022 year and early withdrawals from the income equalisation scheme. We have made a 'class of case' determination for the affected regions that qualify for an early refund however affected customers outside of these regions can still make a case-by-case deposit or refund application. 

[Deposits](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/income-equalisation-scheme/deposits)

The rain and flooding will affect farmers and growers' income for the 2023 income year. Late deposits for the 2022 year can be made until 30 June 2023. 

[Refunds](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/income-equalisation-scheme/refunds)

Early refunds of deposits will be allowed. Normally income equalisation deposits are not available for refund until 12 months after the deposit is made. However, we do have discretion to allow early refunds, particularly in the case of a medium or large-scale adverse event or when the person is suffering serious hardship.   
  
All applications for an early refund must be in writing and will take approximately 20 days to process. It should be remembered that the refund will be income in the year that the application is made unless it is elected to treat the refund as income in the prior income year where the application for refund is made in the specified period.   
  
For more information on income equalisation and deposits refer to

Recent weather events - Cyclone Gabrielle update
================================================

20 February 2023

If you have been affected by the recent cyclones and adverse weather you might be worried about not being able to file or pay your taxes on time. You do not need to call us right now. Focus on the clean-up. When you are able to, please contact us in myIR including the word ‘cyclone’ or call us on our disaster line 0800 473 566.

If you are impacted by these weather events, see what support is available for you.

[Tax relief for emergency events](/topics/tax-relief-for-emergency-events)

Penalties and interest
----------------------

If you let us know as soon as you reasonably can that you’ve been affected by either cyclone or the January floods, we can then later remove any late filing and payment penalties, and some interest. You’ll need to ask us to do this after you’ve paid the core tax in a reasonable time.

For Cyclone Hale we can remove interest charged up to 31 March 2023 if you’re in the Northland, Coromandel, Gisborne, Wairoa or Wairarapa districts.

[Tax Administration (January Cyclone Event) Order 2023 – New Zealand Legislation](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2023/0001/latest/whole.html?search=y_regulation%40regulation_2023__rc%40rinf%40rnif_an%40bn%40rn_25_a&p=1#LMS807457)

For the January 2023 floods we can remove interest charged up to 30 April 2023 if you’re in the Northland, Auckland, Waikato or Bay of Plenty regions.

[Tax Administration (January Flood Events) Order 2023 – New Zealand Legislation](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2023/0003/latest/whole.html?search=y_regulation%40regulation_2023__rc%40rinf%40rnif_an%40bn%40rn_25_a&p=1#LMS813765)

For Cyclone Gabrielle we can remove interest charged up to 30 June 2023 if you’re in the Northland, Auckland Waikato, Bay of Plenty, Gisborne or Hawke’s Bay region, or the Tararua district.

[Tax Administration (February Cyclone Event) Order 2023 – New Zealand Legislation](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2023/0010/latest/whole.html?search=y_regulation%40regulation_2023__rc%40rinf%40rnif_an%40bn%40rn_25_a&p=1#LMS817299)

We also know that there has been localised flooding and damage across other regions and districts. If that’s you, get in touch and we can see how we can help.

At any time you can set up an instalment arrangement in myIR to pay us over time. This means you won’t get any additional penalties in the first place.

Donations and donee organisations
---------------------------------

If you make a monetary donation to an approved charity or organisation you may be entitled to a tax credit. 

Find out more, including whether the organisation you’re giving to is an approved organisation.

[Approved donee organisations](https://myir.ird.govt.nz/tools/?LINK=DONREQ)

Income equalisation Scheme
--------------------------

To help affected farmers and growers we are allowing late deposits for the 2022 year and early withdrawals from the income equalisation scheme.

[Income equalisation scheme](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/income-equalisation-scheme)

Donated trading stock
---------------------

Normally if you give goods away you still have to pay tax as if you’d sold them, but until 31 March 2024 you might be entitled to some tax relief.

This area is quite complex and you should speak with your accountant or tax agent.

Reconstruction under the "dividend stripping" provision upheld
==============================================================

2014 case note – CIR's reconstruction under the dividend stripping rule upheld - tax avoidance, shortfall penalties for taking an abusive tax position.

Case

TRA 001/13 \[2014\] NZTRA 04

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2004, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") upheld the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's ("the Commissioner's") assessment to reconstruct the disputants' income under section GB 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004.

### Impact of decision

This is the first case in which the Commissioner's reconstruction under the dividend stripping rule in section GB 1(3) has been upheld by the Courts and it reconfirms established principles around the wide powers of reconstruction under section GB 1.

### Facts

The disputants ("Mr and Mrs G") were the directors and shareholders of A Limited ("Holdings") and X Limited ("Specialists").

In the 2007 year, Holdings returned a taxable profit of $558,047 and had retained profits of $1,856,277. Mr G returned taxable income of $49,023 in the 2007 year but funded his lifestyle by drawing down funds from his shareholder account in Holdings. By the 2007 year, his shareholder account was overdrawn by $1,079,657.

Specialists owned a separate business venture and in the 2007 year returned a taxable profit of $653,906 but had accumulated losses of $2,237,166.

In December 2006 (after receiving tax advice), the disputants incorporated Q Limited ("Group"). On 1 February 2007, the disputants sold their shares in Holdings to Group for $1.84 million. Group funded the purchase of the shares by obtaining a loan from the disputants on a payable on demand basis.

The disputants treated the amounts they received from the sale of their shares in Holdings to Group as being capital in nature. Mr G's overdrawn shareholder current account liabilities in Holdings were repaid and funds were credited to shareholder accounts in Group. There was a further $521,913 available to be drawn down by the disputants in the future.

Specialists issued 1,949,900 shares in Holdings at a purchase price of $1,949,900 and capitalised an existing loan of $2,024,900. Specialists and Holdings agreed to set off the purchase price of $1,949,900 against the existing loan debt of $2,024,900. The Commissioner voided the arrangement under section BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and then assessed the disputants in the 2007 year on the basis that the consideration received for the sale of their shares in Holdings was in substitution for a dividend under the "dividend stripping rule" in section GB 1(3).

The disputants admitted that the sale of their shares in Holdings to Group was a tax avoidance arrangement under section BG 1. The challenge proceedings were filed on the basis that the Commissioner's reconstruction under section GB 1(3) was wrong, because the effect of section BG 1 was to void the transaction in its entirety so that there was no remaining tax advantage to the disputants. The disputants also challenged the imposition of shortfall penalties for taking an abusive tax position.

### Decision

Sinclair DCJ began by referring to the following relevant legal principles in relation to the Commissioner's power to counteract a tax advantage obtained under a tax avoidance arrangement:

1.  Pursuant to section BG 1, a tax avoidance arrangement is void as against the Commissioner for income tax purposes; TRA 001/13 \[2014\] NZTRA 04 (the judgment) at \[17\], but that section BG 1 does not in itself create a liability for income tax; \[17\]
2.  That the Commissioner may counteract a tax advantage obtained by a person under a tax avoidance arrangement under section BG 1(2); and that, under section GB 1(1), the Commissioner may exercise her reconstructive powers in the manner as she thinks appropriate \[18\]; but that she does not have to base the adjustment on a hypothetical arrangement that the taxpayer may have entered into in the absence of the tax arrangement \[21\] (see also _Accent Management Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2007) 23 NZTC 21,323 (CA);
3.  Under section GB 1(3), consideration under a sale of shares is deemed to be a dividend if the sale is part of a tax avoidance arrangement and some or all of the consideration received in the opinion of the Commissioner, represents, is equivalent to, or is in substitution for an amount which the person would, might be expected to, or in all likelihood would have derived as a dividend in that tax year or subsequent years, if the arrangement had not been entered into \[23\].

Her Honour rejected the disputants' submission that no tax advantage remained to be counteracted (they submitted that the effect of section BG 1 was that the loans owing to Holdings and Specialists remained owing and to be paid for income tax purposes). Sinclair DCJ held that section BG 1(1) voids the tax effect of the arrangement but does not void the underlying transaction as between the parties.

Her Honour noted that the purpose of section BG 1, and related reconstruction provisions, is to remove the tax advantage. In the present case, the sale of the shares had the effect of crediting the disputants' current accounts so that Mr G's indebtedness to Holdings was repaid. It also enabled the disputants to maintain this pattern of drawings into the future as there were still funds available to be drawn down and this resulted in a tax advantage for the disputants.

The TRA held that the consideration received by the disputant on the sale of the shares was in substitution for a dividend which the disputants "would, might be expected to, or in all likelihood would have derived or would derive" as a dividend in the 2007 tax year or subsequent years, if the arrangement had not been made and that the requirements of section GB1(3) were satisfied \[56\].

**_Shortfall penalties_**  
Her Honour held that the Commissioner's imposition of shortfall penalties under section 141D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 was correct.

Sinclair DCJ rejected the disputants' argument that Parliament did not intend the expression "shortfall" to apply in a case like this. Her Honour held that Parliament clearly envisaged that the exercise of the Commissioner's powers under section GB 1(3) or under section GB 1(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004 would likely result in a taxpayer facing a "tax shortfall" and a shortfall penalty. In this case the requirements for a shortfall penalty have been met.

Her Honour found that the disputants' tax position was an unacceptable tax position and that the arrangement lacked commercial reality, involved a degree of artificiality in the ownership and control of the entities and found that the arrangement had the dominant purpose of avoiding tax. Sinclair DCJ also made reference to the tax consultant's letter dated 31 August 2006, advising on the restructuring arrangement, rejecting the disputants' contention that the advice immunised them from a statutory liability for shortfall penalties.

Ngā pukapuka pūkete Record books
================================

You’ll need to keep record books like wage, deposit, petty cash and cash books. These help you complete your return. We use them when we want to check your accounts.

Wage books
----------

There should be a wage book for each tax year showing each employee:

*   on their own page
*   working for you at the start of the year
*   who started employment with you during the year.

### Details you need in your wage book

*   Total gross earnings, including taxable allowances (the amount before PAYE is deducted).
*   Amount of earnings not liable for ACC earner levy.
*   The amount of PAYE deducted (taking into account any tax credits for payroll giving donations).

Summarise the details for each employee at the end of each deduction payment period. This will be either:

*   twice monthly or monthly, depending on your yearly PAYE deducted
*   every payday if you're a payday filer.

Keep a summary sheet for each payment period showing these totals:

*   gross wages
*   PAYE deducted, taking into account any tax credits for payroll giving donations

Ngā whakaritenga mau pūkete mō ngā hua tāke rangahau me te whakawhanake Record keeping requirements for R&D tax credits
=======================================================================================================================

You must support your claim for tax credits with the relevant information. Records must show that your:

*   business is an eligible entity
*   R&D activity is eligible
*   R&D expenditure is eligible.

Eligible business
-----------------

In most cases your normal business records should prove that you are a business in New Zealand or a [non-business researcher](/api/glossary/item?id={6D708311-BAB1-4677-BE99-0919948FA65E})
.

If you are in one of the following situations, you must make sure you have records which demonstrate you meet the relevant criteria:

*   contracting with someone else to perform R&D
*   a non-business researcher
*   an overseas owned company conducting the R&D through a fixed establishment in New Zealand
*   performing R&D on behalf of a company in the same group which owns the R&D
*   conducting the R&D in a partnership or joint venture, a government owned organisation or university within a group of companies.

[Eligible R&D entities](/research-and-development/tax-incentive/eligibility/eligible-entities)
 

Eligible R&D activities
-----------------------

To show that your activities meet the definition of eligible R&D activities, you must record:

*   the new knowledge, new or improved processes, services or goods you aim to produce
*   the scientific or technological uncertainty your activities seek to resolve
*   how this uncertainty cannot be solved by current, publicly available information
*   the systematic approach used to resolve this uncertainty
*   how your supporting activities exist solely to support your core activities.

[Eligible R&D activities](/research-and-development/tax-incentive/eligibility/eligible-activities)
 

Eligible expenditure
--------------------

Claims for the tax credit will be based on information about the staff time and other resources that were spent on eligible R&D activities. Your records must show the:

*   connection between your expenditure and eligible R&D activities
*   claimed expenditure is on the list of eligible expenditure types
*   claimed expenditure is not on the list of ineligible expenditure types.

[Eligible R&D expenditure](/research-and-development/tax-incentive/eligibility/eligible-expenditure)
  

When you use contractors
------------------------

If you use a contractor or an approved research provider to undertake R&D on your behalf, you still must submit your supplementary return in year one or request for general approval in year two. You are also responsible for your income tax return.

Your contractor must provide the following information:

*   records that document the investigation
*   the scientific and technological uncertainty
*   records for your supplementary return in year one or general approval in year two.

If your contract includes work that does not meet the definition of an R&D activity, you will need to separate the payments made for work related to core and supporting activities and other work.

Records for controlled foreign companies or foreign investment funds to be available in English
===============================================================================================

2006 QB clarifies taxpayers' requirements to provide financial records in English for CFCs or FIFs, when using the branch equivalent tax calculation method.

We have been asked to clarify Inland Revenue's position as to whether taxpayers are required to provide financial and other underlying records including evidence of foreign tax paid, in English for any controlled foreign companies ("CFCs") or foreign investment fund ("FIFs") they may hold when using the branch equivalent tax calculation method.

#### Background

There have been a number of instances when verification by the Commissioner of branch equivalent tax calculations has been affected by taxpayers not being able to provide the underlying records in English. This issue has highlighted that some taxpayers are not aware of their obligation, to keep in New Zealand, sufficient records in the English language to enable the Commissioner to readily ascertain their attributed income.

#### Practice

The legislation requires that any taxpayer that holds interests in any CFC or FIF, where the branch equivalent tax calculation method is adopted, has an obligation to provide upon request financial and other underlying records, for that entity, in English.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Application of Section 22 of the Tax Administration Act (TAA) 1994 |     |     |
| Section 22 (2) of the TAA states as follows: |     |     |
|     |     |     |
|     |     | "...every person who - |
|     |     |     |
|     | (a) | Carries on any business in New Zealand: |
|     |     |     |
|     | (b) | Carries on any other activity (not being the carrying on of employment as an employee) in New Zealand for the purpose of deriving assessable income;... |
|     |     |     |
|     | _(d)_ | _Makes, holds, or disposes of, for the purpose of deriving assessable income, any investment;..._ |
|     |     |     |
|     | (f) | Is a company that is... a branch equivalent tax account company... |
|     |     |     |
|     |     | _shall keep in New Zealand sufficient records in the English language to enable the ascertainment readily by the Commissioner, or any officer authorised by the Commissioner_ in that behalf, of - |
|     |     |     |
|     | (g) | The assessable income derived by that person from the carrying on of that business, or the carrying on of that other activity, or the making or holding or disposing of that investment; and |
|     |     |     |
|     | (h) | The allowable deductions of that person in the carrying on of that business, or the carrying on of that other activity, or the making or holding or disposing of that investment; and ... |
|     |     |     |
|     | (k) | Every credit and debit to the...branch equivalent tax account;... |
|     |     |     |
|     | and shall retain in New Zealand all such records for a period of at least 7 years..."(emphasis added) |     |

The Commissioner's position is that should the records of the various CFCs and FIFs not be provided in the English language, the attributed CFC or FIF income (being assessable income) or attributed CFC or FIF losses (being allowable deductions) cannot be readily ascertained. Nor is the Commissioner in the position of being able to readily ascertain the accuracy in such situations of the resulting entries to the branch equivalent tax account.

Where the financial and other underlying records, including evidence of foreign tax paid, are not maintained in English, the Commissioner considers that upon request there is a requirement for taxpayers to provide such information in English in a timely manner, to ensure the Commissioner can readily ascertain the matters referred to above.

#### Exception

The exception to such a requirement is under section 22(2) of the TAA 1994:

> _"... the Commissioner may, on application in writing being made to the Commissioner in that behalf, authorise any such person, by notice, to keep and retain outside New Zealand or as the case may be, in a language other than the English language, such of those records as the Commissioner determines"._

Such applications will be considered on a case by case basis, taking into account the degree of difficulty which maintaining records in a language other than English would cause for Inland Revenue, the compliance history of the taxpayer, whether alternative sources of relevant information are available and the relative cost to the taxpayer in meeting their obligation.

Ngā takunetanga me whakahoki i ngā hua tāke ngaromanga Events where loss tax credits must be recovered
======================================================================================================

There are set events that mean companies will have to repay their research and development (R&D) loss tax credit. These are called 'loss recovery events' and the tax you'll need to pay is the R&D repayment tax.

Loss recovery events (LREs) and the R&D repayment tax
-----------------------------------------------------

There are set events that mean your company repays its Research and Development (R&D) loss tax credit.  These events are loss recovery events (LREs). Sometimes you'll repay it all or only some of it. It depends on what type of event it is.   
  
When your company gets the loss tax credit you must make an annual declaration. It tells us if a LRE has taken place or not. You do this each year until you've repaid the total amount of R&D tax loss credit. 

The LREs are: 

*   disposal of intellectual property
*   appointment of a liquidator
*   company migration or no longer a company
*   sale of shares.

### R&D repayment tax

Repayment of your R&D loss tax credit is the R&D repayment tax. R&D repayment tax is due by the terminal tax date for the tax year the LRE occurred in.

R&D repayment tax must be paid in full if a liquidator is appointed or the company migrates or is no longer a company. This happens even if in the same year there is a disposal of intellectual property or sale of shares.

### When your R&D tax loss credit is settled

When you receive the R&D loss tax credit the amount of losses cashed out are extinguished. However, the loss value of any R&D repayment tax paid as a result of a LRE will be reinstated in the year in which the payment is made.

If you've already repaid your cashed out tax credit balance by trading into profit, no further payment amount is required. 

The four loss recovery events (LREs) and repayment tax amounts
--------------------------------------------------------------

These are the four loss recovery events and how the repayment tax is calculated.

### Disposal of intellectual property

When a company disposes of intellectual property it becomes liable to pay R&D repayment tax. This is unless the disposal:

*   is part of an amalgamation, or
*   was for at least market value and is assessable income of the company.

The amount to pay after the sale will be the lesser of: 

*   28% of the sale price
*   the current balance of the R&D tax loss credit. 

The due date for R&D repayment tax is the terminal tax due date for the tax return period. This is the same period the loss recovery event (LRE) occurred in. 

### Appointment of a liquidator

Appointment of a liquidator is a loss recovery event (LRE).  

The amount of the outstanding R&D loss tax credit will become payable (as R&D repayment tax). You need to pay it by the terminal tax due date for the income year. That is the same year as the liquidator's appointment.   

### Company migration or no longer a company 

A company migration or no longer a company is a loss recovery event (LRE). This type of event is when the company is: 

*   no longer a company for tax purposes
*   no longer a resident in New Zealand 
*   treated as resident in a foreign country or territory under a double tax agreement (DTA). 

You pay outstanding R&D loss tax credit by the terminal tax due date. This is the due date for the year the company was no longer eligible.  

### Sale of shares

#### Change of shareholding greater than 90%

It's not a loss recovery event to sell or transfer up to 90% of your company's shares from the first year of the 'cash out'.

Selling or transferring over 90% of your company's shares is a loss recovery event. This means you'll have to repay the 'cashed out' balance remaining. You'll need to repay it in full by the terminal tax due date.

#### Shareholder continuity

If your company does not maintain its shareholder continuity under the usual rules, any remaining losses to be carried forward from that income year may be forfeited if business continuity is not maintained.

[Carrying company losses forward](https://www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/income-tax-for-companies/losses-for-companies/carrying-company-losses-forward)

This will not create an LRE event until you sell 90% of the company.

The amount due to be paid after the sale will be lesser of the:

*   market value of shares sold multiplied by tax rate (28%) 
*   current balance of the R&D loss tax credit.

The due date for R&D repayment tax is the same as the terminal tax due date. This is for the year the sale occurs in. 

Example: Disposal of intellectual property

Company A has claimed the R&D loss tax credit in each of the 2015-16 and 2016-17 tax years totalling $40,000. In the 2017-18 tax year they sold intellectual property for $30,000 which they'll treat as a capital asset and not include it as part of its assessable income.

The amount due to be paid after the sale will the lesser of:

28% of the sale price $30,000 x 28%  = $8,400

28% of the loss tax credit balance $40,000 x 28% = $11,200

Company A is required to pay an amount of $8,400 by the due date for terminal tax for the 2017-18 tax year. 

To account for this, the company will file a R&D loss tax credit statement showing the LRE and the new tax credit balance of $31,600. The remaining balance reduces as the company starts trading into profit and making future tax payments. 

Example: Company migration or no longer a company

Company A has claimed the R&D loss tax credit in each of the 2015-16 and 2016-17 tax years. The amount of loss tax credit refunded to the customer for the two years totals $50,000.

In the 2017-18 tax year, Company A decides to move the company to Australia. Because of this they are required to pay back the outstanding balance of the "cashed out" amounts.

A R&D repayment tax assessment is raised for $50,000 and is due on the 2017-18 terminal tax date.

Refining the scope of the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty
=====================================================================

2007 amendments remove GST and withholding-type taxes from the scope of the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty.

#### Sections 141B(2) and (3)(b), and 141KB of the Tax Administration Act 1994

The amendments remove GST and withholding-type taxes from the scope of the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty. The thresholds for the assessment of the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty have been increased.

#### Background

An unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty of 20 percent of the shortfall is assessed if, viewed objectively, a taxpayer's tax position fails to meet the standard of being "about as likely as not to be correct". The penalty is applied only in cases where the tax shortfall is significant - which before the current amendments was a tax shortfall of more than $20,000 and the lesser of either 1 percent of the total tax figure or $250,000. The penalty does not apply to tax shortfalls that arise from mistakes in the calculation or recording of numbers in a return.

Taxpayers who make and acknowledge errors in taking a particular tax position cannot be regarded as having met the standard of being "about as likely as not to be correct". If the standard is not met, unacceptable tax position shortfall penalties may apply. The legislation has had an adverse effect on taxpayer behaviour by proving to be a disincentive to disclosing errors to Inland Revenue. To counter this problem, a recent amendment, section 141KB, provided Inland Revenue with the discretion to either cancel or not impose the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty if:

*   the tax position taken is the result of a clear mistake or simple oversight;
*   the shortfall arising from the tax position is or would be subject to a reduced penalty because the shortfall was voluntarily disclosed before notification of a pending tax audit or investigation, or is a temporary shortfall; and
*   it is appropriate that the taxpayer not be liable to pay an unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty in relation to the tax position taken.

Section 141KB applied retrospectively from 1 April 2003. When introduced, the discretion was signalled as a short-term solution only because:

*   it gave rise to significant increases in administrative and compliance costs;
*   it did not fit well with the self-assessment environment; and
*   the words "clear mistake and simple oversight" in the penalties context were uncertain and could create a revenue risk if interpreted more broadly over time.

The amendments limit the penalty to income tax only and apply higher thresholds. Consequently section 141KB has been repealed.

#### Key features

The discretion allowing Inland Revenue to cancel or not impose the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty in some situations has been repealed and replaced with other measures that narrow the scope of the penalty.

GST and withholding-type taxes have been removed from the scope of the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty so that the penalty applies only to tax positions relating to income tax. For other types of tax, the shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care may apply in appropriate cases.

The thresholds above which the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty is assessed have been increased. The penalty will apply when the tax shortfall arising from the taxpayer's tax position is more than both:

*   $50,000; and
*   1 percent of the taxpayer's total tax figure for the relevant return period.

As well as increasing the minimum threshold to $50,000 (from $20,000), the amendment removes the upper threshold of $250,000, thus significantly further increasing the thresholds. Removing the $250,000 limit is intended to ensure that the penalty will not apply to what may be regarded as everyday transactions for some large corporates.

#### Application date

What happens next
-----------------

We'll process your request within 10 working days. If we need more information, we'll contact you.

Once we confirm your registration, we'll send you a letter and make it available in your myIR account. You'll see an NZFT account on your homepage in myIR, which you can use to manage the trust's details and submit annual returns. You'll need to keep these up to date to retain NZFT registration.

We'll also send you a GST receipt when we receive your payment for the registration fee, if you were required to pay it.

Your responsibilities
---------------------

You or your tax agent will need to keep up to date with managing the trust's details and filing its annual returns.

[Tax agents](/roles/tax-agents)

Non-compliance with the disclosure rules can result in the trustee losing their access to the foreign sourced income exemption for the relevant income year and/or being charged the Foreign Exemption civil penalty (of up to $1,000) for failure to comply.  

### Residual beneficiaries

Are also known as final beneficiaries and are beneficiaries that have a right to any undistributed trust property when the trust is wound up.   
  
The residual beneficiary does not have a fixed, vested or contingent interest in the trust property.   
  
Your trust deed may describe residual beneficiaries as a class or group – for example, children of the settlor. If this is the case, describe the class to us when registering the New Zealand foreign trust.

Registered banks and residential mortgage-backed securities special purpose vehicles
====================================================================================

2009 legislation relating to registered banks and residential mortgage-backed securities special purpose vehicles.

_**Sections HR 9, HR 10 and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007**_

The residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) scheme established by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) in 2008 requires registered banks to set up a bankruptcy remote third party (SPV), which can be either a company or a trust. All the major banks have set up RMBS structures, and some may have drawn down RBNZ monies.

Broadly, the RBNZ will provide additional liquidity support for a bank provided the bank offers collateral securitised AAA rated residential mortgages as securities. As part of the security arrangements for this funding, the RBNZ requires these mortgages be held by a SPV.

There are potential tax consequences arising from establishing and using the RMBS as collateral to secure a medium-term finance facility from the RBNZ.

The government has determined that taxation consequences should not impact adversely on the RBNZ measures designed to ensure the stability of the financial system.

Consequently, new sections HR 9 and HR 10 have been inserted into the Income Tax Act 2007 by Supplementary Order paper to the bill to produce a tax outcome for the banks and the SPVs which achieves the government's objective.

### Key features

The amendments:

*   insert a new definition of a residential mortgage-backed securities special purpose vehicle (RMBS SPV);
*   set out the tax consequences following the establishment of an RMBS SPV;
*   set out the tax consequences of an RMBS SPV ceasing to qualify, other than on an unwind; and
*   set out the tax consequences of the unwind of an RMBS SPV.

### Application date

The RMBS amendments apply for the 2008-09 and later income years.

### Detailed analysis

A RMBS SPV is defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 as.

*   a company or a trust that derives no exempt income;
*   which holds interests in New Zealand residential mortgages or loans secured by such mortgages that are treated for financial reporting as being held by the registered bank;
*   has all its funding from the RMBS it issues, apart from incidental funding amounts; and
*   the RMBS it has issued must be either held by the registered bank with the intention of participating in the RBNZ's domestic liquidity operations; held by RBNZ and accepted into its domestic liquidity operations; or transferred by RBNZ, after being accepted into its domestic liquidity operations, to a person resident in New Zealand or a person not resident in New Zealand but unassociated with the registered bank.

##### _Tax consequences where RMBS SPV exists_

Once the existence of a RMBS SPV has been established as set out above, the following tax consequences apply:

*   The registered bank is treated as carrying on the activities that the SPV carries on, and having a status, intention and purpose of the SPV, and the SPV is treated as not carrying those activities, and not having that status, intention and purpose.
*   The registered bank is treated as holding all property that the SPV holds, and the SPV is treated as not holding it.
*   The registered bank is treated as being party to any arrangement which the SPV is party to, and the SPV is treated as not being party to that arrangement.
*   The registered bank is treated as doing a thing and being entitled to a thing that the SPV does or is entitled to do, and the SPV is treated as not doing that thing or being entitled to that thing.

The tax effect of these provisions is that the registered bank is treated as doing everything that the SPV does while it remains a qualifying SPV, and the SPV is treated as not doing those things while it is a qualifying SPV.

Practically, this will mean that transactions between the registered bank and the SPV will have no tax consequences for either party while the SPV remains a qualifying SPV. Also, all transactions with third parties by the registered bank and the SPV will be included in the registered bank's tax return while the SPV remains a qualifying SPV.

It also means the RMBS SPV will not be required to obtain an IRD number or file income tax and GST returns while it continues to qualify.

##### _Tax consequences when RMBS SPVS cease to qualify_

When a RMBS SPV ceases to qualify in terms of the definition above and other than being unwound (as defined below), the following consequences apply:

*   The registered bank is treated as having disposed of the property it was treated as holding as above. It is treated as disposing of the property immediately before the SPV ceases to qualify.
*   The RMBS trust/company is treated as acquiring the property referred to in the preceding bullet point immediately after it fails to qualify as a SPV.
*   The registered bank is treated as not being a party to an arrangement it was treated as being a party to in relation to the SPV immediately before the SPV ceases to qualify.
*   The vehicle is treated as being a party to the arrangement immediately after the SPV ceases to qualify.

Where property or an arrangement is disposed of/acquired for tax purposes in terms of the above deeming provisions it is done so at market value.

##### _Unwind of RMBS SPV_

The unwind of a RMBS SPV for tax purposes is defined as being the process of:

*   cancellation of the RMBS issued by the SPV and held by the registered bank or the RBNZ;
*   transfer of the interests in residential mortgages and loans secured by residential mortgages held by the SPV to the registered bank; and
*   termination of the company or trust, by liquidation or otherwise.

##### _Further developments_

The definition of a RMBS SPV includes the requirement that the mortgages and loans secured by mortgages held by the SPV are treated for financial reporting purposes by the registered bank as being held by the registered bank.

The strict reading of this requirement is that the relevant financial arrangements are reported in the legal entity financial statements of the registered bank. It has been brought to officials' attention that, while this applies in some cases, there are other cases when the relevant financial arrangements are treated as held by the registered bank only in the consolidated financial statements prepared by the registered bank.

The policy intent is that the amendments apply in the latter case, when the relevant financial arrangements are treated as held by the registered bank in the consolidated financial statements prepared by the registered bank where they are not also included in the legal entity financial statements of the registered bank.

It seems likely that further amendments will be recommended.

[All GST dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[GST (goods and services tax)])

A group is formed when 2 or more entities, which carry out [taxable activities](/api/glossary/item?id={F966147A-3408-4CDD-A965-AF294365FA2D})
, register for GST as a group.

An entity can be any of these:

*   a person
*   a company
*   an incorporated or unincorporated society or club
*   a joint venture or partnership
*   a trustee or a trust or estate
*   a public or local authority.

A company can be either of these:

*   a body corporate incorporated in New Zealand or elsewhere
*   a limited partnership registered under the Limited Partnerships Act 2008.

Who can be in a group
---------------------

There are different criteria depending on the types of entities.

### Company-only groups

If every member in the group is a company, the companies must be at least 66% commonly owned in terms of voting interests or market value interests.

The group must also meet 1 of these criteria:

*   each company is GST-registered
*   the total value of taxable supplies made by the group to outside entities is at least 75% of the total supplies made by the group .

### Mixed groups

Entities which are not all companies can form a group if they are GST-registered and meet 1 of these criteria:

*   1 member of the group controls all other members of the group
*   1 person outside of the group controls all members of the group
*   2 or more people carrying on a taxable activity in partnership, control the members of the group.

Non-resident entities registered under section 54B of the GST Act 1985 can only be grouped with other non-resident entities registered under the same section.

How a group works
-----------------

We treat a group as a single entity and use its combined turnover for GST purposes.

The group chooses 1 GST-registered member to be its representative. The representative files 1 GST return on behalf of the group at the end of each taxable period.

Taxable supply information is provided using the representative's GST number or a member can provide it under their own GST number.

Responsibilities of the group representative
--------------------------------------------

The group representative:

*   must be registered for GST before joining the group
*   is treated as carrying out the taxable activities of the group
*   is responsible for filing the group's GST returns and paying any GST due to us
*   can ask us to add or remove group members, change the representative or cancel the group registration
*   is our contact for all matters relating to the group's GST activity.

Responsibilities of each member
-------------------------------

Each member:

*   must keep its own GST records
*   is liable, both as a group and as an individual member, for any GST due to us
*   must use the same filing frequency and accounting basis as the group
*   does not file its own GST returns while a member of the group
*   must give the representative details of its income and expenses so the representative can include these in the group's GST return.

A member can provide taxable supply information under its own GST number or the GST number of the representative member.

Members do not need to charge GST on sales to other members or claim GST from each other for transactions within the group.

GST appears above the person’s head, which is then replaced by a shopping bag with a plus sign and dollar sign next to it.

The scene is replaced by a computer screen on a desk with the word REGISTER on the screen.

#### Audio

**Music**

Easy listening style music plays throughout the entire video.

**Narrator**

Goods and services tax, also known as GST, is a tax added to the sales price of most goods and services sold here in New Zealand.

Registering for GST isn't one of the most exciting parts of starting your own business, but it is important.

* * *

#### Visual

A website with REGISTER is shown on a computer screen, a computer mouse cursor selects the register button.

A note slide in from the right which displays LAST 12 MONTHS and $60,000, this slides to the left and is replaced by a new note which displays NEXT 12 MONTHS $60,000. These show that you need to register for GST if your sales for the last 12 months, or expected sales for the next 12 months, are over $60,000.

The camera pans away from the computer screen, a paper shopping bag is shown on a desk with groceries falling into it.

A circle with GST written inside it appears, this fills up with GST charged. The Inland Revenue Te Tari Taaki logo appears, arrows show the GST being paid to Inland Revenue.

A business expenses record is displayed with CREDIT on it as you claim back the GST you’ve paid on most business expenses.

**Narrator**

You’ll need to register for GST if your sales for the last 12 months were more than 60,000 dollars, or if you expect your sales for the next 12 months to be more than 60,000 dollars.

If you are registered for GST, it must be included in the prices you charge your customers.

Like when you buy groceries the price you pay includes GST.

If you're registered for GST, you collect GST from your customers and pay it to us.

You can claim a credit for the GST you pay on most of your business expenses.

Even if your sales are under 60,000 dollars, you may like to register for GST voluntarily.

Give it some thought.

REGISTER is displayed on the screen, a green circle with a tick and red circle with a cross are displayed under registering. A computer mouse cursor moves to REGISTER, then to the tick and finally the cross.

The green circle expands, the tick is replaced by a GST RETURN. A magnifying glass moves over the GST RETURN to show a dollar sign. The return is replaced by a business expenses record is displayed with CREDIT on it as you claim back the GST you’ve paid on most business expenses.

The green circle shrinks and now the red circle expands. The cross inside the red circle is replaced by 3 GST returns which indicates more paperwork is needed than if you did not register for GST voluntarily. An exclamation mark appears as penalties and interest may be charged if you file returns or pay late. A price tag is then shown in the circle with +15% on it as you need to account for the GST in the prices you charge your customers.

A person is standing next to a desk with a computer on it. A thought bubble appears above the person’s head showing a customer. A circle appears in the middle of the screen with REGISTER inside it.

**Narrator**

Registering has both advantages and disadvantages.

By filing regular GST returns, you'll get regular insights into how your business is doing, and you'll be able to claim the GST you pay on most of your expenses.

But registering for GST has some disadvantages.

Filing GST returns means extra paperwork and you may be charged penalties if returns and payments are late.

Also, because you'll be collecting GST from your customers and paying it to us, you'll need to allow for GST of 15% when you set your prices.

So, in between arranging your new workspace just the way you want it and dreaming about working with your ideal customers, you might register for GST.

In this video, we'll give you a quick overview of what you should know.

#### Visual

A circle appears with +15% inside it, this is the GST rate. This is replaced by a top on a coat hanger with a price tag displaying $100 +GST. The price tag changes to show $115 as this is the GST inclusive price.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

GST is charged at a rate of 15 percent.

So, if a good is priced at 100 dollars excluding GST, it will be 115 dollars including GST.

#### Visual

A computer screen is shown with an internet browser displayed. PAYMENTS BASIS and INVOICE BASIS appear on the screen. A GST return appears, it has 2 fields highlighted, GST COLLECTED and GST PAID.

INVOICE BASIS moves off screen to the right, leaving PAYMENTS BASIS visible. A note is displayed with the heading LAST 12 MONTHS and UNDER $2 MILLION, which falls away to show a new note with NEXT 12 MONTHS UNDER $2 MILLION. This is what your income must be under to use the payments accounting basis for GST.

A GST return is displayed, it shows that using the payments basis, you enter the GST you have received from customers and the GST you have paid to suppliers on your GST return.

PAYMENTS BASIS moves off screen to the left leaving INVOICE BASIS visible. An INVOICE is displayed showing the word DATE to represent the invoice date and payment date. This is to indicate that the earlier of the 2 dates is what you use to determine what GST return to include the GST on. This means you may not have actually received money from customers or paid money to suppliers before including the GST on a GST return.

PAYMENTS BASIS and INVOICE BASIS merge to show HYBRID BASIS. You use INVOICE BASIS for sales, and PAYMENTS BASIS for expenses.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

When you register for GST online, you’ll choose which accounting basis you'd like to use.

Your accounting basis is how you report on your GST.

It’s what you show in your GST return about the GST you’ve collected and the GST you’ve paid.

The most commonly used accounting basis are the payments basis and the invoice basis.

If your total sales are under 2 million dollars in the past 12 months or likely to be less than 2 million dollars in the future, see our website for the details, you can use the payments basis.

That means you’d need to show in your GST return the amount of payments you’ve received from customers and the amount of payments you’ve made to suppliers.

The invoice basis can be used by everyone.

Using the invoice basis means you look at the invoice date and the payment date of all your transactions and whichever has the earliest date is what you show in your GST return.

So you would show the amount on the invoices you’ve sent to your customers in your GST return even if you haven’t been paid yet.

And you’d show the amount on the invoices you’ve received from your suppliers, even if you haven’t paid them yet.

There’s also a hybrid basis that can be used by everyone.

If you choose the hybrid basis, you use the invoice basis for your sales and the payments basis for your expenses.

* * *

#### Visual

A person is standing next to a desk with a computer on it, a GST RETURN pops out of the computer screen.

A scale is displayed with GST CHARGED on one side and GST SPENT on the other. The Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake logo and the word YOU are shown in the middle of the scale. GST SPENT weighs the scale down, arrows move from the Inland Revenue logo to YOU as you’ll get a refund if you pay more GST than you receive. GST CHARGED weighs the scale down, arrows move from YOU to the Inland Revenue log as you’ll need to pay more GST to us if you receive more GST than you pay.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

You’ll need to file regular GST returns.

Each time you file, we'll calculate the difference between the GST you've charged and the GST you've spent.

If you've spent more than you've charged, we'll refund you the difference and if you've charged more than you've spent, you’ll pay the difference.

Aroha appears on the right of the screen, MORE THAN $24 MILLION is displayed above her head, her filing frequency of MONTHLY is displayed below her.

LESS THAN $24 MILLION MORE THAN $500,000 appears at the top middle of the screen, the filing frequency ONCE EVERY TWO MONTHS is displayed under this.

LESS THAN $500,000 is displayed on the left of the screen, the filing frequency ONCE EVERY SIX MONTHS is displayed under this.

Gary appears to the left of Aroha, $1 MILLION is displayed above his head, his filing frequency of MONTHLY appears below him. Icons of GST returns and paperwork replace MONTHLY as sometimes people use this filing method to claim regular refunds and keep on top of business records.

Jane appears to the left of Gary, $1 MILLION is displayed above her head, her filing frequency of ONCE EVERY TWO MONTHS is displayed below her.

Gordon appears on the left of the screen, there is space between him and Jane. $300,000 is displayed above Gordon’s head, his filing frequency of ONCE EVERY SIX MONTHS is displayed below him.

Gordon closes the gap and slides towards Jane. Gordon’s sales changes to $700,000 and his filing frequency changes to ONCE EVERY TWO MONTHS. An envelope icon is displayed to indicate that Gordon let us know he was changing how often he files GST returns.

A GST return is shown and then replaced by an exclamation mark to show that penalties and interest will be charged if GST returns or payments are late.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

The larger the business, the more frequently you’ll need to file.

Aroha runs a construction business with sales over 24 million in a 12-month period so she has to file monthly.

Businesses with sales over 24 million in any given 12-month period need to file monthly, but any business can choose to file monthly.

Businesses with sales less than 24 million but over 500,000 need to file at least once every two months.

Businesses with sales less than 500,000 need to file at least once every six months.

Gary has a restaurant with sales of 1 million dollars so he doesn’t need to file monthly, but he chooses to so he can get regular GST refunds and keep on top of his paperwork.

Jane’s food truck also has sales of 1 million dollars, but she chooses to file every two months.

Like Gary, Jane wants to keep on top of paperwork but she only wants to have to file once every two months.

Filing once a month is too much paperwork for her.

Gordon’s architecture business has sales of 300,000 dollars so he’s allowed to file every six months.

Gordon chooses to do this because he has few sales and purchases so filing isn’t a big job for him.

Businesses can change to a frequency that they qualify for at any time.

So, when Gordon starts to have a few more sales and purchases, he decides to file once every two months.

He sends us a secure email through myIR to let us know.

Whatever frequency you choose, please make sure you file your returns and pay any GST by the due date to avoid any penalties and interest.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

To register for Working for Families payments, myIR is the simplest, fastest way to go.

You’ll need some details to complete your registration.

If you want to get payments from Inland Revenue, you’ll need IRD numbers for you, your partner, and your children.

If you don’t have an IRD number for your child, you can still get Working for Families payments for up to eight weeks, to give you time to provide this information to us.

If you, your partner or your child don’t have an IRD number, you’ll need to apply.

This can be done online through myIR with document verification at an AA driver licensing agent.

There is further information on ird.govt.nz to help you through this process.

You can register your child’s birth and apply for their IRD number at the same time through smartstart.services.govt.nz.

If you have a partner, you’ll need to include their income too.

We’ll need your before-tax income from 1 April to 31 March.

For more information on how to estimate your income, visit ird.govt.nz.

If you’re registered for myIR, we’ll fill in some information we already know about to make this easier for you.

You must also provide your bank account number and let us know if you want to get Working for Families payments weekly, fortnightly or as a lump sum at the end of the tax year.

Ok, that’s your registration done.

**Narrator**

Through the tax year, the first of April till thirty-first of March, you get Working for Families payments based on how much you and your partner expect to earn that year.

Then, around June July when we have your and your partner’s income details, from employers or tax returns, we compare it against the amount your family actually earned to work out if you got the correct amount of Working for Families weekly or fortnightly payments.

This is what we call a square up, comparing how much you got based on your expected income to how much you should’ve got based on your actual income.

If you got too much, you’ll have to pay some back.

If you didn’t get quite enough, you’ll get some more.

To find out more about keeping us updated throughout the year and the end of year square up, visit ird.govt.nz.

We'll ask you some questions to determine if the entity you're registering is an NZFI that needs to report to us for CRS purposes.

Show all

Question 1 - Are you a Financial Institution?

#### Yes:

Go to question 2.

#### No:

You must be a financial institution to register for a CRS account.

#### Description

A financial institution is a type of entity.

An 'Entity' covers legal persons and legal arrangements, for example, companies, corporations, partnerships, incorporated bodies, trusts and foundations. An individual cannot be an 'Entity'.  
CRS section VIII(E)(3).   

A 'Financial Institution' is an Entity that comes within any of the following four categories.

#### Investment Entity

This includes Entities that satisfy either of the following.

*   The Entity’s income is derived, mainly (50% or more) from carrying on a business of providing specified investment activities for customers (such as portfolio management, investment or administering financial assets or money for customers).
*   The Entity’s income is derived mainly (50% or more) from financial assets (such as shares and bonds) and the entity is managed by another financial institution (such as a financial institution corporate trustee or fund manager).

#### Depository Institution

This generally includes savings banks, commercial banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions.

#### Custodial Institution

This generally includes custodian banks, brokers and central securities depositories that derive 20% or more of their income from holding financial assets (such as shares and bonds) and providing related services for customers.

#### Specified Insurance Company

This is generally an entity that issues or makes payments with respect to cash value insurance products.

CRS Section VIII(A) of the CRS and CRS Com pp. 159-165.

Question 2 - Is the Financial Institution in New Zealand?

#### Yes (resident in New Zealand or branch in New Zealand):

Go to question 3.

#### No:

You must be a financial institution that is resident in New Zealand (or has branch operations here) to register for a CRS account.

#### Description

Generally a Financial Institution will be resident in New Zealand for CRS purposes if it is resident in New Zealand for tax purposes.

However, the following special rules apply for Financial Institution trusts (other than unit trusts) and other types of entities that do not have a tax residence.

Where a Financial Institution is a Trust, it will generally be resident in New Zealand for CRS purposes if one of the Trustees is a NZ tax resident. \[However, an exception to this is if the trust has a trustee overseas and reports for CRS purposes in that country because the trust is tax resident in that country – in which case the Trust will be treated as resident in that other country (not New Zealand) for CRS purposes\].

Where a Financial Institution (other than a Trust)  does not have a tax residence, it is treated as resident in New Zealand for CRS purposes if any of the following apply.

*   The Entity is incorporated in NZ.
*   The Entity has a place of management in New Zealand.
*   The Entity is subject to financial supervision in New Zealand.

Multiple Residence Entities (except Trusts) - place where the accounts are maintained. For example, where such an entity is resident in two or more countries (including New Zealand) the Entity will be subject to CRS obligations in New Zealand for accounts maintained in New Zealand.

CRS Section VIII(A)(2) and CRS Com. pp. 158-159.

Question 3 - Are you excluded from reporting either by the Common Reporting Standard or by Inland Revenue?

#### Yes:

You have determined that you are a category of financial institution that is not required to report (or be reported on) for CRS purposes. You do not need to register for a CRS account.

#### No:

Registration complete. Please note that trustee documented trusts with reportable accounts are required to register with IRD.

#### Description

Non-Reporting Financial Institutions include the following.

*   Certain Governmental Entities (Com pp. 166-167).
*   Certain International Organisations (Com pp. 166-167).
*   Central Bank (Com pp. 166-168).
*   Broad Participation Retirement Fund (Com p. 168).
*   Narrow Participation Retirement Fund (Com pp. 168-169).
*   Pension Fund of a Governmental Entity, International Organisation or Central Bank; (Com p. 169).
*   Qualified Credit Card Issuer (Com pp. 169-170).
*   Exempt Collective Investment Vehicle (Com pp.173-174).
*   Trustee-Documented Trust (Com p. 174) - Note that a trustee documented trust does not need to report for CRS purposes. However, this is provided that it has a financial institution trustee and that trustee reports on the trust’s behalf. Trustee documented trusts with reportable accounts are required to register with IRD.
*   Low-risk Non-Reporting Financial Institutions (Com pp. 170-173).

Reporting CRS information to us
-------------------------------

### New Zealand financial institutions (NZFIs)

NZFIs with CRS obligations (including service providers and trustees that report on their behalf) are able to report the relevant CRS information to us in myIR.

You must complete your reporting by 30 June of the relevant tax year. For example, if your first CRS period ended 31 March 2018 you must report by 30 June 2018.

Instructions on how to submit a CRS disclosure are in the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) - registration and reporting user guide.

[CRS - registration and reporting user guide 2018 (PDF 4MB) Download guide](/-/media/project/ir/home/documents/no-number/crs---registration-and-reporting-user-guide/crs---registration-and-reporting-user-guide-2018.pdf?modified=20240204231840&modified=20240204231840)

We cannot provide extensions to the reporting period as this obligation is set out in the Tax Administration Act 1994. It's also important that New Zealand meets its international obligations.

You can choose from 3 different reporting options.

1.  Online form for small volume disclosures.
2.  Excel template for medium volume disclosures of up to 1,000 records. You must make sure you use the appropriate version of this template when reporting. This version is available in myIR.
3.  XML for large volume disclosures with a maximum file size of 350mb.

#### Technical changes to reporting for 2021

You'll need to be aware of how the technical changes to reporting for 2021 affect the option you're using. The changes affect each reporting option in different ways.

[Changes to the Common Reporting Standard for 2021](/international-tax/exchange-of-information/crs/registration-and-reporting/changes-crs-2021)

### Account holders and controlling persons

Account holders and controlling persons are not required to report to us. Their financial institution will report the prescribed information about their accounts if such persons are identified as being relevant foreign tax residents.

Automatic Exchange of Information - Your obligations if you hold or control financial accounts:

[Automatic exchange of information IR1033 2018 (PDF 120KB) Download guide](/-/media/project/ir/home/documents/forms-and-guides/ir1000---ir1099/ir1033/ir1033-2018.pdf?modified=20240204231753&modified=20240204231753)

  
International exchange of information
----------------------------------------

If New Zealand has an automatic exchange of information (AEOI) exchange agreement with your jurisdiction of tax residence, we'll send this information to the tax authority in that jurisdiction by 30 September of the relevant tax year.

New Zealand will also be receiving information from other jurisdictions about New Zealand tax residents that are investing overseas. This will help us verify that these people have paid the correct tax on these offshore investments.

We'll handle all information reported under the CRS in the strictest confidence as will the foreign tax authorities. Domestic laws, administrative practices and binding international treaties protect your information.

Penalties for non-compliance
----------------------------

### New Zealand Financial Institutions

Penalties can apply to financial institutions that don't comply with CRS due diligence and reporting obligations, including recordkeeping. This includes escalating thresholds of civil penalties and criminal penalties for knowledge-based offences.

### Account holders and controlling persons

Penalties may apply if you:

*   provide false, incomplete or misleading information
*   fail to provide this information
*   fail to provide an update if there is a material change to the information you have provided.

This includes civil penalties of $1,000 that we could apply as well as criminal penalties that can apply for knowledge-based offences.

Legislative References

High Court Rules

### Summary

The National Council of Women of New Zealand Incorporated (NCWNZ) applied, among other things, for an order that its appeal against a decision of the Charities Registration Board ("the Charities Board") not to backdate its registration be consolidated with its tax challenge of income tax assessments made by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") for the period that NCWNZ was deregistered as a charity. Clifford J granted the order on the basis that both the appeal and the tax challenge arose out of the same facts and circumstances, and both involved related interpretational issues.

### Facts

The NCWNZ is a charitable organisation established in 1896.

On 4 June 2009, following the enactment of the Charities Act 2005, NCWNZ was registered as a charitable entity by the Charities Commission as of 30 June 2008 ("the registration decision").

On 22 July 2010, the Charities Commission revoked the registration decision with effect from 19 August 2010.

On 10 September 2012, NCWNZ applied to the Charities Board, the successor to the Charities Commission, for reregistration as a charitable entity. NCWNZ asked that its reregistration be backdated to the date of deregistration, namely 19 August 2010.

On 15 April 2013, NCWNZ was reregistered with effect from 10 September 2012, not 19 August 2010 as requested. The Charities Board refused to backdate NCWNZ's registration.

The Commissioner assessed NCWNZ for income tax for the period that it was not registered as a charitable entity, namely 19 August 2010 to 10 September 2012. NCWNZ has challenged the assessments ("the tax challenge").

NCWNZ has also appealed the Charities Board's decision not to backdate its registration ("the appeal").

### Decision

The only issue in this proceeding that concerns the Commissioner is the issue of consolidation. The other issues relate only to the appeal.

#### _Consolidation_

Clifford J referred to rule 10.12 of the High Court Rules regarding consolidation of proceedings. The factors he considered relevant included the savings in time, cost and judicial resources, the need to remove the risk of inconsistent decisions, the potential shortcut of consolidation at trial, and the care required to avoid confusion through multiplicity of parties and issues.

His Honour stated that the appeal and the tax challenge arose essentially out of the same facts and circumstances. He accepted that, on the one hand, because NCWNZ was a charity, there was a real public interest in limiting NCWNZ's exposure to the costs of two separate proceedings. However, he also accepted, on the other hand, that if NCWNZ was successful in the appeal, the tax challenge would be rendered moot and the Commissioner would not be required to participate at all.

On balance, his Honour found that it was appropriate that the appeal and the tax challenge (to the extent that it involves the question of interpretation of section CW 41(5)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007, the provision in issue in the tax challenge) be heard together. However, he did not consider that formal consolidation was necessary because hearing the appeal and the tax challenge at the same time would promote the efficient use of everyone's resources.

Registration of non-residents for GST
=====================================

New GST rules allow qualifying non-resident businesses to reduce GST by registering and claiming refunds in appropriate instances. Apply from 1 April 2014.

_Sections 5(3B), 10(7A), 19(1B), 19A(1)(a)(iv), 20(3L), 20(3M), 46(1B), 51(4)(a), 51B(1)(d), 54B, 54C and 55(1B) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985; section 120C(1)(c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994_

GST is a tax on final consumption and is intended to be neutral for businesses. Under the GST rules, a non-resident business may need to bear New Zealand GST as an economic cost of doing business. The new rules allow non-resident businesses to claim input tax deductions (and therefore refunds) in broadly the same way as a comparable New Zealand business. Allowing these deductions to be claimed has, in turn, necessitated appropriate base-maintenance measures to be introduced.

### Key features

Certain non-resident businesses will be eligible to register for GST and claim input tax deductions even though they are making no taxable supplies in New Zealand. Non-resident businesses will need to satisfy certain criteria in order to be able to register under these new rules. Registration will result in the non-resident businesses being able to claim input tax deductions in New Zealand in a broadly comparable way to a New Zealand resident that operates a similar business. This will allow the non-resident business to access refunds of GST incurred, meaning that New Zealand GST should not generally be an economic burden on non-resident businesses.

If the non-resident business is making taxable supplies, or is part of a GST group that makes taxable supplies, it will not be able to register under the new provisions. Instead, it will register under the "regular" registration rules and be able to claim input tax deductions in accordance with those rules.

The Commissioner has special deregistration powers applicable only to non-residents registered under the new provisions. These deregistration powers, along with the other conditions of registration, are designed to encourage compliance from this non-resident group and to protect the tax base from fraudulent refund claims.

### Background

As GST is intended to be neutral for businesses, it should only be an economic cost to business in carefully defined circumstances. Under the previous registration rules, non-resident businesses found it difficult to access refunds for GST incurred - particularly on services received in New Zealand.

The new rules are designed to ensure that qualifying non-resident businesses are able to reduce the economic burden of GST by registering and claiming refunds in appropriate instances.

### Detailed analysis

### _Registration_

Section 54B sets out the registration criteria for non-residents. The Commissioner may register a non-resident if satisfied that:

*   The person is registered for a consumption tax in the territory in which they are resident. Or, if that territory does not have a consumption tax (or one that applies to the activities of the person), it must have a taxable activity that would make them liable to be registered in New Zealand if they were operating here. At present, this means that the person must be making supplies (on an annual worldwide basis) greater than $60,000.  
    This criterion is largely directed at ensuring that the non-resident is a genuine business. The rules accept registration for a comparable tax in another jurisdiction as a proxy for the legitimacy of a business. In doing so, the rules recognise that some countries do not have consumption taxes, or have taxes with a narrower base than New Zealand's GST. In order to accommodate those businesses, while still requiring some evidence of the 'genuineness' of an operation, the $60,000 a year supply test applies.
*   The person's input claim for their first registration period is likely to be greater than $500. Registering and administering non-resident businesses involves administration costs for Inland Revenue. Having a minimum claim amount ensures that only businesses that incur a reasonable degree of expenditure in New Zealand can register. This prevents processing GST returns when the administration costs involved would outweigh any refund provided.
*   The person's business does not involve the on-selling of services when it is reasonably foreseeable that those services will be received in New Zealand by a non-registered person. This criterion is intended to prevent any fraud risk, which would involve people in New Zealand receiving "pooled" services through a non-resident entity. For example, a group of New Zealand students could establish and register for GST an "education services" company in another country. That company agrees to pay the fees and living costs of the students in return for the students paying it for its services. The non-resident company could not register in New Zealand and claim New Zealand input tax on fees because it is reasonably foreseeable that it will be supplying education services that are received in New Zealand by non-resident students.
*   The person is not carrying on, or intending to carry on a taxable activity in New Zealand and is not, or intending to become a member of a group of companies carrying on a taxable activity in New Zealand. It is important to note that a non-resident that plans on carrying out a taxable activity in New Zealand (or being part of a group that does) is not precluded from registering from GST. Instead, they should register under the "regular" rules and claim input deductions accordingly. The effect of this rule is that only a non-resident that makes no taxable supplies in New Zealand (or, in other words, is not obliged to return any output tax) is able to register under section 54B of the GST Act.

If, sometime after registration, a person starts making taxable supplies, or joins a group that makes taxable supplies, their registration status changes from someone being registered under section 54B to someone registered under the "regular" rules from the date they start making taxable supplies or join the group, as applicable (see section 54B(2)).

A specific timing rule has been included in section 54B(3). Under this rule, the date at which a person either ceases to be eligible to be registered under section 54B, or becomes registered under that section, is the end of a taxable period. This ensures that there are no taxable periods when a person has to complete a return that incorporates two sets of rules.

### _Effect of registration_

_Input tax deductions_

A non-resident business that is registered under section 54B will generally claim input tax deductions under section 20(3L). This section allows input tax to be deducted to the extent to which goods or services are used for, or available for use in making taxable supplies, treating all supplies made by the person as if they were made and received in New Zealand.

The requirement that the supplies must be treated as being made and received in New Zealand is to avoid a person claiming input deductions on what would be exempt supplies on the basis that it may export (and therefore zero-rate) those supplies. This would provide a mechanism for turning exempt supplies into taxable supplies and artificially inflate the input tax deductions the non-resident could claim.

This test effectively asks the registered person to work out what would be their input tax deductions if they were a solely New Zealand business. It is accepted that this will require some knowledge of New Zealand GST. However, given the broad GST base, it is expected that most businesses that operate outside of the financial services and residential housing sectors will be eligible to deduct nearly all of their input tax.

Section 20(3M) provides a further option for claiming input deductions for non-resident businesses that principally make supplies of financial services. If they choose, they can agree with the Commissioner a fair and reasonable method of apportioning input tax claims. This provision effectively mirrors section 20(3E), which allows New Zealand financial services providers to reach similar agreements with the Commissioner.

_Accounting basis_

Section 19(1B) provides that when the Commissioner registers a non-resident under section 54B, that person must account for GST on a payments basis. This is a base-protection measure to ensure that refunds are not provided when the GST has not been incurred. It will require the non-resident to actually pay an amount in order to claim input tax in relation to that amount. A consequential amendment has also made to section 19A(1)(a) to effect this.

_Taxable periods_

No special rules are being introduced in relation to filing periods for non-residents. The normal rules will apply to determine whether they should file GST returns on a monthly, two-monthly or six-monthly basis.

_Right to withhold refunds_

Generally, the Commissioner has 15 working days to refund an amount of input tax in accordance with a return. This can be extended if the Commissioner, within those 15 working days, notifies the person that she intends to investigate the return. For registered non-residents, section 46(1B) has been added to extend this refund and investigation period to 90 days. This extended period reflects the fact that returns from non-residents may involve some communication before they can be finally processed. To allow for this communication (including matters such as unfamiliarity with the non-resident business or potential language barriers), an extended period is desirable.

A separate amendment to section 120C(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 switches off use-of-money interest accruing in the event that the Commissioner extends the refund period beyond the original 90 days.

_Groups of companies_

New section 55(1B) clarifies that a non-resident registered under section 54B cannot join a group if it would result in the group having both resident and non-resident members. This ties in with section 54B(2), discussed above. In the event that a person registered under section 54B does join such a group, their registration status will revert to "normal" at that time.

It is anticipated that a non-resident company registered under section 54B should be able to group with other companies also registered under that section.

### _Cancellation of registration_

Under section 54C, there are instances when the Commissioner can, in addition to powers that already existed under sections 52(5) and (5A), cancel the registration of a non-resident registered under section 54B. These situations are:

*   When the Commissioner is satisfied that the person is no longer eligible to be registered under section 54B(1)(a). This means that if the person's registration for consumption tax in their home jurisdiction lapses, or if their supplies drop below $60,000 a year (and their home jurisdiction does not have a consumption tax that applies to them), they can be deregistered in New Zealand. The rule is intended to ensure that if a person, for example, artificially inflates their turnover to register for GST in New Zealand but is or becomes effectively a shell company, they can be deregistered. This is consistent with the idea that only genuine non-resident businesses should be eligible to register for GST.
*   When the person, for three consecutive taxable periods, has either not filed a return or has filed a late return. This rule is intended to encourage compliance in non-residents. It is expected that a non-resident may have periods when their involvement with New Zealand is limited or non-existent. Rather than letting registration continue indefinitely, this rule should encourage them either to file nil-returns for those periods or make the conscious decision to deregister.  
    A failure to file, or filing late, for three consecutive periods will result in deregistration and a prohibition on re-registering for five years. That prohibition also applies to non-resident associates of the person. This will prevent a non-resident group registering one company and, if that company is deregistered, then registering another member of the group in its place. If a person's registration is cancelled under this section, the effective date of the cancellation is the first day of the third period.

A consequential amendment to the deregistration provision in section 52(7) has been made so that it only applies to non-residents that are not registered under section 54B. This change is necessary because, without it, any person registered under section 54B would arguably be at risk of being deregistered under section 52(7).

Section 5(3B) has also been included to clarify the effect of deregistration of non-residents. Under section 5(3), there is a risk that a non-resident that deregistered for any reason may be liable for output tax on the market value of all of their business assets - even if those assets were offshore. This would result in over-taxation of assets that had no connection with New Zealand. Under section 5(3B) the only deemed supplies that would occur on deregistration would be:

*   goods present in New Zealand at a time immediately before the person ceases to be registered; and
*   services that would be performed in New Zealand at that time the person ceases to be registered.

A consequential amendment has been made to section 10(7A) to ensure that the value of these deemed supplies is their open market value.

### Application date

The amendments all apply from 1 April 2014.

Regrassing and fertilising expenditure
======================================

2006 amendment to the tax treatment of regrassing and fertilising expenditure clarifies when it is fully deductible and when it is to be treated on capital account.

### Sections DO 1, DO 4, OB 1 and Schedule 7 of the Income Tax Act 2004

### Sections DO 3, OB 1 and Schedule 7 of the Income Tax Act 1994

The treatment of regrassing and fertilising expenditure has been realigned to clarify when it is fully deductible and when it is to be treated on capital account. The changes are designed to provide more certainty when accounting for such expenditure and to bring the tax treatment into line with modern short-rotation pasturemanagement practices.

Under the new rules, regrassing and fertilising expenditure is fully deductible in the year incurred unless is associated with a significant capital activity, such as a farm conversion. When incurred as part of a significant capital activity it is amortised at 45% per year, instead of 6% as previously.

Amortisation rates for farming and agricultural expenditure will in future be updated by Order in Council.

### Background

Inland Revenue published guidelines (Operational Statement 007) in July 2004 on the treatment of expenditure in converting farms from one agricultural purpose to another. These guidelines set out Inland Revenue's position on the treatment of regrassing and fertiliser expenditure - that it should be treated on capital account and amortised over time.

Concerns were raised by accountants and farmers over the result of this position, given the realities of modern farming practices and, in particular, because any regrassing and fertilising expenditure not considered to be fully and immediately deductible were required to be amortised at a rate of 6% a year - a rate not updated since 1986. The updated rules were developed in consultation with accounting and farming representatives, and take into account the significant shift in farming practices towards short rotation grassing practices.

### Key features

The main changes introduced are:

*   _Capital account treatment:_ Regrassing and fertilising expenditure incurred in connection with a significant capital activity, such as a farm conversion, will be amortised at 45% of the diminished value of that expenditure each year. Schedule 7 to both the Income Tax Acts 1994 and 2004 has been amended to achieve this while retaining the 6% amortisation rate for expenditure incurred when preparing land for farming or agriculture.  
    
*   _Revenue account treatment:_ Regrassing and fertilising expenditure will be fully deductible in the year it is incurred unless it is required to be treated on capital account and amortised. Section DO 3 of the 1994 Act and section DO 1 of the 2004 Act have been amended to provide for this.  
    
*   _Specific limitations:_ Two limitations further clarify the boundary between capital and revenue account and exclude from capital account treatment expenditure that is associated with:
    *   pasture that has an estimated useful life of one year or less because it would ordinarily be deductible under ordinary principles (see the amendments to section DO 3 of the 1994 Act and section DO 1 of the 2004 Act); and
    *   Changes in the intensity of farming activities. This could include, for example, moving from 8 (low intensity) to 12 (high intensity) sheep or other stock units per hectare. The change is to provide consistency regardless of whether the change occurs in one year, more gradually over a number of years, or as a result of changes in the general technology of farming practices (see the amendments to section OB 1 that define "significant capital activity").

### Application date

The amendments apply to expenditure incurred on or after 1 July 2004.
Regulatory I mpact Statement | 4 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] imposed on the analysis there is limited scope to further define the problem the policy is addressing. Consultation with the sector has not been undertaken. The RIS would hav e benefited from feedback from consultation, including the views of the stakeholders on the options considered in the RIS. Regulatory I mpact Statement | 5 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Section 1: Diagnosing the policy problem What is the context behind the policy problem and how is the status quo expected to develop? 1. The assumed policy problem is that the cost of early childhood education (ECE) is high relative to families’ incomes. The following section provides context on the ECE sector and future outlook on ECE affordability. 2. The 2022 Early Childhood Education Census showed that there were just over 181,000 children attending licensed early childhood services. Children attended for an average of 21.6 hours per week. Participation rates are highest for 3- and 4-year-olds, where 80% and 84% of children in the respective age groups were attending ECE in 2022. There were 4,597 licensed services operating at the time of the Census. 1 3. Existing regulatory systems are in place to support families with childcare costs. These range from universal and specific ECE supports, such as childcare subsidies, to broader income adequacy payments that contribute towards the cost of raising children, such as the Family tax credit and Best Start tax credit. These supports have different policy rationales, including increasing workforce participation, increasing ECE attendance rates, providing a greater range of choice for parents (both in where to send their children and whether to send them to ECE at all), and alleviating child poverty by supporting income adequacy through direct payments. 4. Childcare supports are administered by several different agencies, including the Ministry of Education (MoE), the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) and Inland Revenue (IR). Support is provided either direct to the parent or direct to the service provider. 5. Each form of support targets a slightly different group and objective, with different eligibility requirements. People may be eligible for one or more of these supports. Examples of the supports include: • The ECE Subsidy. A universal subsidy paid directly to ECE providers for all children attending the ECE service with a daily limit of 6 hours per day and a weekly limit of 30 hours per week. • 20 Hours ECE Subsidy. A subsidy paid directly by MoE to ECE providers based on the number of children enrolled. The 20 hours covered by this subsidy replace the first 20 hours of the ECE subsidy. Associated with this funding are restrictions that specify parents cannot be charged fees for the 20 hours. • The Childcare Subsidy. Administered by MSD and paid directly to the ECE service provider for children up to the age of six of low- to middle-income families 2 . This subsidy is normally paid for up to nine hours of ECE a week if the parent(s) are not working, studying or training 3 and up to fifty hours a week if the parent(s) are working, disabled, or meet other conditions required by MSD. • Donations Tax Credit. Individuals can claim 33 percent of donations up to the amount of their taxable income. ECE payments can be claimed if they are 1 Some of the census information was very recently updated for 2023 data. The total number of children in ECE has increased. 2 Families are eligible if they earn less than: $2,144 before tax a week with 1 dependent child $2,450 before tax a week with 2 dependent children $2,756 before tax a week with 3 or more dependent children. 3 Policy responsibility for the 9-hours component of Childcare Subsidy sits with Oranga Tamariki Regulatory I mpact Statement | 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] optional and go to general funds and the service is an approved donee organisation/charity. • Working for Families (WFF) tax credits, including the Family tax credit, In-work tax credit and Best Start tax credit. This programme is administered by Inland Revenue and MSD and provides a direct payment to families with children, including those in the early childhood age group. Best Start is targeted to parents with children aged 0 to 3 years old. 6. These above payments are periodically increased in value, either by automatic adjustment or periodic review. The exception to this is the Donations Tax Credit, which is set at a fixed proportion of charitable spending and will automatically reflect any increased donations on childcare but is limited to a fixed proportion of taxable income earned. 7. It should be noted that due to a lack of reliable access to fees data it is currently difficult for any government agency to provide advice on how effective the above interventions are in reducing ECE costs for parents and caregivers. Future outlook on ECE affordability 8. It is anticipated that without Government intervention, the current high inflation environment and trends in the price measures for the ECE sector may result in ECE costs continuing to increase. 9. Other factors for the increase in ECE costs may include lack of fees transparency resulting in inefficient markets (from information asymmetries), increasing operating costs, and demand exceeding the supply of ECE centres in some locations. Additionally, there are non-monetary regulations in place for the ECE sector which can increase the cost of delivery. 10. The recent repeal of the planned extension of 20 Hour ECE to 2-year-olds also reduces future support to some families to meet ECE costs. 11. If ECE costs do rise, an increasing number of families may no longer be able to afford some ECE hours. This may restrict their ability to work or could result in pressure on other types of family spending to maintain ECE hours, consequently reducing families’ income adequacy, work incentives and/or ECE participation rates. Limitations on Policy Analysis 12. As providing prompt support to families facing cost of living pressures, through targeted assistance with ECE costs, is a priority, the Government has directed Inland Revenue to implement a childcare tax credit by 1 July 2024 to increase the incomes of families who have children in ECE. 13. This, alongside standard policy limitations such as time constraints and lack of available data, has constrained Inland Revenue’s ability to do a comprehensive policy analysis. This section expands on those limitations and the impact they have had on the policy analysis. Lack of fees data 14. Comprehensive fees data is not available from either MSD or MoE: • MoE has an existing mechanism called the Early Learning Information collection (ELI), which collects attendance data and systems which store each child’s name, date of birth and National Student Number (NSN). However, MoE does not collect any fees data from families or providers. MoE had received funding in Budget 2023 to construct a system through which providers would report their standard fee rates to the Ministry. This system has not yet been implemented and would not provide Regulatory I mpact Statement | 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] granular detail on individual families’ fees, including what portion of those fees are covered by other government supports. • MSD holds comprehensive fees information for a small population, including the portion of the fee that is covered by other government support. However, this data is only held for recipients of the Childcare Subsidy ( 35,000 recipients for the 2022/23 year), therefore is not representative, and is collected via a manual process that places a high administrative burden on families, ECE providers and MSD staff. This process is not easily scalable. 15. Without comprehensive fees data, it is difficult for any government agency to determine the severity of ECE costs on families (including trends for the future), the factors that increase ECE costs (e.g., operational costs, impact of government regulation on the sector), and the efficacy of current and future government interventions in reducing ECE costs for parents and caregivers. 16. Instead, Inland Revenue has had to make assumptions about the severity of the policy problem and find alternative ways to feasibly implement a tax credit linked to childcare expenditure without easy access to current fees data. Policy design limitations 17. The Government has requested a new tax credit, “FamilyBoost”, that prioritises the following parameters: • direct payment to eligible parents on a household basis, • the payment be proportional to parents’ actual childcare costs up to a capped amount per household, • the maximum payment be abated according to household income, • a regular payment, • administered by Inland Revenue, and, • implementable by 1 July 2024 to address current cost of living pressures. 18. These parameters define the set of options officials can examine in this analysis, meaning some significantly different alternatives to those proposed in this paper have not been considered in detail. Instead, the scope of policy options presented to Ministers have been limited to variations of direct tax credits that Inland Revenue can administer to increase incomes of families utilising ECE. 19. If there had been more scope and time available to do a comprehensive options analysis, Inland Revenue (alongside other agencies) would have considered a wider range of policy options to address the problem, including: • reducing ECE fees through a direct subsidy to providers, • regulatory price controls or changes to reduce the impact of other regulatory systems that increase operational costs for providers (e.g., play space requirements), or • increases to incomes of families utilising ECE through other government support and/or wage growth. 20. This options analysis would include considering whether other agencies would be better suited to implement a new or expanded existing support instead of Inland Revenue. Lack of public consultation 21. We have not been able to undertake any consultation with the public at this stage of the policy process due to time constraints and budget secrecy conventions, despite the potential for significant compliance costs on the ECE sector and parents in implementing a childcare tax credit. For example, depending on the tax credit model selected, parents may either be required to periodically upload invoices (with ECE Regulatory I mpact Statement | 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] families can afford ECE, they may still be incentivised to not work if the ECE fees exceed the net income gained from working. 28. Inland Revenue does not have data available to support the implications of high ECE costs relative to income on families in New Zealand on income adequacy or various participation measures. Impacts of high ECE costs relative to income on population groups 29. High ECE costs relative to income disproportionately affects women, Māori and Pa sifika, lower-income and rural population groups. 30. Women are disproportionately impacted by high ECE costs as they are more likely to take time out of the labour force to care for children, including as sole parents. 5 This impacts on a woman’s long run labour market outcomes and increasing the gender wage gap. Therefore, any policy intervention to improve accessibility of childcare is more likely to benefit women by increasing work incentives, especially policy interventions that are targeted towards second earners or solo parents. 31. Research indicates that payment for childcare when children are at 4 or 5 years old varies by ethnicity. Survey data by Growing Up in New Zealand (Aotearoa's largest longitudinal study of child health and wellbeing) shows that “76 percent of families overall pay for care, with paying for care high among Europeans (78%) and Asians (77%), and lower among Māori (67%) and Pasifika (61%)”. 6 This means any government support targeted at alleviating ECE costs will provide a reduced benefit to Māori and Pasifika families due to these two groups being less likely to pay for childcare, either due to ECE subsidies covering the cost already, lower ECE participation, or greater participation in informal/non-cash-based childcare. 32. A reduced benefit will also apply to wider groups of parents who have low or no fees. This extends to lower income households (who are likely more eligible for other subsidies) and rural groups (who may have limited geographic access to childcare options). Alternatively, any policy intervention to reduce ECE costs relative to income may increase uptake if cost is a barrier to these groups for accessing childcare, although we are uncertain of the impact of cost on ECE participation. What objectives are sought in relation to the policy problem? 33. There are several potential objectives that a childcare tax credit could accomplish which will inform which of the potential options is preferred. 34. The Government has outlined the primary objective of “FamilyBoost” as directly increasing the incomes of families who have children in ECE ( targeted by level of household income with full abatement at $180,000 household income). 35. Other potential objectives of a childcare tax credit include: • Decreasing the amount payable for childcare costs • Greater fee transparency in the ECE sector • Increasing ECE participation • Improving children’s educational and/or development outcomes • Increasing labour market participation rates 5 82.4 percent of single parent households are led by women, and 91 percent of Sole Parent Support recipients are women (Ministry for Women). 6 See Sin, I. (2022). How do childcare experiences differ by ethnicity and for families with previous childcare access issues? Motu Economic and Public Policy Research. https://www.motu.nz/assets/Uploads/Use-of- childcare-after-access-issues-note-FINAL.pdf Regulatory I mpact Statement | 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 36. These alternative objectives have not been a consideration in assessing options to implement a childcare tax credit, but it is likely that these will be impacted by achieving the primary objective nonetheless. 37. Alongside the primary objective of increasing incomes of families who have children in ECE, we have designed policy options within the parameters of the following secondary objectives: • is timely and feasible to be implemented, • aligns as closely as possible with the Government’s policy proposal, and, • minimises cost to government and compliance burden on parents. Regulatory I mpact Statement | 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Section 2: Deciding upon an option to address the policy problem What criteria will be used to compare options to the status quo? 38. The criteria which will be used to compare options are: • Increases in the income of eligible families • Potential to promote fee transparency • Compliance costs for providers (including ECE centres and student management system providers) • Compliance costs for parents/caregivers • Administrative costs • Fiscal cost to the government • Time required for implementation What scope will options be considered within? 39. The scope is limited to the parameters requested by the Government for the “FamilyBoost” tax credit. In addition, the administration of a childcare tax credit (if proportional to ECE expenditure) requires access to fees information that is linked to individual parents or caregivers, the children in their care, and to their family income. 40. While Inland Revenue has some of the data required to administer a childcare tax credit (i.e., income data and bank account information for some potential recipients), other essential data is held by ECE providers and parents (i.e., ECE fee payments and enrolment/attendance details, relationship and household details). 41. Other agencies (MoE and MSD) also receive some of the necessary data, but not enough to implement “FamilyBoost” by 1 July 2024. • MoE receive enrolment and attendance data for individual children from providers, but this does not include fees information. The child is also not linked to the parent in the MoE data set and neither MoE nor the ECE providers hold household income information. • MSD are provided with some fees information from ECE providers and income information from parents for the Childcare Subsidy (35,000 recipients across 2022/23), but this is limited to fees information for lower-income families, and the information is manually collected and not easily scalable to cover the target group for “FamilyBoost”. In comparison to MSD, Inland Revenue has wider access to individual income information and an existing family’s data set linking a significant number of children to parents for WFF tax credits and Child Support. 42. Without current access to the fees data, the scope of policy options has been further limited to variations of direct payments that Inland Revenue can feasibly administer using known data sources and interactions, to increase incomes of families using ECE. 43. Implementing a product that meets the parameters set out by the Government will require new legislation and regulation and cannot be implemented within the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s existing powers. As such, there is not a non- regulatory option available. Regulatory Impact Statement | 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Section 3: Delivering an option How will the new arrangements be implemented? 61. The implementation details are dependent on the option selected, and as such the following is a preliminary indication of our approach. Implementation arrangements 62. The Government has identified Inland Revenue as the administrator of the payment. Introducing a new tax credit would have a significantly high organisational impact on Inland Revenue to support the anticipated increase in initial and ongoing customer contact. 63. The organisational impacts include systems changes (either through developing a new system or utilising an existing system as a base for the tax credit) and investment into change management/staff training to support customers and ensure compliance. Additional staff would be required to manage additional contacts and support parents. This investment includes developing education and guidance thorough the Inland Revenue website to relevant stakeholders (ECE providers, student software system providers and parents) and for customer service to assist in any queries to ensure eligible parents are aware of and can access the credit. 64. Depending on the preferred option, “FamilyBoost” could come into effect as early as 1 July 2024 (Option 2), or as late as 2026 (Option 3) . The design of Option 2 has accounted for an earlier implementation date of 1 July 2024, but does give short notice to ECE providers to update their invoices and to Inland Revenue to build the tax credit. As such it comes with risks around time to deliver. Option Three allows for sufficient consultation and preparation time for all parties. 65. Consultation with the ECE sector as part of the childcare tax credit work programme presents an opportunity for discussion about improving ECE data collections more generally, either as part of, or as a complement to the implementation of a childcare tax credit. Implementation risks 66. A detailed assessment of implementation risks is yet to be compiled as it depends on which option is to be progressed. However, any option risks adding complexity to an already complex income support system and ECE support system. This can impose a burden on parents to understand and access the various supports, including requiring parents to interact with multiple agencies. Furthermore, it affects agencies’ ability to distinguish the individual and combined efficacy of income and ECE supports. 67. The other risk relevant to either option is that IT system changes pose high uncertainty due to their complexity which can extend the time it takes to build, test, and implement any new products. This means any identified timeframes are an estimate, especially when the two options are reliant on ECE providers updating their systems, either with a minor adjustment (changing their invoices to comply) or a large adjustment (supplying ECE fees information to the government). This also impacts the software providers that ECE providers use. 68. Particular to Option 2, are the risks that there will be lower take-up due to compliance costs on parents, integrity risks associated with invoices or disclosed personal incomes, the implementation date of 1 July 2024 sitting within Inland Revenue’s peak period of demand resulting in reduced levels of customer support available across Inland Revenue. Finally, there is a risk that the basic refund model will become entrenched without a replacement model ever designed and implemented. 69. Option 3 carries less integrity risk (as it would be largely automated) but is reliant on ECE providers being able and willing to update their systems to create information

Regulatory regime for KiwiSaver and CSFs
========================================

2007 changes have been made to the regulatory regime for KiwiSaver and CSFs (complying superannuation funds).

A number of changes have been made to the regulatory regime for KiwiSaver and CSFs.

A CSF is a registered superannuation scheme that has incorporated certain KiwiSaver rules - in particular, lock-in and portability. Employer contributions to CSFs are eligible for the exemption from SSCWT that is provided for KiwiSaver schemes. The rules applicable to KiwiSaver schemes apply in most part to CSFs. The Taxation (KiwiSaver) Act 2007 introduces further obligations for CSFs in this regard. The Act also introduces new obligations for CSF providers. These obligations address the unique position of CSF in the KiwiSaver environment.

**KiwiSaver rules**

The KiwiSaver rules found in Schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act establish the conditions of membership for any KiwiSaver Scheme. For example, it includes rules relating to the lock-in of funds, circumstances of early withdrawal and rules preventing unreasonable fees from being charged. These rules apply to CSFs through the definition of complying fund rules in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004. The Taxation Act further aligned the complying fund rules with the KiwiSaver rules. Specifically, the Taxation Act includes an amendment to the definition of complying fund rules that ensures that any CSF must allow the withdrawal of funds as a lump sum. The complying fund rules also ensure that no person may join a CSF if the person is over the age of eligibility for New Zealand superannuation. Regulation 21 of the KiwiSaver Regulations 2006 has also been amended to enable CSFs to establish a mortgage diversion facility.

Sections 196 and 101G of the KiwiSaver Act have also been included in the complying fund rules. Section 101G of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 (as implied into the definition of the complying fund rules) ensures that compulsory employer contributions to CSFs must be allocated to the investment profile chosen by members and be fully vested. It further requires notice to be sent by providers to the Commissioner two months before the member becomes eligible to withdraw his or her funds by reaching the age of eligibility.

**Unreasonable fees**

The definition of "complying fund" rules in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 has been amended to include a reference to rule 2 in Schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act. This requires all CSF providers to ensure that the fees they charge for membership are not unreasonable. Breaching this rule will amount to a breach of section 35 of the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 and may be enforced through the provisions in the Superannuation Schemes Act that allow the Financial Markets Authority to direct, de-register or order the wind-up of a scheme. The generic appeals processes in the Superannuation Schemes Act will also apply. An amendment has been made to section 40 of the Superannuation Schemes Act that enables a court to enforce the requirement that fees not be unreasonable.

**Contribution rates**

 The definition of CSF rules in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act requires CSFs to make deductions from salary or wages that are equivalent to the minimum contribution rate specified in section 25(1)(d) of the KiwiSaver Act. This requires contributions to be made at 4 percent of an employee's gross base salary. The compulsory employer contribution must be made at the relevant rate, as prescribed in section 101D of the KiwiSaver Act. The compulsory employer contribution has been phased in over four years, increasing from 1 percent of an employee's gross salary or wage to 4 percent of gross salary in 2011. The complying fund rules have been amended so that the transitional rules that allow employer contributions to count towards the minimum contribution requirement also apply to complying fund members.

**Transfers and insurance**

Section 9D of the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 has been amended to enable schemes that provide insurance benefits linked to superannuation accumulation to reduce those insurance benefits if a member elects to transfer their CSF accumulation to a KiwiSaver scheme. The insurance benefit may be reduced by an amount proportionate to the amount that is transferred out of the CSF to a KiwiSaver scheme. For example, if a CSF member has an accumulation of $100,000 and elects to transfer $50,000 of that accumulation to a KiwiSaver scheme, the CSF may reduce the life insurance benefit attached to that member's account by $50,000.

**Successor agreements**

To obtain CSF status, a registered superannuation scheme must satisfy the requirements for the scheme to be registered before 1 July 2007. Similarly, there are requirements that any employer participating in the scheme, must have entered into a participation agreement before 1 July 2007. To ensure that employers are not locked into agreements with a specific provider, the law enables successor participation agreements to replace any participation agreement entered into before 1 July 2007. Successor agreement will need to be established under the provisions in section 9BAA of the Superannuation Schemes Act.

**Register of CSFs**

Section 158 of the KiwiSaver Act has been expanded to enable the KiwiSaver register to include a sub-register of CSFs. The information recorded on the sub-register will be largely similar to the information recorded for KiwiSaver schemes, and will include contact details for trustees, the date of approval for complying fund status and annual financial balance dates. The details to be included in the register of complying funds are specified in section 161 of the KiwiSaver Act. The register applies from 1 April 2008.

**Participation agreements**

The new section 41 of the Superannuation Schemes Act requires all existing participation agreements relating to CSFs to be lodged with the Financial Markets Authority within 28 days. This provision only applies to employers that have already chosen to provide access to the CSF under a participation agreement. Further, section 34 of the Superannuation Schemes Act has been amended to include a requirement that, on application for approval as a CSF any relevant participation agreement providing access to the CSF section of the scheme must also be provided to the Financial Markets Authority.

**Implied offer relating to transfers without consent**

Section 9BAA of the Superannuation Schemes Act enabled a trustee or an employer to transfer members in a scheme or a specific class of members within a scheme to a new scheme when the terms of membership are no less favourable. An amendment has been made to this provision that deems an offer of securities to have been made by the relevant member and acceptance to have been tendered by the new provider if the application is successful. This does not nullify the requirements of the Securities Act to provide an investment statement, but simply recognises that a contract has been made between the parties. All providers will still be required to provide potential members being transferred with an investment statement for the new scheme.

 **Notification of fee change**

Amendments have been made to the KiwiSaver Act and the Superannuation Schemes Act to require trustees of a scheme to notify the Financial Markets Authority of any changes to the fees being charged to members in that scheme. Section 189B of the KiwiSaver Act and section 39 of the Superannuation Schemes Act require a trustee of a scheme to notify the Financial Markets Authority of any changes to the fees charged for membership in a CSF or a KiwiSaver scheme. A corresponding amendment to section 40 of the Superannuation Schemes Act and section 189C of the KiwiSaver Act has also been made that enables a court to enforce the "unreasonable fees" requirements. This amendment has replaced the provisions in clause 2 of Schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act that allowed enforcement by the courts. The prohibition against unreasonable fees, however, is still contained in clause 2 of Schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act.

 **Responsible investment**

New section 205A has been introduced to require all KiwiSaver schemes and CSFs to disclose their approach to responsible investment. The disclosure of this approach must be in the form required by the KiwiSaver Act. The Act specifics that the disclosure must be in the investment statements of the scheme and must be included at the end of the "who is providing it for me?" section of the investment statement. The disclosure statement must be in the form prescribed by the section. Failure to comply with this requirement is treated as a failure to comply with the Securities Regulations 1983. This allows the Securities Commission to monitor and enforce compliance with this provision.

 **Definitions of "independent trustee"**

The definition of "independent trustee" in clause 4 of the KiwiSaver Act has been amended to remove the requirement that the trustee be independent from the administration and investment managers of the scheme. The amendment allows trustees that are performing these back-office functions themselves to continue operating as trustees of the scheme. The amendment applies to both trustees and related companies of trustees. Further, requirements for independence from employer contributors have been removed. Technical amendments have also been made to the definition of "independent trustees" to clarify that only one director of a trustee corporation will need to satisfy the requirements for independence.

**Investment adviser**

An amendment has been made to section 206 of the KiwiSaver Act to provide that a person is not an investment broker if they merely exercise a function, duty or power under the KiwiSaver Act.

Relitigated decision of the Authority
=====================================

2009 case note – Identical matters subject to previous proceedings and decided upon cannot be relitigated - abuse of the Court's process, PAYE matter.

Case

TRA No 029/07 Decision 10/2009

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994

### Summary

The disputant attempted to relitigate matters already decided by the Authority. The disputant's argument was that he was remunerated inclusive of PAYE. A previous decision of the Authority found the disputant's remuneration excluded PAYE. In this proceeding the Commissioner sought to strike out the disputant's claim on the basis that this matter had already been before the Authority and decided upon by it.

### Impact of decision

The decision confirms that identical matters that have been subject to previous proceedings and decided upon cannot be relitigated.

### Facts

In these proceedings the disputant attempted to relitigate a previous decision of the Authority (_Case X16_ (2005) 22 NZTC 12,216) relating to PAYE amounts assessed to the disputant under section NC16 of the Income Tax Act 1994.

The Commissioner applied for a strike out on the basis that the disputant's challenge is an ill-conceived attempt to relitigate matters which have been the subject of previous proceedings, and it is therefore an abuse of the Court's process.

The background to _Case X16_ is as follows:

*   The disputant was a Chief Executive Officer of a telecommunications group of companies in June 2000, the disputant preferred to operate as an independent contractor rather than an employee, however he had initially left his options open as to his employment status and no PAYE was deducted from his remuneration. This situation continued for the June to 31 October 2000 period. Accounts staff at the company the disputant worked for were made redundant due to the insolvency of the company, the disputant was made responsible for PAYE matters.

In _Case X16_ the Authority held:  

*   No PAYE deductions were made by the employer in relation to salary payments made by the employer to the disputant. The disputant knew this and did nothing about the situation until the receiver of the company had been appointed and the disputant's employment contract was terminated.  
      
    The disputant was responsible for non-deduction and non-payment of PAYE. He received his salary as gross income. Accordingly, it was appropriate that he be assessed for the PAYE content of his remuneration.

The Authority confirmed the Commissioner's assessments, and made adjustments amounting to $28,199.84. Following the Authority's decision, the Commissioner issued a $1,891.98 default assessment to the disputant which related to the period ending 30 June 2000. The disputant is disputing this assessment in this present proceeding.

### Decision

The Authority held that PAYE was not deducted from payments made to the disputant by his employer company. Therefore, the disputant was personally liable for the PAYE under section NC16 of the Act.

The disputant's employer failed to make any PAYE deduction. That aspect was simply not attended to, and the disputant knew that, and that the employer did not have funds available for PAYE on the disputant's salary. Also, there is considerable vagueness as to whether the disputant's salary payments were intended to be on an employment basis or independent contractor basis, and whether or not they were meant to be net of tax.

The Authority had already made similar findings against the disputant in relation to the PAYE periods ended 31 July 2000 to 31 October 2000. As reported in _Case X16_, similar findings were also made in relation to the June 2000 period.

At the strike-out hearing, the Authority allowed the disputant to file further evidence in support of his position that PAYE was deducted from payments made to him by his employer company. The Authority went on to say that filing further evidence would not, and could not, lead to the reopening of the other periods (31 July 2000 to 31 October 2000) and that the disputant could only rely on further evidence for the period ending 20 June 2000.

New evidence did not disclose any new matters which would make a material difference to the Authority's previous decision in _Case X16_.

The Commissioner's position is that PAYE has never been paid by the disputant's employer and section NC16 applies and makes the disputant, liable to the Commissioner for PAYE. The Authority agreed with the Commissioner and found that the disputant's challenge is an ill-conceived attempt to relitigate matters which have been the subject of previous proceedings, and is therefore an abuse of the Court's process.

Remedial amendments clarifying the rules for registration of charities
======================================================================

2008 amendments clarify the rules for registration of charities and resolve uncertainties for tertiary institutions, non-resident charities and schools.

**_Sections CW 41(5), CW 55C, LD 3(2)(bb) and (bc) of the Income Tax Act 2007, sections 32E(2)(kb) and (kc) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, sections 73 (2)(jb) and (jc) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968_**

Amendments have been made to the Income Tax Act 2007, Tax Administration 1994 and the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 to resolve certain tax uncertainties that have emerged in the lead-up to the 1 July deadline for charities to register with the Charities Commission.

### Background

Under law that came into force on 1 July 2008, charitable entities had to be registered with the Charities Commission by that date to be entitled to the charity-related income tax exemptions and for gifts to them to be exempt from gift duty. However, a number of associated gaps and uncertainties had been revealed in the lead-up to the 1July deadline.

A number of different types of entities were unclear about whether they had to register with the Charities Commission to retain their tax-exempt status. Concerns had also been raised by Inland Revenue over how it would deal with charities that had not completed the registration process by the deadline and with non-resident charities that are unable to register with the Charities Commission.

### Key features

The amendments provide that:

*   Tertiary education institutions and certain non-resident charities will not be subject to income tax.
*   Those making gifts to state and state integrated schools, tertiary education institutions and certain non-resident charities will not need to pay gift duty on those gifts.
*   Those making cash donations to state and state integrated schools or tertiary education institutions can claim a charitable tax credit on the cash donation.  
    The transitional changes allow Inland Revenue, in limited circumstances, to continue to treat an entity as tax-exempt as a charity if it has not completed the registration process by 1 July.

The amendments will mean that tertiary education institutions and state and state integrated schools will not need to register with the Charities Commission to retain their current tax-exempt treatment. However, they may still choose to register as a charitable entity under the Charities Act 2005 to have access to other benefits that flow from registration - for example, registered charity status can be a prerequisite for securing funding from other charitable organisations or can be a means of branding for some organisations.

### Application date

The amendments will apply from 1 July 2008, the date on which the tax provisions in the Charities Act 2005 came into force.

### Detailed analysis

#### _State and state integrated schools_

New tax provisions will apply to state and state integrated schools that are run by boards of trustees constituted under Part 9 of the Education Act 1989.

*   Section LD 3(2)(bb) of the Income Tax Act 2007 includes state and state integrated schools in the entities that are donee organisations. Donations made to donee organisations qualify for the charitable donations rebate for individuals and tax deductions for companies and Maori authorities.
*   Section 73 (2)(jb) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 exempts from gift duty gifts made to state and state integrated schools.
*   Section 32E(2)(kb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows state and state integrated schools to apply for a Certificate of Exemption for resident withholding tax purposes.

#### _Tertiary education institutions_

New tax provisions will apply to tertiary education institutions (universities, polytechnics, specialist colleges and wananga) that are established under Part 14 of the Education Act 1989:

*   Section CW 55C of the Income Tax Act 2007 exempts from income tax the income derived by a tertiary education institution.
*   Section LD 3(2)(bc) of the Income Tax Act 2007 includes tertiary education institutions in the entities that are donee organisations.
*   Section 73(2)(jc) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 exempts from gift duty gifts made to a tertiary education institution.
*   Section 32E(2)(kc) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows tertiary education institutions to apply for a Certificate of Exemption for resident withholding tax purposes.

#### _Charities that need more time to complete the registration process_

New section CW 41(5)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 deals with transitional tax consequences for charities that need more time to complete the registration process. It applies to entities that:

*   started, before 1 July 2008, to take reasonable steps in the process of preparing an application for registering as a charitable entity under the Charities Act 2005
*   intend to complete the process of preparing an application in future
*   have not been notified by the Inland Revenue that they are not a "tax charity";.

Inland Revenue has developed administrative guidelines on what organisations will need to do to be eligible for the transitional relief. These guidelines can be viewed in News and updates.

Charities that qualify for this transitional relief will continue to be treated as income tax-exempt, and gifts made to them will not attract gift duty.

#### _Non-resident charities_

New section CW 41(5)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007 enables Inland Revenue to approve certain non-resident charities as income tax-exempt on grounds of their having charitable purposes. Gifts made to these approved charities will not attract gift duty.

To be eligible for the proposed treatment, a non-resident charity must carry out its charitable activities outside of New Zealand and must not have a strong connection to New Zealand such that the Charities Commission is able to exercise its monitoring and enforcement functions under the Charities Act 2005.

Inland Revenue will develop a set of administrative guidelines on how it will assess whether a non-resident charity is eligible for the exemptions. These guidelines will be available on Inland Revenue's website.

[Remedial amendments to the Portfolio Investment Entity tax rules](/new-legislation/act-articles/2007-19/remedial-amendments "Remedial amendments to the Portfolio Investment Entity tax rules")

Remedial amendments to the portfolio investment entity tax rules
================================================================

2007 changes provide collective investment entities that elect to be portfolio investment entities with the necessary flexibility to implement the PIE rules.

##### Sections  CB 4B, CP 1, CX 44C to CX 44E, DB 17, DB 43B, DB 43C, EB 2, EX 1, HL 5 to 10, HL 11B, HL 12, HL 14, HL 15, HL 16, HL 19, HL 20, HL 21, HL 23, HL 23B, HL 24, HL 26, HL 27,  HL 28, HL 30, HL 31, IG 1, KI 1, LD 10, LD 10B, LD 11, NG 1, and OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004; sections 31B, 33A, 36 and 57B of the Tax Administration Act 1994; section 53 of the Companies Act 1993; and section 97B of the Taxation (Savings Investment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006

A number of technical amendments have been made to the portfolio investment entity tax rules to give effect to the policy intent of the rules.  The changes provide collective investment entities that elect to be portfolio investment entities with the necessary flexibility to implement the rules and ensure that different commercial arrangements can be accommodated.  The amendments also make a number of technical corrections to the rules.  These changes will enable a smooth introduction of KiwiSaver and the portfolio investment entity rules on 1 October 2007. 

### Background

The new tax rules for portfolio investment entities were enacted at the end of 2006 and address a number of long-standing problems with the taxation of collective investment vehicles.  The effect of the new rules is that, from 1 October 2007, people that invest in a collective investment vehicle that elects to be a portfolio investment entity will be taxed in a broadly similar manner to a person that made the same investment directly.  This is achieved by providing portfolio investment entities with tax relief on certain Australasian share gains, applying the new fair dividend rate method for non-Australian share gains, and ensuring that the investment earnings that low-income people derive through portfolio investment entities are taxed at 19.5%. 

Since the rules were enacted, a number of technical issues with the application of the rules have arisen.  These changes address these issues and provide collective investment vehicles with the necessary flexibility to implement the new rules.

### Key features

Section HL 20 has been amended to provide that the portfolio entity tax liability is calculated for a portfolio calculation period and a portfolio investor class and each investor in the portfolio investor class.

The new section HL 23B allows portfolio tax rate entities that pay tax under sections HL 21 or HL 23 to make voluntary payments of tax when an investor partially reduces their interest in a portfolio investor class.  As the amount of tax that is paid under section HL 23B is voluntary it is left to the discretion of the entity to calculate the amount of tax payable.  This will accommodate the different ways entities calculate tax when an investor partially exits a portfolio investor class.  

A number of changes have been made to section HL 27 to deal with various issues that have arisen in relation to the way portfolio tax rate entities allocate and use tax credits.  One of the main changes ensures that tax credits attributable to an investor in a portfolio tax rate entity that is itself a portfolio tax rate entity, can flow through to the portfolio tax rate entity investor without limitation. 

Section HL 28 has been amended to set more appropriate rules on a portfolio investment entity's use of portfolio entity formation losses.  Broadly, the new rules will require portfolio investment entities to spread the use of portfolio entity formation losses over three years.  These losses cannot be used to offset net income when the portfolio investment entity has income covered by New Zealand tax credits.

The definition of "portfolio investor rate" in section OB 1 has been amended so that the top rate of tax in a portfolio tax rate entity is 30% (instead of 33%).  This amendment applies from the 2008-09 and later income years.   

### Application dates

The application date for most of these changes is  
1 October 2007, to coincide with the commencement of the portfolio investment entity rules.  The amendment that reduces the top rate of tax in a portfolio tax rate entity from 33% to 30% applies from the 2008-09 and later income years.  The amendment to the Taxation (Savings Investment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 that ensures entities can elect on or after 1 April 2007 to be a portfolio investment entity applies from 1 April 2007. 

### Detailed analysis   

#### Calculation of portfolio entity tax liability for an investor as a member of a portfolio investor class

Section HL 20 has been amended to ensure that the portfolio entity tax liability is calculated for a portfolio calculation period and a portfolio investor class and each investor in the portfolio investor class.  Before the amendment, the portfolio entity tax liability was calculated for a portfolio calculation period and an investor (that is, as being the sum of the portfolio entity tax liability for each portfolio investor class that the investor is a member of).  There was no ability for a portfolio tax rate entity to calculate the tax liability for  
the investor as a member of a portfolio investor class.

The new approach will allow portfolio tax rate entities to calculate a tax liability for an investor as a member of a portfolio investor class and apply the investor's share of the tax credits for the class (both foreign and New Zealand) accordingly.  The provisions relating to foreign and New Zealand tax credits have also been amended so that credits can be allocated to an investor and used to reduce their liability as a member of a portfolio investor class.  This is discussed in more detail below.

It is important to note that these changes would not generally prevent a portfolio tax rate entity from applying an investor's tax credits to reduce the investor's portfolio entity tax liability across all their classes.  That is, in addition to allowing a portfolio investor class-based approach to calculation of tax liabilities and utilisation of credits, the amended rules will also support the former approach of allowing an investor's portfolio entity tax liability to be reduced by all of the investor's available foreign and New Zealand tax credits.  The way tax credits can be utilised (especially foreign tax credits) is relevant where a tax liability is triggered when an investor reduces their interest in a portfolio tax rate entity.

The new approach is designed to accommodate the different commercial arrangements that a portfolio tax rate entity may have. 

#### Payment of tax on switches between portfolio investor classes and partial exits

New section HL 23B allows portfolio tax rate entities that pay tax under section HL 21 or HL 23 to make voluntary payments of tax when an investor fully or partially exits a portfolio investor class.

This change allows portfolio tax rate entities to pay tax when an investor switches from one investor class to another within the same entity, and also to accommodate partial exits from a portfolio investor class (which may be a reduction in an investor's interest in the entity rather than a switch to another class).  In both cases, without the amendment, the rules would not have triggered a tax liability.

Before this amendment, an investor that switched between portfolio investor classes would not have triggered a taxable event under the rules.  This is because, for portfolio tax rate entities that pay tax under section HL 21 or HL 23, the previous rules provided that a taxable event would arise mid-period only if there was a so-called "portfolio investor exit period".  A portfolio investor exit period arises when an investor's portfolio investor interest (defined in the context of their interest in the entity) is less than their portfolio entity tax liability.  Therefore, a switch between portfolio investor classes would not have triggered a portfolio investor exit period as it would not have resulted in a reduction in an investor's interest in the entity (that is, a reduction of the interest relating to one class would be offset by an increase in the interest relating to another class).

Similarly, a withdrawal from a portfolio investor class would not have triggered a taxable event if the interest being withdrawn was not sufficiently significant to give rise to a portfolio investor exit period.  That is, a taxable event would not have been triggered if the remaining interest in the entity exceeded the tax liability that would otherwise have arisen in respect of the amount withdrawn.  This is what is referred to as a partial exit.

A portfolio tax rate entity that pays tax under section HL 21 or HL 23 now has the option of treating switches between investor classes as a taxable event under section HL 23B and, as a result, section HL 7.  That is, if an investor withdraws from a portfolio investor class (either completely or partially) and reinvests the funds in another portfolio investor class of the same entity, then the entity can elect to pay the tax for the part of the year before the withdrawal.

Similarly, if there is a partial exit from a portfolio tax rate entity that pays tax under section HL 21 or HL 23, the entity can elect to pay tax for the portion of the interest that was withdrawn.  This includes switches between portfolio investor classes that are not complete withdrawals.

As the application of section HL 23B is voluntary, a portfolio tax rate entity that pays tax under section HL 21 or HL 23 can choose not to pay tax for investors switching between classes, or when there are partial exits from a portfolio investor class or the entity as a whole.

##### Income allocated by portfolio tax rate entities to partial withdrawals

If an entity elects to make optional payments of tax on reductions of investor interests, the portfolio entity tax liability referred to in the new section HL 23B is up to the portfolio tax rate entity to determine.  Because the payment of tax is voluntary it is left to the discretion of the entity to calculate the amount of tax payable.  In any case, an accurate tax calculation for the investor as a member of a portfolio investor class is required at the end of a quarter or a tax year.

This effectively means that a portfolio tax rate entity has the option of calculating an investor's portfolio entity tax liability either on the actual interest that is redeemed, or it can choose to treat the interest being cancelled as a proportion of the investor's interest in the entity as a whole.  In the latter case, under section HL 23B the entity is able to calculate the tax liability on the interest redeemed as a proportionate share of the investor's tax liability for all portfolio investor classes that the investor has an interest in.  An example illustrates:

An investor has an interest in Class A and Class B of a portfolio tax rate entity that pays tax under section HL 23.  On two days the classes derive portfolio investor allocated income and portfolio investor allocated loss as outlined in Example 1.  At the end of day two the investor redeems 20 percent of their  
interest in Class A.  The 20 percent redemption represents a 10 percent redemption of the investor's interest in the entity.

#### Example 1

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
|     | **Class A** | **Class B** |
| **Day 1** | Income = $100 | Income = $20 |
| **Day 2** | Loss = $80 | Income = $10 |

  
Under the proportionate approach, total income for the investor is $50.  Therefore, given the investor redeems 10 percent of their interest in the portfolio tax rate entity, the entity could pay tax under section HL 23B on $5.  Alternatively, the entity could pay tax in relation to the amount actually redeemed.  This means that tax could be paid on 20 percent of income attributable to class A  
(20% x $20 = $4).

Section HL 23B allows both approaches to calculating the tax liability when there is a partial exit from a portfolio investor class as outlined above.

Under the changes to the definition of "portfolio investor exit period" (in particular, paragraph (b) of the definition), a portfolio investor exit period arises where the portfolio entity tax liability for an investor for a portfolio investor class and any other class exceeds the investor's portfolio investor interest for the portfolio investor class and any other class.  In other words, a portfolio investor exit period arises if the total accumulated tax liability for the investor exceeds the value of their interest in the entity as a whole.

If a portfolio investor exit period arises, section HL 23(2) requires a tax payment, the amount of which is the portfolio entity tax liability of the entity for the portfolio investor exit period - that is, the total accumulated tax liability across all classes.

##### Option for a section HL 21 portfolio tax rate entity to pay tax rather than zero-rate when an investor withdraws

Under new section HL 23B, if an investor in a portfolio investor class of a portfolio tax rate entity that pays tax under section HL 21 withdraws their interest in the class or the entity in a quarter, the entity has the option of paying the tax relating to the quarter in which the exit occurs, rather than zero-rating the withdrawal.

If this is the case, then a portfolio investor exit period does not arise and the investor does not need to include any income relating to the quarter in which the withdrawal was made in their tax return.  This has the benefit of ensuring that the income relating to the period of the withdrawal remains excluded income of the investor.

Again, because the application of section HL 23B is voluntary, the entity would still have the option to zero?rate the investor.  In this case it would be the responsibility of the investor to pay the resulting tax liability.

##### Timing of optional tax payment

An optional payment of tax under section HL 23B must be made to Inland Revenue by the end of the month following the month in which the investor switch or partial exit occurred, in the case of an investor in a portfolio tax rate entity that pays tax under section HL 23.  Optional payments of tax relating to investors in portfolio tax rate entities that pay tax under section HL 21 are due at the same time as the normal quarterly tax payment.

Rebates under section KI 1 can also arise on investor switch or partial exit from a portfolio tax rate entity that pays tax under section HL 23.  The timing for payment of these rebates is the same as would occur if tax was payable.  An amendment to section HL 26(2) has been made to provide this rebate mechanism for partial exits.

##### Consequential amendments to the definition of portfolio investor exit period

The definition of "portfolio investor exit period" in section OB 1 has been consequentially amended to ensure that it applies generally on a portfolio investor class basis, and is therefore consistent with subpart HL.

However, a portfolio investor exit period continues to arise when there is a reduction in an investor's interest so that the investor's total remaining interest in the entity across all classes is less than the tax liability relating to the reduction.

For portfolio tax rate entities that pay tax under section HL 23, this means they are only required to pay tax for an investor on a part-year basis if there is a portfolio investor exit period.  However, as discussed above, these entities can make voluntary payments of tax under section HL 23B when investors partially exit a class or the entity as a whole.

For investors in portfolio tax rate entities that pay tax under section HL 21, a portfolio investor exit period does not arise if the entity has made a payment of tax under section HL 23B sufficient to meet the relevant portfolio entity tax liability for the investor.  This ensures that any income allocated in the quarter in which the investor withdrew their interest, and on which the entity has paid tax, is still considered as excluded income under section CX 44D. 

##### A section HL 7 adjustment

As the section HL 23B payment gives rise to a portfolio entity tax liability of the entity, an adjustment under section HL 7 to reflect the liability is required.  The maximum period for making this adjustment is discussed in more detail below.

[Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2007](/new-legislation/act-articles/student-loan-scheme-amendment-act-2007 "Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2007")

Removal of interest write-offs for borrowers ineligible for interest-free loans
===============================================================================

2007 amendment to the Student Loans Act removes interest write-offs for borrowers ineligible for interest-free loans.

##### Sections 38A to 41 and section 55 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992

Interest write-offs for borrowers ineligible for interest-free loans have been abolished.

### Background

Before the changes, borrowers who were overseas for more than six months and ineligible for interest-free loans may have been eligible for one of the following interest write-offs:

##### Full interest write-off for resident borrowers studying

Borrowers who were resident for tax purposes but who were not eligible for an interest-free loan for an entire tax year may have been eligible for a full interest write-off for the entire year if they had studied for part of that year. Eligible borrowers who completed their study part-way through the academic year were entitled to a full interest write-off to 31 March the following year. Borrowers received the write-off even if they had been overseas for most of the year.

##### Base interest write-off for resident borrowers

Borrowers who were not eligible for an interest-free loan, who retained their place of tax residence and who earned below the repayment threshold were eligible to have their base interest written off for up to two years.

##### Partial base interest write-off for resident borrowers

Borrowers who were not eligible for an interest-free loan, who retained their place of tax residence and whose base interest charged was more than half of their repayment obligation were eligible to have the difference written off for up to two years.

##### Interest write-off for non-resident borrowers studying full-time overseas

Non-resident borrowers could qualify for a base interest write-off or base interest reduction in certain limited circumstances. Borrowers could qualify for either provision if they had:

*   renegotiated all or part of their assessed repayment obligation for a year on financial hardship grounds; and
*   satisfied Inland Revenue that they had been engaged in full-time study overseas and payment of base interest charged during the year in which they were in full-time study would cause serious hardship.

### Key features

Sections 38A to 41 and section 55 have been repealed. The interest write-offs have been abolished because they are inconsistent with the policy intent of interest-free loans, which is to encourage borrowers to remain in, or return to, New Zealand.

### Application date

The changes applied from 1 April 2007.

Ngā pūkete whare rēti Rental property records
=============================================

You’ll need to keep accurate records for your residential rental property to calculate income and expenses. 

You must keep rental records for at least 7 years, even if you no longer rent the property. Your records include:

*   bank statements, cheque butts and deposit books
*   working papers for all calculations
*   a list of all receipts and payments
*   invoices, transaction listings or statements showing income received where the property is rented through a management company or service provider such as Airbnb or Bookabach
*   invoices and receipts for expenses
*   a list of assets with receipts showing their purchase value and date
*   the rental agreement (if long-term tenancy)
*   any loan mortgage agreement
*   vehicle logbook (if vehicle expenditure is claimed).

It's easier if you use a separate bank account for your rental activity.

Short-term accommodation rental records
---------------------------------------

If you’re providing short-term accommodation (eg through Airbnb) you’ll also need to keep records to show:

*   the market rental per night (including dates of when this changed or increased over time)
*   the number of nights you rent out the room or property and how much income you receive for this
*   the number of nights the room or property is used privately (this includes you, or people [associated with you](/api/glossary/item?id={51FA1411-3A83-4019-8451-CED79A628D11})
    )
*   the number of nights you rent out the room or property at ‘mates’ rates’ and how much income you received from this
*   any [excess deductions](/api/glossary/item?id={C3E1928C-9525-4DB5-BBD8-8B5FBF8EC353})
    .
*   evidence of when it was not rented but available to be rented out

Rental records and property that is not rented but available
------------------------------------------------------------

You'll need to keep records showing the time your property is not rented out but still available to be rented.

Your records cannot be:

*   just a statement of its availability
*   sporadic or limited advertising
*   advertising that is not likely to attract many customers.

Your records need to show:

*   evidence of active, regular and effective marketing of the space at market rates
*   that it’s available at times and for periods that demonstrate it’s genuinely available to rent.

Residential rental property deduction records
---------------------------------------------

If the residential rental property deduction rules apply to your property, you'll need to keep records showing:

*   what basis you are electing for each property that you own
*   changes to the elected basis for your rental property, for example from the individual to the portfolio basis, and the year that change takes place 
*   any excess deductions, and which property or portfolio those excess deductions relate to
*   transferred unused excess deductions (that's from one property or portfolio to another), what the amount transferred is, and when the transfer took place 
*   when you disposed of a property, the date it took place, and if a property sale whether the sale taxable or not.

With residential rental property deductions you'll need to calculate what amounts should be included in your tax return. Keep records of the:

*   calculations
*   properties the calculations are for
*   decisions that may change your tax position.

Rental property partnership a business
======================================

2012 case note – rental properties a business therefore losses unable to be offset against other income for Working for Families Tax Credits purposes.

Case

\[2012\] NZTRA 02

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2004

### Summary

The disputant owned several rental properties in a partnership, which was operating at a net loss. The losses were offset against other income, which increased her entitlement to Working for Families Tax Credits (WfFTC). Despite the losses, the rental properties were found to be a business because they were an undertaking for making a pecuniary profit. The losses could not therefore be offset against other income for WfFTC purposes.

### Impact of decision

The decision follows the Court of Appeal decision in _Grieve v CIR_ \[1984\] 1 NZLR 101 (CA) that pecuniary profit is more than a revenue (taxable) profit. It is the character and circumstances of the individual venture which are crucial in establishing whether or not there is an intention to make a pecuniary profit.

### Facts

The dispute relates to amendments made by the Commissioner to the disputant's amended WfFTC assessments and consequential income tax assessments for the periods ended 31 March 2006 to 31 March 2008 inclusive.

The disputant is married with five children and is the principal caregiver for WfFTC purposes. During the period concerned, the disputant and her husband owned a number of rental properties in partnership together. The rental properties were incurring losses. The disputant and her husband offset the losses against their income. Because of the resulting decrease in income, the disputant claimed extra WfFTC.

The Commissioner re-assessed the disputant on the basis that the rental properties were a "business" for WfFTC purposes and accordingly the disputant could not deduct the rental losses from her income.

### Decision

Judge Barber stated that where there is a "business" and the business incurs net losses, the business is deemed not to have been carried out (and therefore no loss incurred) when calculating "net income" for WfFTC purposes. "Business" is defined in section OB1 of the ITA 2004 as: "(f) includes any profession, trade, manufacture, or undertaking carried on for pecuniary profit".

Judge Barber referred to _Grieve v CIR_ \[1984\] 1 NZLR 101 (CA) as the leading authority on the concept of "business". He held that there must be a two-fold enquiry as to: the nature of the activities; and the intention of the taxpayer in engaging in those activities. At \[42\], Judge Barber stated:

In the end, the character and circumstances of the particular venture are crucial. The objective evidence shows that the disputant commenced and now carries on a commercial undertaking in an organised and sustained way, and in my view the overall effect of that is to obtain, now and in the future, pecuniary profit.

Judge Barber considered the following factors (from _Grieve_) at \[43\]-\[53\]:

*   the nature of the activity;
*   the period over which it is engaged in;
*   the scale of operations and volumes of transactions;
*   the commitment of time, money and effort;
*   the pattern of activity; and
*   the financial results.

Judge Barber agreed with the Commissioner that after taking into account all of these factors, the disputant was operating a business. At \[55\], he held that: "to seek money's worth by capital gain in property value is to seek 'pecuniary profit'".

Judge Barber also held that the definition of "pecuniary profit" is not limited to revenue (taxable) profit. He agreed that the disputant's activity fell squarely within the concept of an "intention to make a pecuniary profit".

Judge Barber found that the disputant was undertaking a property owning and letting business at all material times. Accordingly, the disputant's rental losses for the relevant tax years were business losses and must be excluded from the WfFTC entitlement calculation.

Te rīhi atu i te pahī, wakamoe, moe-waho rānei Renting out a cottage, caravan or sleep-out
==========================================================================================

When you’re renting out your a cottage, caravan or sleep-out you’ll earn rental income. You’ll need to pay tax on the rental income. 

To see what you pay tax on you'll need to know your [gross rental income](/api/glossary/item?id={675F39E7-69B6-4841-BAC7-F43CE3A12248})
 and allowable rental expenses. There are set methods for working out what these are.

Using the right method to work out tax to pay
---------------------------------------------

To make sure you use the right method to work out the tax to pay you'll need to know:

*   how long you're renting out your property ([short-stay accommodation](/api/glossary/item?id={362ACC2B-2932-4683-92E8-9A537F6C9A2E})
     or long-term)
*   if your property is an asset or part of your [main home](/api/glossary/item?id={AD1B86A5-6B63-4FFF-B245-605A92C3446B})
    .

Attachment is how to tell if your residential property is an asset or part of your main home. For example, we'd see a:

*   garage conversion attached to your main home as part of your main home
*   cottage, caravan or sleep-out on your property as a separate asset, as they're not usually attached to your main home.  

Working out your income when renting part of your main home
-----------------------------------------------------------

When you're renting part of your main home, follow the tax rule for this type of property.

[Renting out my main home](/property/renting-out-residential-property/tax-by-rental-property-type/renting-out-my-main-home)

Working out income when renting out a separate asset
----------------------------------------------------

With renting a separate asset, you may be able to work out what tax there is to pay using 1 of the following:

*   mixed-use asset rules
*   actual cost method.

### Mixed-use asset rules

If you sometimes use your asset privately you apply the mixed-use asset rules. Use them if during the income year the property is:

*   used privately by you or an [associate](/api/glossary/item?id={51FA1411-3A83-4019-8451-CED79A628D11})
    
*   vacant for 62 days or more.

[Mixed-use asset rules](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-expenses/mixed-use-assets)
 

### Actual cost method

You use the actual cost method for working out rental income for your asset when either of the following apply:

*   only rented out and never used privately
*   not vacant for 62 days or more.

You'll need to show it's available to rent when not in use.

With the actual cost method, you split your expenses using floor area guests can use by the number of rental nights. This shows what expenses you can claim against your rental income.  
  
You'll also have to fill in a tax return to see if you have to pay any income tax to us.

[Actual cost method for working out rental income and expenses](/property/renting-out-residential-property/residential-rental-income-and-paying-tax-on-it/rules-for-working-out-rental-income-and-expenses)

GST and renting for short stays
-------------------------------

Residential rental income from renting out long-term is exempt from [GST](/api/glossary/item?id={682C0E7B-0612-4CC3-90E0-683E3A9F547B})
. You do not register, file or claim GST for your rental income or expenses.

Renting for short stays is not the same. Renting for short stays is a [taxable activity](/api/glossary/item?id={F966147A-3408-4CDD-A965-AF294365FA2D})
 for GST.

You'll only have to register and file if your turnover from all your taxable activities is over $60,000 for the year. This includes your short stay rental income.

Make sure you read about GST to find out what your obligations are.

Te rīhi atu i te whare hararei Renting out a holiday home
=========================================================

What

Work out what tax there is to pay when you rent out, and use, a holiday home

When renting out a holiday home you must pay tax on the income.

To work out what tax you'll pay, take away your allowable rental expenses from your [gross rental income](/api/glossary/item?id={675F39E7-69B6-4841-BAC7-F43CE3A12248})
. The method you use to calculate these depends on:

*   any private use of the holiday home by you
*   the number of days your holiday home was unused. 

When the mixed-use asset rules apply
------------------------------------

You must use the mixed-use asset rules if your holiday home was both:

*   used to earn rental income and was also used by you or an [associated person](/api/glossary/item?id={51FA1411-3A83-4019-8451-CED79A628D11})
     (this is the mixed-use)
*   was unused for 62 days or more (being available for use does not count).

[Mixed-use asset rules](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-expenses/mixed-use-assets)

When the mixed-use asset rules do not apply
-------------------------------------------

You must use the actual cost method to work out what tax there is to pay on rental income from your holiday home if either of the following apply:

*   the home earned you rental income and was not used by you or an associated person
*   the home was unused for less than 62 days.

### How you use the actual cost method

How you use the actual cost method depends on your use of the holiday home. If you rented it out and:

*   you did not use it privately, deduct all rental expenses from the rental income. You can do this for the time you rented it out and when it was available to rent.
*   you or an [associated person](/api/glossary/item?id={51FA1411-3A83-4019-8451-CED79A628D11})
     used it privately, you need to work out what the expenses are from the days it was rented out and available to rent.

To claim expenses for the time it was available to rent, you must be able to provide evidence that you did not use the holiday home privately during this time. You can only deduct these expenses to see what you'll pay tax on, not those for private use. The actual cost method shows you how to do this.

You cannot use the actual cost method if your holiday home is unused for 62 days or more. You must use the mixed-use asset rules.

Te rīhi atu i te whare e takune ana au ki te hoko atu Renting out a property I intend to sell or flip
=====================================================================================================

When you rent out a residential property you first bought to sell or [flip](/api/glossary/item?id={EBFD6FCF-D51E-469A-A201-DE3845DECC3F})
 you’ll need to pay tax on the rental income.

The rental income can be from renting out long-term or for [short-stay accommodation](/api/glossary/item?id={362ACC2B-2932-4683-92E8-9A537F6C9A2E})
.

[](/api/glossary/item?id={362ACC2B-2932-4683-92E8-9A537F6C9A2E})

Renting for short stays is a taxable activity
---------------------------------------------

It can mean you'll either pay GST if you're already registered, or have to register and file for it.

You’ll also need to pay income tax on any profit earned when the property’s sold. This is because one of your [intentions](/api/glossary/item?id={A3637F26-4574-4352-B0EB-9A273CC990AA})
 was to sell the property.

[Buying and selling property](/property/buying-and-selling)

Renting out for short stays and paying tax
------------------------------------------

When you’re renting out short-stay accommodation you may be able to work out your taxable rental income using either the:

*   short-stay standard cost-method (the property must be your main home)
*   actual cost method. 

### Short-stay standard-cost method

The short-stay standard-cost is a fixed nightly rate you can claim against your rental income. It's for short-stay accommodation in your home. 

You can use the method if you only rent out your home for 100 nights or less over the year. Each room in your house is equal to 1 of these nights. So if you rent out your 3 bedroom house for 1 night we'll see that as 3 nights.

There’s no income tax to pay if you charge guests up to the fixed nightly rate. It's [exempt income](/api/glossary/item?id={486206DB-3A57-47DB-B74B-D3F51D13A4E5})
.

hen you charge guests more than the fixed nightly rate you'll pay tax on the difference. You'll have to file a tax return to do that. You cannot claim expenses as the fixed nightly rate covers those.

Make sure you read the rules.

[Short-stay standard costs for renting out your home or its rooms](/property/renting-out-residential-property/residential-rental-income-and-paying-tax-on-it/rules-for-working-out-rental-income-and-expenses/short-stay-standard-cost-for-renting-out-your-home-or-its-rooms)

### Actual cost method

Sometimes you cannot, or do not want to use the short-stay standard cost method. When this happens use the actual cost method to work out your taxable rental income.

With the actual cost method, you split your expenses using floor area guests can use by the number of rental nights. This shows what expenses you can claim against your rental income.

You'll also have to fill in a tax return to see if you have to pay any income tax to us. 

[Actual cost method for working out rental income and expenses](/property/renting-out-residential-property/residential-rental-income-and-paying-tax-on-it/rules-for-working-out-rental-income-and-expenses/actual-cost-method)

Renting out long-term and paying tax
------------------------------------

A long-term rental usually means you have tenants. When you’re renting out long-term you only use the actual cost method to work out your taxable rental income.

With the actual cost method you deduct all allowable rental expenses from your [gross rental income](/api/glossary/item?id={675F39E7-69B6-4841-BAC7-F43CE3A12248})
. This is for the time it's rented or available for rent.

Renting out property that you use privately
-------------------------------------------

If you rent out the property and use it privately it's a mixed-use asset. A mixed-use asset residential property is one that's:

*   not your main home
*   used by you or an [associated person](/api/glossary/item?id={51FA1411-3A83-4019-8451-CED79A628D11})
    
*   rented out by you to earn rental income some of the time.

You can use one of 2 ways to work out what tax there is to pay on your mixed-use asset property. Your use of the property counts. If there's been:

*   no private use by you, you can use the actual cost method
*   private use by you, check what rule to use in this table:

| How the property is used | How you work out your allowable expenses and taxable rental income |
| --- | --- |
| *   Vacant for 62 days or more.<br>*   The property is rented out (income-earning use) for some of the time.<br>*   The property is used privately some of the time. | *   You must use the mixed-use asset rules. |
| *   Not vacant for 62 days or more.<br>*   The property is rented out (income-earning use) for some of the time.<br>*   The property is used privately some of the time. | *   Use the actual cost method. |

GST when you’re renting out the property
----------------------------------------

Residential rental income from renting out long-term is exempt from [GST](/api/glossary/item?id={682C0E7B-0612-4CC3-90E0-683E3A9F547B})
. You do not register, file or claim GST for your rental income and expenses.

Renting out for short stays is a [taxable activity](/api/glossary/item?id={F966147A-3408-4CDD-A965-AF294365FA2D})
 for GST.

If you’re not already registered for GST, you need to:

*   add your short-stay rental income to income from your other taxable activities
*   register for GST if your total turnover is over $60,000 in a 12-month period.

Make sure you read about GST to find out what your obligations are.

===============================================================================

What

Paying tax on money you get from people who paid to stay in rooms in your home.

Who

People who were paid money by someone to stay in their home.

When you get money from renting out a room or rooms in your home you’ll earn rental income.

You may need to pay tax on your rental income.

How you’re renting it out, who you’re renting to, and for how long, changes what income tax you pay.

Renting out to flatmates 
-------------------------

Flatmates share a house, expenses and chores. Usually one flatmate is the tenancy holder.

If you, or someone in your flat, collects rent from the others to pass on to your landlord, the income is not taxable. There’s no need to do anything.   
  
If you own a home and get flatmates in, you may have tax to pay on the profit from renting to them.

Use the actual cost method to see what tax you may have to pay.

Renting out to private boarders or home-stay students 
------------------------------------------------------

Private boarders and home-stay students are different to flatmates. When boarders rent rooms in your house, part of the rent they pay is for services. These are services like meals or laundry.

To see if there’s tax to pay use these tax rules for renting to private boarders.

Renting rooms in your home for short stays
------------------------------------------

Renting for short stays is when you rent out a room or rooms in your home for a few nights or up to 4 consecutive weeks at a time. This excludes renting out to flatmates or boarders. It's usually the type of renting you'll offer through services like Airbnb or Bookabach.

When you’re renting out rooms in your home for short stays, you may be able to work out your rental income using either the:

*   short-stay standard-cost method
*   actual cost method.

### Short-stay standard-cost method

The short-stay standard-cost is a fixed nightly rate you can claim against your rental income. It's for short-stay accommodation in your home. 

You can use the method if you only rent out your home for 100 nights or less over the year. (Each room in your house is equal to 1 of these nights. So if you rent out your three bedroom house for 1 night we'll see that as 3 nights.)

There’s no income tax to pay If you charge guests up to the fixed nightly rate. It's [exempt income](/api/glossary/item?id={486206DB-3A57-47DB-B74B-D3F51D13A4E5})
.

When you charge guests more than the fixed nightly rate you'll pay tax on the difference. You'll have to file a tax return to do that. You cannot claim expenses as the fixed nightly rate covers those.

Make sure you read the rules before using the method.

### Actual cost method

Sometimes you cannot, or do not want to use the short-stay standard cost method. When this happens use the actual cost method to work out your taxable rental income.   
  
With the actual cost method, you split your expenses using the floor area guests use by the number of rental nights. This shows what expenses you can claim against your rental income.   
  
With this method you'll also have to fill in a tax return to pay income tax to us.

Te rīhi atu i te whare haumitanga Renting out investment property
=================================================================

What

Work out what to do if you get rental income from a residential property that is not your main home

Who

Homeowners, landlords, developers, builders

An investment property is a [residential property](/api/glossary/item?id={1F912F94-D62C-4C35-899B-1FA9078EE8CA})
 that you buy to earn you rental income. It's a property you do not use yourself.

The rental income can be from either renting out long-term or for short stays through services like Airbnb.

Paying tax on your rental income
--------------------------------

You must pay income tax on the rental income. To work out what you pay, you deduct your allowable rental expenses from your [gross rental income](/api/glossary/item?id={675F39E7-69B6-4841-BAC7-F43CE3A12248})
.

For your investment property, you’ll need to use the actual cost method to see what tax you'll pay.

[Actual cost method for working out rental income and expenses](/property/renting-out-residential-property/residential-rental-income-and-paying-tax-on-it/rules-for-working-out-rental-income-and-expenses/actual-cost-method)

### Residential rental excess deductions

Sometimes your allowable rental expenses are more than your gross rental income. When this happens you're left with excess deductions. You'll have to carry these into the next tax year and deduct them when you earn [residential income](/api/glossary/item?id={639854D6-6590-446F-8E92-123587082168})
.

You cannot use the excess deductions against your other income, for example salary and wages. 

There are rules about what you can do with excess deductions when you have more than 1 residential rental property.

[Residential rental property deductions](/property/renting-out-residential-property/residential-rental-property-deductions)

GST and renting out investment property
---------------------------------------

Residential rental income from renting out long-term is exempt from GST. This means you do not register, file or claim GST for your rental income and expenses.

Renting out [short-stay accommodation](/api/glossary/item?id={362ACC2B-2932-4683-92E8-9A537F6C9A2E})
 is a [taxable activity](/api/glossary/item?id={F966147A-3408-4CDD-A965-AF294365FA2D})
 for GST.

If you’re not already registered for GST, you need to:

*   add your short-stay rental income to income from your other taxable activities
*   register for GST if your total turnover is over $60,000 in a 12-month period.

Make sure you read about GST to find out what your obligations are.

Te rīhi atu i tōku whare matua Renting out my main home
=======================================================

What

Paying tax on rental income from renting out your main home

The money from renting out your home is income. Whether you rent out long term or offer short stays sets how you work out the tax you need to pay.

Renting out your main home for short stays
------------------------------------------

When you’re renting out your main home as [short-stay accommodation](/api/glossary/item?id={362ACC2B-2932-4683-92E8-9A537F6C9A2E})
, you may be able to work out your rental income using either the:

*   short-stay standard-cost method
*   actual cost method.

### Short-stay standard-cost method

The short-stay standard-cost is a fixed nightly rate you can claim against your rental income. It's for short-stay accommodation in your home. 

You can use the method if you rent out your home for only 100 nights or less over the income year. (Each room in your house is equal to 1 of these nights. So if you rent out your 3 bedroom house for 1 night we'll see that as 3 nights.)

There's no income tax to pay if you charge guests up to the fixed nightly rate. It's [exempt income](/api/glossary/item?id={486206DB-3A57-47DB-B74B-D3F51D13A4E5})
. 

When you charge guests more than the fixed nightly rate you'll pay tax on the difference. You'll have to file a tax return to do that. You cannot claim expenses as the fixed nightly rate covers those.

Make sure you read the rules before using the method:

[Short-stay standard cost for renting out your home or its rooms](/property/renting-out-residential-property/residential-rental-income-and-paying-tax-on-it/rules-for-working-out-rental-income-and-expenses/short-stay-standard-cost-for-renting-out-your-home-or-its-rooms)
 

### Actual cost method

Sometimes you cannot, or do not want to use the short-stay standard-cost method. When this happens use the actual cost method to work out your taxable rental income. 

With the actual cost method, you split your expenses using floor area guests can use by the number of rental nights. This shows what expenses you can claim against your rental income.   
  
You'll also have to fill in a tax return to see if you have to pay any income tax to us. 

[Actual cost method for working out rental income and expenses](/property/renting-out-residential-property/residential-rental-income-and-paying-tax-on-it/rules-for-working-out-rental-income-and-expenses/actual-cost-method)

### GST and short stay renting

Renting out your main home for short stays is a [taxable activity](/api/glossary/item?id={F966147A-3408-4CDD-A965-AF294365FA2D})
 for GST.

You'll only have to register and file if your turnover from all your taxable activities is over $60,000 for the year. This includes your short stay rental income.

Make sure you read about GST to find out what your obligations are.

[GST and renting out residential property](/property/renting-out-residential-property/gst-and-renting-out-residential-property)

Renting out your main home long-term
------------------------------------

A long-term rental usually means you have tenants. When you’re renting out long-term you only use the actual cost method to work out your taxable rental income.

With the actual cost method you deduct allowable rental expenses from your [gross rental income](/api/glossary/item?id={675F39E7-69B6-4841-BAC7-F43CE3A12248})
. This is for the time it's rented or available for rent.

With long-term residential renting there’s no GST to pay. You do not need to register, file or claim GST for your rental income or expenses.

Appeal Status

Appealed

Reparation and section 109 of the Tax Administration Act 1994
=============================================================

2009 case note – Appeal against conviction for aiding and abetting company to not file GST return - reparation, s 109 Tax Administration Act, disputed facts hearing.

Case

The Queen v Karl Andre Allan

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, Sentencing Act 2002

### Summary

Mr Allan appealed against his conviction and sentence for aiding and abetting a company to knowingly fail to file a Goods and Services Tax ("GST") return intending to evade the payment of GST. The Court dismissed the appeal against conviction, but upheld the appeal against the amount of reparation that Mr Allan had been ordered to pay to Inland Revenue

### Impact of decision

This decision differentiates between an assessment and a loss for the purposes of reparation. Where a convicted person wants to raise evidence at sentencing that was not called at trial, but relates to aggravating or mitigating factors, the court must hold a disputed facts hearing. There is no infringement of section 109 of the Tax Administration Act ("TAA") where the amount of reparation is challenged, as the convicted person is challenging the loss to Inland Revenue, not the assessment.

Reparation is limited to core tax; penalties and use of money interest should not be included in reparation orders.

### Facts

Mr Allan ran a small business of buying and selling electrical equipment. He incorporated Logical Choice Ltd in December 2003. Initially his mother was the sole director and shareholder, though it was not disputed that Mr Allan ran the business. For the first nine months following incorporation until September 2004, the company filed two-monthly GST returns, all of which claimed input tax credits. Over the following 18 months to 1 March 2006, no GST returns were filed.

In June 2006, Mr Allan asked his chartered accountant to file these returns, but only provided the necessary information in August 2006. In the meantime, he filed a GST return in July in which he claimed an input tax credit. The outstanding returns were filed in September showing that the company owed $64,000 in GST. Following this, the shareholding and directorship of the company was transferred from his mother to Mr Allan and he put the company into voluntary liquidation. However, Mr Allan continued to operate his business and in November 2006 set up a new trading company.

Mr Allan was prosecuted for, and convicted of, nine counts of aiding and abetting a company (Logical Choice Ltd) knowingly to fail to file a GST return, intending to evade the payment of GST.

After conviction, but before sentencing, Mr Allan provided a letter from his new accountant saying that the GST appeared to have been overstated. The Judge refused to take the letter into account at sentencing.

Mr Allan was sentenced to one year's imprisonment and ordered to pay reparation of $80,000 (which included GST ($64,000) plus late payment penalties and interest).

### Decision

#### Conviction appeal

The Court dismissed the conviction appeal. It dismissed the Crown's submission that the amount of GST owing was irrelevant at trial, as the amount of GST could be relevant to whether or not Mr Allan had an intention to evade the payment of GST by the company. However the Court dismissed Mr Allan's conviction appeal on the basis that there was ample evidence of intent, such that there was no risk that the new evidence could lead to a not guilty verdict.

#### Sentence appeal

At hearing, Mr Allan abandoned his challenge to the sentence of one year's imprisonment and limited his challenge to the amount of the reparation order, on the basis of the new accountant's evidence. The four issues arising are as follows:

##### Should the Judge have held a disputed facts hearing?

Mr Allan submitted that a disputed facts hearing should have been held before sentencing because the amount of GST was an aggravating fact that affected the amount of reparation. The Crown conceded that the amount of GST may be an aggravating factor for the purposes of sentencing, but argued that section 24(1)(a) of the Sentencing Act and the wide discretion that the trial Judge has to decide what facts were proved at trial allowed a Judge to decline to hold a disputed facts hearing where section 24(2)(b) is satisfied.

The Court stated that the accused has an absolute right not to present any evidence at trial and to put the Crown to proof. The trial Judge may therefore only hear Crown evidence on a point without any contrary evidence. The Court held that natural justice required that a disputed facts hearing be held when a convicted person wishes to call evidence that was not called at trial but which is relevant to any aggravating or mitigating factors. Under section 24(2)(a) of the Sentencing Act, the court must indicate to the parties the weight it would be likely to attach to the disputed fact if it were found to exist, and its significance to the sentence or other disposition of the case.

The Court held that a disputed facts hearing should have been held unless section 109 of the TAA precluded Mr Allan from challenging the amount of GST.

##### What is the relevance of section 109 of the TAA?

Section 109 of the TAA provides that no disputable decision may be disputed in a court and shall be deemed to be taken as correct. Section 24(2)(c) of the Sentencing Act provides that if a fact is relevant and disputed, the prosecutor must prove beyond reasonable doubt the existence of any disputed aggravating fact.

Mr Allan submitted that section 109 only applies to civil proceedings. The Crown submitted that on its plain meaning section 109 applies to both criminal and civil proceedings and relied on the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court judgments in _R v Smith_ (2009) 24 NZTC 23,004 and _Smith v R_ (2009) 24 NZTC 23,176 where the Supreme Court stated that there was no justification for giving the words of section 109 anything other than their plain meaning. The Crown submitted that there was no impairment of any right or freedom under the Bill of Rights Act.

The Court accepted that there was no impairment of the Bill of Rights Act, but rejected the Crown's submission as contrary to the essential principles of a fair trial. The Court held that there was no conflict between sections 24(2)(b) and (c) and section 109. Reparation is concerned with loss. A challenge to a reparation order is not a challenge to an assessment. The Court held that the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court's comments in _Smith_ were obiter.

The Court stated that if it were wrong and there was a conflict, sections 24(2)(b) and (c) of the Sentencing Act would prevail over section 109. Alternatively, the Court would have read down section 109 as applying only to civil proceedings.

##### Should section 32(3) of the Sentencing Act have been considered?

On behalf of Mr Allan, it was submitted section 32(3) of the Sentencing Act should have been considered by the District Court Judge as if Inland Revenue had made default assessments, it would have mitigated its loss. The Court dismissed Mr Allan's submissions and held that the responsibility for the offending rested with Mr Allan and he could not blame Inland Revenue.

##### Should penalties and use of money interest be included in any reparation figure?

The Crown conceded that the loss to Inland Revenue is limited to the core tax evaded and that penalties and use of money interest should not be included as part of a sentence of reparation, as neither are a loss to Inland Revenue. The Court agreed with the concession made by the Crown as to penalties and use of money interest.

The Court granted Mr Allan's application to adduce further evidence and the appeal against sentence to reduce the amount of reparation to $51,407.70.

Repaying the Small Business Cashflow Scheme (SBCS) loan
=======================================================

You will have 5 years to pay off the loan. You do not have to make repayments in the first 2 years. Generally, we will not charge interest during the first 2 years. 

After 2 years from the date of approval of the loan you will need to begin monthly repayments of the outstanding balance. We will send you a repayment schedule in myIR, outlining the repayment dates and amounts needed.

The annual interest rate is 3% once repayments start after 2 years.

If you make voluntary repayments in the first 2 years, your repayment plan will have lower required repayments.

If you want to change a repayment plan or you cannot meet a payment at any stage, please contact us as soon as possible to talk about your situation. Any missed payments are an event of default on the loan, meaning you may have to immediately repay the loan in full , with any interest.

First 2 years interest-free
---------------------------

From 21 March 2022 the first 2 years of the loan will be interest-free. This change will apply to existing borrowers, as long as there has not been any default on your SBCS loan.

For all new borrowers, this change automatically applied from 21 March 2022. If you choose to draw down the loan in up to 4 separate amounts (up to the maximum loan amount), the 2-year interest-free period begins from the date of your first drawdown.

Loans have an annual interest rate of 3% which applies after 2 years from the date of the loan contract.

If there is an [event of default](/api/glossary/item?id={8FA05D28-0FDF-404B-BE77-298CBCAEEEA1})
 on your loan, you may have to repay the loan in full right away with any interest and default interest may be charged.

Interest on top up loans
------------------------

Existing borrowers who apply for a top up loan will have 2 separate loans with 2 separate interest-free periods. For example, for the:

*   existing SBCS loan, the interest free period applies 2 years from the date the loan was made available to you
*   top up loan, the interest free period applies 2 years from the date the first drawdown of the top up loan was made available to you.

If you choose to receive the top up loan in up to 4 separate amounts (up to the maximum loan amount) instead of a single lump sum, the interest-free period starts from your first drawdown of the top up loan. Any further drawdowns do not create a new interest-free period.

Other general rules that apply when you take out the loan
---------------------------------------------------------

If you have a change of circumstances while you still have the loan, you need to contact us as soon as possible after the change.

Examples include:

*   your business ceases or is sold
*   your business is no longer viable
*   you become insolvent
*   you enter bankruptcy, liquidation or other creditor arrangement
*   the nature of your business changes. For example the business changes from real estate agent to selling books.

If you apply for a loan with false or misleading information, or give us false or misleading information later, you may have to immediately repay the loan in full right away, with interest. You could also be investigated for offences under the Crimes Act 1961.

Interest charges if you default on the loan
-------------------------------------------

If there is a default on your loan, you have to immediately repay the loan in full with any interest and default interest may be charged.

If we recall a loan because of a default, we'll charge a higher interest rate.

The balance of the principal loan amount (plus any standard interest) will have default interest calculated on it. The default interest is calculated daily. Default interest is the standard interest rate of 3% rate plus an added amount and is calculated as follows:

Loan balance x \[UOMI (use of money interest)\* + Standard loan interest\]

In this formula:

*   loan balance includes principal and standard loan interest
*   \* UOMI underpayment rate.

Unlike UOMI charged in other taxes, the interest charged on the loan cannot be remitted.

[Interest on overpayments and underpayments (UOMI)](/managing-my-tax/penalties-and-interest/interest-on-overpayments-and-underpayments)

Payment methods
---------------

You can make payments towards your SBCS loan using any of our repayment options, including direct debit. The tax type for Small Business Cashflow Scheme repayments is SBC.

Ways of paying
--------------

You can ask us to pay any tax refund towards your loan balance instead of paying it to you. If you'd like to do this, you'll need to message us in myIR. Refunds may be used to pay off other tax debts first, if you have them.

It's important to use the right tax code when you're working. This lets your employer know they need to make deductions from your salary or wages.

If you earn salary or wages use the SL tax code
-----------------------------------------------

When you get a salary or wage and have a student loan you must add 'SL' to your tax code. This tells your employer you have a student loan and they need to deduct repayments from your pay to put towards your loan.

The repayments from your income depend on:

*   how much you earn
*   if it is your main or secondary income.

[About tax codes](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/tax-codes-and-tax-rates-for-individuals/about-tax-codes)
 

You make student loan repayments when you earn more than the repayment threshold
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The amount you have to pay to your student loan each year is 12% of every dollar you earn over the repayment threshold. 

For the 2025 tax year the annual repayment threshold is $24,128.

The repayment threshold is broken down into the following pay period thresholds.

*   $464 if you're paid weekly.
*   $928 if you're paid fortnightly.
*   $1,856 if you're paid every 4 weeks.
*   $2,010.66 if you're paid monthly.

Student loan repayments for your main job
-----------------------------------------

You repay 12% of every dollar you earn over the pay period repayment threshold when you use a tax code with 'SL' for your main job (M SL or ME SL).

For example, in the 2025 tax year, if you earn $600 a week before tax, your repayment will be $16.32.

$600 (weekly pay before tax) − $464 (weekly repayment threshold) = $136.  
$136 (income over the repayment threshold) × 12% (repayment rate) = $16.32.

Benefits and payments from Ministry of Social Development (MSD) are considered main sources of income, but can only use the M tax code (not M SL). This means no student loan repayments are deducted from these sources of income. If you get a payment from MSD and earn other income, you may want to apply for a student loan special deduction rate.

[Student loan special deduction rate](/student-loans/living-in-new-zealand-with-a-student-loan/repaying-my-student-loan-when-i-earn-salary-or-wages/student-loan-special-deduction-rate)

Student loan repayments for your secondary job
----------------------------------------------

The repayment threshold does not apply to secondary jobs because it has already been taken into account with your main job. This means you repay 12% of every dollar you earn from your secondary job to your student loan.

For example, if you earn $200 a week before tax in a secondary job, your repayment will be $24.

$200 (weekly pay before tax) × 12% (repayment rate) = $24

### Special deduction rates for secondary jobs

If you have more than 1 job and you earn less than the pay period repayment threshold from your main job, you can apply for a special deduction rate for your secondary job. This lets the unused amount of the pay period repayment threshold to be used with your secondary income, reducing your repayments.

Repayment deduction exemptions
------------------------------

In some situations, you may earn over the pay period repayment threshold, but less than the annual repayment threshold (such as working a holiday job). A student loan repayment deduction exemption may be the best option for you in these situations.

Pay your loan off faster with extra repayments
----------------------------------------------

You can make extra repayments to your loan if you want to pay it off faster.

Adjustments to deductions
-------------------------

Your employer may need to correct the amount of a student loan deduction after they have notified you or us, if the original amount was incorrect. To provide you with certainty, after 4 years your assessment is final.

When you're based overseas, you'll need to make minimum repayments on your student loan or apply for a temporary repayment suspension.  You'll also need to be aware of how to make payments from overseas. You can get someone to act on your behalf here in New Zealand.

We recommend that you set up regular weekly or monthly payments as it's much easier to stay on track.

[Getting someone to act on my behalf](/managing-my-tax/getting-someone-to-act-on-my-behalf)

Due dates and minimum repayments based on your student loan balance
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We send you an assessment notice each year that tells you the minimum payments you need to make. Your payments are generally due by 30 September and 31 March. If 1 or both of these dates have passed by the time we notify you, we may adjust these dates.

### Minimum repayments when you first become overseas-based

The amount you initially need to pay by each due date depends on your loan balance when you first become overseas-based, which is the day after you leave New Zealand.

### Minimum repayments when you remain overseas-based

Your repayments are based on your total loan balance on 31 March each year you are overseas-based. There are 2 things to keep in mind with overseas-based repayments.

1.  Your minimum repayments may go up if your loan balance increases and moves into the next repayment bracket. This may be due to a new loan, or interest or penalties as there has been a default on the loan.
2.  Your minimum repayments will not go down as your loan balance gets smaller.

New Zealand based student loan deductions made while you are overseas-based will not be credited towards your overseas-based assessment. These will be credited towards your overall loan balance.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |Student loan repayment amounts and their due dates for overseas-based customers.
| Loan balance | Amount to pay by 30 September | Amount to pay by 31 March |
| --- | --- | --- |
| less than $1,000 | Half your total loan balance. | The remaining half of your total loan balance as at 1 April the previous year. |
| $1,000 to $15,000 | $500 | $1,000 |
| $15,000 to $30,000 | $1,000 | $2,000 |
| $30,000 to $45,000 | $1,500 | $3,000 |
| $45,000 to $60,000 | $2,000 | $4,000 |
| over $60,000 | $2,500 | $5,000 |

At the current interest rate, if your loan is over $142,860, your repayments will not be enough to cover your interest. There are some situations where your loan may remain interest free when you're overseas.

You can make loan payments online
---------------------------------

If you live in Australia, the United Kingdom, Europe, Canada or the United States, you can set up direct debit payments in your myIR account.

Other payment options include:

*   credit or debit card
*   money (telegraphic) transfer.

[Paying from overseas](/managing-my-tax/make-a-payment/ways-of-paying/paying-from-overseas)

### Money transfer things to be aware of

If a money transfer provider does not process your payment to us in time for the funds to clear by the due date, it will remain outstanding. We may charge penalties or interest. It is your responsibility to make sure you:

*   pay and file on time
*   make payments to us either on or before the New Zealand due date
*   check if the provider you choose charges international fees.

In a number of cases the bank in New Zealand you send your telegraphic transfer to will charge a fee from the amount you transfer. Make sure you allow for this when you send money to us this way.

[Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2012](/new-legislation/act-articles/student-loan-scheme-amendment-act-2012 "Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2012")

Repayment holiday
=================

2012 Student Loan rules reduce the repayment holiday for overseas-based borrowers from three years to one, and require borrowers to apply for a repayment holiday.

_**New sections 106 to 108A, sections 110, 112 and 115(1), and schedule 6, clause 9**_

The new rules reduce the repayment holiday for overseas-based borrowers from three years to one, and require borrowers to apply for a repayment holiday. Borrowers must apply before the expiry of 183 days (six months) from the date of departure, and as part of the application process, they must supply details of a contact person who resides in New Zealand.

### Background

Under the previous rules, borrowers received an automatic three-year holiday from any repayment obligation when they left New Zealand. The three-year holiday was considered generous and could result in borrowers not resuming repayments when the repayment holiday came to an end. As part of the Budget 2011 student support package, it was announced that the repayment holiday would be reduced, and that borrowers would need to apply for it. The changes in the new legislation seek to improve repayments from overseas-based borrowers, and signal to borrowers the importance of repaying the loan when the repayment holiday comes to an end.

### Key features

Sections 106 to 108 have been repealed and replaced with new sections 106 to 108A. The "opt-in" and "opt-out" provisions have been replaced with an application process. A borrower may apply for a repayment holiday within 183 days from the date of departure, meaning that an overseas-based borrower may not apply for a repayment holiday. New section 107B provides for the Commissioner to grant a repayment holiday if satisfied that the borrower has nominated a contact person and has not reached the borrower's repayment holiday limit. The repayment holiday has been reduced from three years to one.

### Application date

The changes apply from 1 April 2012.

### Detailed analysis

A borrower may apply for a repayment holiday within 183 days from their date of departure (section 107).

When an application is made, the borrower must appoint a New Zealand-based contact person (section 107A).

The Commissioner may grant a repayment holiday if the borrower has nominated a contact person, and has not reached their repayment holiday limit (section 107B(1)).

Section 107B(3) prescribes when the borrower has reached their repayment holiday limit as follows:

1.  The borrower has had a repayment holiday of one year (365 days).
2.  The borrower has had a three-year repayment holiday under the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992.
3.  The borrower has had a repayment holiday for less than three years under the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992, and has had their entitlement set to the lesser of one year or their remaining entitlement under the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992.
4.  The borrower has had the repayment holiday continued under the transitional provisions in section 108A(2).

For borrowers who are on a repayment holiday as at 1 April 2012, their entitlement will be set to the lesser of one year or their remaining entitlement (section 108A(2)). For example, if a borrower has been overseas for one year as at 1 April 2012, under the 1992 Act they would have had two years remaining of their repayment holiday. On 1 April 2012, their entitlement will be set to one further year, rather than two years.

Section 108A(1) applies to borrowers who have used part of their repayment holiday and have not exceeded their repayment holiday limit—they must now apply for a repayment holiday if they intend to go overseas.

A borrower is deemed to be "overseas-based" when the borrower has been overseas for 184 or more consecutive days. Section 107B(2) recognises that to be granted a repayment holiday a borrower must be overseas-based. Despite this, section 108 deems the repayment holiday to have commenced on the first day of the period of the borrower's physical absence from New Zealand.

The repayment holiday ends on the earlier of the day that the borrower reaches their limit and the day on which the borrower ceases to be overseas-based.

Sections 110, 112 and 115 have been amended as a consequence of reducing the repayment holiday to one year.

Repeal of fund withdrawal tax
=============================

2010 legislation repeals fund withdrawal tax - payable on superannuation fund withdrawals relating to employer contributions for employees on highest tax rate.

As a consequence of the alignment of the top ESCT rate and the top personal tax rate at 33% in Budget 2010, fund withdrawal tax (FWT) was to be phased out so that it would not apply to contributions made after 1 October 2010.

However, FWT has instead been repealed for all withdrawals from 1 April 2011, which is the date from which there is no discrepancy between the top ESCT rate and the top actual tax rate.

### Background

FWT is a tax of between 4.2% and 5% payable on certain superannuation fund withdrawals that relate to employer contributions for members whose income is above $70,000. FWT was introduced to ensure that employees who are on the highest tax rate (38% until 1 October 2010) are not under-taxed under the employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) rules, as the top rate for ESCT was 33%.

Without FWT it would have been possible for a person on the 38% tax rate to "salary sacrifice" by agreeing with their employer to pay a contribution to a superannuation fund instead of salary. This contribution would have been taxed at a final rate of 33%. If the person later withdrew the employer contribution from the fund there would have been no further tax on the withdrawal. As not all superannuation funds require that members' funds are "locked" in the fund until retirement, this would have provided a mechanism for people on 38% to have salary and wages taxed at 33% rather than 38%.

The Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2010 reduced the top marginal PAYE rate of 38% to 33% from 1 October 2010. This means that from 1 October 2010 there will be no discrepancy between the top ESCT rate and the top marginal PAYE rate (which is the final rate that applies for non-filing individuals). From 1 April 2011, there will be no discrepancy between the top ESCT rate and the top personal tax rate (which is the final rate that applies for individuals who file returns). As a result, there will no longer be a need for FWT.

Rather than repealing FWT outright, the Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2010 had preserved FWT for contributions made before 1 October 2010 and then phased it out after five years. The rationale was that repealing FWT carries a theoretical risk of salary sacrifice in the period after the Budget but before marginal tax rates are aligned with ESCT.

### Key features

Subpart CS has been repealed from 1 April 2011. This means that FWT will not apply to withdrawals after this date.

If a withdrawal is made before 1 April 2011, funds will need to return income that relates to the 2010-11 or earlier income year according to section CS 1(8), notwithstanding that subpart CS is repealed from 1 April 2011. For example, if a withdrawal to which section CS 1 applies is made on 1 August 2010 (during the fund's 2010-11 income year), the fund will need to include an amount calculated under section CS 1 in their income for the 2011-12 income year.

A number of consequential repeals have been made in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 to reflect the repeal of FWT.

*   Section CX 10(2)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007, which provided that a loan made by a superannuation fund is not a fringe benefit if it falls under the FWT rules.
*   Section HM 37(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007, which provided that income derived under FWT rules by a multi-rate PIE is treated as income to which no investor has an investor interest.
*   Section RD 72 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which provided that a trustee may recover FWT from member's distribution.
*   Section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which defined:
    *   "member" (paragraph (b))
    *   "withdrawal"
    *   "significant financial hardship"
    *   "trust rules" (paragraph (a))
*   Section 32B of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which provided that a superannuation fund can request information from a member or member's employer in respect of FWT.
*   Section 32C of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which provided that a superannuation fund can request information from a transferor super fund in respect of FWT.
*   Section 165AA of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which provided that a superannuation fund may recover FWT from a member's distribution.

Under section 4 of the Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2010, funds would have been required to track contributions made before and after 1 October 2010 until FWT was eventually phased out after five years. This provision has been repealed from 7 September 2010.

### Application dates

Amendments to repeal FWT apply from 1 April 2011.

Section 4 of the Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2010 has been repealed from 7 September 2010, which is the date that the Taxation (Annual Rates, Trans-Tasman Savings Portability, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 received Royal assent.

Repeal of Research and Development tax credit
=============================================

2008 legislation repeals the research and development tax credit effective from the 2009-10 income year.

**Sections LH 1 to 6, LH 8 to LH 16, YA 1, YB 20(2) and schedule 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections 3(1), 33A(2), 43A(2), 91AAP and 108(1B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994**

The research and development tax credit has been repealed, effective from the 2009-10 income year. The tax credit remains in place for the 2008-09 income year.

**Background**

A 15% tax credit for eligible expenditure on R&D activities was introduced in 2007, with effect from the 2008-09 income year.

The subsequent repeal of the tax credit was foreshadowed in the 2008 general election campaign. As the explanatory note of the Taxation (Urgent Measures and Annual Rates) Bill explained:

> ... The Government's objective in repealing the tax credit is to move towards a broad-based, low-rate tax system, which will improve the quality of investment and reduce distortions.
> 
> Removing the R&D tax credit will also partially fund the reduction in personal tax rates. The Government considers the benefits of reducing tax rates are certain, whereas the benefits of the R&D tax credit are less certain.
> 
> The Government is concerned that much of the credit will fund R&D that would have occurred in any case, the compliance costs associated with claiming the credit are high and that the credit will be paid out on standard operating expenditure re-characterised as R&D-related expenditure.

### Key features

**Main repeal (sections LH 1 to LH 6, LH 8 to LH 14, LH 16, YA 1, YB 20(2)(ob) and schedule 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007)**

The provisions that determine eligibility and calculate the value of the R&D tax credit have been repealed from the 2009-10 income year.

Expenditure on activities that take place in the 2009-10 or subsequent income years will not be eligible for the tax credit.  

**Example 1: Effect on research and development projects**

F Co starts a two-year R&D venture in the 2008-09 income year that includes activities that meet the definition of eligible R&D activities in each year. The eligible expenditure and depreciation loss totals $350,000 in the 2008-09 income year. In that year, F Co incurs expenditure of $100,000 on activities carried out in New Zealand and $250,000 on activities carried out in Australia. The activities continue into the 2009-10 income year, and the firm incurs $300,000 of expenditure on activities carried out in New Zealand that would have been eligible for the tax credit had the credit not been repealed.

F Co can claim the R&D tax credit for the eligible New Zealand expenditure and depreciation loss for the 2008-09 income year, but not for any portion of the overseas expenditure or depreciation loss for that year (since more than half of the eligible expenditure or depreciation loss must be incurred in New Zealand). Expenditure in the 2009-10 income year is no longer eligible for a tax credit.

Consequential amendments repeal schedule 21 and the definitions of "district health board", "industry research co-operative", "listed research provider", "overseas eligible expenditure", "research and development project" and "tertiary institution" from section YA 1. For simplicity, the repeal date of the schedule and these definitions are aligned with the last possible date of the 2008-09 income year.

**Deferred or carried-forward expenditure (sections LH 2 and LH 6(5) of the Income Tax Act 2007)**

Expenditure on activities carried out in the 2008-09 income year that would have been eligible for a tax credit only in a subsequent year will no longer be eligible.

This means that an adjustment made in the 2008-09 income year under section DB 50 of the Income Tax Act 2007 for unpaid expenditure on employment income will not be eligible when the deferred income is paid out in a subsequent period. Similarly, overseas eligible expenditure that has to be carried forward from the 2008-09 income year because the claimant has insufficient local expenditure on the same R&D project in that year will no longer be eligible for the tax credit.

**Example 2: Eligible overseas expenditure**

A New Zealand company, G Co, incurs eligible expenditure of $1 million on R&D activities carried out in New Zealand in the 2008-09 income year. In the same year, it also incurs eligible expenditure of $400,000 on R&D conducted overseas on the same R&D project.

In the following year, it incurs expenditure of $500,000 on activities carried out in New Zealand that would have been part of the same R&D project and that would have been eligible for a tax credit had the tax credit not been repealed.

G Co can claim the R&D tax credit for the local expenditure in the 2008-09 income year and on any overseas expenditure incurred that year, up to the value of 10 percent of the New Zealand eligible amount, which in this case is $100,000. The other $300,000 of overseas expenditure is not eligible for a tax credit in the 2008-09 income year or in subsequent years.

#### Listed research providers (section LH 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007)

The provisions that relate to a listed research provider (LRP) will be repealed from 1 October 2009. That will allow claimants, including those with late balance dates, to use the exception to the minimum threshold for eligible expenditure paid to a non-associated LRP.

#### Administration (sections 3(1), 33A(2), 43A(2), 91AAP and 108(IB) of the Tax Administration Act 1994)

As a result of the main repeal of the R&D tax credit, provisions no longer necessary to administer the tax credit have been repealed. The definition of "response period" in section 3(1) has been amended because the time periods that relate to claims for the 2010-11 and subsequent income years are no longer necessary. A similar amendment has been made to section 108(1B). Sections 33A(2)(db) and 43A(2)(d)(iib) have been repealed from the 2009-10 income year. Section 91AAP is repealed from the date that the provision was initially enacted.

A number of administrative and definition provisions have been retained so that the tax credit can continue to be administered for the 2008-09 income year.

### Application date

Repeal of the R&D tax credit is effective from the 2009-10 income year.

It underpins voluntary compliance and ensures society’s support for the system. While views differ on what constitutes a fair tax system, they need to be grounded on facts and real data. For the first time, we now have that real data – thanks to this report. New Zealand is not a highly taxed nation. We sit in the middle of the OECD in terms of total taxes as a proportion of the economy. To understand whether our tax system is fair, we need to know who pays what. This point was made by the Tax Working Group in its 2019 report. We have accurate data on wealth for more than 90% of the population from surveys such as the Household Economic Survey (HES). But these sample surveys do not provide the information we need on the true wealth – and, therefore, total income – of the wealthiest families, and the taxes they pay on that income. The highest net worth of anyone ever surveyed in the HES is less than $40 million. We know there are people much wealthier than that in our country, including some billionaires. So, the survey is out by a factor of hundreds for this subset of the population. We know the tax rate paid by wage and salary earners and small business owners on their income. But until now, we have not known what tax the top cohort in New Zealand pays on their economic income. To help fill this significant gap, in 2021 the Government provided Inland Revenue with funding and legal powers to undertake this High-Wealth Individuals Research Project. That has enabled Inland Revenue to calculate the effective tax rates (ETR) for high- wealth families. It provides crucial information on which to assess the true fairness of our tax system. The study finds that high-wealth individuals usually get their income from returns on investments. Around 80 percent of their economic income is capital gains, and much of it is earned through trusts or companies. The report shows that when personal, company and trustee taxes are included, the median family in the high-wealth group paid 8.9% of their economic income in tax. When GST is included, the median family in the high-wealth group still only pay 9.5% of their economic income in tax. For this group, GST paid is tiny, relative to their economic income compared with the other 90% of taxpayers. The results of a Treasury study of the effective tax rates paid across the full income and wealth distribution, based on a similar concept of income, have been released alongside this report, which enables comparisons with other taxpayers. It shows the effective tax rate paid by middle income New Zealanders is at least double that paid by the wealthier New Zealanders in this Inland Revenue study. Our tradies, nurses, school teachers, hospitality workers, hairdressers, cleaners, engineers and small business owners all pay much higher effective tax rates than their wealthier fellow Kiwis. We tax those who earn all their income from salaries at a much higher rate than the very wealthy. The report also shows these trends are long term. Page ii This work puts us at the forefront of the countries considering these issues. The OECD’s Centre for Tax Policy, for example, has a project on high-income earners, based on modelling scenarios, due to be released soon. However, this Inland Revenue report breaks new ground because it goes further, because it is based on actual data. I thank those who have contributed to this report. I believe it will provide a fundamental baseline for debate on the fairness of our tax system, allowing future tax policy to be based on better data and more solid evidence. Hon David Parker Minister of Revenue Page | 1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1. The taxation of top income earners or high-wealth individuals has been the subject of considerable research in international literature over recent years. One area of study is whether top income or wealth households disproportionately earn the types of income that are subject to lighter taxation in tax systems. 2. This report describes the outcomes of the High-Wealth Individuals Research Project (the Project). It contributes to this literature by investigating how much tax a group of high-wealth New Zealand families pay relative to their income – that is, their average effective tax rates (ETRs). It paints a comprehensive picture of ETRs for those high-wealth families by estimating the families’ ETRs based on economic income. Economic income is a measure of income that includes all items that increase an individual’s ability to consume goods or services, that is, both taxable and non-taxable sources of income. 3. This report breaks new ground as ETRs for the high-wealth families (the Project population) are calculated by combining tax administration data, public data and survey data collected specifically for this Project. The main period for which ETRs are calculated is the six-year period 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2021 (the Project period). 1 4. The tax system supports the well-being of New Zealanders by providing revenue to fund public goods and services, influencing behaviours, and as a means of redistribution. The progressive nature of New Zealand’s income tax means that the tax system plays a role in reducing inequality and encouraging social cohesion. This report supports the fundamental objectives of the tax system by providing insights into how the tax system impacts on New Zealand society. Personal taxable income ETRs 5. To provide a comparator to ETRs based on economic income, we first calculate ETRs for the Project population based on personal taxable income and personal tax. Personal taxable income is income individuals receive that is taxable, such as salary, wages, interest and dividends. 6. The median personal taxable income ETR of the Project population was around 30% on a median taxable income of $268,000 for individuals. This result shows that taxes on personal taxable income are progressive and that high-wealth families will generally have a relatively high ETR on personal taxable income. 7. By comparison, for any year of the Project period, a person with personal taxable income of $50,000 would have had an ETR on this income of 16% and an individual with personal taxable income of $100,000 would have had an ETR on this income of 24%. Further, when considering the tax and transfer system jointly, many individuals in low-income deciles receive more in the form of government cash transfers than they pay in tax. If such transfers are netted off tax paid, these individuals will have very low or negative ETRs. Economic income ETRs 8. Economic income is a broader concept of income than taxable income as it includes non-taxed forms of income, such as capital gains on shares and real property. It seeks to measure the increase in an individual’s economic resources during a period. As Sapere note in a recent study, since not all economic income 1 Referred to as the 2016-2021 income years. The top personal tax rate was 33% over this period. Page | 2 is taxable, statutory tax rates do not provide an accurate indication of the actual rates of tax that are imposed on the actual economic income derived by individuals and households (Murray et al., 2023 p27). 9. ETRs based on economic income are calculated as tax divided by economic income. Our measure of economic income includes income taxable at the personal level, and in trusts, and additional income from the ownership of real property and portfolio assets and from the ownership of business entities, such as companies. In the main, this additional income is capital gains income. Capital gains income from assets held in trusts is also included. The taxes we include in our comprehensive economic ETRs are personal tax, company tax and trustee tax. Any estimates of ETRs for the wealthiest individuals are uncertain and open to refinement, due to current data limitations. 10. The approach we take in this report is similar to recent work undertaken by the United States Council of Economic Advisers that estimates ETRs for the 400 wealthiest US families based on tax administration and other data (Leiserson & Yagan, 2021). It stands with other recent work on the taxation of top income or wealth households, such as recent OECD work (Hourani et al (in press)) and Advani and Summers (2020a). 11. The Treasury has undertaken a complementary project, which models ETRs for the general New Zealand population based on a similar concept of income to that used in our report. Comparisons between the projects key results are provided at paragraph 50. 12. Our results show that the average ETRs for the Project population, based on economic income, are significantly lower than the average personal taxable income ETR, of around 30%, for the Project population. When all sources of income and tax (except GST) are included, the family median ETR is 8.9% and the weighted-mean ETR is 9.8% (these are measures of the average ETR over the Project period). 13. We also calculate these ETRs including GST as tax. While there are difficulties in comparing GST to income, as GST is levied on consumption, including GST allows a fuller assessment of the overall tax system. Consideration of GST is important given that GST constitutes around a third of central government tax revenue. The inclusion of GST in the ETR only increases the family median ETR over the Project period by 0.5 percentage points. 14. The Project population receives a small portion of their income through government transfers in the form of superannuation. Netting transfers off tax has minimal impact on the average ETRs – reducing the median ETR (excluding GST) by 0.3 percentage points. Income from home ownership (capital gains on the owner-occupied property and imputed rental) is also a small proportion of the income of the Project population. These items have minimal impact on the average ETRs of the Project population. 15. The above results are for measures of the average ETRs. There is substantial variation in ETRs within the Project population and, as capital gains are volatile, by year. ETRs for individuals can be above the average ETR on personal taxable income or close to zero in the case of high capital gains. ETRs can also be negative if there are capital losses, for example, if corporate tax is paid in a year when an individual made a capital loss on holding shares. The role of capital gains 16. The main source of untaxed income included in the ETRs is accrued and realised capital gains. Overall, the capital gains of the Project population significantly Page | 3 reduce their ETRs when compared to income based on taxable sources, such as wages and salary. 17. The average ETRs of the Project population are lower than the ETR on incomes consisting of only wages and salary for any point in the income distribution (that is, the lowest average ETR on only wages and salary is 10.5%). Note, however, when government cash transfers are considered (such as Working for Families or superannuation), and treated as a negative tax, families in low deciles may have a lower (and potentially negative) ETR than the Project population averages. 18. While capital gains can accrue to all asset owners, net worth in New Zealand is concentrated in upper net worth deciles. According to the Household Economic Survey (HES) 2018, the top 2 percent wealthiest households own 25 percent of total net worth, and the top one percent holds over 25 percent of the financial assets in New Zealand. The capital gains of the Project population significantly exceed the average capital gains of the general population. 19. While the results in this report are estimates, the magnitude of the reduction in ETRs estimated when capital gains are included shows that capital gains are a significant source of untaxed income for high-wealth families. This result is true even if there is significant error in the measurements. Scenario testing of different assumptions, including assuming capital gains were 20 percent lower, did not significantly change this conclusion. Interpretation of results 20. It can be argued that where there are forms of income that are subject to low or no taxation, individuals will be incentivised to invest in the assets earning that income until the post-tax return (adjusted for risk) on income from those assets is equal to the post-tax return on income from assets with taxable income streams. In effect, individuals will bid up the price of these assets, lowering the return from the asset until the post-tax return equals that of taxed investments. The lower return derived from the asset is a cost from the tax system that is not captured in average effective tax rates. 21. To the extent that tax rules cause pre-tax returns to adjust, the tax system will have impacts on progressivity that cannot be picked up solely by looking at how average tax rates vary with income. This will be particularly relevant to investment assets that are liquid (so their market value easily changes and represents capitalised earnings) and where the pre-tax returns being generated by assets are not likely to depend on the owner of the assets. However, where investment returns depend on the skill of the investor (such as in controlled business entities), or are otherwise unique, market adjustments are likely to do less to equalise post-tax returns. For the Project population, much of their income is derived from business entities that they control. 22. Failing to tax forms of income that are earned predominantly by those who are better off is likely to have an important impact in reducing the progressivity of the tax system and is also likely to impose other economic costs through influencing the pattern of investment in the economy. Page | 4 Key findings 23. Key findings from the ETR analysis are set out here. 24. These key findings relate to 311 high-wealth New Zealand families (the Project population). 2 The mean estimated net worth of the families in the Project population for 2021 is $276 million and the median is $106 million. By comparison, based on HES 2021 data, Stats NZ estimates the starting point for the wealthiest 1 percent of households (that is, the wealthiest 19,000 households) to be $7.6 million. Income 25. For the Project population, the median family economic income for 2018 was around $8 million and the median tax on this income was around $642,000. The Project population earned a significant amount of income from capital gains. A substantial amount of income (67 percent of the Project population’s economic income) was earned through trusts, either as trustee income or capital gains on trust assets. 3 26. Figure ES1 4 shows the composition of the Project population’s income, over the six-year Project period. It shows that 7 percent of the Project population’s economic income was from personal taxable income and 10 percent from taxable trustee income. Other property, portfolio and business entity income largely consists of capital gains income, earned either directly or through a trust. Capital gains from business entities was particularly significant, being just over 50 percent of economic income over the Project period. Figure ES1: Income sources as a percentage of economic income 27. The Project population’s annual economic income varied over the Project period from $1 billion in 2017 to $14.6 billion 2021. This volatility was largely due to volatility in business entity income. The year ending 31 March 2021 saw particularly high income. This was largely due to high capital gains being generated on assets in this year and, to a much lesser extent (around 3 percent of the increase), increased dividends and shareholder salary pay outs prior to the top personal tax rate increasing to 39%. 2 For the key findings section, the Project population is those families that responded to the surveys. 3 Beneficiary income included in personal taxable income is not included as trust income in this figure. 4 Personal taxable income and trustee income include taxable income from property, portfolio and business entity investments such as rent, interest and dividends. These income elements are not included in the other categories. Personal taxable income and other income for Project population April arch Personal taxable incomeTrustee income attributedOther portfolio income Other property incomeOther business entity income Page | 5 Effective tax rates (ETRs) 28. The report calculates average effective tax rates, that is, tax divided by income. 5 This shows how much tax is paid on each dollar of income included in the ETR, taking account of different income sources having different effective tax rates. For example, if a person had two income sources, one of $200 for which $60 of tax is paid (this has an ETR of 30%) and one of $100 for which $1 of tax is paid (this has an ETR of 1%), the average tax rate is 20.3%. 6 This is a weighted average and takes account of the relative size of the income sources. 29. ETRs based on economic income are calculated starting with income taxable at the personal level (base income) and the tax on this income (personal tax). This gives the base income ETR, which is a comparator for other ETRs. Additional economic income is added to base income for the economic income ETRs. When an income flow that bears company or trustee tax is added, this tax is included in the ETR. The median and weighted-mean ETRs are ways of presenting the average ETR for the Project population. 30. The degree to which an economic income ETR is below the base income ETR indicates the extent to which the additional income is taxed at an average tax rate below that for personal taxable income and its relative size. To illustrate, in the example above, if the first income stream were base income (ETR 30%), when the second income stream is added (ETR 1%) it only reduces the ETR to 20.3% (rather than the simple mean of 15.5%) as the second income stream is smaller than the first. If the second income stream were also $200, and $2 of tax was paid (ETR 1%), the ETR would be 15.5%. Median Project period ETRs 31. The Project period ETR for an individual or family is the sum of the individual’s or family’s tax over all six years divided by the sum of their income over all six years. The median ETR represents the mid-point of the ETRs. 32. For the family, the median base income ETR (that is, the ETR for income taxable at the personal level) over the Project period is 30.1%. 33. When all income sources and all tax are included in the ETR, this gives the all- income ETR. The median Project period all-income ETR (excluding GST) for the family is 8.9%, indicating the additional economic income included is taxed at a substantially lower rate than the Project population’s personal taxable income. The inclusion of GST only increases this ETR by 0.5 percentage points. 34. The above analysis treats transfers as income. If, alternatively, transfers are treated as a negative tax and deducted from the numerator, the median all- income ETR for the Project period (excluding GST) reduces to 8.6%. Project period population ETR (population weighted-mean ETR) 35. The Project period population ETR is the sum of all the tax of all members of the population over all six years divided by the sum of all their income over all six years. It provides an income-weighted mean for the population. 36. The Project period population ETR (excluding GST) for the family, including all income sources, is 9.8%. This compares to a base income ETR on the same measure of 32.1%. When transfer income is deducted from the tax (the numerator) it is 9.7%. The inclusion of GST in taxes increases the ETR by 0.3 5 All ETRs are calculated from their income and tax elements. ETRs are not calculated from other ETRs. 6 That is, 61/300 or (30\*.666+ 1\*.333). Page | 6 percentage points. Imputed rental, which is the benefit one receives from owning their own home, is included in this ETR but makes minimal difference. 37. Table ES1 compares the Project period median ETRs and the Project period population (weighted-mean) ETRs. Table ES1: Project period all-income ETRs for family Type of ETR Weighted mean Median Base income 32.1% 30.1% All-income ETR 9.9% 9.3% All-income plus imputed rental ETR 9.8% 8.9% All-income plus imputed rental netting transfers 9.7% 8.6% All-income plus imputed rental and GST ETR 10.1% 9.5% Significance of income from different asset classes 38. We were interested in whether income, additional to taxable income, from property, portfolio or business entity assets had the biggest impact on reducing the ETR from the base income ETR. To test this, we add each income source to the base income ETR in isolation. This generates the all-property, all-portfolio and all-business entity asset class ETRs. These ETRs show the average tax rate assuming income is comprised of only base income and income from the particular asset class. 39. These ETRs can be compared to each other to understand the relative magnitude of the impact of the income source on the ETR. The impact of a particular income source on the ETR depends on both the ETR on that income source and the relative size of the income source. For example, if an income source is untaxed, but is small compared to base income, it will have minimal effect on the ETR. If an income source is taxed at around 30%, it will have minimal effect on changing the ETR from the base income ETR no matter its size. 40. Figure ES2 7 shows that all three income sources have a similar impact on the Project period population all-income ETR. While income from business entities is larger, the addition of company and trading trust tax to the ETR when this income source is included balances this. 41. For the Project population, property income is larger than portfolio income (19 percent and 13 percent of income). However, property income bears some additional tax when property is held in land-rich entities, whereas additional portfolio income does not. Overall, this results in these two income streams having a similar impact on the ETR. 42. The all-property, all-portfolio and all-business entity ETRs do not include trustee income and trustee tax, whereas the all-income ETR does. The difference between the “all-income other than additional trust income and tax” ETR and the all-income ETR shows the impact of adding trustee income and tax (which has a relatively high ETR, of 33%, but is only 10% of economic income). 7 Imputed rental is included in these ETRs. Page | 7 Figure ES2: Comparison of Project period population ETRs by family 43. The ETR when all income sources are included is lower than the ETR when income from a single asset class is included. This is because each asset class ETR only includes base income and personal tax and economic income and any income tax from that asset class. When income from all sources is included, the income in the ETR calculation is higher as it is the total of all income. This means that the tax amount is spread across more income. Longer periods 44. One consideration is whether the ETRs would be different over a longer time frame. The Project period (1 April 2015 to 31 March 2021) saw somewhat elevated asset price growth compared to measures of longer-term averages (see paragraph 3.18). This may mean the ETRs are lower than they would be in a period of lower asset price growth. However, as a scenario, we tested reducing capital gains from property over the Project period by 20 percent, compared to the main scenario. This only increased the all-income Project period population ETR by 0.4 percentage points. When capital gains from all sources are reduced by 20 percent, the all-income Project period population ETR increased by 1.9 percentage points to 11.7% (excluding GST). Therefore, capital gains would have resulted in a significant reduction in ETRs, compared to the base income ETR, even if they had been 20 percent lower over the Project period. 45. Additionally, we estimated an ETR based on income from significant holdings in listed companies (SHLCs) over a longer period. As this ETR is based on public data, it could be calculated over the period 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2021. Over this period, the total capital gains of the subgroup that had SHLCs (45 individuals) was $6 billion (of this, there was $1.7 billion in realised capital gains). The median listed company ETR for this group over this period was 13.4% and the weighted-mean ETR was 9.9%. Therefore, even over an extended period, ETRs based on economic income are lower than those based on personal taxable income. Comparison to capital gains of the general population 46. The Project population earns significantly larger capital gains than the general New Zealand population (general population). Even when residential real property, the most widely held asset class, is considered, the Project population’s capital gains are relatively large.

Figure ES3: Mean residential real property capital gains by net worth decile for general and Project population - 2018 Source: Household Economic Survey (2018) and Project data. Comparability to the Treasury and other New Zealand ETR estimates 47. The Treasury has estimated ETRs for the general population based on a similar concept of income. The Treasury’s longer-term ETR estimates (10-year capital gains rate), without inflation adjustment, are the most comparable series to our median ETR estimates (see Appendix F). 48. However, as the Treasury’s estimates are based on HES data, they are not able to include company tax in the ETRs (although they count amounts met with imputation credits as personal income tax). Further, trustee taxable income and tax are omitted in the Treasury work but are included in our all-income measures. The inclusion of company tax and trustee income and tax in our estimates will make the ETRs in this report higher than those of the Treasury for the same income composition. This will be most significant for higher net worth deciles, in particular deciles 9 and 10 (ventiles 17 to 20). This means the Treasury estimates for lower and middle net worth deciles are more comparable to our estimates than those for higher deciles. In comparing results, care should be taken to ensure transfers are treated consistently (that is, whether transfers have been treated as a negative tax). 49. Even aside from the above caveats, there is no single ‘correct’ comparator between the Treasury ETRs estimated for the general population and our ETRs for the high-wealth population. Below we compare the Treasury estimate for the ETR of a family in the middle of the net worth distribution and middle of the income distribution (being the median adult-equivalent family in ventile 10 9 ) to our estimates. Both estimates used in this comparison subtract transfers from taxes. 8 For the Project population, property in land-rich entities is not included. 9 Ventiles divide a distribution into 20 groups. Ventile 10 is the middle of the distribution.

The Treasury finds that the: ▪ median equivalised-family ETR for net worth ventile 10 is 16.1% if GST is not included in the ETR and the median equivalised-family ETR for income ventile 10 is 15.9% if GST is not included in the ETR. The median for the high-wealth population on the same basis is 8.6%. ▪ median equivalised-family ETR for net worth ventile 10 is 20.2% if GST is included in the ETR and the median equivalised-family ETR for income ventile 10 is 19.7 percent if GST is not included in the ETR. The median for the high-wealth population on the same basis is 9.4%. 51. While there are some differences in methodology, the estimates in this paper can also be compared to recent ETR estimates by Sapere that also seek to measure ETRs based on economic income. The Sapere research shows scenarios assuming that most income is earned in a taxable form up until retirement. In contrast, the Project population earn most of their income as returns on investment that are not directly taxable. Only 17 percent of the Project population’s income is taxable under the personal tax scale or as trustee income. 52. For example, Sapere provides a scenario of a high-income professional working couple with no dependents who earns 64 percent of their income in the form of taxable wages and salaries or taxable investments in Portfolio Investment Entities. This family do not receive a government benefit and live in their own home. Sapere find this family would have an average ETR of 29% at an income of $500,000. As compared to the ETRs we estimate, this shows that ETRs are significantly reduced when a large portion of income is non-taxed capital gains as opposed to taxable wages and salary or taxable investment returns (Murray et al., 2023). Inheritances and wealth 53. We also collected information on significant gifts and inheritances received by the Project population over a 50-year period. Sixty-six families declared receiving a significant gift or inheritance in this period. A total of $411 million was reported as being received, with a mean receipt for receiver families of $6.2 million. 54. Finally, an approach has been developed for this Project, with input from Stats NZ, to combine HES net worth data with the Project data set to re-estimate top wealth shares (Appendix G). Based on the combined data, our findings show that for all years the estimated shares of net worth held by the top 10 and 1 percent are higher than those estimated based on the HES alone. Structure of report 55. This report proceeds as follows: ▪ Part 1 sets out the general context for the Project, including the Project purpose, the broader social context regarding the distribution of wealth and income, and key methodological choices made by the Project. ▪ Part 2 provides a general discussion of ETRs and other relevant literature and sets out the ETR on personal taxable income. ▪ Part 3 provides the economic income ETRs over the Project period for the three main asset classes and for all sources of income. ▪ Part 4 provides the results for listed companies over longer periods and provides the results for GST, inheritances and wealth aggregates. Page | 10 Caveats and limitations 56. Several assumptions are made in estimating the income and ETRs of the Project population. This means that the income and ETR measures are approximations rather than precise estimates. 57. Further, included income is limited to income flows that are material, reasonably quantifiable or estimable, and for which the associated tax can be obtained. Outside of taxable income, capital gains were the major income type that satisfied these criteria, although other non-taxed items, such as untaxed distributions, are also accounted for. Results including an estimate of imputed rental from owner-occupied housing are also provided. 58. Some foreign income, such as foreign income earned through non-portfolio foreign companies, is not included in our measures. Survey data was subject to reporting thresholds, which excluded some income from the scope of analysis. We also do not include in ETRs some forms of gains that may be considered economic income from a broad perspective, such as gifts and inheritances. However, the treatment of these receipts is not settled in the literature. 59. Furthermore, our measures of income do not include in-kind government expenditure, such as expenditure on health and education. In-kind government expenditure generally reduces income inequality. In our main scenarios we treat government transfers, such as superannuation, as income rather than as a negative tax. However, given the Project population receive minimal government cash transfers, this has minimal impact on the population weighted-mean ETR. 60. The accuracy of the ETRs estimated varies depending on the quality of the data and the method of estimation. Data on taxable income is the most accurate, followed by measures based on market prices (listed company income) or comparable sales data (real property income). Assumptions have been made to estimate income from portfolio and business entity investments, making ETRs including these sources less accurate. The accuracy of the measures, from most to least accurate, is as follows: ▪ Taxable/base income ETR ▪ Listed company ETR ▪ Property ETR ▪ Portfolio ETR ▪ Business entity ETR. Page | 11 PART ONE: PROJECT OVERVIEW AND CONTEXT PART ONE: PROJECT OVERVIEW AND CONTEXT Page | 13 CHAPTER 1 PROJECT PURPOSE Introduction 1.1 This report describes the outcomes of the High-Wealth Individuals Research Project (the Project). This is a research project carried out by Inland Revenue, on the average effective tax rates (ETRs) of high-wealth New Zealand families, based on a comprehensive definition of income. 1.2 The New Zealand tax system supports the well-being of all New Zealanders by providing revenue to fund public goods and services, influencing behaviours, and as a means of redistribution. The progressive nature of income tax means that the tax system plays a role in reducing inequality and encouraging social cohesion. Further, economic outcomes are supported when tax is raised in less costly ways. This Project can be seen as having the broad purpose of supporting the fundamental objectives of the tax system by enriching our knowledge on how the tax system impacts on New Zealand society. 1.3 The report draws from recent literature on the taxation of top income or wealth households. The OECD, for example, in a forthcoming paper on high earners notes that the taxation of individuals at the top of the income and wealth distributions has emerged as a central academic and policy issue over recent years, with interest increasing in the ETRs of top income and wealth households and how tax systems may contribute to, or ameliorate, inequality in income or wealth (Hourani et al., in press). 1.4 One area of interest is whether top income or wealth households disproportionately earn the types of income subject to lighter taxation in tax systems. Several studies from other countries (Advani & Summers, 2020a; McNichol, 2021) show that capital income, such as capital gains and dividend income, is highly concentrated among high income earners and is often subject to preferential treatment in tax systems. 1.5 The Project uses a combination of tax administration data, public data and survey data, collected specifically for the Project, to calculate the average ETRs of 311 high-wealth New Zealand families. ETRs are calculated based on the concept of “economic income”, which is broader than income as defined in tax law. The broader measure of economic income includes items in income that increase individuals’ economic resources and, therefore, well-being. Non- taxable items, such as capital gains, are included. 10 Further, as the economic income measure is comprehensive, it incorporates income earned through entities and trusts and the tax associated with this income. 1.6 This report sets out the analytical output from the Project. Aspects of the Project relating to its operational conduct are documented elsewhere. 11 Information collected for this Project has not, and will not, be used to inform tax compliance activity. The Project is not designed to provide information on tax evasion. 10 Taxable income includes some limited forms of capital gains, such as for sales of property subject to the bright-line test. 11 More information can be found at High-wealth individuals research project (ird.govt.nz) PART ONE: PROJECT OVERVIEW AND CONTEXT Page | 14 The New Zealand Treasury project 1.7 This Project is complementary to a project undertaken by the Treasury (Ching, 2023; Ching et al., 2023b), which models ETRs across the general New Zealand population (general population) based on Household Economic Survey (HES) net worth data (2018). The Treasury project develops a comprehensive concept of income similar to this Project. Some differences exist as the projects are based on different data sources (see Appendix F). A key difference is that the most comprehensive ETRs in this report include company and trustee tax, whereas these taxes are not included in the Treasury’s ET measures (except to the extent that personal tax is met with imputation credits) due to data limitations. This means the Treasury estimates for net worth deciles 9 and 10 (where such income and tax are significant) should not be compared to the estimates for the high-wealth population. However, the Treasury measures provide a comparison for the measures in this paper for low to middle wealth deciles. In making any comparisons, care should be taken to ensure government transfers are treated consistently in the measures. 1.8 Both projects are necessary to give a more complete picture of ETRs across the full income or wealth distribution. This is because the HES, like other household surveys, underestimates the wealth of high-wealth families. Stats NZ (2021) notes that, given the small number of them, the wealthiest households have a low likelihood of being selected to take part in household sample surveys. While mixed, there is evidence from international studies that wealthy individuals may have lower response rates or more acute under- reporting of assets in household surveys than other households. Further, household surveys may not produce the level of detail required to reflect the complex asset portfolios generally held by high-wealth individuals. HES net worth data, therefore, cannot be used as a basis to estimate the economic income of high-wealth families. Tax Working Group 1.9 This Project is reflective of concerns raised by the Tax Working Group (TWG). The TWG was formed by the New Zealand government in 2017 to provide recommendations to improve the fairness, balance and structure of the tax system. 12 Its 2019 report, Future of Tax, indicated that a lack of information about the impact of current tax settings made it difficult to articulate clearly the trade-offs involved in policy changes or where potential tax gaps existed (Tax Working Group \[TWG\], 2019). 1.10 The TWG report noted we have limited knowledge of economic (as opposed to taxable) income at all levels of society but especially for the very wealthy. As net worth is concentrated in the top 20 percent of households, it was noted that the distribution of capital gains is also likely to be skewed in this way. The TWG expressed a concern that perceptions of unfairness arising from very unequal income distribution would erode public acceptance of the tax system and undermine voluntary compliance. The TWG noted the need for greater information generally and better data about the distribution of wealth in New Zealand in particular. 12 Tax Working Group Terms of Reference (2017): https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/terms- reference-tax-working-group.html. PART ONE: PROJECT OVERVIEW AND CONTEXT Page | 15 Assessment framework 1.11 Two key principles on which to assess tax systems are fairness and efficiency. The ETRs estimated in this report provide information that is relevant to both principles for New Zealand’s tax system. 1.12 Fairness for the tax system is often thought of as having two elements. First, vertical equity – the principle that the amount of tax an individual pays should increase with their level of economic well-being often referred to as ‘ability to pay’ . econd, horizontal equity – that those with similar income and circumstances pay similar amounts of tax (Keen & Slemrod, 2021). 1.13 One way to assess these fairness principles is to measure the extent to which average ETRs differ across the income distribution (that is, how much tax is paid relative to income for different income cohorts . New Zealand’s tax system seeks to be progressive. That is, it seeks to achieve higher average tax rates and lower transfers as income increases. Our ETR measures can shed light on the progressivity of the tax system based on a broader measure of income than taxable income. If untaxed income is disproportionately earned by higher income individuals, this will reduce the progressivity of the tax system. 1.14 ETRs can also give insight into the potential efficiency impacts of tax settings. Where ETRs are variable across income sources, they are likely to affect incentives, such as by incentivising investment in certain forms of activity over others. This can give rise to economic costs. 1.15 A key element in assessing either fairness or efficiency is the comprehensiveness of the income measure used in the assessment. For this reason, this report calculates ETRs based on economic income, which is a more comprehensive measure of income than taxable income. 1.16 The ETRs calculated in the report can be assessed: ▪ Relative to ETRs across the whole income distribution (based on a similar concept of income) to get a better understanding of how tax paid varies with income. To do this, the ETRs computed by the Project can be compared to ETRs estimated by the Treasury for low and middle income or wealth deciles. ▪ By considering the extent to which ETRs based on taxable sources of income differ from ETRs when non-taxable income sources are considered and when the income and tax attributable to individuals, but earned or remitted through entities or trusts, is considered. 1.17 Where possible, the report also provides measures of realised capital gains in isolation. This indicates how much extra income of the Project population would potentially have been taxed if New Zealand imposed a realised capital gains tax. This is a static measure, not taking account of potential behavioural changes if a realised capital gains tax were imposed. 1.18 Finally, in addition to investigating average ETRs, the report considers the GST impost on the Project population relative to other income deciles, and relative to their economic income, and the amount received by the Project population in significant gifts and inheritances. PART ONE: PROJECT OVERVIEW AND CONTEXT Page | 16 CHAPTER 2 THE DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH AND CAPITAL INCOME Introduction 2.1 While this report’s focus is on measuring effective tax rates ET s based on tax paid relative to income, the distribution of wealth is still relevant. This is because wealth, or net worth, can earn a return consisting of not only taxable investment income, but of a further increase in the value of the assets representing the wealth itself (together being capital income). 13 The wealth distribution therefore offers a broad guide as to who is likely to benefit as assets appreciate. 2.2 Net worth is unevenly distributed in New Zealand, as in other countries. 14 However, this differs by asset class, that is, holdings of some asset classes (such as financial assets) are more concentrated in upper net worth deciles than other asset classes (such as owner-occupied property). 2.3 This chapter considers net worth statistics. These focus on measuring physical and financial wealth, which is a contributor to an individual’s or household’s well-being. Other forms of wealth, such as human capital and environmental amenities, also contribute to well-being but are not considered in this report. 2.4 Chapter 15 provides estimates of the mean and median net worth of the Project population based on data collected for this Project. Household survey-based measures 2.5 The Household Economic Survey (HES) is a high-quality household survey that collects net worth data. It provides the most comprehensive source of information on the distribution of net worth in New Zealand. However, as noted earlier, HES underestimates top wealth. Sapere, for example, note that this means that there is currently only limited information publicly available on the level and distribution of net worth in New Zealand and on the net economic income households derive from their wealth (Murray et al., 2023). 2.6 Around half of the net worth in New Zealand is held by 10 percent of households. The HES 2018 15 found that the top household net worth decile (the wealthiest 10 percent of households) held around 53 percent of total net worth, and the top household percentile (the wealthiest 1 percent of households) held around 17 percent. 16 If directly held owner-occupied housing (OOH) is excluded, the top net worth decile held 63 percent of the total household net worth in the HES 2018. 2.7 In contrast, the poorest 50 percent of households collectively held around 6 percent of net worth, with deciles 1 to 3 each holding less than 1 percent. 2.8 Figure 2.1 below shows the share of total household net worth by net worth decile (HES 2018). The cut out shows the share of decile 10 net worth by 13 Zidar (2022) notes that approaches to measuring income inequality may be based on wealth statistics. 14 Appendix A provides an international comparison of top wealth shares. 15 HES 2018 refers to the HES Household Net Worth Supplement 2017-2018, years ended 30 June. 16 HES 2021 is similar (52 and 16 percent). HES 2021 refers to the HES Household Net Worth Supplement 2020-2021, years ended 30 June. Figures on this page come from HES 2021, Table 4.01.

Figure 2.1 Share of total household net worth by net worth decile and share of decile 10 net worth by decile 10 net worth percentile Main graph: decile shares of total household net worth – with and without owner-occupied housing Cut out: decile 10 percentile shares of decile 10 household net worth Source: Household Economic Survey (2018) 2.9 As figure 2.1 shows, within decile 10, net worth is also unevenly distributed. The top net worth percentile (99 th percentile) held around one third of total decile 10 net worth in HES 2018. If we consider just the top 2 percent wealthiest households, who hold almost 50 percent of decile 10 net worth, this group of households held around 25 percent of total household net worth in New Zealand in 2018 (figure 2.2). 2.10 Measured inequality tends to be higher for individual-level, rather than household or family-level, measures. This is because families and households share resources. Based on individual net worth, the top net worth decile held around 59 percent of net worth in HES 2018, and the top net worth percentile held around 20 percent. 17 That is, dividing decile 10 into ten groups. PART ONE: PROJECT OVERVIEW AND CONTEXT Page | 18 Figure 2.2 Share of total household net worth held by top 2 percent wealthiest households Source: Household Economic Survey (2018) 2.11 There is a life cycle aspect to wealth accumulation, as people tend to become wealthier over their working life as they save, and then they spend those savings in retirement. Life cycle factors do not fully explain the distribution of net worth. Figure 2.3 shows net worth quintiles by age band for individuals. Figure 2.3 Median individual net worth by age group and net worth quintile Source: Stats NZ based on Household Economic Survey (2018) 2.12 Further, holdings of different asset types are distributed differently across net worth deciles. For this reason, later chapters consider the income earned by the Project population from different asset classes. Real property, particularly owner-occupied property, 18 is the most widely held asset. However, real property holdings are still concentrated in upper net worth deciles, particularly when property in trusts is included (figure 9.1). Holdings of financial assets are highly concentrated in net worth decile 10 (figure 10.1). 18 Around 64 percent of households are homeowners (Symes, 2021).

One of these methods is the capitalisation method, developed by Saez and Zucman (2016). This uses income flows from tax administration data and aggregate asset wealth from the Household Balance Sheet to improve estimates of net worth shares. Ching et al. (2023a) have developed this approach for New Zealand. Under this approach, the individual-level net worth shares in 2018 are 67 percent for the top decile and 26 percent for the top percentile. 2.14 Furthermore, an approach has been developed for this Project, with input from Stats NZ, to combine HES net worth survey data with the Project data set. Generally, this approach replaces some of the HES survey population represented by the wealthiest HES respondent with people (or households) taken from the Project’s responder population who have greater wealth than the wealthiest HES respondent. 19 Further discussion of this combined data approach and the findings are provided in Appendix G. 2.15 Using this combined data approach, net worth shares for the top decile and percentile are higher than those of the HES (although estimates are still within the confidence limits of the original HES estimates). Under the combined data approach, the household-level net worth shares in 2018 are 55 percent for the top decile, and 21 percent for the top percentile. Under the combined data approach, the individual-level net worth shares in 2018 are 61 percent for the top decile and 24 percent for the top percentile. 2.16 The concentration of net worth in upper deciles means that capital income, including capital gains, disproportionately accrues to higher net worth deciles. Consistent with this, chapter 5 (figure 5.5, paragraph 5.31) shows that the Project population earns a significantly greater proportion of their taxable income in the form of returns to investment than the general population. 2.17 Based on the HES, income is less unequally distributed than net worth. Perry (2019, p50) finds, for 2018, that the top household income decile earned 27 percent of total disposable income. 20 The bottom five income deciles combined also earned around 27 percent of total disposable income. Measures based on disposable income account for the role of taxes and transfers in reducing income inequality. For pre-tax taxable income, the top income decile earns around 35 percent of income. 2.18 The Gini coefficient is a measure of inequality. When multiplied by 100, the Gini coefficient ranges from 0 to 100, with values closer to 0 representing higher equality. Based on HES 2018 data, Stats NZ calculated the household net worth Gini coefficient to be 69. 21 Perry (2019) calculated the household disposable income Gini coefficient, based on HES (2018) income, to be 32.7. 22 This demonstrates that, as measured by HES, wealth is more concentrated than income. 2.19 However, like taxable income, HES income does not include certain forms of gains, such as capital gains. If income were defined more comprehensively to include all returns from capital, the wealth and income distributions would 19 To undertake this approach anonymised E data was transferred to Inland evenue’s secure database. 20 Perry uses equivalised disposable (after taxes and transfers) household income (HES income); that is, income adjusted for household composition and size. The top income decile will not contain the same individuals as the top net worth decile (that is, a person can have high wealth but relatively low income). Appendix A discussed the joint distribution of income and net worth. 21 A similar value (68) was found for 2021. 22 Perry (2019) Table B.10 p52. The market income Gini (before taxes and transfers) is 40.1. New Zealand’s disposable income Gini is slightly higher than the OECD average. PART ONE: PROJECT OVERVIEW AND CONTEXT Page | 20 likely be more similar. As Sapere note, income series in New Zealand tend to be based on taxable income which omits certain forms of income (Murray et al., 2023). A recent strand of international literature has studied measurement of income sources, and shares, for those at the top based on more comprehensive definitions of income. 2.20 For the UK, for example, Advani and Summers show that capital gains are large enough to make a noticeable difference to measured top income shares and including capital gains in income changes the narrative for UK inequality over the past two decades. The share of income going to the top 1 percent income earners is 3 percentage points higher when fiscal (taxable) income and capital gains income are considered than if fiscal income alone is considered. Those who are in the top 1 percent when gains are included, who are otherwise not, are more likely to be business owners, to be older and to be female than those who were otherwise in the top 1 percent. 2.21 These differences were much larger when looking towards the very top. Focusing on the top 0.01 percent, the authors found the top share increased 60 percent from 2.2 percent when measured and ranked on fiscal income, to 3.6 percent when measured and ranked on total remuneration; that is fiscal income and capital gains (Advani & Summers, 2020b). 23 This shows the importance of measuring income comprehensively in inequality measures. 23 The definition of capital gains is taxable capital gains and therefore the main home is excluded. However, a rise in inequality was still found if gains on the main home were included and distributed equally by income. PART ONE: PROJECT OVERVIEW AND CONTEXT Page | 21 CHAPTER 3 KEY METHODOLOGICAL CHOICES 3.1 This chapter sets out some key methodological choices relating to the Project. Estimation of income and effective tax rates 3.2 A preliminary observation is that the measures calculated for this Project are estimates rather than precise measures of any person’s income or effective tax rate (ETR). Elements of the income estimates are based on assumptions and, in some cases, derived from notional values or asset class growth rates. The Project aims to provide indicative and average measures of the income and ETRs of high-wealth individuals. The focus is on the population average rather than any individual or family. 3.3 Further, the Project has balanced the comprehensiveness of the information collected against compliance and other costs. This means that some sources of income are not included. In particular, the Project does not comprehensively measure foreign income and tax, and it only includes material sources of capital gains income (see chapter 6). The Project population 3.4 The Project population is a group of high-wealth individuals and their families. These individuals have contributed to New Zealand society in multi-faceted ways, including through building businesses that have created employment and through other activities, such as charitable donations. While this report does not assess the wider social contribution of these individuals, we acknowledge the significant contributions many of them have made to New Zealand society and thank them for their responses to the information- collection exercises. 3.5 This Project population was constructed based on Inland evenue’s existing information base. Inland Revenue, as part of its usual function, undertakes regular environmental scanning of high-wealth family groups (defined as those with estimated net worth either over $50 million or over $20 million where they meet other factors, such as controlling a significant enterprise). This environmental scanning involves monitoring, for example, major transactions, information obtained through the tax system, media reports and other sources of public information. High-wealth families are added to this list when Inland Revenue becomes aware of them through this environmental scanning. 24 There are likely to be high-wealth families that have not been identified by Inland Revenue. As the Project population has been identified for administrative reasons, it should not be considered representative of the top 1 percent, or other grouping, of wealthiest New Zealanders. 3.6 Based on data collected for the Project, we estimate that the mean net worth of the responder Project population is $276 million, and the median is $106 million. This is considerably higher than Stats NZ’s estimate of the starting 24 For example, in 2015, the administrative population comprised 212 high-wealth families. In 2021, it comprised 400, and in 2022, it comprised 452. PART ONE: PROJECT OVERVIEW AND CONTEXT Page | 22 point for the wealthiest 1 percent of New Zealand households – being $7.6 million. 25 3.7 The Project population has been limited to New Zealand tax residents. This means that only individuals comprehensively liable for New Zealand income tax during the Project period are included. 3.8 In constructing the population, an initial high-wealth individual population was established based on Inland evenue’s existing information. Two exclusion criteria were then applied to ensure the population was limited to high-wealth New Zealand tax residents. The initial population, less those meeting the exclusion criteria, is referred to as the whole population. The exclusion criteria were that the family did not have net worth over $20 million at any point in the Project period, or that they were non-resident or transitional resident for most of the Project period. Out of the whole population, a responder population of 311 families was established, being those individuals in the whole population that responded to the information collections. Measures in this report are based on the responder population, 26 although sensitivity checks using the whole population have been undertaken where possible. Box 1 below provides more detail on the population. 3.9 Based on taxable income, the Project population is also generally high- income. Based on the HES income distribution, the taxable income of around 70 percent of the families in the Project population is in decile 10 of the general population income distribution. Further, we estimate that the Individual A (see 3.11) responder population is around 7 percent of the number of individuals in the top 1 percent of taxable income earners. However, the taxable income of this population is around 15 to 23 percent of the taxable income of the entire top 1 percent of taxable income earners for 2019 to 2021. Unit of analysis 3.10 The Project uses both the family and the individual as the basis for analysis. Population-level measures are also calculated. 3.11 Individual-level measures are based on the individual identified in the initial population. This person is called Individual A and is the person who generally earns most of the family income. Individual-level analysis is undertaken because tax is levied on an individual basis in New Zealand. As the adults in the family often have significantly different income levels, they often have significantly different ETRs. 3.12 A family is defined as a single adult or a couple and their dependent children (see glossary). Use of families as a unit of analysis reflects that families share resources, and therefore inequality is generally less for families than individuals. In this analysis, however, the ETR results for the family were often very similar to that of Individual A, reflecting that Individual A’s income often dominates the entire family income. For the responder population, Individual A earned 85 to 91 percent of the total taxable income of all family members in the 2019 to 2021 income years. For this reason, we do not always graph both measures. Further, trust income has been grouped by family in our analysis as assets in trust are often for the benefit of the family. 25 Data provided by Stats NZ (HES 2021). One percent of households is 19,000 households. 26 Appendix B provides some descriptive statistics for the Individual A responder population. PART ONE: PROJECT OVERVIEW AND CONTEXT Page | 23 3.13 Using the family unit is narrower than using a household unit (that is, all individuals living in a household), which is what is used for the HES and some other analyses of income distribution. However, the demographic characteristics of our population suggest that a family and household unit will often be similar. The median age of the Individual A responder population is 68 and most families are two people. Further, given the tax system is based on individuals, the narrower definition of family is preferred, as households may contain more distantly related, or even unrelated, people. Use of families is consistent with the approach being undertaken by the Treasury in their ETR analysis as they use equivalised family units. Timeframe of analysis 3.14 The income and ETRs of the Project population have been estimated over the 2016 to 2021 income years (1 April 2015 – 31 March 2021 inclusive), referred to as the Project period in this report. 3.15 This period was chosen mainly because individuals and entities are required to hold tax records for seven years. Individuals were therefore likely to have retained, or have access to, relevant documents for this period. Additionally, it provides a sufficiently long period to measure changes in the value of assets, and therefore capital gains, while smoothing out some annual volatility. 3.16 However, chapter 13 provides analysis of ETRs for income from significant holdings in listed companies (SHLCs). This analysis is based on public information and is over longer periods. The longer periods give a longer-term view of ETRs and are less subject to short-term macro-economic factors. Where listed company income is combined with other income sources, only income from the Project period is included. 3.17 A longer period has also been used for information concerning inheritances (chapter 15). Information on inheritances was sought to give some additional perspective on the ways in which individual wealth has been accumulated. This information was collected over a 50-year period, given that inheritances are received extremely rarely, if at all. 3.18 As further context, the Project period saw house and share price growth rates above long-term averages. Mean annual (geometric mean) house price growth over this period was 10 percent, versus 8 percent for the period 1 January 2000 – 31 December 2021. 27 The mean annual (geometric mean) NZX Index increase for the Project period was 14 percent, compared with 10.6 percent for the period from 1 October 2007 to 31 December 2019, which could be considered a single full business cycle. Income and ETR measures based on asset growth at these levels remain informative, despite being higher than historical norms and having the effect of creating a relatively higher level of economic income. 28 The key findings section of the report also provides a scenario test assuming lower growth of asset values. Attribution to the individual and incidence 3.19 The Project calculates comprehensive income and tax measures based on economic substance, looking through legal form. It attributes to the 27 Based on Core Logic data from the eserve ank’s Monetary Policy Statement. 28 House price growth peaked in the December quarter 2021. However, as at the December quarter 2022, the house price index remained above the level it was at the end of the Project period. PART ONE: PROJECT OVERVIEW AND CONTEXT Page | 24 individuals the income effectively earned, and tax remitted, through entity structures. This recognises that economically only individuals earn income and pay tax, not entities. However, this requires making assumptions that mean, in some cases, such as trusts, income attribution is approximated, and the degree of real ownership is calculated independently of rules that might apply under taxation law or accounting principles. 3.20 The impost of taxation does not always fall on the person who remits it. For example, a tax on corporate profits could fall on employees through reduced wages. Some work on ETRs has attempted to attribute certain taxes based on incidence (Auten & Splinter, 2019). This work has highlighted the difficulty of determining where the tax impost ultimately falls and in what proportion, particularly for company tax. 3.21 Given these difficulties, the Project fully attributes personal income tax to the individual liable, and income tax imposed at the entity level is attributed to the individuals who own the entity (or, in the case of trusts, have analogous interests). For goods and services tax (GST), it is assumed the impost of taxation is borne by the purchaser (Thomas, 2022). 29 3.22 Another consideration is when tax is recognised. The Project recognises tax in the year it is assessed. That is, tax is the amount liable to be remitted in the relevant income year (see chapter 6). Data sources 3.23 A principle of the Project was to use Inland Revenue’s tax administration data as much as possible. Tax administration data is an accurate source of information on income as defined in tax law. It has become standard for literature on income inequality to rely heavily on tax administration data (Delestre et al., 2022, Advani & Summers., 2020b). The Project also uses public sources of information, such as information from share and property registers, where possible. Using tax administration and public data has the advantage of minimising compliance costs for individuals. 3.24 However, these data sources were insufficient to get a full picture of the economic income of the Project population. Tax administration data is limited to the definition of taxable income, which excludes some receipts included in economic income. For this reason, further information was sought from the Project population through three information collections (the Family Details Collection, the Entity Collection and the Financial Collection) targeted towards gaps in the information otherwise available (see Appendix C for a description of these collections). The analysis in this report therefore combines tax administration data, public data and survey data. 3.25 The sources of data and their quality are discussed in detail in Appendix E. However, in summary: ▪ Tax administration data provides an accurate source of information on income sources that are taxable and on tax remitted. ▪ Data from public share registers provides an accurate source of information on company holdings and market prices. Actual sales prices may differ from market prices. 29 Thomas (2022) notes that assuming VAT is fully passed through to the final consumer in prices is a standard assumption made in empirical literature. PART ONE: PROJECT OVERVIEW AND CONTEXT Page | 25 ▪ Data from public property registers provides an accurate source of information on property holdings. ▪ Publicly available data on property values (for example, Automated Valuation Models) is based on comparable sales and provides a reasonable estimate of the change in value of similar assets. Idiosyncratic factors, however, may not be accounted for. ▪ Survey data has the benefit of being targeted at specific data gaps in tax administration data, the specific needs of the Project and the population of interest. Therefore, survey data improves the measurement of income and wealth by improving the comprehensiveness of our measures. Survey data, however, can be subject to measurement error from factors such as under-reporting and non-response bias. However, the high response rate to the surveys, and cross checking of survey responses with tax administration data, suggests that the survey data can be used to provide indicative and informative measures of the population’s income and ETRs. Confidentiality 3.26 An important principle of the Project has been the protection of the privacy of individuals and the confidentiality of information. Great care has been taken with the gathering, handling and protection of data. Results presented in this report are subject to a set of confidentiality rules adopted by the Project following consideration of Stats NZ’s icrodata-Output-Guide. A Privacy Impact Assessment was prepared for the Project following consultation with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, and this is publicly available. 30 30 Inland Revenue (2021). High-wealth individuals research project. https://www.ird.govt.nz/about-us/who- we-are/organisation-structure/significant-enterprises/hwi-research-project PART ONE: PROJECT OVERVIEW AND CONTEXT Page | 26 Box 1: The Project population To identify the Project population, an initial population was first identified. The initial population is the high-wealth individuals identified through Inland Revenue administrative records as being part of a high-wealth family (that is, a family with net worth over $50 million or net worth over $20 million and meeting other criteria). Where an individual could be identified as non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes, they were removed from the initial population. The families in Inland evenue’s records were split into family units that met the definition of family discussed above. As this is a narrower definition of family, this resulted in a larger number of smaller family groups. 31 One individual from each family in the initial population received the first survey, the Family Details Collection, which collected information to identify family members. This individual, of which there were 397, is referred to as Individual A in this report. The whole population is the initial population, together with their family members, less the individuals that met the exclusion criteria (being either non-resident or transitional resident for most of the Project period, or the family did not have net worth over $20 million at any point in the Project period). Individuals were removed from the population when they provided evidence that they met the exclusion criteria. The removal of these individuals reduced the population to 352 observations of Individual A. The responder population is the whole population less those who did not respond to one of the Entity or Financial Collections (see Appendix C for details of the collections). This may be because they were excluded from the collection on compassionate grounds, they were not able to be contacted or they did not respond to one or both collections. The responder population comprises 311 observations of Individual A, and 238 partners and 27 dependent children identified through the Family Details Collection. Where no family members were identified, Individual A is treated as a family unit. ‘Whole population’ and ‘responder population’ may refer to either the relevant population of Individual As only, or Individual A combined with their family. The ETRs in this report are based on the responder population. Sensitivity checks using the whole population have been used where possible.

Families with an initial wealth of $20 million at the start of the period who lost wealth over the period were not excluded. Page | 27 PART TWO: APPROACH TO EFFECTIVE TAX RATES PART TWO: APPROACH TO EFFECTIVE TAX RATES Page | 28 CHAPTER 4 EFFECTIVE TAX RATES Introduction 4.1 This report calculates the average effective tax rates (ETRs) of the individuals and families in the Project population. An ETR is a measure of tax remitted by an individual or group relative to a measure of their income. 4.2 There are two types of ETRs: average ETRs and marginal ETRs. A marginal ETR shows how much tax would be paid on someone’s next dollar of income, while an average ETR shows how much total tax is paid relative to total income (that is, the average amount of tax on each dollar of income). 4.3 Marginal ETRs are often used to examine the impact of the tax system on incentives to work, save or invest. Average ETRs are useful when examining an individual’s tax impost relative to their income, particularly when considering types of income that are not subject to taxation or the overall progressivity of the tax system. Given the purpose of this Project, all references to an ETR in this report refer to an average ETR unless otherwise stated. Put simply, an ETR for this report is tax/income. 4.4 Both the income measure and the taxes to be included in the ETR must be chosen, and ETRs will be sensitive to these choices. Taxable income is not a comprehensive definition of income and reflects only the components of income that Parliament has decided to tax. For example, in New Zealand most capital gains are excluded from taxable income. Chapter 6 discusses the concept of economic income – which is a comprehensive approach to measuring income and is the concept used in this report to measure economic income ETRs. 4.5 Several complications arise in calculating ETRs. For example, ETRs are sensitive to the period they are measured over 32 and the timeframe of analysis. Results are also sensitive to the unit of analysis (such as individual or family), and assumptions need to be made about who bears the incidence of tax. We undertake several sensitivity tests to test the materiality of assumptions made. 4.6 One issue that arises when multiple years are used is the treatment of inflation. For this report, income and tax are calculated on a nominal basis (that is, amounts are not inflation-adjusted). While inflation can affect the ETR calculation, we expect that over a six-year low inflation period these impacts would not significantly alter the result. 33 4.7 Box 2 explains how the ETRs in this report are calculated. 32 Levell et al. (2021) note that analysis of taxation and welfare systems tends to see income more evenly distributed when considered over individuals’ lifetimes. 33 Although the ETR calculation is nominal tax divided by nominal income, inflation could affect the calculation in at least two ways. Some capital income and expense amounts have different nominal (taxable) amounts than real amounts, such as interest. Also, inflation alone would increase nominal incomes over the six-year period being analysed, which would tend to give the later years higher weighting when six-year period calculations are done. PART TWO: APPROACH TO EFFECTIVE TAX RATES Page | 29 Box 2: Timeframe and unit for ETR calculations To calculate ETRs, both the unit and timeframe of analysis need to be determined. In terms of the unit of analysis, ETRs are calculated for Individual A, the family and the population. The ETR for the family is calculated by summing, respectively, the tax and income of each member of the family. This ensures the impacts of the progressive tax scale are accounted for and provides an income-weighted mean of the family members’ ET s. In terms of the timeframe of analysis, ETRs are calculated annually or over the six- year Project period (or the longer periods for SHLCs). Individual A/family ETRs: Annual ETRs: To calculate annual ETRs for Individual A and the family, the annual tax of Individual A or the family members is divided by their annual income. Annual measures show how ETRs vary over time. Annual tax of each family or individual Annual income of each family or individual Project period ETRs: To calculate Project period ETRs, for each Individual A and each family, annual tax is summed over all six years and divided by the sum of annual income over all six years. Using the six-year period reduces the volatility inherent in an annual measure, while summing annual tax and income recognises the impact of the progressive tax system and the annual calculation of tax. Sum of annual tax for the six-year period for each family or individual Sum of annual income for the six-year period for each family or individual Our main descriptor of the individual/family ETRs is the median. This is the point above and below which half of the observed ETRs fall, and so represents the midpoint of the data. We also provide the upper and lower quartile; 50 percent of observations fall between the upper and lower quartile (the inter-quartile range). The median and inter-quartile range are preferred to an unweighted mean of the ETRs, as the unweighted mean can be heavily influenced by outliers. Outliers have been excluded from the median and inter-quartile range figures. 34 Population measures Project period population ETR: For this measure, the total annual tax of all members of the population is summed over all six years and divided by the sum of the total annual income of all members of the population over all six years. This results in one ETR for the population, which is an income-weighted mean for the population. Sum of annual tax for the six-year period for all members of the population Sum of annual income for the six-year period for all members of the population Population measures can be based on the population of Individual As or the family. Family population measures are the same as the aggregate of all individuals in the population (Individual A, partners and dependent children). This is referred to as the ETR or income for all members of the population (or all responders). 34 Outlier limits are calculated using the interquartile range as: LQ – 1.5 \*(UQ-LQ) and UQ + 1.5\*(UQ-LQ). PART TWO: APPROACH TO EFFECTIVE TAX RATES Page | 30 ETRs over the income distribution 4.8 Under a progressive rate system, the average ETR of individuals will increase as taxable income increases. The personal income tax is progressive in New Zealand. Figure 4.1 shows the statutory marginal tax rate scale that applied over the Project period (this had a top marginal tax rate of 33%) and the average tax rates on personal taxable income under that scale. The top marginal tax rate on personal taxable income was increased to 39% in 2021; this is not shown in figure 4.1. The average tax rate line demonstrates that, under the progressive personal income tax, average tax rates increase with income. 4.9 Under this statutory tax rate scale, an individual with personal taxable income of $50,000 would have an average tax rate of 16%, an individual with personal taxable income of $100,000 would have an average tax rate of 24% and a person with personal taxable income of $200,000 would have an average tax rate of 28.5%. Figure 4.1 Marginal and average tax rates 4.10 However, figure 4.1 only demonstrates the marginal and average tax rates on personal taxable income. The major sources of tax revenue in New Zealand are personal income tax, GST and company tax (figure 4.2). Excise taxes, such as alcohol excise, constitute only around 8% of central government revenue in New Zealand. To consider the impacts of the tax system in totality, our most comprehensive ETRs (chapter 12) include all major taxes attributable to the Project population – that is personal income tax, company tax, and GST (trustee tax is also included). 4.11 One difficulty with including GST in the analysis is that GST is levied on expenditure while our ETRs are estimated relative to income. When considered as a portion of annual income, GST will appear more regressive than when considered as a portion of expenditure. This is discussed in chapter 14. However, as Perry (2019, p54) notes, a comprehensive analysis of the tax and transfer system needs to consider all major tax sources, including tax paid through GST. 4.12 In their 2019 report, the Tax Working Group (TWG) considered the combined impact of personal income tax and GST across income deciles based on data from the Household Economic Survey (HES) 2012/13. This demonstrated that Average and marginal ET efore tax income thousands Comparison of average and marginal tax rates tatutory marginal tax rate tatutory average tax rate PART TWO: APPROACH TO EFFECTIVE TAX RATES Page | 31 when both personal income tax and GST are included, and when considering income on an annual basis, the tax system is less progressive than if only personal income tax is considered. 4.13 Table 4.1 below shows ETRs, as calculated by the TWG, based on both personal income tax and GST. The concept of income used here (total income) 35 is similar to taxable income. Unlike ETRs based on economic income, these ETRs do not comprehensively take account of untaxed sources of income, such as capital gains. Figure 4.2 Composition of central government tax revenue (2020) Source: Inland Revenue and Treasury Treatment of transfers and in-kind government expenditure 4.14 In our main analysis, we treat government transfers (such as superannuation) as income. This means any transfers are included as income in the denominator of the ETR calculation, and the associated tax is included as tax. 4.15 An alternative approach is to treat transfers as a negative tax and deduct them from the numerator of the ETR calculation. If transfers are treated as a negative tax, then for analysis across the entire income distribution, ETRs will be negative for some people in lower deciles. That is, some individuals with low taxable income are net recipients under the tax/transfer system. This will depend on individual circumstances, such as whether a person receives superannuation. 4.16 The TWG (2019) found that based on the total amount of income and tax in each HES income decile, deciles 1 to 4 were net recipients under the tax and transfer system in 2012. This is also illustrated in table 4.1 (based on the tax scale that applied in 2012; that is, with a top tax rate of 33%). 35 Total income includes taxable income and some limited non-taxable income sources, such as cash transfers and tax credits. It is not as wide as “economic income” and does not include non-taxable capital gains. The taxes included in this analysis are personal income tax, GST and Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) levies.

In general, transfer income only comprises about 1 percent of personal taxable income for the responder population so does not significantly impact measures based on the Project population’s total income. 4.18 Neither of these approaches shows the full distributional impact of government tax and spending. “Final” income is a concept of income that takes account of market income, government cash transfers, direct and indirect taxation, and in- kind government expenditure on services, such as health and education. Final income reflects a more comprehensive measure of the economic resources available to a household than does market or disposable income. 4.19 Final income has been studied in New Zealand by Crawford and Johnston (2004). Crawford and Johnston show that final incomes are more equally distributed than disposable incomes (income after income tax and transfers), as higher-income households pay a greater absolute amount in consumption tax and receive less in terms of in-kind benefits. 4.20 Aziz et al. (2012) also looked at the distribution of final income in 2012 and similarly found that final income is more equally distributed than market and disposable income. They found a fall in the income Gini of 31 percent due to the impact of the tax and transfer system, and a further 9 percent fall when government in-kind expenditure and indirect taxation is considered, demonstrating the higher redistributive effects of the tax and transfer system than in-kind transfers and indirect taxes. While this report takes account of the impact of GST, it does not consider in-kind government transfers. Other studies 4.21 Previous studies have examined ETRs across income and wealth distributions in other countries. While the countries studied have different tax systems to New Zealand and each other, they highlight a general tendency arising from the PART TWO: APPROACH TO EFFECTIVE TAX RATES Page | 33 preferential tax treatment of income from capital. 36 The results also highlight that ETR analysis tends to be highly sensitive to the definition of income used. 4.22 Those studies that more narrowly define the income included within their ETR calculations to align it with taxable income more closely, such as Milligan (2021) who examined average tax rates in Canada, tend to show that ETRs are broadly progressive across the income levels. However, the concentration of dividend income among individuals with the highest incomes, and the preferential tax treatment dividends often receive in tax systems (such as in the Canadian system Milligan examines), does result in a slight decrease in progressivity at the top of the income distribution. 4.23 Bricker et al. (2020) had similar results to Milligan when calculating ETRs across the wealth and income distributions based on data from the United States. When income included in the ETR calculation aligned with taxable income, ETRs were broadly progressive. Once the authors expanded the definition of income, in particular incorporating estimated unrealised capital gains, they saw a sharp decrease in progressivity of the tax system, with the wealthiest individuals no longer having the highest ETRs. 4.24 Advani & ummers’ (2020a) analysis of ETRs in the United Kingdom showed more dramatic results, despite the analysis being limited to taxable income. The concessionary tax treatment of income from capital by the UK tax system meant that when taxable capital gains were accounted for, on average, ETRs began to decline on incomes greater than £250,000. Among those with the highest incomes (greater than £10 million per year), the average ETR was calculated to be 21%, which was less than the rate paid by someone earning £30,000. However, significant variation existed among the ETRs of high-income individuals, with ETRs generally falling relative to the proportion of income sourced from capital. 4.25 The OECD’s Centre for Tax Policy work programme includes a project on high- income earners (Hourani et al. in press). One output in this project seeks to calculate ETRs under various hypothetical income compositions based on countries’ tax settings. They model stylised ET s for different income levels based on different income compositions. This research suggests that ETRs for top income earners are heavily influenced by the source of their income. While the examined countries had different tax systems, the OECD found that, in nearly all countries, an individual earning only income from labour had a higher personal level ETR than someone whose income was a mix of income from labour and capital. Their work suggested this was the result of the widespread favourable tax treatment of income from capital compared to income from labour. Since income from capital is concentrated among those individuals at the top of the income distribution, the favourable treatment disproportionately benefits high-income earners. 4.26 In 2021, the United States Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) undertook a study into the ETRs of the 400 wealthiest US families (Leiserson & Yagan, 2021). This study was based on IRS data and information from Forbes magazine. They calculated the economic income of these families by reference to the Haig-Simons definition of income (see paragraph 6.3), taking the change in the family’s pre-tax wealth, as reported by Forbes magazine. They estimated the tax paid by these families based on the tax paid by the 400 highest income- earning families from IRS data multiplied by an adjustment factor to convert to 36 In other jurisdictions, preferential tax treatment of capital income may arise from features of the tax system that do not exist in New Zealand, such as lower taxes on capital income, special exemptions and deductions. PART TWO: APPROACH TO EFFECTIVE TAX RATES Page | 34 the tax paid of the 400 wealthiest families. They estimated an average Federal ETR for income tax of 8.2% for the period 2010–2018. Their sensitivity analysis yielded estimates in the 6–12% range. They state a key contributor to the low ETRs is preferential tax rates on capital gains and dividend income. They note that their estimates are lower than commonly cited top income tax rates produced by, for example, the Congressional Budget Office, largely due to those other studies excluding unrealised capital gains. 4.27 To date there has not been a study of ETRs relative to economic income in New Zealand. Therefore, this work, and the Treasury’s work on ETRs, contribute new approaches to the literature on ETRs for New Zealand. Approach to calculating ETRs 4.28 The approach we take is similar to that taken in recent OECD work. In their forthcoming paper, Hourani et al. first analyse ETRs for individuals earning income from wages only. They then compare these results to the ETRs for individuals earning different compositions of income (Hourani et al., in press). 4.29 In chapters 5 and 8, we first calculate the ETRs that apply for personal taxable income. In chapter 5, the ETR is based on personal taxable income, as defined in tax law. In chapter 8, the ETR (the base income ETR) is also based on income sources taxable at the personal level. However, this ETR recognises losses in the year they occur (rather than limiting income to zero) and therefore income can be negative in the base income ETR. These ETRs can be compared with ETRs based on a broader concept of income. While ETRs based on economic income would be expected to be lower than ETRs based on statutory tax rates, this approach allows us to consider which income sources drive differences in ETRs for taxpayers earning different levels and combinations of income. 4.30 Chapters 8 to 12 calculate ETRs, over the Project period, based on the more comprehensive measure of income described in chapter 6 – economic income. In assessing economic income ETRs, we first consider how additional income (and tax) from different asset classes impacts on the base income ETR in isolation. These ETRs are called the asset class ETRs and do not include the full income of the Project population. Isolating income from different asset classes allows us to consider the relative magnitude of different income types in the ETR analysis. For the asset class ETRs, economic income sources from the following major asset classes are added to the base income ETR in isolation: ▪ Real property holdings (property ETR – chapter 9) ▪ Portfolio financial investments (portfolio ETR – chapter 10) ▪ Non-portfolio/businesses entities (business entity ETR – chapter 11). 4.31 Significant holdings in listed companies (SHLCs) are considered in isolation in chapter 13 (as well as being consolidated in the ETRs for the Project period). As this is based on public data, this calculation can be done over a longer period and the results are more reliable than for unlisted entities, which are valued based on financial statement data rather than market prices. 4.32 A comprehensive ‘all-income’ ET is calculated for the responder population in chapter 12. This provides the ETR including all the economic income and tax of the individuals; that is, the amount of tax paid relative to all income sources. The all-income ETR is calculated including company and trustee tax (in addition to personal tax) and both with and without GST. PART TWO: APPROACH TO EFFECTIVE TAX RATES Page | 35 CHAPTER 5 PERSONAL TAXABLE INCOME Introduction 5.1 This chapter presents the effective tax rates (ETRs) for personal tax relative to personal taxable income (also referred to as taxable income) as defined by tax law (the taxable income ETR). 5.2 The purpose of calculating a taxable income ETR is to provide a comparator for ETRs based on economic income. As shown in figure 5.1 below, and chapter 12, personal taxable income only represents 7 percent of the total economic income of the responder population and is therefore not a comprehensive measure of the population’s income. 5.3 The measures in this chapter are calculated for the responder population (that is, 311 families (311 Individual As, 238 partners and 27 dependent children) or 311 Individual As). Figure 5.1 Taxable income as a share of total economic income Methodology Personal taxable income and tax assessed 5.4 The personal taxable income ETR is calculated as: 푃푒푟푠표푛푎푙 푡푎푥 푎푠푠푒푠푠푒푑 푃푒푟푠표푛푎푙 푡푎푥푎푏푙푒 푖푛푐표푚푒 5.5 Personal taxable income is sourced from information Inland Revenue holds for the individual taxpayer from tax assessments. It is the sum of the income types taxable at the personal level minus any allowable expenses and minus any Taxable income as a share of total economic income Taxable income Other economic income PART TWO: APPROACH TO EFFECTIVE TAX RATES Page | 36 losses that have been brought forward and claimed. It comprises income that is taxed at source and/or income (or losses) returned on an Individual Income Tax return (IR3). 5.6 Income that is taxed at source includes: salary and wages, government transfer payments, interest, dividends, schedular payments, āori Authority distributions and government subsidies, such as the COVID-19 wage support payment. Transfer payments (for the Project population, superannuation) comprise only about 1 percent of the personal taxable income for the responder population. 5.7 Income/loss on an IR3 that is not taxed at source includes taxable estate or trust distributions (beneficiary income), overseas income, partnership income, look-through company income, shareholder-employee salary, income from residential property, other rental income, most self-employment income, income from taxable property sales, other income, and expenses or losses relating to these income types. 5.8 Personal tax assessed is the amount calculated under the personal tax rate schedule for the period. Where someone had an income tax assessment, such as an IR3, Personal Tax Summary (PTS) or Auto Calculation, we measure tax as tax assessed from that assessment, that is, the tax on taxable income figure. Where there is no income tax assessment, but the person has received income taxed at source, we calculate tax at the applicable marginal tax rates. The latter applies to 18 percent of those that had taxable income during the Project period. GST is not included in tax for the taxable income ETR. 5.9 Some points to note are that: ▪ an amount of tax that is met by imputation credits on dividends received is included as tax in the ETR calculation ▪ foreign tax paid (and eligible for a foreign tax credit) by the taxpayer on foreign income is included as tax in the ETR calculation, and ▪ taxable income is gross of imputation credits and foreign tax credits (to ensure that taxable income is a pre-tax amount). 5.10 Portfolio investment entity (PIE) income and tax are assessed separately from the PIE investor, but they are economically equivalent to income and tax of the investor. While, in substance, it would be more accurate to include PIE income and tax in the individuals’ ETRs, it would add a significant administrative cost to include them. We, therefore, tested the impact of PIE income and tax on the taxable income ETR. The inclusion of PIE income and tax had an immaterial impact, and therefore they have not been included in ETRs in the report. 5.11 We do not reduce total taxes by the charitable donations tax credit. This does not reduce the income tax assessment (as it is processed separately). We view this as a government subsidy that is intended to benefit the charity and not the taxpayer. The taxpayer’s pre-tax income is unchanged, and the amount they pay to the charity is increased by the amount of the tax credit, so the net cashflow to the taxpayer is unchanged. owever, the government’s tax revenue is reduced, and the charity’s donation is increased by the amount of the credit. We follow this approach in calculating tax throughout the report. Treatment of losses 5.12 A feature of the New Zealand tax system is that when an individual makes a loss in a year, their taxable income (and tax) is zero and that loss is carried into future years and may be used to offset positive future income. This creates PART TWO: APPROACH TO EFFECTIVE TAX RATES Page | 37 complications for measuring ETRs on income generated within a particular period. 5.13 The results in this chapter are based on taxable income. This means income is set at a minimum of zero and is calculated after tax losses are used or carried forward. However, using taxable income results in losses generated before the Project period commenced being included, and if a tax loss generated in the Project period is not completely offset by later positive income in the period, then the loss will not be recognised. 5.14 To understand the materiality of these consequences, we perform a sensitivity test. We calculate a measure of tax and income that fully attributes the income or loss to the year of income/loss and assumes an individual receives a tax refund where they make a loss in a year. For this measure, we use annual net income as the income measure (which may be negative). The tax refund calculated on negative income uses the highest tax rate (this was 33% during the Project period). This scenario is included in Appendix D. Overall, using this approach only makes a small difference to the results (less than 1 percentage point difference in the ETR). 5.15 When calculating economic income, a somewhat different base measure of income is used – annual net income or loss – see chapter 8. Data sources 5.16 The internal source of information that is used depends on whether the individual has had an income tax assessment. 5.17 If there is no income tax assessment, the Summary of Earnings or income summary is used. These sources will only show income that is taxed at source, provided by a third party. An income tax assessment is used if available. This is only required if a taxpayer has income not taxed at source. Most of the responder population has filed an IR3 or other income tax assessment (82 percent). The order of application is as follows: ▪ IR3, PTS or Auto Calculation ▪ Summary of earnings or income summary. Results Income 5.18 The mean taxable income for Individual A is stable from the 2016 tax year through to the 2020 tax year, being around $820,000 over these years. There was a large increase in the 2021 tax year to just over $2,000,000. 37 The mean income of the family is, on average, $163,000 higher. 5.19 The median taxable income for Individual A fluctuates around $268,000 over the Project period. The family median is around $73,000 higher. The mean is significantly higher than the median due to some individuals with relatively high income. Figure 5.2 illustrates these results. 37 In 2021, there was an increase in dividends and shareholder salary payouts compared to previous years. These were made prior to the top tax rate increasing to 39%. PART TWO: APPROACH TO EFFECTIVE TAX RATES Page | 38 Figure 5.2 Median vs. mean taxable income Individual A and family 5.20 Compared with the general population, based on the Household Economic Survey (HES) income deciles (2019), the taxable income of around 70 percent of the families in the Project population falls in income decile 10 – that is, they are high-income earners based on only taxable income. The remaining 30 percent of families are spread across all income deciles, including 9 percent in decile 1. Effective tax rates (ETRs) 5.21 The ETRs we have calculated (see Box 2) are: ▪ Annual ETRs for Individual A and the family unit – Annual ETRs are calculated as annual tax assessed over annual taxable income received for each year in the Project period for Individual A or the family. Where taxable income is zero, the ETR in that year is the period average (total tax over the period/total income over the period). This is applicable to around 9 percent of the responder population each year. ▪ Project period ETRs for Individual A and the family unit – Total annual tax assessed over total taxable income received for the entire six-year period for each Individual A and family unit. ▪ Project period population ETR (population weighted-mean ETR) – Total annual tax assessed over total taxable income for the entire six-year period for all observations of Individual A or all individuals in the responder population. Annual taxable income ETR 5.22 Figure 5.3 shows that, for each year of the Project period, the median annual taxable income ETR for Individual A is between 29.8% and 30.2%. The family unit median annual taxable income ETR is slightly lower, being between 29.0% and 29.4%. 5.23 The family unit ETR is lower as partners and children generally earn lower income than Individual A. However, the difference is small because Individual A . . . . . .

The range between the lower and upper quartile (50 percent of the population) is around 6 and 7 percentage points, respectively, for most years. Figure 5.3 Annual taxable income ETR for Individual A Project period taxable income ETR 5.25 The median Project period taxable income ETR is similar for both Individual A and the family unit, at 30.8% and 30.1% respectively. Figure 5.4 shows that most Project period taxable income ETRs fall in a small range (the inter-quartile range is 5 to 6 percent). Figure 5.4 Project period taxable income ETR for Individual A and family Project period population taxable income ETR (population weighted-mean ETR) 5.26 The Project period population taxable income ETR is 32.2% for Individual A and 31.9% for all members of the responder population.

Scenario – treating transfer income as a negative tax 5.28 As noted, our main scenario treats transfer income like other income and includes it in the denominator of the ETR. An alternative approach is to treat transfer income as a negative tax in the numerator of the ETR calculation. This is the approach taken by the Treasury in their main analysis. 5.29 Treating transfer income as a negative tax only has a small impact on the Project period population taxable income ETR, reducing it by 1.2 percentage points for Individual A and 1.5 percentage points for the family. This is because transfer income is small relative to the total taxable income of the Project population. However, when considering the median family by taxable income for 2018, and assuming a family of two adults who both receive superannuation, treating transfer income as a negative tax reduces their taxable income ETR by 10.1 percentage points, from 30.4% to 20.3%. Income composition 5.30 Compared with the general population, the Project population receives a relatively large portion of their taxable income from investments, that is, interest, dividends and rental income. Only a small amount of transfer income is received by the Project population, which is all from New Zealand Superannuation, compared to the general population, who may receive New Zealand Superannuation, income-tested benefits and student allowance. 5.31 Figure 5.5 shows the composition of income across the general population taxable income deciles, based on tax administration data, as compared to the Project population of Individual As for 2018.

As noted earlier, economic income ETRs are first calculated based on different income compositions – by assessing the impact of income from different asset classes in isolation – and then for all income sources. Economic income 6.2 Personal taxable income is statutorily defined. It excludes certain forms of economic gains. In particular, in New Zealand most capital gains are not taxed. This means that ETRs based on only taxable income are limited in their ability to assess the overall progressivity or efficiency of the tax system. 6.3 Given this, the report calculates ETRs based on a more comprehensive measure of income – economic income. Economic income is a measure of income commonly used in public policy research. Our economic income measure approximates the Haig-Simons definition, which defines income as consumption expenditure plus the change in net wealth for a period (Simons, 1938). This approach views income as potential consumption, and most things that would allow an individual to consume more are treated as income. Haig-Simons income offers a comprehensive view of the change in economic resources of an individual (Armour et al. 2014). 6.4 While the Haig-Simons definition is generally regarded as the gold standard for income measurement, practical difficulties of collecting data limit what may be included in its measurement (Smeeding & Weinburg, 2001). Notably, we do not seek to measure economic income directly from consumption and change in wealth; rather, we measure it through the gains (cash and accrued) to the individual. In effect, we start with income sources taxable at the personal level – using tax administration data – and add in additional income that is not taxed at the personal level. 6.5 Our economic income measure is therefore calculated as the sum of (as relevant for the asset class ETRs): ▪ Annual net income or loss (base income). ▪ Realised capital gains (for assets sold during the Project period). ▪ Accrued capital gains (for assets not sold during the Project period). ▪ Non-taxed distributions from companies and trading trusts. ▪ Trustee taxable income (and capital gains on the assets in trusts). ▪ Taxable income of land-rich entities (this replaces distributions from those entities and is in addition to the capital gains on real property). ▪ Imputed rental on owner-occupied housing. 6.6 These elements are explained in more detail below, and how these elements are applied in the asset class ETRs is explained in the relevant chapters. PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 43 Annual net income or loss (base income) 6.7 The first element in the calculation of economic income ET s is the individual’s annual “net income or loss” as defined in the Income Tax Act 2007, section BC 4). This is derived from tax administration data. Annual net income or loss (annual net income) has the same income sources as personal taxable income but differs from personal taxable income as losses are recognised fully in the year they occur. Unlike personal taxable income, annual net income may be negative. Annual net income is used as the base for economic income as it is a better reflection of the individual’s actual income from taxable sources than taxable income. 6.8 As annual net income already includes taxable distributions (such as dividends and beneficiary income), only untaxed distributions from entities are additionally added to calculate economic income. Income from entities and trusts 6.9 Our economic income measures also attribute amounts earned through entities and trusts to the individuals. As explained in later chapters, non-portfolio entities are classified as business entities (this includes companies and trading trusts) or land-rich entities. The income from business entities is the change in value of the individual’s ownership interest in the entity plus distributions from the entity to the individual. If an entity holds significant property assets, it is classified as a land-rich entity. In this case, we measure the capital gain as the change in value of the real property assets of the entity. For land-rich entities, we include the taxable income of the entity in economic income, as a proxy for rental income, and remove distributions to avoid double counting. 6.10 Chapter 7 explains how we incorporate income earned through trusts. The income of the trust is attributed to the family using the methodology in chapter 7. For the all-income ETR, when the trust is not a trading trust, we include in income the families’ proportion of the trustee income and the capital gains on the assets of the trust. For the asset class ETRs, only the capital gains on the relevant assets of the trust are added to income. Trading trusts are treated as a business entity and the income is calculated accordingly. Capital gains 6.11 The most significant items added to annual net income are realised and accrued capital gains. 38 In Part 3, capital gains are calculated for the Project period (that is, the earliest base year used to calculate capital gains is 1 April 2015). 6.12 Only capital gains from asset types most likely to give rise to material and measurable capital gains are included. Capital gains from smaller assets and personal items, such as cars, artwork, intellectual property and jewellery, are not included. While this arguably results in some downward bias to the income measures, these capital gains are likely to be immaterial and many of these items may be better thought of as consumption goods rather than assets. 38 Advani and Summers (2022) note that the inclusion of capital gains in the comprehensive income definition is not without problems. For example, a decline in interest rates will increase the present discounted value of consumption flows from an asset such as housing, and hence increase the asset price. An individual may therefore receive gains but not be better off than before. However, when the aim is to measure inequality, it is important to consider these gains, because someone with assets that have increased in sales value when the interest rate falls is better off than someone without such assets. PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 44 6.13 There are differences in the reliability of our measures of capital gains for different asset classes. Measures based on listed prices or comparable sales, such as for listed shares and property, will be more accurate than measures based on financial statement information, such as is the case for unlisted entities. Appendix E provides more information on the various data sources. 6.14 Capital gains are measured on the following asset types: ▪ Real property – This includes owner-occupied homes, other residential property, commercial and industrial property, bare land and farms. – Capital gains from real property held directly, or in trusts, partnerships and land-rich entities, are included. ▪ Portfolio financial assets – This includes portfolio equity instruments, debt instruments, and other investments held in New Zealand or overseas. An equity investment is treated as a portfolio investment when the family, together with trusts, held less than a 10 percent ownership interest in the entity or the entity did not meet a specified asset or income threshold (see chapter 11). – This includes portfolio financial assets held directly or in trusts. ▪ Business/non-portfolio entities – Business entities are identified and measured separately when the family, together with trusts, owns 10 percent or more of the entity and the entity meets a specified asset or income threshold. 39 – Business entities are companies (listed and unlisted) and trading trusts. Capital gains are not calculated on sole trader businesses or partnerships due to difficulties with valuing such entities. – Capital gains on indirect holdings of New Zealand companies (when the family’s holding is greater than percent and companies held in trust are also included. 6.15 Capital gains have generally not been calculated on holdings in foreign non- portfolio entities, except for foreign subsidiaries owned by a New Zealand listed company. 40 This is because of difficulties with identification and valuation (see ‘Foreign income and taxes’ below for a full explanation of foreign income and tax included). 6.16 When we add capital gains to annual net income, we take the following approach to account for the possibility that some capital gains will have been taxed and therefore included in annual net income: ▪ Real property gains of companies, partnerships, and trading trusts – if there is a business activity code indicating that the entity is in the 39 Chapter 13 (SHLCs) includes some companies in which the family had less than a 10 percent ownership interest but was a significant shareholder. The threshold is set at 10 percent for the all-income ETR and business entity ETR. 40 The foreign subsidiaries of listed companies are not explicitly valued, but their value is inherent in the value of the New Zealand listed companies that own them. PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 45 business of land development, subdivision, trading or erecting buildings, we have assumed the realised gains are taxable. How we treat capital gains to remove double counting is discussed in chapter 9. ▪ In all other cases, we assume capital gains are untaxed, so both accrued and realised gains are reported in the ETRs as additional to annual net income. To the extent that some of these gains are included in annual net income and taxed, this will tend to understate the ETR. However, we consider this is likely to be the correct treatment in most cases. 41 Imputed rental 6.17 In addition to the above items, the property and all-income ETRs have been calculated both inclusive and exclusive of imputed rental income on owner- occupied housing. This is the rent individuals would pay for their homes if they did not own them and recognises the real benefits to individuals from owning their homes (Smeeding & Weinburg, 2001). For households with otherwise similar incomes, the consumption possibilities are greater for households with low housing costs than for those with high housing costs. Including imputed rental as part of consumption-based income measures recognises this consumption benefit that accrues to homeowners and allows a more meaningful comparison of households with different tenure types (Perry, 2019, p20). Financing costs 6.18 Estimates of capital income should be net of the financing costs associated with the income-producing asset. Where individuals directly hold assets that produce taxable income, we account for financing costs in annual net income, which is reduced by financing costs. We also take account of mortgages on the owner- occupied property in the calculation of imputed rents. For business entities, the amount of debt in the entity is considered in the calculation of its annual value, and for land-rich entities, financing costs are recognised in taxable income. However, where a directly held asset generates no taxable income but generates capital gains included in our measures (for example, a holiday home), our approach does not take account of financing costs. This could result in an overestimate of income and understatement of ETRs in some cases. 6.19 However, Household Economic Survey data suggests that high-wealth individuals have little personal debt compared to their assets. For the HES 2018, the liabilities of the top percentile of households were 0.33 percent of their assets. Consistent with this, only approximately 15 percent of the Project population declared having a mortgage on their owner-occupied property in the Financial Collection and the value of these mortgages was less than 10 percent of the value of the owner-occupied property. Given this, we do not expect any omitted financing costs to have a large impact. Gifts and inheritances 6.20 In considering the definition of income, one issue is whether gifts and inheritances should be included. These items form part of Haig-Simons income, given they increase individuals’ consumption possibilities. However, different views are taken in the literature on the treatment of gifts. We have chosen not to treat these amounts as income. On one view, gifts and inheritances can be 41 Inland Revenue data suggests that approximately 46,000 residential properties were sold and taxed in the two tax years following 2017/18. This represents only 14 percent of the 332,000 residential property sales recorded by Inland Revenue in the same two-year period. Equivalent data is not available for the proportion of taxable sales for other types of assets, such as shares. PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 46 seen as a transfer between individuals that net out in aggregate and do not increase aggregate income (Schmalbeck, 2010). 42 6.21 Another consideration is that our period of analysis is the 2016–2021 income years. Significant gifts and inheritances are rare and may have been received at any point in an individual’s life, making it difficult and potentially distortionary to include these amounts in an ETR calculated over a limited period. However, we did collect information on significant gifts and inheritances, which is discussed in chapter 15. 6.22 Finally, as discussed in chapter 4, government in-kind transfers, such as health and education, are not included as income in our measures. Taxation 6.23 This section discusses the approach to calculating tax for the ETRs. Timing of tax recognition 6.24 Tax is recognised as the tax assessed on taxable income (of the individual or entity) under New Zealand tax law for a given income year. For example, an individual’s personal tax in a year will be the amount assessed for a given year’s taxable income. ikewise, a company’s or trustee’s taxable income will be the amount assessed in relation to the entity’s taxable income in a tax year. 43 As discussed in chapter 5, an alternative measure of tax that recognises and values tax losses in the year they are incurred makes minimal difference to the results. 6.25 The Treasury’s measure of personal tax in their ET analysis is also tax on annual taxable income, which is consistent with our primary approach. Included taxes 6.26 There are choices as to what taxes to include in the calculation of the economic income ETR. The taxes we include are based on a consideration of the following: ▪ Project purpose: The purpose of calculating ETRs is to assess the level of progressivity and the efficiency of the tax system. This means some taxes are not relevant as they are related to specific costs or disincentivising certain activities (for example, excises). ▪ Symmetry: We seek to ensure that ETRs are consistent in the treatment of income and taxation. This means that when an income flow is included (for example, capital gains from companies), we will also include any taxation it bears at either the individual or entity level (for example, company tax). This means different taxes are included for different ETR calculations, depending on the income stream included. 42 Schmalbeck (2010) argues that if gifts are treated as income, the giving of gifts should be treated as an expense. He gives the example that if every taxpayer were to transfer their income in some year to the person next in alphabetical order on a roster of taxpayers, one would not conclude that aggregate income had doubled. Dodge (2013) notes that the giving of gifts may be argued to be consumption by the giver. 43 No alignment of dates will be undertaken when a company’s or trust’s income year differs non-standard balance date from that of the individual. For example, the company’s tax paid will be added to the individual’s tax paid, irrespective of the period the income year refers to. PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 47 ▪ Materiality: Some taxes are excluded on materiality grounds, particularly when we have insufficient data to accurately estimate how much of the tax would have been incurred by the Project population. 6.27 The following taxes are included in ETRs as relevant: ▪ Personal income tax (included in all ETRs): New Zealand income tax assessed on personal taxable income earned by members of the family. For ETRs when company tax is not directly included as tax (see below), this will include the amount of tax attributed to dividends when the tax is satisfied with imputation credits or other tax credits. ▪ Company tax: When the family owns more than 10 percent of a company, 44 they are attributed a share of company tax proportionate to their shareholding when the relevant income source is included in the ETR (this is also the case when the company is held in trust). To ensure that tax paid by companies is not double counted, when company tax is attributed to individuals, it is reduced by the amount of the imputation credit from that company included in personal tax. No company tax is attributed on portfolio holdings (except imputation credits as described above). ▪ Trustee tax: Trustee income tax is attributed to the family when the taxable income of the trust is attributed to the family for the all-income ETR. Trustee income tax is not included in the asset class ETRs as trustee income is not included in these ETRs. However, trading trusts are treated as business or land-rich entities, and consequently the share of trading trust tax is included in the asset class and all-income ETR. 6.28 Additionally, an estimate of the GST attributable to the Project population will be made and included in an ETR measure for the all-income ETR. Excluded taxes 6.29 The following taxes (or tax-like charges) are not included within ETRs: ▪ Excise taxes and gaming duties: Excluded because these taxes are levied to address the social costs associated with a particular activity. Further, we have not collected detailed data on relevant expenditures and therefore would not be able to accurately estimate the amount paid in excise tax. Excise tax and gaming duties are unlikely to be material. ▪ Fringe benefit tax: Excluded because the tax is paid by employers, and it is difficult to attribute it to, or determine the incidence on, individuals. ▪ Local body rates: Excluded as they are not levied by central government. ▪ ACC levies: Excluded because they are difficult to attribute to individuals, are unlikely to be material and are more akin to insurance. ▪ Employer superannuation contribution tax: This was considered immaterial in this context. 44 Company tax is included for all companies in the listed company ETR (chapter 13). PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 48 Foreign income and taxes 6.30 Foreign income and tax are included within ETR measures where practical. However, difficulties with the measurement of foreign income and tax mean that not all amounts are included. Some international studies (such as Alstadsaeter et al., 2019) show that foreign asset holdings can be significant for high-wealth individuals, hence the omission of some foreign income may result in an underestimation of income. 6.31 Foreign portfolio income (including capital gains) and foreign taxes paid directly by individuals and trusts on such income and creditable in New Zealand are accounted for in relevant ETRs. Capital gains on overseas real estate are not included, as estimates of this income (and any tax paid on it) would be unreliable. However, overseas rental income will generally be included as part of annual net income. 6.32 Capital gains related to controlled foreign companies (CFCs) owned directly by individuals and trusts are excluded from the ETRs because of a lack of information on foreign tax payments. 45 This exclusion is likely to be immaterial to the overall results. Administrative data suggests that the Project population hold minimal direct interests in CFCs. 6.33 Foreign income (including capital gains) and taxes related to foreign subsidiaries of listed New Zealand non-portfolio entities are included in the ETRs. 46 This relates to the inclusion of capital gains income from the change in share value of the New Zealand parent company. Since the change in value of the parent company reflects the change in value of all its subsidiaries, foreign income is included to the extent it adds to the gain, and foreign company tax paid by the foreign subsidiaries is also included. 6.34 Capital gains and taxes related to foreign subsidiaries of unlisted domestic non- portfolio entities are excluded from ETR calculations because: ▪ we do not have the information on the foreign subsidiary’s income to estimate the value of the foreign subsidiary, and ▪ unlike the case for a New Zealand listed company, we can estimate the value of a group of New Zealand unlisted companies without including the value of the foreign subsidiaries (by only considering the income of the New Zealand companies in the valuation). 45 Dividends and attributed foreign income from CFCs are included in annual net income, and creditable foreign taxes and New Zealand taxes imposed on these amounts are included as taxes. 46 This income and tax are also included in the listed company ETR in chapter 13. PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 49 CHAPTER 7 TRUSTS 7.1 As discussed, our economic income measures include income earned through trusts. Trust equity can be a significant component of net worth for high-wealth individuals. Rashbrooke (2021) notes that based on the Household Economic Survey, the mean individual in the top 1 percent of the net worth distribution holds around half of their assets in trust equity. Our results show a significant portion of the Project population’s income is earned through trusts. 7.2 A trust is within scope if it had total gross assets of greater than $1,000,000 in any year of the Project period and a member of the family was a settlor, appointer or beneficiary of the trust. 47 This asset threshold may bias income downwards. In the information collection, 1,279 such trusts (including trading trusts) were disclosed. 7.3 Unlike corporate entities, it is not clear who has the right to the undistributed income from a trust. For this reason, we have developed a set of rules for attributing income of trusts to the families in the Project population in the relevant years (see ‘Attributing “ownership” of trusts’ below). 7.4 Our approach to calculating the economic income derived from trusts treats the trust as if the income were directly earned by the family, provided the family has a sufficiently strong relationship to the trust. If the family does not, then only the distributions received by the family from the trust are included in the family’s income (see ‘Economic income measurement for trusts’ below). Attributing “ownership” of trusts 7.5 Our approach to attributing the income (trustee income and capital gains) and trustee tax of a trust to a family uses a model analogous to company ownership. As trusts are not separate legal entities, vary in structure, and have no equivalent to share equity, this approach provides an approximation of the family’s effective ownership. 7.6 We have adopted a series of tests to determine how trust income is attributed to the family. 48 The first set of tests seeks to create a proxy of equity ownership – first considering if the family has real (as opposed to legal) control of the trust or has exclusive beneficial ownership (regardless of control) of the trust. If this is not the case, we look at the strength of the family’s relationship to the trust and then the proportion of distributions the family has either received or has the right to receive. 7.7 The test that is satisfied determines the ‘trust attribution factor’ for the family. 49 This is the proportion of trustee income (for the all-income ETR) and trust capital gains (for the all-income ETR and asset class ETRs) that is attributed to the family. For example, if the trust attribution factor is 50 percent, then 50 percent of trustee income and 50 percent of trust capital gains are attributed to the family for the all-income ETR. The trust attribution factor is not applied to 47 Where such a trust is the sole beneficiary of another trust, that other trust is also included. SHLCs in trust are included in the listed company ETR if they are consolidated in disclosed stock exchange holdings. 48 All tests use the definition of family in the glossary. Adult children are excluded from this definition. 49 For chapter 13 (SHLCs), the trust attribution factor is assumed to be 100 percent. PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 50 beneficiary income, for which the actual amount received is included in the recipient’s base income. Where the family has control or exclusive beneficial ownership 7.8 If either the control or exclusive beneficial ownership test is satisfied, we treat the trust as effectively “owned” by the family and the trust attribution factor is 100 percent. This applies to around 71 percent of disclosed trusts. Control test 7.9 The control test is satisfied if two-thirds or more of those with the power of appointment over the trust are family members. Power of appointment refers to a person having been granted the right, usually in the trust deed, to appoint, change, and possibly remove trustees, and in some cases, to appoint or remove beneficiaries from a class that can benefit under the trust. It can sometimes also include a power to approve or veto certain key decisions of trustees, such as to dispose of significant assets, to approve certain distributions or even to trigger the liquidation of the trust. 7.10 Trustees also have day-to-day control of the trust assets. However, we have not used this as a proxy for control; rather, we have treated this as being equivalent to the directors of a company charged with day-to-day decision-making. We have equated the powers of appointment with the rights vested in the shareholders of a company. These are not recognised principles that appear in tax law, and they are only adopted for the purpose of this Project. 7.11 Where there is no power of appointment created, the law generally vests this in the trustees in the event of a vacancy. However, we do not have the capacity to determine this position in individual cases, so we have chosen not to use this as an additional test for attribution purposes. Exclusive beneficial ownership test 7.12 The exclusive beneficial ownership test is satisfied if all beneficiaries of the trust are in the family. In this case, we consider there is a clear expectation that all beneficiary distributions would eventually be made to the family. 7.13 The exclusive beneficial ownership test is also satisfied where the trustees hold the family’s principal home. This brings an additional 9 disclosed trusts into this set of trusts. Where the family does not have control or exclusive beneficial ownership 7.14 If neither the control nor exclusive beneficial ownership test is satisfied, we look at the following two approaches. 7.15 First, we consider the strength of a family’s relationship to a trust. If the only relationship the family has with the trust is as beneficiaries (and there are beneficiaries outside the family), then the trust attribution factor is zero and we only include the distributions the family received from the trust in income. We refer to this as the beneficiary-only test and this applies to 79 trusts. 7.16 Second, if a family has other relationships with a trust in addition to being a beneficiary (that is, as a trustee, appointer, or settlor), the trust attribution factor is determined based on the distributions the family has received or may be expected to receive in the future. The attribution factor is determined by applying the following tests sequentially (meaning the first test met in the list is the one applied): PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 51 ▪ First, for a “fixed” trust with non-discretionary entitlements to income provided for (62 trusts), we determine the trust attribution factor based on the share of distributions to which the family is entitled. ▪ If the first test is inapplicable and actual distributions have been made to the family in the Project period, we determine the trust attribution factor based on the proportion of total trust distributions the family received over the Project period. This test applied to 26 trusts. ▪ Finally, if neither of the above apply, we determine the trust attribution factor based on the proportion of assets, if any, the family would be entitled to as final beneficiaries if the trust were wound up (this applies to 17 trusts). This is equivalent to the rights of shareholders in a liquidation. 7.17 Under these tests, the trust attribution factor is zero for 21 percent of trusts. This includes the trusts that met the beneficiary-only test and trusts that did not meet any test, which were 15 percent of trusts. Economic income measurement for trusts Trading trusts 7.18 If the trust is a trading trust (that is, has an active business), economic income is measured in the same way as for business entities (chapter 11) and attributed as above. Trustee tax for the year is also attributed as tax. Trusts other than trading trusts 7.19 The following paragraphs discuss how the economic income from other trusts is measured for the all-income ETR and the asset class ETRs. All-income ETR Income 7.20 If the beneficiary-only test does not apply, total economic income from the trust for the family is the sum of: ▪ beneficiary income received by the family (already included in the annual net income base) ▪ the trustee’s taxable income x the family’s trust attribution factor ▪ the capital gains on the underlying assets of the trust 50 x the family’s trust attribution factor ▪ for land-rich entities held in trust, the taxable income of the entity, less distributions from the entity to the trust, is also included in income (pro- rated in proportion to the trust’s ownership of the entity and following application of the trust attribution factor). 51 7.21 Distributions from a trust that are taxable to members of the Project population are included in income as part of annual net income/base income. These 50 That is, real property held directly by the trust or in a land-rich entity held by the trust, business entities held in trust, and portfolio assets held by the trust as per the portfolio methodology. 51 The treatment of land-rich entities is discussed in chapters 9 and 11. PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 52 distributions do not form part of the trustee’s taxable income. Untaxed distributions are not recognised as income to the Project population unless the beneficiary-only test applies. This is because the income used to fund them is recognised as income of the trust and is therefore already included. Distributions of the trust to third parties are not part of income for our purposes. 7.22 If the beneficiary-only test applies, the trust attribution factor is zero and the income to the family members is the amount received as taxable beneficiary income and untaxed distributions from the trust. Tax 7.23 Tax from trusts included in the all-income ETR is trustee tax plus attributed company tax on companies owned by the trust. This is multiplied by the family’s trust attribution factor. Tax on beneficiary income is included in tax on personal taxable income. Asset class ETRs 7.24 Table 7.1 sets out the income and tax from trusts for the asset class ETRs. 7.25 Because we cannot determine which components of income earned by the trust (for example, rent) have been distributed as beneficiary income and are therefore already in annual net income/base income, we do not attribute to trust beneficiaries any taxable income of the trust for the asset class ETRs. However, non-taxable gains (that is, capital gains) are attributed since they cannot have been included in base income. No trustee tax is attributed on those amounts. 7.26 Where the beneficiary-only test is satisfied, the trust attribution factor is zero. Only taxable beneficiary income is included in the individuals’ income for the asset class ETRs. Untaxed distributions are not included as it is not possible to identify which element of income has been distributed.

It only includes income sources taxable at the personal level. It is used in preference to personal taxable income as the treatment of losses more accurately reflects the economic income or loss a family generates during the year from personal taxable income sources. Like personal taxable income, base income constitutes 7 percent of the economic income of the Project population. 8.2 This chapter presents effective tax rates (ETRs) based on annual net income (base income) as the first step in the economic income calculations. 8.3 Income and ETRs in this chapter, and all chapters in Part 3, are calculated for the responder population unless otherwise stated. This is 311 families (311 Individual As, 238 partners and 27 dependent children) or 311 Individual As. The addition of income from children throughout the income categories has proven to be immaterial to the ETRs. Methodology 8.4 The ETR on annual net income, the base income ETR, is calculated as: 푃푒푟푠표푛푎푙 푡푎푥 푎푠푠푒푠푠푒푑 퐴푛푛푢푎푙 푛푒푡 푖푛푐표푚푒 8.5 Annual net income is sourced from tax assessments Inland Revenue holds for the individual taxpayer. It is the sum of the income types taxable at the personal level minus any allowable expenses. It therefore includes the same income types discussed in chapter 5 - personal taxable income. However, rather than recognising losses that have been brought forward (or claimed) for tax assessment purposes, losses are only recognised in the year they economically occurred. This means annual net income can be a negative amount. Around 3 percent of the responder population have a negative base income amount each year. 8.6 Personal tax assessed is the amount of the individual taxpayer’s tax liability on their personal taxable income under the personal tax rate schedule for the year. It is calculated in the same manner as in chapter 5. Again, GST is not included in tax in this chapter. 8.7 Calculating an ETR using personal tax assessed divided by annual net income is appropriate as a base from which economic income calculations are undertaken. This is because annual net income better reflects income economically earned in a year, whereas taxable income reflects income as defined under tax law (which could be influenced by earlier years’ income . As our goal is to assess how much tax is paid under current tax settings relative to economic income, we use tax assessed on taxable income as the measure of tax. Further, as discussed in chapter 5, an alternative measure of personal tax that imputes a tax benefit for losses on personal income made an immaterial difference to the results. PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 54 Results Income 8.8 The mean annual net income for Individual A is similar to mean taxable income over the period. The mean varies between $794,000 and $879,000 from 2016 to 2020, and then it increases to $1,971,000 in 2021. 8.9 The mean annual net income for the family unit is similar to mean taxable income, being between $929,000 and $1,015,000 from 2016 to 2020 and then increasing to $2,148,000 in 2021. 8.10 The median annual net income for Individual A and the family unit is also similar to taxable income, being between $250,000 and $314,000 for Individual A and between $325,000 and $377,000 for the family unit. Figure 8.1 Median vs. mean base income Individual A and family Effective tax rates (ETRs) 8.11 The same ETRs are calculated as for taxable income. 8.12 The base income ETRs have also been calculated for the whole population (352 families and 352 Individual As) as a sensitivity test. The base income ETRs are similar based on the responder or whole population, being on average within 0.2 percentage points. The mean and median base incomes of the responder population are, on average, 4 percent higher than for the whole population of Individual As and 6 percent higher for the family. Annual base income ETR 8.13 Figure 8.2 shows that, for each year of the Project period, the median annual base income ETR for Individual A is between 29.4% and 30%. The family unit ETR is around 1 percentage point lower, being between 28.4% and 29.2%. On average, this is 0.4 percentage points different to the results for the taxable income ETR. 8.14 As with taxable income, most Individual A/family unit annual base income ETRs are within a small range.

These results are very close to the results for the taxable income ETRs. Figure 8.3 shows the distribution of Project period base income ETRs by ETR band 52 for Individual A. The distribution for the family unit is similar. Some individuals have low ETRs due to having low base income (a negative ETR occurs when base income is negative). Figure 8.3 Project period base income ETR for Individual A Project period population base income ETR (population weighted-mean ETR) 8.16 The Project period population base income ETR is 32.2% for Individual A and 32.1% for all members of the responder population.

Asset class ETRs are calculated as if income were earned only from annual net income (base income) and the asset class in question (for example, property). Therefore, asset class ETRs isolate a particular income stream to assess the impact of that income stream on the base income ETR. Tax is added to the numerator of the asset class ETR when an income stream that bears that tax is included. The asset class ETRs follow a standard format of: 퐸푇푅= Personal tax assessed+ tax from asset class A Annual net income +income from asset class A Personal tax assessed and annual net income (base income) are included in all asset class ETRs to provide a standard base line to compare how much a particular income source changes the ETR, as compared to the base income ETR of approximately 30%. The asset class ETR is an income-weighted mean of the base income ETR and the ETR for the income source added. A weighted-mean ETR is a measure of the relevant units ETR that accounts for the proportion of income subject to different tax rates. The extent of variation in the asset class ETR, from the base income ETR, depends on: • the ETR on income from asset class A; and • the size of the income from asset class A relative to base income. If the average ETR on income source A were 30%, the addition of income source A would not reduce the ETR relative to the base income ETR no matter the size of the income source. If the average ETR on income source A were 0%, but income source A was very small (large) compared to base income, then income source A would have minimal effect (a large effect) on the ETR, compared to the base income ETR. Sub-components of income from an asset class are first added separately. Then all income components of an asset class are added for the all-asset class A ETR. For example, for the portfolio ETR, the asset class ETR is calculated: • first, only including income from direct holdings of portfolio investments (direct portfolio ETR) • second, only including income from trust holdings of portfolio investments (trust portfolio ETR). This allows us to assess if direct or trust holdings of portfolio assets have a bigger impact on the base income ETR. Then, for the all-portfolio ETR, income from both direct and trust holdings is included to show the combined impact of all portfolio income on the ETR. As, personal taxable income and personal tax are included in the all-portfolio ETR, as well as in each of the direct portfolio ETR and trust portfolio ETR, the all-portfolio ETR is not a weighted mean of the direct and trust portfolio ETRs. As illustrated in figure 8.5, the all-portfolio ETR shows the total impact of these income sources on the ETR. Figure 8.5 All-portfolio ETR vs. component portfolio ETRs All portfolio ET , .

It presents asset class effective tax rates (ETRs) assuming income is comprised of annual net income (base income) and economic income from real property holdings (property ETRs). 9.2 The population for this chapter is the responder population unless otherwise stated. 9.3 For the general population, while real property is more widely held than other asset classes, holdings of property are still concentrated in higher net worth deciles. Further, higher net worth deciles have a lower ratio of property liabilities to property assets, meaning higher deciles have a higher share of net than gross real property holdings. Higher deciles also have higher values for real property in trusts. Figure 9.1 shows that when holdings through trusts are included, the top net worth decile holds around 45 percent of net real property assets. 54 9.4 Owner-occupied housing (OOH) is a greater share of the assets of middle, than higher, income deciles (see figure 9.3, at paragraph 9.32). Figure 9.2 shows that the top net worth decile holds around 70 percent of net real property assets excluding OOH (including property held in trust). Figure 9.1 Share of total household real estate holdings by net worth decile Source: Household Economic Survey (2018) 54 Household Economic Survey, Net Worth Supplement (2018).

Property ETRs are decomposed into the following sub-categories based on how property is held: ▪ direct property ETR, ▪ land-rich entity ETR, and ▪ trust property ETR. 9.6 These property income and tax sources are combined for calculating the all- property ETR. Additionally, imputed rental is included in an all-property ETR. Methodology 9.7 To calculate the property ETRs, we start with the base income ETR presented in chapter 8 (personal tax assessed/annual net income) and add in income from property holdings as discussed below. Directly held property 9.8 Directly held property is property held in an individual’s name. This includes property held in a general partnership. 55 Capital gains (accrued and realised) from directly held property are added to annual net income to calculate the direct property ETR. 55 Information was collected on trustee holdings of property in the Financial Collection. Where the individual was on the property title only in the capacity of a trustee (and was not a beneficiary), this property has been removed from the data. Similarly, where a property was held on an individual’s behalf by another person in a bare trustee or nominee capacity, this property has been included.

Additionally, the tax paid on rental/lease income is already included in personal tax assessed, as is any tax paid on capital gains, such as under the bright-line test. However, as we cannot identify these taxable capital gains, our measure may double count some gains. 9.11 For directly held property, debt and other rental expenses on a rented/leased property will be taken into account as they will reduce net rental income (an element of annual net income) and tax on taxable income. For owner-occupied property, debt is considered in the calculation of imputed rental (see below). Property held in trust 9.12 Economic income from real property held in trust will be calculated and attributed to families in accordance with the trust attribution methodology. 9.13 When the trustee of the trust holds the property directly, the income added is the capital gain on the property. The taxable income (rental and bright-line gains) of the trust from owning the property (and associated costs) is not attributed in the asset class ETR 56 because taxable income amounts are often paid as beneficiary income. No additional trustee tax is attributed for the asset class ETR given only non-taxable trust income has been included. 9.14 The trust property ETR, when the trustee directly holds the property, is: 푃푒푟푠표푛푎푙 푡푎푥 푎푠푠푒푠푠푒푑 퐴푛푛푢푎푙 푛푒푡 푖푛푐표푚푒+ 푐푎푝푖푡푎푙 푔푎푖푛푠 푓푟표푚 푡푟푢푠푡 푝푟표푝푒푟푡푦 57 9.15 A trust may also own a company that holds property. If the company is land rich, the income (and associated tax) will be calculated in the same manner as for land-rich entities (see below). Property held within entities 9.16 Companies and trading trusts that predominantly hold property investments are regarded as land rich and are included in the land-rich entity ETR. 9.17 Companies and trading trusts will be deemed to be land-rich entities when the average annual value of the entity’s property interests is greater than the average annual equity value of the entity over the Project period. For example, if an entity has an average annual value of property of $5 million, as well as an average annual business value (using the method set out in chapter 11) of $2 million, the entity will be valued based on its property interests only. 58 9.18 For limited partnerships, all property held by a limited partnership is included in the land-rich entity ETR in proportion to the limited partner’s partnership interest. 56 Trustee income is included in the all-income ETR. 57 Multiplied by the trust attribution factor. 58 The comparison is between the gross value of property and the equity value of the entity. PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 61 9.19 The economic income of a land-rich entity (including limited partnerships) is the change in market value of the entity’s real property assets plus taxable income 59 (assumed to be mainly rental and lease income) from the entity. For entities identified as property trading companies through their Business Industry Classification (BIC) code, we assume the taxable income of the entity includes realised capital gains. In this case, we do not include the realised capital gains (or gains on that property prior to the year of sale) in economic income so that we do not double count capital gains. 9.20 As dividends paid by a land-rich company to the individual are included within the individual’s personal income and the company’s taxable income, they are subtracted from the income calculation. 60 This avoids double counting of income generated by the entity. 9.21 When income from land-rich entities is included in the ETR, company tax and trustee tax from trading trusts on that income are added to the numerator of the ETR. The amount of tax met with imputation credits from the same company is removed from tax to avoid double counting. Both income and tax are attributed to the individuals (and trusts) in proportion to their ownership. 9.22 Unlisted companies and trading trusts that are not land-rich entities are valued in accordance with the methodology in chapter 11. 9.23 The land-rich entity (LRE) ETR is: 푃푒푟푠표푛푎푙 푡푎푥 푎푠푠푒푠푠푒푑+푎푡푡푟푖푏푢푡푒푑 푒푛푡푖푡푦 푡푎푥− 푖푚푝푢푡푎푡푖표푛 푐푟푒푑푖푡푠 푓푟표푚 퐿푅퐸 퐴푛푛푢푎푙 푛푒푡 푖푛푐표푚푒+ 푝푟표푝푒푟푡푦 푐푎푝푖푡푎푙 푔푎푖푛푠 푎푛푑 푡푎푥푎푏푙푒 푖푛푐표푚푒 푓푟표푚 퐿푅퐸−푑푖푣푖푑푒푛푑푠 푓푟표푚 퐿푅퐸 All-property ETR 9.24 The all-property ETR includes all sources of property income from direct, trust and land-rich entity holdings and all tax included in the property ETRs (that is, personal tax and attributed entity tax from land-rich entities). The all-property ETR shows the combined impact of all property income (and tax) on the base income ETR, whereas the component ETRs above show the significance of each source of property income individually. As tax is spread across more income in the all-property ETR, it is lower than the component ETRs. 9.25 The all-property ETR is: 푃푒푟푠표푛푎푙 푡푎푥 푎푠푠푒푠푠푒푑+푎푡푡푟푖푏푢푡푒푑 푒푛푡푖푡푦 푡푎푥− 푖푚푝푢푡푎푡푖표푛 푐푟푒푑푖푡푠 푓푟표푚 퐿푅퐸 퐴푛푛푢푎푙 푛푒푡 푖푛푐표푚푒+ 푎푙푙 푝푟표푝푒푟푡푦 푐푎푝푖푡푎푙 푔푎푖푛푠+ 푡푎푥푎푏푙푒 푖푛푐표푚푒 푓푟표푚 퐿푅퐸−푑푖푣푖푑푒푛푑푠 푓푟표푚 퐿푅퐸 Calculation of capital gains 9.26 Capital gains on real property have been calculated as the annual change in value of the property over the Project period. The way in which a real property’s annual value is determined depends on whether the property is residential or non-residential. 9.27 For residential property (including lifestyle), annual valuations have been obtained from a third-party automated property valuation service. This uses an 59 In the case of a limited partnership, the taxable income is already included in annual net income. 60 In the case of trading trusts, beneficiary income does not need to be subtracted as it is not included in the trustee income. For the asset class ETRs, dividends from land-rich companies held in trust are not removed as trustee income is not included in the ETR. PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 62 Automated Valuation Model (AVM) based on comparable sales data. 61 The annual (accrued) change in value is measured using the relevant year’s closing AVM for the property less the previous year’s closing AV , when the property was not disposed of in that year. Realised gains included in economic income are calculated for a sales year based on the AVM for the year of sale less the prior year’s closing AV , with the capital gain for the sales year pro-rated for the portion of the year the property was held. 62 9.28 For non-residential property, the properties are split into sub-categories depending on the property type and region. The sub-categories of non- residential property are: 1. Commercial. 2. Industrial. 3. Rural/Farm. 4. Forestry. 9.29 For non-residential property, an initial 2015 valuation is established from the rateable value. 63 Annual values are then calculated by applying an annual growth rate to the rateable, and then subsequent years’, value. 64 The growth rate is derived from comparable sales data and is applied at the level of each non-residential sub-category and region (the growth rates are provided at the end of this chapter). Where a disposal occurs, the realised gain included in economic income is valued based on the calculated valuation, less the prior year’s value, pro-rated for the portion of the disposal year held. 9.30 An allowance has been made for assumed expenditure on improvements for property (capital expenditure). Where the change in improvement value for the property in our data exceeds 4.4 percent per annum, we assume the excess is capital expenditure. 65 The change in value of the property is then reduced by the amount of the estimated capital expenditure. Imputed rental 9.31 Imputed rental is the foregone rental from living in one’s own home. It represents the consumption benefit that an owner-occupier receives from home ownership. It is included as a component of economic income to ensure equal treatment of homeowners and renters (see chapter 6). 9.32 Figure 9.3 shows that owner-occupied housing represents a smaller proportion of the total assets of decile 10 than other deciles. 66 For the Project population, owner-occupied property is small compared to total assets, at around 1.8 61 There were some gaps in the AVM data that were filled by using territorial authority growth rates. Where a residential property has no AVM valuation for any years, the property’s rateable value is used. 62 We investigated use of the sales price. However, this was not comparable with the AVM-based purchase price. Actual purchase prices were generally not available in our data. 63 The rateable value (RV) used for the 2015 opening value is the closest RV prior to this date. 64 The six-year average growth rate has been used due to the annual volatility in growth rates. 65 This is the average annual change in the CPI - Purchase of Housing index. This is used as an estimate of the expected change in the capital value of the house. 66 Household Economic Survey, Net Worth Statistics (2018). Decile 1 have higher gross assets and higher holdings of owner-occupied dwellings than decile 2 but have lower net worth due to higher liabilities. This leads to the relatively high proportion for decile 1. PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 63 percent. Nonetheless, for the Project population, imputed rental is 16 percent of base income over the Project period. Figure 9.3 Share of total household assets held in owner-occupied housing by net worth decile compared to Project population Source: Household Economic Survey (2018) 9.33 The Project sought information from each family on their principal residence and the amount of mortgage borrowing secured over it, if any.

Imputed rental is only calculated on one property. In reality, families may be benefiting from the use of more than one property (for example, a main home and a holiday home). The imputed rental included may therefore be under-measured. Data sources 9.35 Publicly available title data from LINZ is held by Inland Revenue and has been used by the Project to identify both direct holdings and holdings through entities. 9.36 Limited information was sought from the Project population on property ownership in the Entity and Financial Collections. As trust-held property generally displays the names of trustees on the title, details regarding trustee- or nominee-held property were requested from the Project population to ensure title data was correctly matched with the beneficial owners of the real property. Details relating to the primary residence were also sought from the Project population for the purpose of calculating imputed rent. 67 Territorial rental yields ranged from 2.9 percent (for Dunedin) to 5.7 percent (for Auckland) with an annual average of 3.7 percent.

Results Income 9.38 Figure 9.4 shows the annual amount of base income, capital gains on directly held and trust-held property, capital gains and taxable income of land-rich entities and imputed rental for all members of the responder population for each year.

Figure 9.4 Property income value compared with base income value for family 9.39 The total value of income from land-rich entities and trust properties is larger than for directly held property. As shown in table 9.1, the population hold many properties in land-rich entities. Properties held in trust tend to have a higher value than properties held directly, leading to higher capital gains for trust-held than directly-held properties. Table 9.1 also shows that the growth rates for properties of the Project population, over the Project period, are in line with average growth rates over the Project period (see paragraph 3.18). 9.40 Figure 9.5 shows the capital gains included in economic income from residential and non-residential property by ownership type. Capital gains are larger for non- residential property, with 41 percent of capital gains being derived from residential and 59 percent from non-residential property. 9.41 Additional work on forestry capital gains was done to analyse the effect of the mismatch of capital gains accruing before sale versus the imposition of tax that is deferred until the trees are sold. To do this for the all-property ETR, a sensitivity test was completed. At 1 decimal place, there is no difference in any of the ETR calculations when forestry capital gains are excluded. As such, forestry capital gains income has been included in the property ETR calculations. , , , , , Income value millions Tax year Income by type property family responders ase income Direct and rich entity Trust properties Imputed rental PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 65 Table 9.1 Average growth rate and number of residential and non- residential properties by class 68 Property holding type Average number of properties per year Average value growth, p.a. 2016 – 2021 Direct 1,279 10.2% .... esidential 874 9.8% ....

For all ETR measures, income is base income plus property income unless otherwise stated. 9.44 For directly held property, measures have also been calculated for the whole population as a sensitivity check. 69 Based on the whole population, the median Project period ETR and the Project period population ETR are less than 1 percentage point different from measures for the responder population. Annual property ETR 9.45 Figure 9.6 shows the median annual base income ETR (on average, 29% across the six-year period) compared to the median annual all-property ETR for the family unit. 9.46 Over the Project period, the family median annual all-property ETRs (excluding imputed rental) vary between 5.5% and 9.3%. The ETR is lowest in 2021 due to higher capital gains in this year. Figure 9.6 Median annual all-property ETR for the family Project period property ETR 9.47 For the Project period property ETRs for the family, all median property ETRs are lower than the median base income ETR. This is due to capital gains that are not subject to tax. 9.48 The family median all-property ETR on this measure is 9.4%. When imputed rental income is added, the ETR reduces to 8.5%. In comparison, the family median Project period base income ETR is 30.1%. 9.49 For the median Project period asset class ETRs, the trust property ETR is lower than the direct property and land-rich entity ETRs. This is consistent with higher capital gains on trust property than directly held property. The land-rich entity ETR is the highest. This is because land-rich entity income is concentrated in a 69 As the whole population includes people who did not respond to the information collection, we could only calculate gains from directly held real property for them. This is because we can match individual’s names with property holdings in public records, but we could not do this for property held in companies and trusts that we did not have information on. ET Tax ear edian annual property ET family ase income ET All property ET PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 67 small number of families and is therefore relatively small for the median person. Further, land-rich entity income bears tax at the entity level. 9.50 Figure 9.7 70 shows the median Project period property ETRs for the family. The direct property ETR is 22.9% (for Individual A, 24.8%), the land-rich entity ETR is 24.0% and the trust property ETR is 18.1%. Figure 9.7 Project period property ETR for the family Project period population property ETR (population weighted-mean ETR) 9.51 As seen in the other property ETR measures, the inclusion of property capital gains and income significantly lowers the Project period population ETR compared to the base income ETR. On this measure, the all-property ETR for the family is 11.5%. When imputed rental is included, it is lower at 11.0%. 9.52 Of the income sources, properties in land-rich entities are the most significant in reducing the ETR at the population level. This is different to the median ETRs as capital gains from land-rich entities are concentrated within the Project population. A small number of families earn large capital gains from land-rich entities and have low ETRs. This results in the land-rich entity ETR for the population measure being the lowest of the three asset classes. 9.53 Compared to the base income ETR, the direct property ETR is reduced slightly more (7.8 percentage points) when the family is considered, as opposed to just Individual A (6.9 percentage points). 70 In the box plots, the line in the center of the boxes is the median and the x is the simple mean.

The realised capital gains are calculated as the difference between the sales price and the price at the later of 1 April 2015 or the purchase date. This provides a static measure of realised capital gains, based on current tax settings. Values would likely be different if a realised capital gains tax were imposed. 9.55 We considered two approaches to calculating realised capital gains from real property: using sales/purchase prices or using AVMs. While sales data may be more accurate, there were several problems with using it. In particular, sales data was not necessarily available for both the purchase and sales prices. Mixing sales data and AVMs can lead to inconsistent results. 9.56 For this reason, we calculate realised capital gains on real property as the difference between the AVM price at the time of sale and the AVM at the later of the purchase date or 1 April 2015. The total value of realised capital gains was: Table 9.3 Realised capital gains on property Holding type Realised capital gains Percent of total capital gains in each category Direct holdings $237,000,000 28% Trust holdings $137,000,000 10% Land-rich entity holdings 71 $1,024,000,000 47% 71 This excludes the realised capital gains of entities identified as property trading entities. PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 69 Comparison to real property capital gains of the general population 9.57 The mean total (realised and accrued) capital gain from residential property for the families in the Project population is higher than the mean capital gain on real property for households in the general population. Figure 9.8 estimates mean capital gains from real property by household net worth decile, based on HES 2018, compared to the Project population’s returns on residential property for the same year. 72 Gains are calculated including and excluding owner- occupied housing (OOH). 73 9.58 For the general population, an estimate of property held in trust is included in the estimates. For the Project population, both directly held residential properties and residential properties held in trust are included. Properties held in land-rich entities are not included. 9.59 For the Project population, the property growth rate is calculated as an average AVM growth rate in 2018 for properties in our data base. For the general population, the Core Logic house price index growth rate in 2018 is used. 74 Both growth rates are 2.8 percent for the 2018 year. Figure 9.8 Mean capital gain on residential real property for general population and Project population Source: Household Economic Survey (2018) and Project data 72 For the general population, the mean is reduced by non-property-owning households. 73 As noted previously, HES underestimates decile 10 wealth. Further, the Project population are in the upper end of decile 10. This explains why the mean for the Project population is higher than decile 10. 74 We used Core Logic House price index data as reported in the Reserve Bank’s Monetary Policy Statements.

It presents asset class effective tax rates (ETRs) assuming income is comprised of annual net income and income from portfolio financial assets (portfolio ETRs). 10.2 The population for this chapter is the responder population. 10.3 For the general population, holdings of financial assets are highly concentrated in the top net worth decile. Figure 10.1 shows that decile 10 held 71 percent of total household financial assets in HES 2018. 75 Within decile 10, financial asset holdings are also skewed. The 99th percentile (top 1/10th of decile 10) holds around 37 percent of decile 10 financial assets, that is, just over a quarter of all household financial assets. Figure 10.1 Share of total household financial assets by net worth decile and share of decile 10 financial assets by decile 10 percentile Source: Household Economic Survey (2018) 75 The financial assets included here are currency and deposits, pension funds and other household financial assets. This includes non-portfolio holdings. PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 72 Included assets 10.4 Portfolio financial assets are investments in equity and debt instruments held directly or through a trust. They include domestic and overseas investments such as: ▪ equity investments when the family, together with trusts, holds less than a 10 percent ownership interest or when the entity had neither gross assets over $1,000,000 nor taxable income over $1,000,000, ▪ debt instruments, ▪ investments in managed funds, such as investment trusts, unit trusts, managed and superannuation funds, and ▪ other investments, such as cryptocurrency, options and hybrid securities. 10.5 ETRs are decomposed into the following sub-categories: ▪ direct portfolio ETR, and ▪ trust portfolio ETR. 10.6 These income sources are combined for calculating the all-portfolio ETR. Methodology 10.7 To calculate the portfolio ETRs, we start with the base income ETR presented in chapter 8 (personal tax assessed/annual net income) and add in untaxed income from portfolio financial assets (PFA). The all-portfolio ETR includes income from direct and trust portfolio holdings. 10.8 The all-portfolio ETR is: 푃푒푟푠표푛푎푙 푡푎푥 푎푠푠푒푠푠푒푑 퐴푛푛푢푎푙 푛푒푡 푖푛푐표푚푒+ 푐푎푝푖푡푎푙 푔푎푖푛푠 푓푟표푚 푑표푚푒푠푡푖푐 푃퐹퐴+푢푛푡푎푥푒푑 푖푛푐표푚푒 푓푟표푚 표푣푒푟푠푒푎푠 푃퐹퐴 10.9 The direct portfolio ETR and trust portfolio ETR are calculated in the same way, but each only includes income from direct and trust portfolio holdings, respectively. These subcomponents allow us to see whether direct portfolio holdings or trust portfolio holdings are more significant in the reduction in the ETR from the base income ETR to the all-portfolio ETR. 10.10 The approach we use makes several assumptions. The results seek to estimate average market returns for portfolios of the size held by the Project population rather than to estimate the actual returns of a particular individual or family. Income from portfolio financial assets 10.11 Financial asset portfolios often comprise several small investments that may be traded frequently. Consequently, the income from portfolio financial assets is measured by aggregating all portfolio financial assets together into a single portfolio for each person analysed rather than estimating the income from each asset separately. For this reason, we also do not calculate the realised gains from portfolio financial assets separately to economic income. PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 73 10.12 To calculate the income from portfolio financial assets, we use the annual value of the portfolio as disclosed in the Financial Collection. Individuals disclosed a total portfolio value, for each year, that included overseas and domestic portfolio assets (including debt and equity instruments). 10.13 The economic income from portfolio financial assets includes personal taxable income from interest, dividends and overseas income and non-taxable accrued and realised capital gains from equity and other investments. 76 Our methodology ensures that the income already included in base income/annual net income is not double counted. 10.14 For each year, the total portfolio value is divided into asset sub-categories. These categories are based on annual data from the Reserve Bank Managed Funds Survey (table 10.2). The categories are: 1. Overseas assets. 2. Domestic equities and other financial assets, including units in unit trusts. 3. Domestic bonds. 4. Cash. 10.15 The income from the domestic and overseas portfolios is then calculated as set out below. Our approach is based on market rates of return rather than actual returns. We assume the Project population earned the average market return. 77 Income from directly held overseas portfolio assets 10.16 Base income already includes overseas income from foreign investment funds (FIFs) and interest from foreign portfolio holdings. 78 For FIFs, the amount included in overseas income (a part of base income) will often be calculated based on a deemed rate of return (DRR) of 5 percent. Income calculated through application of the DRR will differ from actual returns. Base income also includes some other forms of overseas investment income, such as overseas rental income. 10.17 Untaxed income from the overseas portfolio is added to base income for the ETR calculation. Untaxed income is the difference between overseas income from the tax return and imputed overseas portfolio income. Imputed overseas portfolio income seeks to measure the full economic return from the asset holding. 10.18 To calculate imputed overseas income, we assume that the overseas portfolio is made up of 60 percent equities and 40 percent bonds. This is likely to be a conservative assumption. If, alternatively, the overseas portfolio was assumed to be 80 percent equities and 20 percent bonds, total portfolio income over the six-year period would be 14.4% and 16.8% higher for directly held and trust portfolios, respectively, and ETRs would be lower under this assumption. 76 Note that any taxable capital gains on debt investments (such as bonds) are already included in base income. 77 Some work, such as Saez and Zucman (2016), argues that, on average, high-wealth individuals receive higher returns. However, without clear evidence of this in New Zealand, we use market returns. This may mean we underestimate total income. 78 Also, dividends from foreign portfolio holdings if the shares were not taxable under the FIF regime, such as if total foreign equities had a cost of less than $50,000. As noted in chapter 5, PIE income is not included in base income. PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 74 10.19 The equity portion of the overseas portfolio is multiplied by an equity total rate of return (in New Zealand dollars, NZD) to impute total returns from equities. This includes both price and income (that is, capital gains and dividends). The bond portfolio is multiplied by an NZD total rate of return for bonds. This estimates foreign bond income as under the financial arrangement rules. Income from the equity and bond portions is summed together for each year. The excess of imputed income over overseas income from the tax return is added to income. Income from directly held domestic portfolio assets 10.20 Dividends and interest on the domestic portfolio are already included in base income. Therefore, the only elements of domestic portfolio income missing from base income are accrued and realised capital gains on the equity portion of the portfolio. 10.21 Based on the estimated portfolio composition, capital gains on the equity portion of the domestic portfolio are calculated by multiplying the annual opening value of that equity portion by a domestic price rate of return. The price rate of return is the change in price of the asset and excludes any dividend return (that is, it is the accrued and realised capital gains). 79 10.22 No capital gains are calculated on the domestic bond or cash portfolio as these are treated as interest income under the financial arrangement rules and are already included in base income (and the corresponding tax in personal tax). Trusts 10.23 Income from portfolio financial assets held in trust is calculated in a similar manner as for direct holdings and attributed to the family using the trust attribution methodology. 10.24 However, for the portfolio asset class ETRs (the trust portfolio ETR and all- portfolio ETR), only the capital gains on overseas and domestic equity investments are added to base income. We only include capital gains from trust portfolio equity investments in these asset class ETRs because taxable elements of income, such as interest and dividends, earned by the trust may have been distributed by the trust and already included in base income. We are not able to separately identify which elements of income of the trust have been distributed and taxed as beneficiary income. 10.25 In contrast, trustee taxable income is included in income for the all-income ETR in chapter 12. In that case, the income from portfolio assets in trust is calculated in the same manner as for direct holdings. Tax paid on portfolio income 10.26 For the tax calculation, the individuals’ tax on personal taxable income amount is used. This includes the tax on dividends, interest and overseas income. Where overseas tax is met with a tax credit, this will be included in tax. 79 It is possible some capital gains on directly held portfolio domestic equities are taxable and are therefore already in base income. The tax on this income would also be included in personal tax. We are not able to identify these assets so do not account for this, although we consider the amount would not be large relative to total portfolio domestic equities. However, this could lead to some overestimation of income and an underestimation of ETRs. PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 75 10.27 For trusts, no additional tax is included for the asset class portfolio ETRs. This is because only non-taxed income is included, given that taxed amounts could be distributed as beneficiary income. 10.28 As trustee taxable income, and the associated trustee tax, is included in the all- income ETR (chapter 12), dividends, interest and overseas taxable income of the trust and associated tax are included in the all-income ETR to the extent they have not been paid out as beneficiary income. Data sources 10.29 Information on the value of portfolio financial assets was sought from the Project population through the Financial Collection. Disclosures were subject to reporting thresholds. In particular, the Project population were able to round their portfolios to the nearest $500,000. This is a further reason the estimates in this report are approximations rather than precise estimates of portfolio income. 10.30 Tax administration data is used for taxable investment income (interest, dividends and overseas income). 10.31 Market returns are sourced from S&P Global Broad Market Index (international equities), S&P Global Developed Aggregate Ex-Collateralized Bond Index (International Bonds) and S&P/NZX 50 Index (domestic equities). Portfolio compositions are sourced from the Reserve Bank Managed Funds Survey. Table 10.2 provides the portfolio compositions and table 10.3 provides the market returns. Information disclosed by the Project population 10.32 In the Financial Collection, the Project population were required to report the total market value of their portfolio financial assets each year. They were also asked to report any payments from, or contributions to, the portfolio each year. 10.33 Originally, our methodology was to calculate capital gains (and reinvested dividends/interest) on portfolio assets as the difference between the closing value and opening value of the portfolio each year after accounting for contributions and withdrawals. However, following analysis of the responses provided and further investigations, we did not have sufficient confidence in the data to use this approach. On review, the amounts of contributions and withdrawals disclosed were unreliable, and therefore the original approach was discarded and replaced by the market rate of return approach discussed above. Results Income 10.34 Figure 10.2 shows the annual amount of base income (minus interest, dividends and overseas taxable income) and all elements of direct and trust portfolio income for all members of the responder population for each year. 10.35 In all years, trust portfolio income is notably higher than direct portfolio income. This is because substantially more portfolio assets are held in trust than directly (see table 15.1). The 2021 tax year saw high income due to high capital gains on equities that year. PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 76 Figure 10.2 Portfolio income value compared with base income value for family Effective tax rates (ETRs) 10.36 The same ETRs are calculated for each of the portfolio ETRs as for the base income ETR (that is, annual, Project period, and Project period population). 10.37 As the trust attribution methodology applies on a family basis, trust portfolio income has been grouped by family. As such, the following ETRs will mainly focus on the family rather than Individual A. For all ETR measures, income is base income plus portfolio income unless otherwise stated. Annual portfolio ETR 10.38 Figure 10.3 shows the median annual base income ETR (on average, 29% across the six-year period) compared to the median annual all-portfolio ETR for the family unit. 10.39 Over the Project period, the family median annual all-portfolio ETRs vary between 6.1% and 22.9%. There is an increase in the ETR in 2020 due to lower returns that year (at 3.1 percent for the portfolio). The ETR then declines significantly for 2021, due to high returns on financial assets in this year (at 18.1 percent for the portfolio). , , , , , Income value millions Tax year Income by type portfolio income family responders ase income less dividends, interest and overseas income Direct portfolio income dividends, interest and capital gains Trust portfolio income dividends, interest and capital gains PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 77 Figure 10.3 Median annual all-portfolio ETR for the family Project period portfolio ETR 10.40 The family median Project period ETRs for both types of portfolio income are lower than base income, being 27.4% for the direct portfolio ETR (28.2% for Individual A) and 16.3% for the trust portfolio ETR. This is consistent with portfolio income earned through trusts being larger than direct holdings. 10.41 The family median Project period all-portfolio ETR (that is, combining direct and trust portfolio income) is 13.4%. The family median base income ETR for this measure is 30.1%.

The decline in the ETR is due to capital gains that are not taxed. 10.43 The trust portfolio income ETR on this measure declines more than the direct portfolio ETR. This is due to higher income being derived from portfolio income in trusts than from direct holdings.

PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 80 CHAPTER 11 BUSINESS ENTITIES Introduction 11.1 This chapter examines income accruing to the Project population from ownership of listed and unlisted business entities over the Project period. It presents asset class effective tax rates (ETRs) assuming income is comprised of annual net income and economic income (and associated tax) from ownership of business entities (business entity ETR). 11.2 The population for this chapter is the responder population. 11.3 As discussed previously, the ownership of financial assets (including equity in businesses) is concentrated in the top net worth decile in New Zealand (and within the top decile, within the top percentile). Some international studies find that business income is much more important to the top 1 percent, and especially 0.1 percent, of income earners than to those with lower income. Other studies find that owner-managers of high-profit closely held companies retain considerable amounts of profit in their companies each year, which is eventually realised as a capital gain (such as Delestre et al. 2022). We also find that business income is significant for the Project population. Included assets 11.4 This chapter includes income (and tax) from ownership interests in listed and unlisted business entities (companies and trading trusts) that the Project population held either directly or indirectly over the Project period. Income from business entities that are companies held in trusts is also included. 11.5 Income and tax from companies and trading trusts meeting the following criteria are included: ▪ for a company, the company is a New Zealand registered company that had gross assets greater than $1,000,000, and/or taxable income greater than $1,000,000, for any year of the Project period and the family, together with trusts, had a total direct and/or indirect ownership interest exceeding 10 percent of the total ownership interests in the company for any year in the Project period, and ▪ for a trading trust, a member of the family was a settlor, appointer or beneficiary, the trust was registered for GST at some point during the Project period and the trust had more than $100,000 of business income. 11.6 Unlisted entities meeting these criteria, but identified as being land-rich, are valued using the real property methodology and are not included in this chapter. Interests in companies below the thresholds in paragraph 11.5 are included as portfolio financial assets. Listed companies meeting the thresholds in paragraph 11.5 are included in this chapter. This is a subset of the companies included in the listed company ETR in chapter 13. 11.7 The total number of entities identified and included in the methodology in this chapter or chapter 9 is 2,695. Of these, 550 were identified as being land-rich entities. PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 81 11.8 Capital gains from business assets held as a sole trader or via a general or limited partnership are not included in business entity income. If an individual is a partner, the share of the partnership’s taxable income returned by that partner will be included within the individual’s base income. However, if the partnership has real property, the capital gains on that property are included in the property ETRs and the all-income ETR. This applies similarly for sole traders. 11.9 Companies that meet the above criteria but are foreign companies, for example, controlled foreign companies (CFCs), have not been included within the ETR. 81 This is due to a lack of information on how much tax was paid by such companies. Individuals who report owning an interest in a CFC must complete a disclosure. Review of these disclosures indicated that members of the Project population hold minimal direct interests in CFCs. 11.10 The following ETRs are calculated: ▪ personal business entity ETR (this includes income and associated tax from direct and indirect holdings of companies), ▪ trust entity ETR (this includes income and associated tax from trading trusts and companies held in trust). 11.11 These income and tax sources are combined for calculating the all-business entity ETR. Methodology 11.12 To calculate the business entity ETRs, we start with the base income ETR presented in chapter 8 (personal tax assessed/annual net income) and add in capital gains, untaxed distributions and tax from business entities. The all- business entity ETR includes income and tax from all business entities meeting the inclusion criteria. 11.13 The all-business entity ETR is: 푃푒푟푠표푛푎푙 푡푎푥 푎푠푠푒푠푠푒푑+ 푎푡푡푟푖푏푢푡푒푑 푒푛푡푖푡푦 푡푎푥−푖푚푝푢푡푎푡푖표푛 푐푟푒푑푖푡푠 퐴푛푛푢푎푙 푛푒푡 푖푛푐표푚푒+ 푐푎푝푖푡푎푙 푔푎푖푛푠 푓푟표푚 푒푛푡푖푡푖푒푠+푢푛푡푎푥푒푑 푑푖푠푡푟푖푏푢푡푖표푛푠+ 푎푡푡푟푖푏푢푡푒푑 푒푛푡푖푡푦 푡푎푥− 푖푚푝푢푡푎푡푖표푛 푐푟푒푑푖푡푠 11.14 The personal business entity and trust entity ETRs are calculated in the same way, but only include income and tax from the entities noted in paragraph 11.10. These subcomponents allow us to see which type of business entity income is more significant in the reduction in the ETR from the base income ETR to the all-business entity ETR. 11.15 Companies (both listed and unlisted) that are held via a trust, and trading trusts, will have their income and tax attributed to the family in accordance with the trust attribution methodology. Business entity income 11.16 Business entity income is the sum of the distributions received from the entity by Individual A or the family plus both accrued and realised capital gains from equity interests held in the entity during the Project period. As taxable distributions (including beneficiary income) are already included in base income, only non-taxed distributions and capital gains are added to base income/annual 81 As noted in chapter 6, income from offshore subsidiaries of listed companies will be picked up in the value of the listed company as stock market prices are used. PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 82 net income. The tax of the entity (not including amounts distributed as imputation credits or tax withheld by the trustee on beneficiary income that are already included in base income) is also added to income to ensure a gross income measure is used. 11.17 The distributions already included in annual net income are: ▪ Gross dividends (for businesses held in companies). ▪ Owner’s basis look-through company (LTC) income (for businesses held in companies with LTC status). ▪ Gross beneficiary income (for businesses operating through a trading trust). 11.18 For listed business entities, capital gains are calculated as set out in chapter 13. 11.19 The annual capital gain of an unlisted business entity is derived by calculating the annual change in value of the individual’s or trust’s equity interest. This is discussed below. Calculating the equity value of unlisted entities 11.20 Unlisted business entities do not have publicly available market valuations. Consequently, unlisted entities have been valued based on financial statement information held by Inland Revenue. A comparable company multiple method (described below) is used to calculate the business value of the entity. This is based on the entity’s earnings, revenue, or book value. This method seeks to provide a reasonable, rather than precise, estimate of business value. 11.21 The broad premise of this method is that private companies with similar financial characteristics to comparable publicly listed companies can be valued based on a similar ratio (multiple) of price to earnings, revenue, or book value. The multiple will be influenced by expectations as to the economic or industry outlook, with the multiple being higher if the economic outlook is improving. 11.22 Entities are valued in one of three ways. Each of these methods applies a comparable multiple, sourced from data on publicly listed companies, to each entity’s earnings, revenue or book value to calculate the entity’s total value or equity value. These methods apply sequentially (that is, the first in the list that can be applied is the test used): ▪ When an entity had positive EBITDA 82 for all six years, an enterprise value to E ITDA multiple is applied to the entity’s E ITDA to calculate the entity’s total value. This method is used for 37 percent of business entities. ▪ When an entity had positive revenue for all six years, an enterprise value to revenue multiple is applied to the entity’s revenue to calculate the entity’s total value. This method is used for 16 percent of business entities. ▪ Finally, a market value to book value multiple is applied to the entity’s book value of net assets to calculate the entity’s equity value. This method is used for the remaining 48 percent of business entities. 82 Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 83 11.23 The applicable comparable multiple has been determined for each entity based on the entity’s Business Industry Classification code. It therefore represents an average multiple for an entity in that industry. Where an industry does not have a comparable multiple, we use an average of all industry multiples (this was the case for 19 percent of entities). As the average for all industries is lower than the average multiple for entities in our population, this is likely to be a conservative assumption. 11.24 When an EBITDA or revenue multiple is used, once the total business value is calculated, we then calculate the value of equity of the unlisted business entity. This is done by subtracting debt from, and adding cash to, the business value. In essence, net debt is removed from the business value as net debt reduces the value of the business for a prospective purchaser. 11.25 For all methods used, an illiquidity discount is then applied to the estimated value of equity. This illiquidity discount recognises that the private entity is unlikely to be readily sold in the open market. This warrants a discount to be attached to the valuation. A discount of 25% is applied. This means that once the equity value is calculated, it is multiplied by 0.75 to get the estimated value of the equity. 83 11.26 An individual’s, or trust’s, 84 equity value is then calculated based on their percentage ownership (or the trust attribution factor for a trading trust). Each family member’s equity interest is summed to derive values for the family. 11.27 When looking at indirect holdings of entities, that is, group structures, it is each individual entity (meeting the criteria in paragraph 11.5) within the group that is valued rather than the consolidated group. Some adjustments are required for group structures to ensure income from an indirect investment is not double counted. Intra-group dividends derived from subsidiaries are removed from earnings when the company is valued; similarly, the value of subsidiaries included in a business’s book value is removed. Tax 11.28 The annual tax included in the business entity ETR numerator is the sum of personal tax assessed plus the individual’s or trust’s attributed company tax, or tax paid by a trading trust. 11.29 Company tax is attributed proportionately to the individual’s or trust’s ownership interest of a company. Where company ownership interests are held via a trust, the trust’s ownership interest is then multiplied by the family trust attribution factor. 11.30 For trading trusts, the tax is attributed based on the total trustee tax of the trust (not including tax withheld by the trustee on beneficiary income) multiplied by the family trust attribution factor. Any tax paid on beneficiary income will be included in tax on personal taxable income. 11.31 For unlisted companies, only domestic tax is included (consistent with capital gains from foreign subsidiaries not being included). Where a company is owned by an individual, company tax is reduced by imputation credits paid. This ensures there is no double counting of company tax, as imputation credits attached to dividends received by the individual are already included in personal 83 Estimates generally vary from 15 to 35% (Damodaran, 2006). 84 For a company held in trust, both the trustee ownership interest in the company and the family trust attribution factor are applied. PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 84 tax. Where a company is held in trust, company tax is not reduced by imputation credits paid for the business entity ETRs. This is because trustee tax (including imputation credits received) is not included within the business entity ETRs. However, for the all-income ETR, trustee tax is included in the ETR. Therefore, imputation credits are removed from company tax for both direct and trust holdings in the all-income ETR. 11.32 For listed companies, domestic and foreign tax are included (calculated as set out in chapter 13). Foreign tax is included as these companies are valued based on their market share price, which includes the value of foreign subsidiaries. 11.33 The following tax items are already included in personal tax: ▪ Imputation credits attached to dividends. ▪ Resident withholding tax attached to dividends or interest. ▪ Tax on look-through company income, which is ordinarily paid at the shareholder level. ▪ Tax on beneficiary income. Data sources 11.34 Information was collected on the Project population’s ownership of business entities in the Entity Collection. Some supplemental financial information was collected in the Financial Collection. This has been joined with financial information from tax administration data to calculate the value of unlisted business entities. The valuation of listed business entities is based on stock exchange data (chapter 13). 11.35 Industry-comparable multiples were sourced from S&P Capital IQ Pro. Developed capital markets in the Asia-Pacific, Europe and North America regions are used to ensure the population size for comparable data is sufficiently large. 11.36 Information was collected on share sales for the purpose of calculating realised capital gains. However, given the small number of sales and following review of the data quality, this information was deemed unreliable. For this reason, no estimate of realised gains for unlisted entities is made. Results Income 11.37 Figure 11.1 shows the annual amount of base income and additional 85 personal business entity income (that is, income from direct and indirect company holdings) and trust entity income (that is, income from trading trusts and companies held in trust). It also shows all-business entity income, additional to base income, for all members of the responder population. 11.38 Base income is comparatively small compared to business entity income. Trust entity income is generally greater than personal business entity income, with about 55% of all business entities of the Project population being in trust. 85 That is, gross capital gains and untaxed distributions. PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 85 11.39 Business entity income is considerably more volatile than other forms of income, ranging from -$900 million in 2019 to $9,000 million in 2021. The significant increase in business entity income from 2020 to 2021 is in part due to an increase in the comparable multiples used when valuing the business entities annually. For example, the average book value multiple used increased from 1.69 in 2020 to 1.79 in 2021. Growth in business fundamentals also contributed to this increase in business entity income, with those firms valued using an earnings-multiple on average increasing their earnings by 10% from 2020 to 2021, the highest annual growth rate during the Project period. Figure 11.1 Business entity income value compared with base income value for family Effective tax rates (ETRs) 11.40 The same ETRs are calculated for the business entity ETRs as for the base income ETR (that is, annual, Project period and Project period population). 11.41 As the trust attribution methodology applies on a family basis, trust entity income has been grouped by family. As such, the following ETRs mainly focus on the family rather than Individual A. For all ETR measures, income is base income plus business entity income unless otherwise stated. Annual business entity ETR 11.42 Figure 11.2 shows the median annual base income ETR (on average, 29% across the six-year period) compared to the median annual all-business entity ETR for the family unit. 11.43 Over the Project period, the family median annual all-business entity ETRs vary between 2.2% and 9.7%. This declines over the period, with 2019 to 2021 seeing lower ETRs than prior years for the median person. , , , , , , Income value millions Tax year Income by type usiness entity family responders ase income Personal business entity Trust entity All business entities PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 86 Figure 11.2 Median annual all-business entity ETR for family Project period business entity ETR 11.44 The family median Project period all-business entity ETR is 12.8%. This is significantly lower than the base income ETR on this measure of 30.1%. There is a wide range between the upper quartile, of 28.2%, and the lower quartile of 1.8% (50 percent of the Project population fall in this range). 11.45 We do not show the median Project period personal business entity and trust entity ETRs as families often held business assets either directly or in trust and the median person in these ETRs either did not hold the asset or held only a low value of the asset. Figure 11.3 Project period business entity ETR for the family Project period population business entity ETR (population weighted-mean ETR) 11.46 Table 11.1 shows all Project period population business entity ETRs are significantly below the same measure of the base income ETR.

This is because capital gains earned through entities held in trust are larger than capital gains earned from entities not held in trust.

This aggregates all sources of an individual’s or family’s economic income. It starts with base income and then adds all additional income from ownership of real property, portfolio investments and business entities included in the asset class ETRs. The methodology for each of these income components is covered in previous chapters. 12.2 In addition to the income sources included in the asset class ETRs, the all- income ETR includes trustee taxable income and trustee tax (this is in addition to the capital gains on the assets in trust included in the asset class ETRs). At an aggregate level, we can identify income taxed as trustee income and income distributed and taxed as beneficiary income (which is included in base income). However, as discussed in chapter 7, this cannot be done for specific income sources and hence the asset class ETRs do not include any element of trustee taxable income or trustee tax. 86 12.3 The population for this chapter is the responder population. 12.4 The taxes attributable to each income source, set out in paragraph 6.27, have been included in the all-income ETR. That is, personal income tax, company tax on non-portfolio holdings and trustee tax. When company tax is included as tax, company tax that is distributed as imputation credits is not included. This avoids double counting as personal tax includes amounts met with imputation credits. 12.5 When capital gains from business entities are included in income, the individual’s, or family’s, share of tax of the entity is added to income to ensure that a gross income measure is used. The amount of tax added is net of company tax distributed as imputation credits. This avoids double counting, given that base income is gross of imputation credits. 12.6 Table 12.1 summarises the individual components that make up the income (denominator) as well as the tax (numerator) in the all-income ETR. 12.7 Note, however, that if the beneficiary-only test applies for trust interests, the trust attribution factor is zero (meaning that the trustee income and capital gains on assets in trust are not attributed to the family). In this case, untaxed trust distributions received by the family are included in their income. This is in addition to taxable beneficiary income that is already included in base income. 12.8 The Project period and Project period population all-income ETRs are presented both with and without an estimate of: ▪ the imputed rental on owner-occupied housing (see chapter 9), and ▪ the amount of GST estimated to have been paid by the family. 86 As discussed in chapters 9 and 11, trading trusts are treated like business or land-rich entities and income and tax included accordingly.

PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 90 Results Income and tax 12.9 Figure 12.1 shows the annual amount of base income compared with additional income from each category: property, portfolio, business entities and trustee income. It also shows all income categories combined (with and without imputed rental). This is for all members of the responder population for each year. Note, base income and trustee income include taxable elements of income from the asset categories, such as interest, dividends and rental income, and therefore these taxable income elements are not included in the all-property, portfolio and business entities income categories. 12.10 Excluding 2021, base income is around $300 million per year for the Project population. The annual economic income of the Project population varies from $1,000 million in 2017 to $14,600 million in 2021. 12.11 The median family economic income for 2018 is around $8 million and the median tax on this income is around $642,000. The mean family economic income for 2018 is around $22 million and the mean tax on this income is around $1.4 million. The tax included in these figures is personal, company and trustee tax, but not GST. In comparison, the median family taxable income for 2018 is around $350,000, with tax of around $98,000, and the mean family taxable income is around $976,000, with tax of around $308,000. 12.12 In the 2021 income year, income was relatively high. This was due to higher base income from higher payments of dividends and shareholder salary (this is 3% of the gain from 2020 to 2021) and, to a much greater extent, higher asset price appreciation of property, portfolio and business entity assets. As discussed in chapter 11, asset price appreciation for business entities in this year was in large part due to a buoyant, low interest rate environment resulting in higher valuations (through an increase in the comparable multiples). Improvement in business financials from 2020 to 2021 also contributed to the capital gain. Figure 12.1 All-income values for Project population 12.13 Figure 12.2 shows the composition of the Project population’s income over the six-year Project period.

Figure 12.2 shows that 7 percent of the Project population’s economic income is from base income and 10 percent from taxable trustee income. Capital gains and other income from business entities is particularly significant, being just over 50 percent of economic income over the Project period. Figure 12.2 Income sources as a percentage of economic income for responder families 2016-2021 income years 12.14 Across the Project period, 67 percent of economic income was earned through a trust (excluding beneficiary income included in base income). This includes trustee income (which is 10 percent of economic income) and capital gains from property 89 , portfolio and business entity assets in trust. Untaxed trust distributions, included in economic income when the beneficiary only test is met, were only 0.1 percent of economic income. 12.15 Figure 12.3 below shows the annual amount of personal tax, company tax and trustee tax attributed to the Project population. We classify personal tax met with imputation credits as personal tax, so company tax is reduced by imputation credits distributed. 12.16 For the first five years, the proportions of tax by type are relatively constant. On average 21 percent of tax was paid by individuals, 38 percent by companies and 40 percent by trustees over the 2016 to 2020 income years. 90 In 2021, prior to the increase in the top personal tax rate to 39%, tax paid by individuals and trusts more than doubled while company taxation more than halved. 91 The total tax (excluding GST) increased from $436 million in the 2016 income year to $511 million in the 2020 income year, showing there was an increasing trend even without the 39% rate increase. 92 12.17 The amount paid in GST is also included in figure 12.3. This was estimated based on survey data, using responses to questions on the families’ expenditure during the 2019 income year. 93 The GST amount for the 2019 income year is 89 Taxable income (less distributions) from land-rich entities held in trust is also included. 90 This is as a proportion of personal, company and trustee tax. 91 Company tax attributed goes down in 2021 because of the large amount of imputed dividends paid. 92 Total personal, company and trustee tax were $764 million in the 2021 income year. 93 As discussed in chapter 14, following accuracy checks, 56 of 324 family responses to the expenditure questions were discarded. For this chapter, the median GST amount for the remaining families ($32,935) was used as an estimate for the families whose responses were discarded. ase income and other income for responder families April arch ase income Trustee income attributed Other portfolio income Other property income Other business entity income PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 92 used for all years. GST is small compared to the other sources of tax, being $14.5 million per year for the Project population. Figure 12.3 All tax values for Project population Effective tax rates (ETRs) 12.18 The same ETRs are calculated for the all-income ETRs as for the base income ETRs (that is, annual, Project period and Project period population). 12.19 As the trust methodology applies on a family basis, trust income has been grouped by family. As such, family ETRs include trust income (trustee income and capital gains on trust assets) and tax, when applicable. Individual measures do not include trustee income and trust capital gains or trustee tax. However, beneficiary income is included in both measures. This means that the family measures are the more comprehensive measure. 12.20 The all-income ETRs do not include imputed rental income unless otherwise stated. Annual all-income ETR 12.21 Figure 12.4 below shows the median annual base income ETR (on average, 30% for Individual A and 29% for the family across the six-year period) compared to the median annual all-income ETR for Individual A and the family. 12.22 The median annual all-income ETRs for both Individual A and the family are significantly lower (on average by 19.8 and 24.1 percentage points, respectively) than the median annual base income ETR. The median annual all- income ETR for Individual A ranges from 6.1% to 12.8%, while for the family it is between 3.5% and 6.7%. 12.23 The family median annual all-income ETR is, on average, 5 percentage points lower than Individual A’s. However, the difference is largely driven by the inclusion of trust income (capital gains on assets and trustee income) and tax in the family measure. 12.24 When imputed rental is added to the annual all-income family ETR, the median is, on average, 0.02 percentage points lower. Tax value millions Tax year Tax values by type family responders PersonalCompanyTrust T PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 93 12.25 Adding GST paid to the all-income tax component increases the ETR. The median annual all-income ETR plus GST, for the family, ranges from 3.9% to 7.6% when imputed rent is also included in income. Figure 12.4 Median annual all-income ETR for Individual A and family Project period all-income ETR 12.26 As with the annual ETR, the median Project period all-income ETR is significantly lower than the base income ETR on the same measure. The median value for Individual A and the family is 12.9% and 9.3%, respectively, compared with the base income ETR at 30.9% and 30.1%. 94 As with the annual measures, only the family measures include income earned, and tax paid, through trusts. 12.27 When imputed rental is included, the median Project period all-income ETR for the family is 8.9% (0.4 percentage points less). When GST is added to tax, the median Project period all-income ETR (including imputed rental in income) for the family is 9.5%. The median Project period all-income ETR is 0.5 95 percentage points higher when GST is included. 12.28 When considering transfer income as a negative tax for the Project period all- income ETR, the Project period ETR decreases to 8.6% from 8.9% (0.3 percentage points). When both GST and transfer income are considered in the numerator, the Project period ETR is 9.4%, compared to 9.5% when transfer income is not included (a difference of 0.1 percentage points). 94 The annual median is often lower than the Project period median. This is because, on an individual basis, untaxed gains and relative tax on economic income tend to be unevenly distributed across years. Many individuals with high economic income for the period have outlier years, with high tax relative to income. Having many individuals with outlier years has an upward effect on the Project period median ETR, but the effect is muted on an annual basis if the outliers are distributed across the period. 95 This figure is based on rounding the compared ETRs at 2 decimal places.

The family ETR for this measure, excluding imputed rental from income, is 9.9%. The inclusion of imputed rental and GST only makes a small difference to the results, as does deducting transfer income from the tax (the numerator). 12.30 For the Project population transfer income is only .1 percent of economic income. Further, economic income (capital gains and imputed rental) from owner-occupied housing is small compared to total economic income. If transfer income (and tax), capital gains on owner-occupied housing and imputed rental is removed from the population ETR for 2018, the ETR reduces from 6.42% to 6.41%.

It shows the base income ETR on this measure is 32.1%, and when all sources of economic income are included this ETR reduces to 9.8%, being the population all-income ETR (figures in this section include imputed rental and exclude GST). 12.32 The all-property, all-portfolio and all-business entity ETRs are asset class ETRs that only include one component of income in addition to base income (see Box 3 – referred to as all-x ETRs below). These ETRs can be compared to each other to determine which income source has the biggest impact on the reduction from the base income ETR to the all-income ETR. 96 Figure 12.6 shows that each asset class has a similar impact in reducing the ETR from the base income ETR. 12.33 While income from business entities is the biggest income source (see figure 12.2), as the business entity ETR includes entity tax, business entities have a similar impact on the ETR to the other income sources. Business entity tax divided by business entity income (outside of base income) is 9 percent. While property income is larger than portfolio income, property in land-rich entities bears tax, whereas additional portfolio income does not, resulting in similar population level ETRs for these income sources. Land-rich entity tax divided by property income (outside of base income) is 4 percent. 97 12.34 The all-income ETR includes trustee income and tax, whereas the asset class ETRs do not. Without trustee income and tax (which has an ETR of 33%), the all-income ETR would have been lower at 8.2%. This is shown with the “all- income other than additional trust income and tax” ETR. 98 Figure 12.6 Comparison of Project period population ETRs 96 As base income is included in each all-x ETR, the ETRs themselves are not added together to determine the all-income ETR. Rather the all-income ETR adds each income source to base income. The all-income ETR is lower than each all-x ETR as tax is spread across a greater amount of income. 97 Tax on income outside of personal taxable income and trustee income is 6.2% of other income excluding imputed rental and untaxed trust distributions. 98 Trading trust tax is included as trading trusts are treated as business entities. Untaxed trust distributions are also removed in this ETR. PART THREE: ECONOMIC INCOME ETRs OVER THE PROJECT PERIOD Page | 96 12.35 Table 12.3 shows each component of the all-x ETRs (for example, for portfolio holdings, direct and trust portfolio holdings). Like the above discussion of the all-x ETRs, the components can be compared to determine which component has the biggest impact on the all-x and all-income ETR. For example, for portfolio income, portfolio assets in trust can be seen to have a bigger impact on the all-portfolio and all-income ETRs than directly held portfolio assets, as trust portfolio assets result in an 18.5 percentage points reduction in the ETR versus 10 percentage points for direct holdings. 99 Table 12.3 Comparison of all Project period population ETRs Type of income All responders Base income 32.1% All-property ETR (excluding imputed rental) Income included in ETR denominator: base income, direct property, land-rich entity, trust property 11.5% Direct property ETR 24.3% Land-rich entity ETR 15.9% Trust property ETR 18.8% All-property plus imputed rental ETR 11.0% All-portfolio ETR Income included in ETR denominator: base income, direct portfolio, trust portfolio 11.4% Direct Portfolio ETR 22.1% Trust portfolio ETR 13.6% All-business entity ETR Income included in ETR denominator: base income, personal business entity, trust entity 11.6% Personal business entity ETR 17.3% Trust entity ETR 12.1% All-income ETR Income included in ETR denominator: all the above sources plus trustee income (excluding imputed rental) 9.9% All-income plus imputed rental ETR 9.8% All-income plus imputed rental plus GST ETR 10.1% 99 As above, the component ETRs are not summed to form the all-x ETRs as each component ETR includes base income.

This sequentially adds each of the income categories, and associated tax, to the ETR, starting with the base income ETR. This graph cannot be used to determine the relative magnitude of each income source (property, portfolio and business entity income) to reduce the ETR as the impact each additional income source has on the ETR depends on the order in which income sources are added. 12.37 The order used is: ▪ Base income (personal tax). \[A\] ▪ Base income plus business entity income (personal tax, company tax, trading trust tax). \[B\] ▪ Base income plus business entity and property income (personal tax, company tax including tax from land-rich entities, trading trust tax). \[C\] ▪ Base income plus business entity, property, and portfolio income (personal tax, company tax including tax from land-rich entities, trading trust tax). \[D\] ▪ All income, which includes the above categories plus trustee income and non-taxable trust distributions if the beneficiary only test applies (personal tax, company tax including from land-rich entities, trustee tax including from trading trusts). \[E\] 12.38 The ETR increase from step D to step E is due to the inclusion of trustee income and tax (which will have an ETR of 33% in itself).

It presents asset class effective tax rates (ETRs) assuming income is comprised of annual net income and economic income (and associated tax) from significant holdings in listed companies (listed company ETR). 13.2 In this chapter, income and ETRs are calculated over the periods from 2004 to 2021 and from 2008 to 2020. These periods are longer than the Project period used in Part 3, that is, 2015 to 2021. Income from non-portfolio listed company holdings (that is, holdings over 10 percent) earned over the Project period is included in the business entity ETRs and the all-income ETRs in Part 3. 13.3 There are three reasons why SHLCs are presented separately from other business entity holdings: ▪ the data used for the listed company ETRs is more accurate than the data used to estimate the ETRs of other entities, and therefore the results have a higher degree of reliability, ▪ a longer period is available for listed company data, allowing the life cycle of the company to be considered, and ▪ listed company holdings can be very large and provide a significant source of income. 13.4 The analysis in this chapter follows a similar methodology to the business entities chapter. However, there are a few differences between the business entities and SHLC methodologies. For the SHLC methodology: ▪ holdings may be below the 10 percent ownership threshold used for business entities, ▪ the period of analysis is longer, ▪ trust holdings are identified through stock exchange data rather than through collected information, 100 ▪ the analysis is based on Individual A, although it consolidates some family holdings where they are consolidated in stock exchange information (this is most likely where trust holdings are included), and ▪ the analysis covers individuals in the whole population who have SHLCs rather than being restricted to the responder population. 100 The trust attribution methodology is not applied in this chapter. For holdings through a trust, in effect a 100 percent attribution factor is applied. However, cross-checking against collected data suggests that this assumption is broadly correct. Cross-checking also suggests that most SHLCs by value are held in trust. PART FOUR: EXTENDED PERIOD, GST, INHERITANCES & WEALTH Page | 101 Included assets 13.5 Significant holdings in listed companies (SHLCs) are included. Listed company holdings will be SHLCs when, during the period analysed, an individual in the whole Project population was registered as a significant shareholder of a company listed on either the New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX) or a foreign stock exchange. We exclude holdings when the value of the individual’s holding is less than $1,000,000 for all years of the SHLC period. 13.6 In general, these individuals (together with their families and trusts) held at least 5 percent of the company. Alternatively, they may have been an office holder, in which case they may have owned a lower percentage of the company. Holdings through trusts and nominees are also included when they are consolidated in the stock exchange holdings data. 13.7 Forty-five members of the whole Project population (that is, 13 percent of the whole population of Individual As) were identified as having significant holdings in 44 different listed companies on the NZX or a foreign exchange. These individuals are the population for this chapter (the SHLC population). Methodology 13.8 To calculate the listed company ETR, we start with the base income ETR for the period (personal tax assessed/annual net income) and add in additional income and tax from SHLCs. 13.9 We calculate the listed company ETR as: 푃푒푟푠표푛푎푙 푡푎푥 푎푠푠푒푠푠푒푑+ 푎푡푡푟푖푏푢푡푒푑 푐표푚푝푎푛푦 푡푎푥− 푖푚푝푢푡푎푡푖표푛 푐푟푒푑푖푡푠 퐴푛푛푢푎푙 푛푒푡 푖푛푐표푚푒+ 푐푎푝푖푡푎푙 푔푎푖푛푠 푓푟표푚 푆퐻퐿퐶푠+ 푎푡푡푟푖푏푢푡푒푑 푐표푚푝푎푛푦 푡푎푥− 푖푚푝푢푡푎푡푖표푛 푐푟푒푑푖푡푠 13.10 SHLC income is the sum of dividends received from direct holdings 101 (these are already in annual net income) and the capital gain or loss (realised and unrealised) from owning shares in the listed company. Attributed company tax that is, the individual’s share of tax) is added to income to ensure that a gross income measure is used. Imputation credits are subtracted from company tax in the denominator to avoid double counting as they are already accounted for in annual net income. 102 13.11 Capital gains are calculated from stock exchange shareholding data. Capital gains are calculated by taking the individual’s holdings on the last day of the quarter multiplied by the change in share price over the next quarter. 103 Realised gains are included in capital gains through changes in holdings, with the sale valued at the end of quarter trading price. This assumes that trades are made at the closing price on the final day of the quarter. 13.12 In addition to personal tax, the listed company ETR numerator includes company tax proportionately attributable to the shares owned by the individual. 101 Both dividends, and the associated tax on them, for holdings through trusts will be understated in this chapter. However, as discussed in the sensitivity test section below, this only has a small impact on the ETR. Dividends paid to trusts and the tax on them are included in the all-income ETR which includes trustee income and tax. 102 The inclusion of company tax in the denominator made less than half a percentage point difference to the weighted-mean ETR. 103 We tested using the average price for the quarter rather than the end of quarter price. This had a maximum impact of 0.5 percentage points on the SHLC period measures but resulted in a larger reduction for the BCS period measures. Therefore, we only present average price results for the BCS period. PART FOUR: EXTENDED PERIOD, GST, INHERITANCES & WEALTH Page | 102 The company tax includes tax paid in New Zealand and foreign jurisdictions by the company consolidated with its subsidiaries. The company tax is reduced by imputation credits attached to dividends from the company that are derived by the individual. This prevents double counting of the company tax, as personal tax met with imputation credits is already included. 13.13 The calculation in this chapter is for the 17-year period 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2021 (the SHLC period). This period was chosen as it is the longest period for which we could obtain public data. A longer period is informative as companies may go through a life cycle. In the start-up or growth phase, taxable profits may be low but capital gains high. In the mature phase, taxable profits may be higher but capital gains lower. The longer period better allows the ETRs to take account of this life cycle and differences in the timing of capital gains and taxable income. A longer period also reduces the impact of short-term cyclical factors. To account for cyclical factors, we also use the 12-year period 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2020 to cover a single, full business cycle as a sensitivity test. We refer to this as the business cycle scenario (BCS) and the BCS period. 104 Data sources 13.14 Data on listed company holdings, prices and total company tax is sourced from stock exchange data from the S&P CapIQ database. Shareholding data is available for the last day of each quarter since 1 April 2004. Data on imputation credits is calculated from data sourced from the Bloomberg database. Results Income 13.15 Figure 13.1 presents the annual value of base income (that is, annual net income) plus SHLC income 105 , and the total annual tax (personal and company tax) on that income over the SHLC period. The BCS period is shaded. Over all the years of the SHLC period, the population earned a total of $671 million in base income. By comparison, realised and unrealised capital gains (gross of tax) earned through SHLCs totalled $6,022 million (that is, $6 billion). 106 13.16 Figure 13.1 shows there is no relationship between capital gains from the SHLCs and tax paid on an annual basis. It also shows that capital gains income is highly volatile, and there can be periods of gains and periods of losses. 104 A business cycle is defined here as the period from peak to peak in real GDP (Reddell, 2020, April 20). 105 Dividends are included in individuals’ base income so are not added again. For figure 13.1, base income is only included for years where the individual had a SHLC (when only these years are included, base income is $608 million across the SHLC period). The same approach is taken in calculating the ETRs. 106 This includes $179 million of attributed company tax to make the ETR based on gross income. PART FOUR: EXTENDED PERIOD, GST, INHERITANCES & WEALTH Page | 103 Figure 13.1 Income and tax included in listed company ETR Effective tax rates (ETRs) Base income ETR 13.17 The population weighted-mean base income ETR is 33% for the SHLC population over both the SHLC and BCS periods. Note, the SHLC period includes some years when the top personal tax rate was 38% or 39%. This explains why the base income ETR is higher than that in chapter 8. Annual listed company ETR 13.18 Figure 13.2 shows the median annual base income ETR compared to the median annual listed company ETR over the SHLC period (the BCS period is shaded). The median annual listed company ETR is volatile, being between -3.2% and 21.7% over the SHLC period. The impact of the reduction in the top personal tax rate in 2010, from 38% to 33%, can be seen in the base income ETR.

Figure 13.3 shows that, based on end of quarter prices, the median SHLC period listed company ETR is 13.4% and the median BCS period listed company ETR is 14.6%. The median BCS period listed company ETR is 12.3% when based on the average quarterly price. For both periods, around a third of the SHLC population had a period listed company ETR between 0% and 15%. Those with higher capital gains tended to have a lower ETR. 13.20 A low ETR occurs where a taxpayer earned significant capital gains compared to company profits. In these cases, using company profits as a tax base does not provide a good proxy for the income to the individual from capital gains. ETRs could also be negative. This occurs when the individual made negative capital gains in the period, but the company still paid tax. In addition, ETRs could be significantly above personal tax rates when capital gain income is low compared to corporate profits over the period. Figure 13.3 Period listed company ETRs Period population listed company ETR (population weighted-mean) 13.21 In this section, the ETR is calculated as the sum of the total tax relative to the sum of the total base plus SHLC income of the population over the period. Based on end of quarter prices, the SHLC period population listed company ETR is 9.9% and the BCS period population listed company ETR is 16.8% (the BCS period measure is 13.9% based on the average price for the quarter). This measure is relatively high for the BSC period as there were several individuals with relatively low income or losses in this period, reducing the total population income over the BCS period. 13.22 These results show that when the period of analysis is extended beyond the Project period, ETRs based on economic income continue to be lower than those based on personal taxable income. Sensitivity tests 13.23 The results presented in this chapter only include years where the individual was a tax resident and had an SHLC. As a sensitivity test, we also calculated ETRs Project period listed company ET C period C period PART FOUR: EXTENDED PERIOD, GST, INHERITANCES & WEALTH Page | 105 including all years in the period. This made minimal difference to the results, increasing the weighted-mean ETR by around 0.5 percentage points. 13.24 SHLCs are included in this chapter if the individual had a holding exceeding $1,000,000 in any year of the SHLC period. This assumption materially affects the median period ETR but not the weighted-mean ETR. Holdings below $1,000,000 have been excluded as they are portfolio holdings and are more appropriately included in the portfolio ETR along with other portfolio assets. For the excluded individuals, the absolute value of their capital gains on these holdings is minimal compared to their base income (around 2 percent). This means that the ETR, calculated per the methodology set out in this chapter, converges to the base income ETR for these individuals. 13.25 For this analysis, we identified holdings based on the whole population of Individual As. It is possible that in some cases joint holdings with partners are included, particularly for holdings through trusts. Therefore, we also provide a sensitivity test where we use the base income and personal tax assessed of the family. This made minimal difference to the results, increasing the ETR around 0.1 percentage points. 13.26 Finally, most SHLCs are held through a trust. Where the company pays a dividend to the trust, and that dividend is not distributed to the individual as beneficiary income, the dividend will not be included in our income measure. Similarly, the tax on that dividend will not be included in tax. We tested the effect of assuming all dividends were paid to trusts and not distributed as beneficiary income and attributing tax on these dividends. This had a small effect, reducing the median listed company ETR for the SHLC period by 0.5 percentage points and increasing the weighted-mean ETR by 0.3 percentage points. Realised capital gains on SHLCs 13.27 This section presents a calculation of realised capital gains on SHLCs. Realised capital gains are a subset of the $6 billion of total capital gains earned by the SHLC population over the SHLC period. To calculate realised capital gains, two methods were used: first-in-first-out (FIFO) and last-in-first-out (LIFO). The base year for the calculation is the later of the first year of the relevant period and the year of purchase. Consequently, results are biased towards estimating larger gains for later years, as these gains will be measured over a longer time. 13.28 FIFO is where the earliest purchases of shares are deemed to have been sold first when shares are sold. The purchase price is therefore the price paid for the earliest acquisition or the share price at the beginning of the period. LIFO is where the most recent purchases are deemed to be sold first. The purchase price is therefore the price paid for the most recent acquisition and, when that quantity is exhausted, the next most recent acquisition, or the share price at the beginning of the period if no unsold acquisitions since that time remain. 13.29 The total value estimated for realised capital gains for the SHLC population over the SHLC period (1 April 2004 to 31 March 2021) is $1,762,689,560 (FIFO) and $1,707,977,940 (LIFO). This is almost 30 percent of the total capital gains over the period. 13.30 For the Project period (1 April 2015 to 31 March 2021), the realised gains of the SHLC population total $926,353,560 (FIFO) and $925,533,620 (LIFO). This is based on a 2015 base valuation year and is around 23 percent of the total capital gains over the Project period. PART FOUR: EXTENDED PERIOD, GST, INHERITANCES & WEALTH Page | 106 CHAPTER 14 GST Introduction 14.1 This chapter looks at the impost of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), relative to both expenditure and income, across household income deciles. It is based on HES income or taxable income rather than economic income. It extrapolates results for the general population to the Project population. 14.2 GST is a form of value added tax (VAT). 107 In New Zealand, it is an important source of revenue for public finances, raising over a quarter of central government revenue. The incidence of VATs is thought to mainly fall on the consumer, increasing the price consumers pay for goods and services (Obeng, 2018). This gives rise to public discussion regarding the perceived regressivity of VATs and their impact on low-income households. In response, many countries have reduced rates of VAT on necessities, such as food. 14.3 In New Zealand, the GST has a broad base, with limited exemptions, and a single rate. Other tools, such as the progressive income tax and government transfers, are used to address income adequacy concerns. This minimises compliance and administrative costs arising from the GST system and raises significant revenue with a relatively low rate by international standards. 14.4 Alternative designs of the GST have been investigated for New Zealand. Thomas finds that reduced GST rates for necessities would have a progressive effect in New Zealand but would generally provide a greater absolute benefit to the rich rather than poor. Other measures, such as tax credits, were found to provide more targeted income support at lower fiscal cost (Thomas, 2015). 14.5 New Zealand does have some goods and services on which GST is not levied, such as certain financial services (for example, life insurance). As low- and high- income households have different consumption patterns, it is important to understand who benefits from items not being subject to GST. Further, as Perry (2019, p54) and Aziz (2012) note, a comprehensive analysis of the tax and transfer system needs to consider tax paid through both income tax and GST. 14.6 This chapter extends the analysis on the distributional impacts of GST to high- wealth households. In this chapter, GST is considered in isolation. The chapter uses income and expenditure data from the Household Economic Survey (HES) expenditure statistics (for the general population) and survey data on expenditure and taxable income (for the Project population) to estimate the GST-to-expenditure and GST-to-income ratios. 14.7 Neither HES nor taxable income are comprehensive measures of economic income. Further, as noted, a comprehensive analysis of the tax system should consider all major tax types. For this reason, we include GST, as calculated in this chapter, in a measure of the all-income ETR in chapter 12 in combination with other tax types. 107 For simplicity, the term GST is sometimes used to generally refer to VATs. PART FOUR: EXTENDED PERIOD, GST, INHERITANCES & WEALTH Page | 107 Assessing the distributional impacts of GST 14.8 Given that GST is levied on consumption, it is important to consider the base on which an assessment of the distributional impacts of GST should be made. Some studies assess the impacts of GST relative to current expenditure, while others use current income or both expenditure and income. Both bases are a proxy for the welfare or economic resources of the household. Adam et al. (2011) argues that as households can consume out of savings and borrowings, we would ideally measure the impact of consumption taxes over individuals’ lifetime resources. However, data on lifetime income and expenditure is not available and most studies are therefore based on current annual data. 14.9 The choice between an income or expenditure base will impact the outcome. When considered as a portion of annual income, VATs will appear regressive, that is, the tax is a higher proportion of the income of low-income than high- income households. However, when considered as a portion of expenditure, VATs generally appear broadly proportional or, in countries with reduced rates on necessities, slightly progressive (Thomas, 2022). 14.10 Both an income-based and an expenditure-based approach can be useful in providing a perspective on the impacts of GST. For this reason, we take both approaches in this chapter. The arguments for each approach are outlined below. 14.11 Proponents of the expenditure-based approach argue that the GST-to- expenditure ratio provides a better indicator of the lifetime distributional effects of GST (Adam et al., 2011; Thomas, 2015). This is because the GST-to-annual income ratio is significantly affected by savings and borrowings. Households that are currently high income tend to save a greater proportion of their income, and therefore typically have a low impost of GST relative to income. If the household eventually spends that saved income, for example, in retirement, it may then have a high impost of GST relative to income. As the level of expenditure is smoother than income over an individual’s lifetime, it is argued that the GST-to- expenditure ratio better measures the lifetime GST impost. 14.12 However, the GST-to-income ratio allows a combined analysis with direct taxes – allowing an assessment of the whole tax system. Proponents of an income- based approach also argue that liquidity constraints limit households’ ability to shift resources across time and thereby smooth expenditure (Gastaldi et al., 2017). 14.13 Further, higher income tends to be correlated with wealth. As wealthy individuals are more likely to pass on significant inheritances (and so have lower lifetime expenditure than income), their lifetime GST ratio relative to their income versus expenditure may differ significantly. 108 14.14 In terms of the incidence of GST, we follow the Mirrlees review (Crawford et al., 2010) and assume the incidence of GST falls fully on the consumer. 108 Black et al. (2022) shows for Norway that, on average, wealthy individuals leave significant inheritances while lower wealth deciles do not. The Mirrlees review (Crawford et al. 2010) noted that over a lifetime a uniform consumption tax is equivalent to a proportional tax on wage, transfer and profit income combined with a tax on initial assets and a subsidy to bequests. PART FOUR: EXTENDED PERIOD, GST, INHERITANCES & WEALTH Page | 108 Previous studies on New Zealand 14.15 Thomas (2020,2022) assessed the distributional impacts of VAT relative to annual income and expenditure for 27 OECD countries, including New Zealand (based on HES 2016). The results are plotted in figures 14.1 and 14.2 for the 10 income deciles. 14.16 The GST-to-income ratio for New Zealand follows a similar declining trend to that of other OECD countries. For the OECD average, the VAT-to-income ratio declines from around 10.4% in decile 2 to 6.9% in decile 10. 109 Figure 14.1 VAT-to-income ratio by income decile Source: Thomas (2020) Table 2, p26. 14.17 For the VAT-to-expenditure ratio, Thomas finds the ratio is generally broadly proportional or slightly progressive for OECD countries (due to reduced rates on necessities). However, for New Zealand, Thomas found a small degree of regressivity when ordered by income or expenditure. Figure 14.2 VAT-to-expenditure ratio by income decile Source: Thomas (2020) Table 3, p27. 109 Decile 1 incomes may not be representative of the resources of the individual (for example, if there is an annual loss). Hence, we compare decile 2 and 10.

We also cross-checked our approach by comparing results based on the HES 2015/2016 year for the general population to those of Thomas. 14.19 A difference in our approach is that our calculations for the general population are based on the decile median household income and expenditure, whereas Thomas used unit record data. This will make our approach less accurate. Despite that, our results were similar to those of Thomas for the 2015/2016 HES year, providing verification for the broad conclusions from the results for the general population. 14.20 We have extrapolated the results to also estimate the GST impost for the responder Project population. For that purpose, as part of the Financial Collection, we collected information on the expenditure of the Project population for the 2019 year. This provided insights on the Project population’s annual consumption expenditures and spending on goods and services that are GST exempt (or zero-rated), which allowed the assessment of their effective GST ratio. 14.21 Our results for both the GST-to-expenditure and GST-to-income ratios are presented by household (for the general population) and family (for the Project population) income deciles. 14.22 To estimate the GST impost, relative to expenditure and income, we needed to estimate the following: ▪ the consumption expenditure base, ▪ the income base, and ▪ consumption subject to GST (to estimate GST). Defining the expenditure base for the GST-to-expenditure ratio 14.23 To determine the expenditure base for the GST-to-expenditure ratio, we start with HES data on median household expenditure by income decile for the general population and survey data for the Project population. Following other literature, we then remove certain expenditures from the expenditure base to provide an unbiased comparison across income deciles. 110 We also tested the sensitivity of our estimates to the removal of these items. In our results the following are removed: ▪ Rent. This is removed for both the general and Project populations. This ensures that renters and owner-occupiers are treated equivalently. If we were to include rent, this could bias our expenditure base by inflating the expenditure of renters vis-à-vis owner-occupiers. This is because the HES does not include imputed rents on owner-occupied housing, which is the consumption benefit of housing accruing to owner-occupiers. ▪ Expenditures related to purchases of motor vehicles and the housing capital stock. These are removed as these items are large and purchased infrequently. Their inclusion could therefore distort the expenditure base. Ideally, for large durable items, the annual 110 For example, Thomas (2022) or Metcalf (1994). PART FOUR: EXTENDED PERIOD, GST, INHERITANCES & WEALTH Page | 110 consumption benefit would be included. However, we do not have data to estimate this. For housing, the inclusion of house purchases could also result in comparability difficulties in determining the GST embedded in rent and house purchases. 111 ▪ Expenditure on loan servicing and contributions to savings. For the general population, we remove interest payments, contributions to savings, fines, and money gifts, which are all items in HES expenditure. For the Project population, principal and interest payments on mortgages are removed (savings were not included in survey data). The argument for excluding these items is that they are not part of final consumption expenditure. The GST-to-expenditure ratio is sensitive to this exclusion, but it does not impact the GST-to-income ratio. Defining income for the GST-to-income ratio 14.24 For the GST-to-income ratio, we use median household disposable income by decile from HES for the general population. We estimate disposable income for the general population based on household gross income (individualised) less tax, which may overestimate income. 112 One caveat on the use of HES income is that as elements of it are self-reported, there is likely to be some under- reporting (Decoster et al., 2010). For the Project population, we calculate family disposable income from taxable income (that is, taxable income minus assessed taxes). 14.25 Disposable income is used, as consumption is out of after-tax income. Disposable income also reflects the redistributive effects of income taxes. 14.26 We expect that the differences between HES and taxable income, and between the definitions of family and household, have minimal material effect on our baseline results and the broad direction of the empirical evidence. HES income and taxable income both exclude capital gains and retained earnings from entities and trusts. We also believe that there is only a small difference between the HES definition of household and the definition of family for the Project, given the demographics of a typical Project population family (two individuals with the median age of Individual A of 68). It is reasonable to assume that the family usually forms a household in the context of the HES definition. Estimating the GST impost 14.27 The GST impost is estimated from HES data for the general population and from survey data for the Project population. We take median expenditures per decile for the general population (less the expenditure excluded from the expenditure base) and remove items that are either exempt from GST or zero-rated. 113 This 111 When a person purchases a new house from a GST-registered person, it is subject to GST. Used houses built after the introduction of GST would have had GST charged when they were originally sold by a GST- registered person, and improvements to the house since then were subject to GST. Rent is not directly subject to GST, but landlords cannot claim input tax credits on housing improvements or new housing they purchase. In this way, there is some “embedded” T in both renting and purchasing housing, whether it is brand new or already existing. 112 This is because we assume both adults in the family have the same income. If one individual had a higher income, then they would have a higher average tax rate. 113 Based on the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Excluding items that are exempt from GST may understate to some degree the GST paid on those items. This is because the seller of the good may have paid GST on the input costs despite being unable to charge GST on the sale of the output. This is distinct from items that are zero-rated, where the seller can claim an input tax credit on any GST paid on inputs while charging 0% GST on the sale of the output. PART FOUR: EXTENDED PERIOD, GST, INHERITANCES & WEALTH Page | 111 amount is then multiplied by the rate of GST to work out GST paid per decile. 114 For the Project population, we follow the same methodology based on their reported expenditure. 14.28 In estimating the tax burden, the following items were treated as GST exempt or zero-rated: international flights and overseas accommodation prepaid in New Zealand, 115 life insurance and fees for financial services, and residential rent. Further, interest payments, contributions to savings, money gifts, and fines are treated as GST exempt. For our main calculations, purchases of motor vehicles and housing purchases are not included in the calculation of the GST impost. Sensitivity test 14.29 We also estimate these ratios for high-income (top) earners (those above the median income for decile 10) without using survey data from the Project population. This allows us to test if the Project population’s characteristics are consistent with general trends. 14.30 To do this, we estimated the expenditure of top earners by modelling the relationship between income and expenditure for the general population and extrapolating this to high incomes. To generate the consumption income elasticity, we first estimated the amount each HES expenditure subclass (such as food, clothing) linearly increases as income increases across all income deciles. We use the constant elasticities estimated to project the expenditure on each subclass for top earners and sum this to estimate total expenditure for top earners. Our estimates are subject to caveats and statistically uncertain but in line with evidence from other studies (such as Fisher et al., 2019). 14.31 We multiplied the extrapolated expenditure by the GST rate to calculate the GST impost for the modelled top earners. We then calculated the GST ratios for top earners in the same manner as we did for the rest of the population. Caveats 14.32 This modelling is subject to several uncertainties and limitations. It is based on households or families, so it cannot be used to identify individual circumstances. It uses aggregate data and assumptions, which means the results are approximations and should be taken as indicative estimates only. The survey questions for the Project population were more general than those asked in the HES expenditure survey, making our data less granular than HES. 14.33 For the sensitivity test, the consumption income elasticities are considered constant over all income levels. This likely overestimates the amount of actual consumption expenditures made by top earners as consumption of some goods and services (such as food or clothing) may reach a point of satiation. 14.34 Survey data used for the Project population is subject to response error. Some data cleaning was required. For example, where families reported either total expenditure to be less than the sum of sub-components of expenditure or zero expenditure, the survey response was considered unreliable and not used. This exclusion reduced the number of observations to 268 (that is, 86 percent of the responder population). Further, in responding to the survey questions, the Project population were able to round their reported expenditure to the nearest $50,000. This makes the survey data less accurate than HES expenditure. In 114 The GST rate is 13% on gross expenditure (15% of net expenditure). 115 This category should also include expenditures on international flights and accommodation paid outside of New Zealand, but E doesn’t provide reliable data at the decile level, so it is omitted. PART FOUR: EXTENDED PERIOD, GST, INHERITANCES & WEALTH Page | 112 addition, expenditure information was only collected for a single year (2019). We assume that expenditure in this year is consistent with general expenditure trends for the Project population. This year was chosen as it was prior to any COVID lock-down. 14.35 There are differences in the data source used for the general population and the Project population. This reduces the accuracy of our results and may result in a level shift between the different data sources. Results GST-to-expenditure ratio 14.36 We find that the GST-to-expenditure ratio across HES income deciles in New Zealand is broadly proportional. However, it may be slightly regressive or progressive depending on the expenditure base chosen. Extrapolation of the GST-to-expenditure ratio to the Project population, based on either survey data or modelling for the sensitivity test, largely continues the proportional trend, with an average ratio of 10.2% for disposable income above $350,000. 14.37 Figure 14.3 shows the broadly proportional trend. In this figure, the items noted in paragraph 14.23 are excluded. 14.38 For both populations, the exclusion of cars and housing purchases made minimal difference to the GST-to-expenditure ratio. The results are sensitive to the exclusion of interest costs and contributions to savings from the expenditure base. For the general population, the ratio was broadly proportional when these items were excluded. However, as interest costs and savings are proportionately larger for higher income households, a regressive trend was observed when they were not excluded. 14.39 This result is as expected given the broad base of New Zealand’s T. Items not subject to GST are relatively small in relation to total expenditure. Figure 14.3 GST-to-expenditure including survey data Note: The reported results in figures 14.3 and 14.4 are based on three different survey datasets. For the general population, we used the HES 2018/2019 data. For the Project population, we used data for the 2019 reference period from a survey conducted in 2022.

Based on HES income, we find the GST-to-income ratio for decile 2 to be roughly twice as high as for decile 10. 14.41 When we modelled the GST-to-income ratio for top-income families for the sensitivity test, we found a continuation of the trend of a declining ratio. Based on survey data on expenditure from the Project population and taxable income, the declining trend largely continues. 14.42 However, there appears to be a small level shift in the ratio when we move from HES data to survey data. This may be due to the change in the data source. Alternatively, our data suggests that the expenditure of many high-wealth families may not be constrained by their taxable income. In other words, many high-wealth families reported spending more than their taxable income, likely spending from their stock of assets. This demonstrates that high-wealth families have considerable resources beyond their taxable income. 14.43 For the Project population, the GST-to-income ratio is sensitive to the exclusion of vehicle expenditures. The Project population tends to spend relatively more on cars than the general population. 116 Including these expenditures increases the GST-to-income ratio by 4.3 percentage points to 10.3 percent for the Project population families with taxable income below $400,000. 117 However, as noted, cars are excluded from our baseline estimate as they are durable goods. If the Project population had particularly high car purchases in 2019, the GST on cars will be overstated. Figure 14.4 GST-to-income including survey data Note: see Figure 14.3. 116 The expenditure survey revealed that in 2019 the Project population spent relatively more of their income on cars than an average New Zealand household surveyed in HES 2018/2019 (8.8% vs. 5.2% of their total expenditure); more on travel and financial services (16.6% vs 11.5%); less on housing (19.7% vs 23%); and less on other goods and services (54.8% vs. 60.5%). The differences between the two groups are statistically significant at standard confidence levels. 117 The $400,000 is the decile median when the Project population is divided into deciles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Decile Decile Decile Decile Decile Decile Decile Decile Decile Decile Project population T to income ousehold Family disposable income NZ T to income including survey data E esearch Project Thomas , ottom up extrapolation PART FOUR: EXTENDED PERIOD, GST, INHERITANCES & WEALTH Page | 114 CHAPTER 15 INHERITANCES AND WEALTH Introduction 15.1 This chapter provides information on significant amounts inherited or received in gifts by the Project population over a 50-year period. It also presents estimates of the wealth, or net worth, of the Project population. The purpose of this chapter is to provide further insight into the total level of net worth held at the top end of the net worth distribution and the ways in which net worth is accumulated. Inheritances 15.2 As noted by Delestre et al. (2022), there is considerable interest in the income inequality literature as to how intergenerational transfers may drive income or wealth inequality. In some countries, such as the UK, there is evidence that inherited wealth as a source of income has been increasing across generations, driven by a combination of increases in parental wealth and a reduction in the average number of siblings. However, in international studies, it is not clear that inheritances increase wealth inequality. Some studies find inheritances have a neutral effect on relative wealth inequality, partly because smaller inheritances at the bottom of the wealth distribution are still a relatively large share of the smaller wealth there. 15.3 For the reasons set out in chapter 6, we do not include gifts and inheritances in the calculation of ETRs. However, this chapter provides information on the amounts received in inheritances or gifts by the Project population. Information requested 15.4 We collected information on significant gifts and inheritances for the decades from the 1970s until 2020, a total of 50 years. This is a longer period than the Project period over which ETRs are estimated. A longer period was used as inheritances and significant gifts are generally received infrequently, if at all. 15.5 The Financial Collection asked for an estimate, for each decade from 1970, of the total nominal value of gifts and inheritances exceeding $25,000 received from relatives and rounded to the nearest $1,000,000. This included amounts received in trust distributions from testamentary trusts or trusts settled by a relative. This does not include amounts of undistributed income of the trust. No adjustment was made for inflation. 15.6 Due to the extended period and the above reporting thresholds, it was necessarily assumed that this would only provide an estimated picture of the inheritances and gifts received by the Project population. 15.7 Information on inheritances and gifts received in the previous 12 months is collected annually by Stats NZ for the general population via the Household Economic Survey. Stats NZ intends to collect a wider range of information from 2023 onwards. While there are differences in the information sought, this potentially provides some basis for comparison between the general and high- wealth population, but this is not work that the Project has undertaken. PART FOUR: EXTENDED PERIOD, GST, INHERITANCES & WEALTH Page | 115 Results 15.8 Sixty-six family units (21 percent of the responder population) declared an inheritance or gift. The total number of individual inheritances or gifts received by families is higher at 91, since some family units received more than one inheritance across the decades. 15.9 The total reported inheritances received by the Project population was $411 million over the 50-year period. Nearly 75 percent of that was received after 2010. In part this may be due to nominal (non-inflation adjusted) amounts being reported. In the decade from 2010 to 2020, 49 inheritances or gifts were disclosed. Eleven of these were for amounts over $5 million. 15.10 When measuring by family, the mean inheritance of those families who reported any gift or inheritance was $6.2 million over the entire 50-year period. 118 15.11 The median value of inheritances for those families is $1.3 million, indicating that a relatively small number of quite large inheritances have skewed the distribution of the data. 15.12 For those that inherited in the decade of the Project period, the mean inheritance was $6.7 million. We estimate that the total amount of inheritance reported for the Project period is 4.2 percent of the economic income received by this group during the six-year Project period. 119 Figure 15.1 Total and mean inheritance by decade for family 118 The mean and median exclude values less than $10,000. 119 As inheritance was reported by decade, to undertake this estimate we have reduced total inheritance in the 2010 decade by a factor of 0.6. ean inheritance millions Total inheritance millions Decade Total and mean inheritance by decade for family Total inheritance ean inheritance PART FOUR: EXTENDED PERIOD, GST, INHERITANCES & WEALTH Page | 116 Wealth 15.13 Tables 15.1 and 15.2 below show the mean and median estimated net worth of the responder family population for the 2015, 2018 and 2021 years. Net worth is an individual’s or household’s assets less liabilities. The tables provide approximations of net worth rather than precise estimates. 15.14 The net worth values in tables 15.1 and 15.2 have been estimated using the methodologies discussed in prior chapters. How real property has been valued is discussed in chapter 9. The value of portfolio assets is based on information collected in the Financial Collection. For entity holdings, we estimate the value of the families’ equity holding. For entities that are not land rich, we estimate the value of the families’ equity interest using the methodologies discussed in chapters 11 and 13. For land-rich entities, the equity value of the families’ holding is estimated by taking the gross value of the entities’ real property assets less the entities’ net debt, multiplied by the families’ ownership share. 15.15 There are some net worth data sources not available to the Project. For example, information on some foreign assets, such as overseas real estate, was not collected. Our figures omit the value of partnership equity in partnerships that are not land rich. However, given the small number of partnerships in our data (88 in total), we do not expect this omission to be material. Furthermore, collected information was subject to de minimis thresholds. 15.16 Furthermore, information on personal liabilities was not available to the Project for all asset categories. The main omission is liabilities in respect of direct and trust holdings of non-owner-occupied real property. (Figures are net of mortgages on owner-occupied property as this information was collected.) To account for this, we adjust the value of non-owner-occupied property, held directly or in trust, downwards by an assumed debt-to-asset ratio. The ratio we use is based on that of the top 5 percent of households by net worth in the relevant year’s E (see Appendix G, table G4). We assume portfolio assets are not debt financed or that a net figure has been disclosed. 15.17 For 2021, we estimate mean net worth to be $276 million. Mean total net worth is significantly higher than median total net worth, at $106 million in 2021. This is due to some families holding a significant amount of net worth compared to the rest of the Project population. 15.18 Table 15.3 shows the number and percentage of the responder population in certain net worth bands by year.

Both income and wealth, or net worth, contribute to material well-being. Households can consume either from income or from stores of wealth. The below framework, from Perry (2019), shows how both income and wealth provide resources for consumption, which contributes to material well-being. Other non-financial factors, such as environmental amenities, also impact on well-being. Figure A1 Income-wealth-consumption-material well-being framework 2. Income levels and wealth accumulation vary over the lifecycle. Figure A2 shows that net worth tends to grow steadily through to near retirement age, then it declines as it is used to varying degrees in retirement. Household incomes tend to rise much more rapidly and earlier than wealth, then they fall away as paid employment reduces or ceases (Perry, 2019, p5). 3. This means that, although in general net worth increases with income (table A1, first row), there is not a one-to-one matching of households in high-net worth deciles with those in high- income deciles. Table A1 shows the share of net worth for each household income quintile (second row) and each net worth quintile (third row) from the HES 2018. 120 It shows that many low-income people (income quintile 1) have net worth that they will be able to consume, thereby having higher material well-being than their income may suggest. For example, older people may have relatively high net worth but low income. Further, net worth is less concentrated in the top income quintile than the top net worth quintile – as people with higher incomes may not yet have accumulated enough wealth to be high wealth. Considering the joint distribution of income and wealth is a more comprehensive measure of material well-being than either indicator alone. 120 Household Economic Survey 2017-2018, Table 2.03 and 3.03.

These statistics are from internal information rather than survey data. They exclude individuals who do not have an age, physical address or industry classification recorded. 2. The median age of the Individual A responder population is 68, with the mean age being 67. The estimated gender breakdown of the group is 94% male and 6% female. 3. Most of the population list their physical location as the Auckland area (58%), followed by other North Island locations (17%), South Island (15%) and then the Wellington area (10%). 4. There are a mix of personal high-level industry classifications recorded. Table B1 provides details: Table B1 Industry classifications for Individual A responder population Industry classification Proportion Professional, Scientific and Technical Services 28% Rental, Hiring and Real Estate Services 26% Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing 15% Financial and Insurance Services 13% Other Services 122 18% 122 Other Services incudes categories that have a count of 8 or less Page | 125 Appendix C Information collections 1. Information was collected from the Project population in three stages under section 17GB of the Tax Administration Act 1994. In designing the information collections, Inland Revenue took account of the types of information Stats NZ collect in their Household Economic Surveys. The information collections are available at: High- wealth individuals research project (ird.govt.nz) Description of Collections Collection 1: Family Details 2. In November 2021, Individual A was asked for information on their family details, such as the name of their partner and the number of dependent children (as defined) and their name if they had significant income or assets. This information was used to form the family unit for the Project. 3. The notice was sent to 383 individuals (Individual A). After exclusions, 350 responses were required and 325 were received. This is a response rate of 93%. Collection 2: Entity Collection 4. In February 2022, Individual A and, separately, any partners identified in Collection 1, were asked to supply information in relation to entities and business undertakings over a certain threshold in which they had an interest. An interest included, for example, where the individual was a company shareholder with a certain minimum ownership interest. It also included where the individual was a settlor, trustee, named beneficiary and/or appointer (as defined) of a trust. 5. Individual A was also asked to provide information in relation to entities that their dependent children had an interest in. For trusts this applied to all dependent children. In relation to other interests, this only applied to those dependent children who had significant income or assets. 6. There were 622 responses required and 587 responses were received (94%). Collection 3: Financial Collection 7. In June 2022, Individual A and, separately, their partners were asked to provide a range of financial information on themselves and on entities they had an interest in. Information was requested where it was not held by Inland Revenue as it related to non-taxable income or could not be obtained from public information, or where it was held in a form that is too aggregated for the Project to undertake the analysis. De minimis thresholds applied where appropriate. The notice also included questions on expenditure, for the calculation of GST, and significant gifts/inheritances. 8. There were 623 responses required and 556 responses received (89%). Collection 3B: Supplemental Financial Statements Collection 9. This notice sought financial information on entities. It was only issued to those individuals for whom Inland Revenue held insufficient or inadequate financial statement information for entities they had previously disclosed. Internal financial data on entities was used wherever reasonably practicable. 10. There were 44 responses required and 41 responses were received (93%). Page | 126 Appendix D Sensitivity test – treatment of losses for personal tax Introduction 1. Chapter 5 calculates ETRs based on tax on personal taxable income over personal taxable income (taxable income). Chapter 8 calculates ETRs based on tax on personal taxable income over annual net income, also known as base income. 2. For taxable income, when net income is negative for a year, taxable income is set to zero. The negative income (loss) is then carried forward and can offset positive income in future years. Tax assessed for the period is also set to zero when there is a loss for the year. 3. Taxable income does not show actual income for the year where there is a loss or if a loss is carried forward. Therefore, when calculating economic income ETRs, we use annual net income rather than personal taxable income. This is a more accurate reflection of the economic income or loss the individual received or incurred in the year. 4. Additionally, as a comparison to the taxable income ETRs and the base income ETRs, this appendix tests the materiality of losses on personal tax. It recognises that a loss generates a future tax benefit to the individual, able to be used the next time positive income is earned. This tax benefit is recognised in the year it occurs. Methodology 5. For this sensitivity test, where the annual net income in a year is positive, the normal marginal tax calculation will apply to calculate tax. 6. Where annual net income is less than zero, that amount is treated as income in that year and a tax benefit calculated. In general, income carried forward reduces tax at the top tax rate first. Therefore, in this sensitivity test, where the individual has made an annual net loss, the top marginal tax rate for the period (33%) is applied to this annual net loss to calculate the tax benefit. Negative income will result in negative tax, and therefore a positive ETR for that year. 7. The period ETR for this scenario is calculated as: Tax on annual net income (positive year)−tax credits at top tax rate (negative year) Annual net income for period Results 8. When comparing the annual, Project period and Project period population ETRs for both Individual A and the family unit with the taxable income or base income ETR, there is around 1 percentage point difference in any year for the annual medians and quartiles, and less than 1 percentage point difference for the Project period measures. The ETRs under this sensitivity test are marginally higher than those created using tax on taxable income. Page | 127 Appendix E Data sources and quality 1. Figure E1 provides a schematic of the sources of data for the calculation of income. Base income (sourced from tax administration data) is shown on the left and sources used to calculate income from other sources shown moving towards the right. 2. Table E1 provides detailed information on data sources and quality. Figure E1 Schematic of data sources for the calculation of economic income Page | 128 Table E1 Data Quality Component Source Description Data Quality Taxable income sources and tax Taxable income/annual net income and tax assessed. Tax administration data. Income taxable at the individual level and tax on that income. Income taxable to trusts and tax on that income. Tax on entities’ taxable income. Tax administration data is considered complete and reliable for taxable income and tax on taxable income. Trusts Trust relationships used for ETR calculations. Trust financial information. Information collected from the Project population during Collections 2 and 3. These collections sought information on the Project population’s relationship to trusts, such as whether they were a beneficiary, settlor or appointer, and some financial information on trusts, such as distributions. Quality of data depends on the quality of the responses. Certain thresholds applied for a trust to be disclosed, limiting the number of trusts captured. Real Property Property ownership. Public information from LINZ. Information collected from the Project population during Collections 2 and 3. Properties owned by individuals and entities and ownership share. Information on trustee holdings. Data accurate on legal ownership but does not provide beneficial ownership. Title data on legal ownership from LINZ was matched with collected information on trustee holdings to ensure beneficial ownership was correctly matched. Page | 129 Component Source Description Data Quality Property valuations and growth rates for calculation of capital gains. Public information from third party providers (Valocity, Colliers) Automated Valuation Model values for residential properties (AVMs). Rateable values and non- residential growth rates for non-residential property. Property type and characteristics. Sales records. AVMs and non-residential growth rates are based on comparable sales and therefore provide a reasonably accurate measure of the average change in market value for properties of the same type and in the same location. Valuations will not take account of idiosyncratic factors and may not reflect actual returns. Assumptions are made to estimate capital expenditure. Rateable values provide a reasonable valuation from which to measure capital gains for non-residential property. Some AVM values were missing and were filled by using territorial authority growth rates for properties of that type. Imputed rental. Information collected from Project population during Collection 3. Ministry of Housing and Urban Development. Owner-occupied property and mortgage. Regional annual rental yields based on bond data. Imputed rental is calculated by applying market rental yields to the net value of the owner- occupied property. This provides an approximation of imputed rental consistent with similar properties. Page | 130 Component Source Description Data Quality Portfolio Income Market value of portfolio and market growth rates used to calculate capital gains. Information collected from Project population during Collection 3. Public information from S&P indices. Reserve Bank Managed Funds survey. Annual value of the portfolio. Contributions and withdrawals from the portfolio. Market growth rates. Average portfolio composition. During data cleaning, it was determined that disclosed information on contributions and withdrawals from the portfolio was unreliable. Data quality for portfolio values depends on accuracy of responses. Thresholds applied which may mean portfolio value is understated. Capital gains are calculated by multiplying the disclosed portfolio value by a market growth rate. This provides a market average return for portfolios of this size rather than actual returns for the Project population. Business Entities Business entity ownership Information collected from Project population during Collection 2. Ownerships of companies, partnerships, trading trusts and other entities over certain thresholds. Disclosure was subject to thresholds which limited the number of entities disclosed. Matching to tax records suggests ownership data is broadly accurate. Page | 131 Component Source Description Data Quality Financial statement data used to calculate capital gains. Tax administration data and collected information from Collection 3B. Financial statement information is combined with an industry multiple sourced from the S&P database to calculate an entity’s capital gains. While financial statement data is accurate, estimates of capital gains from this data are an approximation as they are based on assumptions. Significant Holdings in Listed Companies Ownership and capital gains Public information from S&P CapIQ crossed checked against information collected from the Project population in Collection 2. Capital gains are calculated from the change in quarterly price and quantity of shares held by the Project population. Capital gains estimates are based on market prices and are therefore highly accurate. Off- market sales are not accounted for. Income taxes paid including imputation credits Public information from S&P CapIQ and Bloomberg. Domestic and foreign tax from financial statements. Imputation credits are calculated as the difference between gross and net dividends reported in financial statements. Listed company financial statements are considered up- to-date and accurate. Page | 132 Component Source Description Data Quality GST Amount of GST remitted Information provided by Individual A during Collection 3. Amount of total family expenditure in 2019 and amount spent on items not subject to GST. Data cleaning was required as some individuals reported total expenditure to be less than the sum of expenditure components. Collected data is less granular than the HES expenditure survey. Remaining expenditure data assumed to be broadly indicative of Project population’s expenditure but not highly accurate. Inheritances Inheritances/gifts Information provided by Project population during Collection 3. Significant gifts and inheritance over a 50-year period. Quality of data depends on accuracy of the response. Thresholds applied which likely results in underestimation. Data from earlier periods may be less accurate. Page | 133 Appendix F Methodological differences between the ETR research of Inland Revenue and The Treasury 1. While this Project and the ETR work of the Treasury are complementary, there are methodological differences that should be considered when comparing the respective ETRs. Overall, the longer-term Treasury ETR estimates, without inflation adjustment, are the most comparable series to the Inland Revenue Project period ETR estimates. 2. Given Inland Revenue uses an income-weighted-mean ETR, and the Treasury uses a simple mean, we consider the estimates of median values the most comparable. 3. The most significant difference between the projects is that the Treasury estimates do not include company taxes (outside of amounts met with imputation credits) or trustee income and tax. This creates a downward bias in the Treasury ETR estimates for higher net worth deciles, compared to the Inland Revenue estimates. Therefore, the Treasury estimates for net worth deciles 9 and 10 should not be compared to the Inland Revenue estimates. This bias is less significant for middle and lower net worth deciles, due to the lower concentration of company and trustee wealth in those parts of the distribution. Further, attention should be paid to the treatment of transfer income in the ETRs to ensure comparability. 4. While both projects are based on similar measurement principles and a similar concept of income, they have the following methodological differences: Time period 5. The Treasury’s analysis is limited to the single tax year ended 31 March 2018, while Inland evenue’s Project covers the six-year period from 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2021. However, the Treasury models capital gains based on a 10-year capital gains rate. We consider this is most comparable to the Project period measures. Population 6. Inland Revenue calculates ETRs for a group of high-wealth families, while the Treasury estimates ET s across New Zealand’s entire wealth and income distribution based on the Household Economic Survey (HES). As noted, HES data tends to understate the net worth of high-wealth families. 7. Both projects assess ETRs for family units using a definition comparable to Stats NZ’s definition of ‘economic family unit’. The Treasury, however, uses equivalised family units whereas Inland Revenue simply uses the family. Given the small number of children in the high-wealth Project population (27), equivalisation would not be expected to have a material impact on the estimates for the high-wealth population. Data sources 8. Inland evenue’s analysis is based on tax administration data, public data and its survey of high-wealth individuals. The Treasury’s analysis is based on data from the HES and the Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI), which includes Inland Revenue personal taxable income data. The Treasury lacks information about unlisted shares, trusts, and the financial situation of the very wealthy, due to data gaps in HES. Page | 134 Included income 9. The concepts of income are similar in both projects as both projects seek to measure economic income. Taxable sources of income and capital gains income are included in both projects’ income definition. 10. The most comprehensive ETR estimates by the Treasury include an adjustment for inflation. This will lower the inflation-adjusted Treasury ETR measures relative to the Inland evenue measures, and only the Treasury’s nominal ET estimates should be compared to the Inland Revenue measures. Included taxes 11. The Treasury’s ETRs include ACC levies, PIE taxes and local government rates while Inland evenue’s do not. The impact of these taxes is likely immaterial for the high- wealth population (see chapter 5 for a discussion of PIE taxes). 12. Inland evenue’s analysis includes taxes paid by companies and trusts, whereas the Treasury’s analysis does not due to data limitations (see paragraph 3). This will make the Treasury’s ET measures lower than the Inland Revenue estimates for the same income (that is, the Treasury ETRs would be higher if company and trustee tax were included). This bias is not likely to be significant for low and middle decile estimates where there are low holdings of these assets, but it could make a significant difference towards the top of the wealth distribution where company and trust equity are likely to be significant. 13. The Treasury treats transfer payments as negative tax and positive general income. Inland Revenue treats transfers as general income in the main analysis but also provides sensitivity testing for treating transfers as negative income. Transfer payments are not a material source of income for the high-wealth Project population and this choice has little impact on the average ETRs for the high-wealth population. Measurement of capital gains 14. Capital gains are calculated by the Treasury using an estimated rate of return for different asset types based on HES asset valuations and market capital gain indices. This approach means the Treasury’s modelling cannot account for variability in capital gains rates across the distribution, insofar as that variability is not already controlled by asset type. Inland Revenue measures capital gains based on a mixture of disclosed valuations of assets, market prices, market growth rates, comparable sales data and estimated values depending on the asset type. 15. The projects use the same types of assets to estimate capital gains, although the HES data for 2018 is known to be missing the distribution of shares in unlisted equities where the respondent was not involved in running the company. Page | 135 Appendix G Comparison of net worth estimates Combined data approach 1. This appendix estimates net worth shares by combining the Project data set with HES data provided to the Project by Stats NZ. This approach is called the combined data approach. 2. The combined data approach has been developed with input from Stats NZ. It treats the Project data set as a full coverage list of the wealthiest individuals (or households) and combines it with HES survey data. This approach replaces some of the HES survey population represented by the wealthiest HES respondent(s) with people (or households taken from the Project’s responder population who have greater wealth than the wealthiest HES respondent(s). 3. The approach in this report reflects that very wealthy individuals and households may not be adequately represented in survey estimates due to sampling variability, non-response or underreporting. When the wealthiest households do not appear in the sample data for whatever reason, their absence contributes to an underestimation of the wealth distribution (that is, it creates a downward bias of the estimates). 4. Any wealth held by high-wealth individuals not in the Project data set is also not included. This would, however, be greater cause for concern if there was a gap between the wealthiest HES respondent and the lowest wealth in the Project dataset, which is not the case. Additionally, some of the responder population included in this analysis may have been included in the HES sample. 123 5. Based on the combined data, our findings show that for all years (at both the household- and individual-levels) the estimated shares of net worth held by the top 50, 10, 5, and 1 percent are higher than those estimated from the HES sample data alone (see tables G1 to G3), although they are still within the confidence limits of the original HES estimates. However, the increase in the estimates provided by the present approach reflects the reduction in the downward bias of the estimates resulting from the under-coverage of the top end of the net worth distribution. 123 There is a small possibility of double counting of some wealth. While it is unlikely to have much of an effect, if it has occurred at all, the extent of this cannot be determined due to the privacy and confidentiality conditions of the Project.

Source: Stats NZ Page | 139 GLOSSARY Annual net income/ base income Annual net income is the sum of the income types taxable at the personal level minus allowable expenses. The main difference to taxable income is that annual net income does not recognise any carried forward losses and may be negative. It is also referred to as base income in this report as it forms the basis for economic income ETRs. All-income ETR The ETR calculated incorporating economic income from all sources, including income (and associated tax) earned directly and through entities or trusts. Asset class ETR An ETR where income includes base income and the income (and associated tax) from a single defined asset class (real property, portfolio assets or business entity investments). Base income Base income ETR See annual net income for a definition of base income. The base income ETR is calculated based on personal tax assessed relative to annual net income. The base income ETR is used as a comparator for economic income ETRs. BCS (period) The Business Cycle Scenario (and the period used for the BCS) used in chapter 13. Business entity A company or trading trust meeting the thresholds in paragraph 11.5 and included in the business entity ETR. CFC Controlled foreign company Controlled foreign company. A company based overseas but controlled by New Zealand residents. It must not be tax resident in New Zealand or must be treated as resident of another country under a double tax agreement. Dependent child(ren) A child of Individual A and/or their domestic partner from a biological, adoptive or fostering relationship who, as at 1 November 2021, was: ▪ aged 17 or under ▪ not in full-time paid employment (regularly working 30 hours or more per week) ▪ not married, in a civil union or in a de facto relationship, and ▪ Individual A regarded them as being part of their household. Disposable income Market income plus cash benefits, housing subsidies and pensions, less income tax payments. Economic income A wider measure of income than taxable income or annual net income. It is based on the Haig-Simons concept of income and seeks to measure the increase in resources of an individual available for consumption over a given period. Exclusion criteria The criteria on which individuals in the initial population may be excluded due to not being a high-wealth New Zealand tax resident. See chapter 3. Page | 140 ETR The average effective tax rate. This is a measure of tax divided by a measure of income and shows the average amount of tax paid on each dollar of income. See Box 2. Family or family unit Each Individual A plus their domestic partner and dependent children, if any. Narrower than a “household” used in E . Final income A concept of income comprised of disposable income plus the cost of in-kind social services received, but less indirect tax paid. General population The New Zealand population. HES The Household Economic Survey conducted by Stats NZ. Individual A The person first identified in each family unit in the Project population. Initial population The set of individuals first contacted by the Project. Only Individual A is in the initial population. See Box 1. Land-rich entity A non-portfolio company, trading trust or limited partnership included in the land-rich entity ETR. For companies and trading trusts, this is an entity that has been identified as having a higher value based on its property holdings than based on the valuation methodology for business entities in chapter 11. Personal tax assessed The amount of tax assessed as liable to be paid on personal taxable income. Personal taxable income (or taxable income) The amount of personal income on which the person, family or population (when aggregated) would pay tax under the rules in the Income Tax Act 2007. Taxable income may also be used in the context of the taxable income of an entity or trust. Project period The income years ending 31 March 2016 to 31 March 2021 (that is, 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2021). Project population The group of individuals selected for this Project, their domestic partners and dependent children. Project population may refer to the responder population or whole population. See Box 1 in Chapter 3. Portfolio financial assets Portfolio investments in financial assets such as: ▪ equity investments when the family, together with trusts, owns less than 10 percent of the entity or when the entity had neither gross assets over $1,000,000 nor taxable income over $1,000,000 ▪ debt instruments ▪ investment vehicles, such as unit trusts or managed and superannuation funds, and ▪ other investments, such as in options or hybrid securities. Responder population Those from the initial population of individuals, together with their family members, who were not excluded from the Page | 141 survey and who responded to both the Entity and Financial Collections. See Box 1. SHLC (and SHLC population and period). Significant holdings in a listed company (and the relevant population and period) used for the purpose of the listed company ETRs in chapter 13. Survey or information collection The questionnaires sent to the Project population to collect information from them. This comprised three main surveys described in Appendix C: the Family Details Collection, the Entity Collection and the Financial Collection. Trading trust A trust that operates an active business, was registered for GST at some point during the Project period and had more than $100,000 of business income. Trust attribution factor (TAF) The degree to which the trustee income, capital gains and tax of a trust is attributed to the members of the Project population using the methodology described in chapter 7. Whole population The initial population less those who met one of the exclusion criteria to be excluded from the Project. Page | 142 REFERENCE LIST Adam, S., Phillips, D., & Smith, S. (2011).

Please note that there are some exceptions so please refer to the • PMO reporting flow diagram • Report inform diagram • Reporting Summary, and • Reporting Calendar for further detail. These artefacts are located on the Reporting SharePoint site. The monthly reporting deadline aligns to the Thursday, two weeks prior to the Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC) meeting. If the PGC meeting falls on an alternate date, due to a public holiday, or other circumstances, the BT PMO will communicate and advise the specific reporting period and timeline for completing the report. • Status reports are saved in SharePoint Reporting library by 12pm on Thursday • Updated to “Final” status and “Published” by 5pm on Thursday. • The deadlines may be extended to noon on Friday with prior approval from the PMO. The BT PMO Project Coordinator will create the necessary report folders in SharePoint and circulate a reminder email at the start of the reporting week. The BT Release Delivery Support Lead conducts a quality assurance review of all reports, creates the draft the Release Summary and the BT Programme Monthly Report pack, including and BT E xecutive S ummary Status. This is reviewed by the BT PMO prior to submission to the BT Programme Manager and BT Deputy Commissioner. The BT Release Delivery Support Lead prepares the bi-monthly joint ministers executive summary and submits this to the responsible Portfolio Domain Specialist. 2 Completing the Reporting Templates 2.1 Template location The BT report template is located on the Reporting SharePoint site. The template can also be found by going to the BT SharePoint home page and clicking on Templates and Processes site (see Figure 1 below), then scrolling down to the Reporting heading. Figure 1 2.2 Report location To navigate to the status reports, click on PMO at the very top of the BT SharePoint home page then click on Reporting Library under the Standard Library heading down the left-hand side of the page (see Figure 2). Figure 2 Page 6 of 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] There are separate folders for the fortnightly and monthly status reports, sorted by reporting date. It is recommended that you save your report/s into this area as soon as you commence working on them. • Please ensure you update the SharePoint status from “In draft/Work in Progress” to “Final/Approved” once ready and released by the Delivery Lead. • Please publish a major version (Major 1.00) by the cut off time, as late reports may not be included in the final pack. Once your reports are uploaded to the correct folder, please ensure the “BT Workstream” and/or “Sub Programme” fields are updated as applicable (see Figures 3, 4 and 5). Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 5 2.3 Executive Summary and Path to Green The top row of the status report, directly below the overall RAG, is for the executive level status summary. This executive summary is particularly important as is replicated into the Programme level reports which are used for both programme and external reporting. The summary should therefore be pitched at the senior executive, programme sponsor and programme leadership level. A view of progress towards key dates with a focus on exceptions and the “go to green” plan/s is very important. Remember that this is consumed by both internal and external IR executives and the Enterprise Portfolio Offi ce, so it is imperative not to overlook the need to support RAG trend and provide rationale. Where the workstream is reporting Light Amber or worse, p lease provide the “go to green plan/s” as applicable. These should include: • what’s required • what impact this will have on schedule • the status of these plans • required resources • associated risk • a measure of confidence in returning to Green Page 7 of 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 2.4 8-key RAG status guidelines Each status report needs to provide a RAG status against the eight keys. Please refer to Appendix 1 RAG status guidelines and Appendix 2 colour theme guidelines. 2.5 Schedule Performance Schedules are to be updated by 12 noon weekly Thursday. The BT PMO will provide a schedule performance (SP) report in PDF format by COB Thursday. These reports are located on the Programme Planning SharePoint site. Use your Snipping Tool to copy and paste the graph into your report as applicable. Any queries should be directed to the BT PMO Programme Planner. 2.6 Commentary If acronyms are used, please ensure these are written in full first with the acronym in brackets. Please refer the BT Programme Glossary and add new acronyms as required. 2.6.1 Escalations and Required Decisions List any escalations, special notes and or decisions relevant for this reporting period (this includes any risks, issues, etc you may wish to escalate). 2.6.2 Key achievements List the top two or three key achievements during the reporting period. It is important to note that the text in this key achievement area is used for reporting to Ministers and the Corporate Centre (i.e. Central Monitoring Agencies) so the text should not include any acronyms, individuals’ names, or commercially sensitive information (e.g. vendor procurement details). 2.6.3 Keys and Schedule Performance Briefly explain any relevant movement in the keys and variance in schedule performance and to refer to any risks and/or issues you may have under management. The keys that are in exception must be supported by your main go-to-green plans – which are covered in the summary. Please consider adding rationale for significant items or if schedule performance (variance against planned to date) is tracking +/- 5% ( based on volume/scope of work). 2.6.4 Key Activities/ Deliverables Provide the key “big rock”/leading activities and deliverables that anchor the workstream to the release schedule and provide a structured progress reporting framework, with RAG and completion status/commentary. 2.7 General Tips Please keep your reporting in plain English, be concise, and report in as few acronyms as possible. • Confine commentary to essential information only and cut back on non-essential detail. If the report is too lengthy it may not be read or understood • Clearly identify if support or action is required from PLT • Remember your audience – not all will have detailed knowledge of the subject matter • Please check your spelling and grammar, do not use us or we – say the team or similar Page 8 of 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Please refer to the Terminology Guidance • Please refer to the BT Framework d ocument which defines the key terms and also specifies the naming of the terms used by the Programme Page 9 of 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3 Programme Reporting The report inform diagram provides an explanation of where individual sections of the reported information is used in aggregate reporting summaries, dashboards and presentations. 3.1 Programme Leadership Team (PLT) The monthly Programme Dashboard (BT Programme status update) is produced by the Release Delivery Support Lead and BT PMO Project Coordinator. This is provided to the Programme Leadership Team and Commissioner for reference. 3.2 Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC), Portfolio Office and Central Monitoring Agencies The monthly reports are also provided to the Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC), Portfolio Office and Central Agencies (Corporate Centre). The monthly Programme Dashboard (BT Programme status update) is used as the key input into the Portfolio Office report. A cut-down version of the Portfolio Office report, focussed on the 10-keys, is then provided to Central Monitoring Agencies and used as a discussion point at regular monitoring meetings, which are held bi-monthly. Central Monitoring Agencies receive the monthly PGC Dashboard including all in-scope workstream reports (refer to the Scope section of the PMO QA Monthly Reporting Process for the current list). 3.3 BT Release Management Meeting and Release Delivery Meeting The fortnightly status reports are consolidated by the Release Delivery Support Lead to produce the “Release Status Report”. These reports are used as input to the BT Release Management and Release Delivery meetings.

Te tono whakawhitinga moni tāwere Requesting credit transfers
=============================================================

You can request a payment or credit transfer in myIR by using the 'Financial transfers' service in the 'Intermediary centre'. Some returns filed in myIR or the Returns Gateway service will allow you to request a credit transfer at the time of filing.

To request a transfer using ‘Financial transfers’ in myIR, you must be linked to the client and have full account access account permissions to the client list for the current location of the credit. However, you do not need to be linked to the recipient of the transfer. Restricted users are not able to use this service.

Tax agents linked to themselves are not treated as a client. This means you cannot perform tax agent specific functions, such as transfers, on your own IRD number. This also prevents agency employees accessing your personal information.

When requesting a credit transfer as part of 'File return' in myIR you also need to have full account access account permission – but if you are using the income tax return service, you can still initiate the credit transfer if you only have file.

Requesting a transfer does not mean we’ll move the credit as requested. When there are higher priority periods or accounts which the credit should go to, the credit will instead follow our automated offset rules, for example if there is a debt in another period.

It is important to tick the ‘Associated person’ check box where applicable when requesting a credit transfer, even if the transfer destination is the same customer. This will ensure the correct effective date is applied.

There are a few other instances where the transfer will not be processed. If this occurs, 1 of the following error messages will be displayed.

### **Error: No credits available to transfer**

This error may display if:

*   there is no assessment in a period, so the credit is locked
*   there is a credit lock, or account halt, on the period
*   the credit arose from a write-off or remission
*   there is a refund created earlier that day which is pending release.

### **Error: Client not available for this service**

This error may display if:

*   the transfer is being requested from your own IRD number
*   you're not linked to the client
*   you're linked, but do not have full account access to the client list where the account is linked
*   the client or the client’s account is:
    *   ceased or deceased
    *   under investigation or special audit
    *   a corporate customer
    *   insolvent by way of bankruptcy, liquidation, voluntary administration, or has been struck off.

Where applicable, the same restrictions and error messages will apply to the destination period.

If a destination client is not available to be transferred to, we will continue to process and release a refund from the source client.

Tax agents cannot transfer credits or payments from certain tax types. These include, but are not limited to, student loans, Working for Families payments and imputation credits.

If you need help with a credit transfer
---------------------------------------

If you need help with a credit transfer or you're not able to request a transfer using these methods, send us a message in myIR. These include, but are not limited to, student loans, Working for Families payments and imputation credit accounts.

Transfer security
-----------------

All transfers requested electronically are traceable and are recorded on the 'Agency activity' report (for owner, administrator and restricted administrator logons).

Owners of myIR logons can view all submissions sent by their staff by going to:

It must be submitted as an attachment to the relevant webform through the Overseas Investment Office (OIO) website https://www.linz.govt.nz/overseas-investment/apply/apply-for-consent-variation-or-exemption • Please complete all boxes, unless the consent application involves solely a change or changes in ownership occurring overseas which will not result in an overall change in majority ownership or control of the significant business assets being acquired. In this latter situation, please complete Parts A, B and F only. • If a box is not completed then Inland Revenue will advise the Overseas Investment Office (OIO) that the required tax information has not been provided. The OIO will then make contact with you and advise which boxes are incomplete. • Reasonable estimates (based on the likely position as at the date when the investment will be given effect) are acceptable. Part A: Investor Details The details supplied should be consistent with the application made to the OIO. Part B: Description of Activities Item 1: Please keep the description short and state clearly what is planned such as brief details of significant additional investment, expansion or divestment of assets, integration with other assets, or major restructuring.

Part C: Capital Structure for Investment Items 3 and 4: The levels of funding should be broken down based on the overall consideration for the investment. For example, if the total consideration is funded by approximately equal parts of equity and debt, then state “50%” in both boxes. Item 5: Please state either “Yes” or “No”. A hybrid arrangement or entity could include any of the following: debentures, convertible notes, preference shares, repurchase agreements (commonly known as “repos”), limited partnerships, unit trusts, dual resident companies and unlimited liability companies. It is not expected that a special review be carried out to identify a likely imported mismatch arrangement. However, if a likely imported mismatch arrangement has already been identified then please state “Yes”. Part D: Transfer Pricing Arrangements Item 6: The extent of transfer pricing arrangements are determined by taking the likely aggregate value of these arrangements and estimating if that total will exceed 20% of the likely total annual expenditure arising from the business involving the assets acquired. Likely types of transfer pricing arrangements include cross-border associated party transactions involving goods, raw materials, management and administration services, technical services, research and development, commissions, rents, royalties, licence fees, interest, guarantees and insurance. In aggregating amounts for types of transfer pricing arrangements, do not net off individual items (for example, sales and purchases). Items 7 and 8: Please state either “Yes” or “No”. Part E: Other Item 9: If there are likely to be any significant flows of funds to or from a particular overseas jurisdiction and that jurisdiction has a double taxation agreement with New Zealand then that will be considered a relevant double taxation agreement. More information on New Zealand’s double taxation agreements can be found at www.ird.govt.nz/international-tax/double-tax-agreements. Item 10: Please state “Yes” or “No”. Part F: Confirmation Please complete these details in full. Note that the person providing the required tax information may be a duly authorised person of the investor.

[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

The tax requirements for companies that have formed a consolidated group.

Income tax
----------

A consolidated group files 1 company income tax return that includes the total assessable income of all the companies in the group. This return is filed under a separate IRD number from the individual companies’ numbers. One group member must be the nominated company to:

*   file income tax returns
*   pay income tax of the group on behalf of all members.

The group will usually only receive 1 income tax assessment. There may be separate assessments for member companies and the consolidated group when a company enters or leaves the group or there's a consolidation during the year.

Each member is jointly and severally liable for the income tax assessed for the group, unless the group limits this to 1 or more member companies. We must be satisfied that the company or companies are able to meet the tax liability of the consolidated group.

The joint and several liability also includes the taxes listed in ‘Other taxes, accounts and payments’ below. 

Provisional tax
---------------

Consolidated groups are treated as 1 company for provisional tax. 

A company that used the ratio method to calculate provisional tax must stop using this method when they join a consolidated group. A consolidated group must meet all the criteria before they can use the ratio method. For this reason, a newly formed consolidated group will not be able to use the ratio method.

[Ratio option](/income-tax/provisional-tax/provisional-tax-options/ratio-option)

Where a company stops being a member of a consolidated group, it (or another consolidated group that it joins) must estimate its provisional tax. The consolidated group may also choose to estimate its provisional tax down to account for the departing member.

### Balance date changes on forming a consolidated group

To be eligible to be part of a consolidated group, a company must have the same balance date as other group members. If the group has several balance dates at the time of forming, the companies forming the group must decide which date to use.

If 1 or more companies change their balance date before joining a group, this may create a transitional year along with provisional tax obligations on the company up until the time the group is formed.

Goods and services tax
----------------------

A GST registered company that joins a consolidated group must match its GST filing frequency to the group’s balance date.

Other taxes, accounts or payments
---------------------------------

Consolidated groups are not able to register for the following taxes, accounts or payments. The individual companies in the group are responsible for registering and administering these.

*   Employer registration account
*   Non-resident withholding tax
*   Fringe benefit tax
*   Resident withholding tax
*   Approved issuer levy

Loss carry-forward and grouping
-------------------------------

A consolidated group must meet the shareholder continuity or business continuity requirements to carry forward a loss from year to year. If a company that makes a loss (loss company) leaves the consolidated group, the loss incurred up until the date of exit stays in the group.

The loss brought forward balance in a consolidated group’s first return is nil.

[Business continuity test](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/income-tax-for-companies/losses-for-companies/carrying-company-losses-forward/business-continuity-test)

### Pre-consolidation losses

A loss that a company makes before it becomes a member of a group is known as a pre-consolidation loss. The general treatment for pre-consolidation losses is that they can be used by the consolidated group:

*   First, applied against the consolidated group income if the group existed from the year the loss was made by the loss company, through to the income year of the loss offset.
*   Second, applied against the loss company’s own income, or the income of another eligible consolidated group or company.
*   Third, carried forward to future periods of that company.

Losses are offset on a first in, first out basis. They are used proportionately if they are made in the same income year.

If the company claiming the loss (loss company) does not have 66% common ownership interests with 1 or more companies in the same consolidated group, the loss is restricted to the total of:

*   the amounts that the loss company that made the pre-consolidation loss would be allowed to offset against its own income if it was not part of the consolidated group
*   the amount allowed to be offset against income of those other members that formed a 66% group with the loss company, for the period from the start of the income year when the loss arose, to the end of the income year when the loss is to be used.

Any pre-consolidation losses that cannot be offset against the consolidated group's income may be: 

*   carried forward by the member company, or 
*   offset against the assessable income of another 66% commonly owned company (including in other consolidated groups). 

The loss company must continue to meet the ordinary loss carry forward rules (including the 49% continuity of shareholding), or the business continuity test.

Imputation credit accounts
--------------------------

A consolidated group must keep its own separate imputation credit account (ICA) and file an imputation return for the group, as part of its non-individual income tax return.  

The opening balance of a newly formed consolidated group ICA is nil. An existing group’s balance is the closing balance of the previous imputation year.

Companies in a consolidated group must file their own annual imputation return to keep a record of the current balance and any changes. However, from the 2020-21 tax year, if the company **always has a nil ICA balance during the relevant tax year**, it is not required to file an annual ICA return.

From 1 April 2021, the rules on the allocation of imputation credits when a member leaves a consolidated imputation group changed.

*   A consolidated imputation group may choose to receive a debit to its ICA, equivalent to a tax payment from a departing member, that has not been used to pay tax due. 
*   If the representative group member decides to receive an imputation debit, the departing member may receive an equivalent imputation credit to its ICA.
*   The departing member may be a company or a consolidated imputation group.
*   The debits and credits to the ICAs will happen on the same day as the original credit from to the corresponding tax payment.

[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

Eligible artists are entitled to receive a payment each time their art is resold (a resale payment). These payments may be taxable.

The resale payment is a set percentage of the resale price. The art professional (for example, an auction house or gallery) resells the artwork and passes the resale payment to a collection agency. The collection agency passes the resale payment to the artist.

If you are an artist who was in business when the artwork was created, you need to pay income tax on resale payments for that art. This is because resale payments are not taxed before they are paid to artists.

[My income is not taxed before I get paid](https://www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/how-income-is-taxed/my-income-is-not-taxed-before-i-get-paid)

Eligibility for the resale payment
----------------------------------

Resale payments are administered by Resale Royalties Aotearoa Toi Huarau. You can check your eligibility for the resale scheme and how to receive a payment on their website. The resale scheme begins on 1 December 2024.

[Resale Royalties Aotearoa | Toi Huarau](https://resaleroyalties.co.nz/)
 

Tax implications for artists
----------------------------

For an artist who was in business when they created their artwork, a resale payment received for that art is taxable income, whether it comes from a resale made in New Zealand or overseas. 

If you live:

*   in New Zealand and your art is resold overseas, you must pay income tax in New Zealand on the resale payment
*   overseas and your art is resold in New Zealand, you must pay income tax in New Zealand on the resale payment. 

### Overseas sales and double tax agreements

New Zealand will have reciprocal resale payment agreements with Australia and the United Kingdom (UK). Artists living in those countries will receive the resale payment when their artwork is resold in New Zealand. 

Artists living in New Zealand will receive a resale payment when their artwork is resold in Australia or the UK. 

New Zealand has double tax agreements (DTAs) with many countries. DTAs can affect the incomes of New Zealanders who live overseas, or New Zealand residents who receive overseas income. 

**Important: we recommend that you ask a tax professional for advice.**

### Non-resident withholding tax

Non-resident withholding tax does not need to be paid on resale payments. 

When an artist has died
-----------------------

When an artist dies, the resale payment goes directly to the beneficiaries under their will, or to their estate. In these situations, the resale payment is not taxable income. The artist’s beneficiaries or estate will not need to pay income tax on the resale payment.

The artist's estate or beneficiaries can decide to transfer the rights to future resale payments to a third party. However, the tax outcomes may be complex. We recommend that you ask a tax professional for advice.

Rescission of Mareva injunction
===============================

2005 case note - Judge concluded the threshold for making the Mareva injunction had been reached - interlocutory application, rescission, GST refunds, assessment.

Case

Queen City Properties Group Limited and Others

Legislative References

Judicature Act 1908

### Summary

The defendants claimed GST input credits on a number of property transactions. The input credits were accidentally released by the Commissioner before he confirmed the defendants were entitled to them. The Commissioner sought and gained a Mareva injunction preventing the taxpayers from using or removing the funds. The defendants applied to have the injunction rescinded.

### Facts

This case concerns a Mareva injunction granted in favour of the Commissioner over the sum of $177,809.99 paid out in error to the bank of the second defendant, Nigel Asby.

There are 16 defendants in this case. The second defendant, Nigel Asby, is the sole director of 13 defendants and their taxation advice and general tax management stem from him. Their tax affairs are managed by the first defendant, Queen City Property Group Ltd and the third defendant is St George Bank of New Zealand Limited.

The thirteen tax payers claimed GST refunds of $177,809.99. The 13 taxpayers assert that they are entitled to a refund.

In July 2004 on Commissioner's _ex parte_ application, interim orders were made in the nature of a Mareva injunction on the second and third defendants. The orders were made to restrain the bank from paying out or dissipating a sum of $177,809.99 released in error by the Commissioner. Similar orders restrained the second defendant who is co-director of the first defendant and effectively its proprietor. It is the second defendant's bank account with the third defendant where the restrained monies are deposited, the second defendant being the sole signatory of that account.

The Commissioner initially sought to reclaim the monies by issuing the Bank of New Zealand with a section 157 notice.

The dispute is based around the purchase of property. Each of the 13 taxpayers purchased an apartment in a block being developed in Hobson Street, Auckland. The 13 agreements, together with 32 other companies' agreements to purchase, with the same directors and shareholders as the 13 taxpayers, were all conditional. Two days later each of the 13 taxpayers on-sold the properties on a ten year deferred settlement basis to one of two non-associated companies, North Shore Holdings Limited ("NSHL") or Pennylane Investments Limited ("PIL"). These sales were unconditional.

Each of the 13 taxpayers had elected under section 19 of the Goods and Services Tax Act to account for GST on a payments basis, basing this on their anticipated annual turnover. Both NSHL and PIL were registered for GST on an invoice basis.

Both NSHL and PIL paid deposits to the 13 taxpayers. The deposits were in fact paid to the first defendant as agent. It appears that the source of those deposits was GST refunds received on the transactions by NSHL and PIL.

Each of the taxpayers paid output tax on the received deposit. The balance of the deposit was applied by the taxpayers to pay the deposit on the apartments they had purchased.

Two years later, the vendor of the apartments cancelled the agreements with all 13 taxpayers and the transactions did not proceed.

A year later, each of the 13 taxpayers filed GST returns, claiming a refund of input tax in respect of the deposits it had paid on the now cancelled agreements. Four months later, the 13 taxpayers cancelled their on-sale agreement with NSHL and PIL. They additionally filed GST returns for that taxation period claiming a refund of the output tax paid on the deposits from NSHL and PIL. None of the 13 taxpayers have repaid these deposits they had received to NSHL and PIL and these companies have been placed into liquidation.

While the audit and correspondence continued, account halts had been placed on the amounts claimed. As a result of administrative error, the halts were not renewed and the amount of $177,809.99 was paid out.

The Commissioner asserts refunds were not payable to the 13 taxpayers; the Commissioner wrote to the taxpayers informing them that the GST refunds would be delayed and the circumstances were being reviewed. No prior conduct by the Commissioner suggested that the money would be forthcoming.

All sixteen defendants applied for rescission of the orders.

### Decision

Priestly J concluded the threshold for making the Mareva injunction had been reached on the evidence before him and the hearing before Williams J.

His reasons were:

*   The Commissioner had a good arguable case that the defendants were not entitled to the money
*   The assets held were within the jurisdiction
*   There were grounds for holding the assets may be dissipated or disposed of before final judgment.

Although the defendants asserted their desire to trade with the money and carry on commercial activities, Priestly J considered there was a lack of evidence as to what those activities would be and how successful they would be. Further reasons for holding these points are set out in paragraphs 76 to 79 of the decision.

His Honour also disposed of the applicant's argument that the _Sea Hunter_ case applied. There too, an account halt failed and the Court of Appeal held that summary judgment against the Commissioner was appropriate. The taxpayer was entitled to retain the $2.5 million paid out in error. Priestly J distinguished that case noting that there, it was the combined effects of ss 20(5) and 46(1) of the GST Act which operated to deny the Commissioner a remedy. That is, the Commissioner had not, in that case, notified the taxpayer within the statutory 15 day period that further information was needed or that an investigation had begun. In this case there had been notification and a clearly stated intention to investigate the claimed entitlement. Hence section 46(1) could not apply.

Priestly J considered the attempt by the Commissioner to remove the money from Mr Ashby's bank account pursuant to section 43 an unlawful attempt to invoke a statutory power. He considered there was force in the defendant's observation that the Commissioner had 'glossed over' this misguided attempt to retrieve the money.

Priestly J also noted the Commissioner's lack of reference to the simultaneous notices of assessment. Although this was not fatally determinative he considered the Commissioner should have referred to them considered the legal consequences of such notices and the statutory safeguards they are subject to.

While Priestly J found such omissions on behalf of the Commissioner worrying, they were not sufficiently serious or determinative to justify the rescission of the injunction. He considered it clear that the Commissioner had no intention in July 2004 to pay the refunds to the defendants. It was only due to an administrative error that the refunds were paid and it was this error that the Commissioner focussed on in his original _ex parte_ application.

The application to rescind the orders was dismissed as no grounds for rescission had been made out. The evidence did not show the Commissioner had made the refund pursuant to an assessment to which he had turned his mind. There was a risk to the money if it was not restrained.

Research and development tax credits
====================================

2007 tax rules which provide a tax credit for NZ businesses that perform research and development, or commission others to perform it for them in New Zealand.

**_Sections LA 6(1)(db), LH 1 to LH 17, OB 4(3)(eb), OB7C, OK 2(3)(cb), OK 4B, OP 5(2)(bb), OP 7(3)(fb), OP 11B, YA 1, YB 2 to YB 4, YB 7, YB 9 to YB 11, YB 13 to YB 18, YB 20(2)(ob) and Schedule 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections 3(1), 22(2) and (7), 33A(2), 43A(2), 68D and 68E, 91AAP, 91C(4), 108(1B), 108B(3)(d), 113(1), 113D, 141(7C) and (7D) of the Tax Administration Act 1994_**

New tax rules have been introduced, which provide a tax credit for New Zealand businesses that perform R&D on their own behalf, or that commission others to perform R&D for them, provided the R&D is performed predominantly in New Zealand. The definition of R&D is in line with comparable jurisdictions where it has proved to be sustainable. The new tax credit applies not just to "white-coat" research, but to the development of new or improved products or processes in a variety of industries.

R&D expenditure that is eligible for the credit includes the cost of employee remuneration, training and travel of employees conducting R&D, depreciation of tangible property, consumables, certain overheads and payments to entities conducting R&D on behalf of the claimant.

The credit applies at the rate of 15 percent of eligible expenditure in a year, and is claimed in the annual income tax return, offsetting the tax liability of the claimant. Surplus credits are refundable. This means that businesses that have a tax loss or have only tax-exempt income receive the credits in cash.

#### Background

The government first raised the option of introducing an R&D tax credit in the Business Tax Review discussion document, released in July 2006. This was followed by an issues paper in November 2006 which proposed general eligibility criteria, a definition of R&D and a list of eligible expenditure. The government announced the introduction of the credit as part of the Business Tax Reform package in Budget 2007.

R&D tax incentives are common overseas with a body of international evidence suggesting that tax incentives are effective at encouraging business R&D. The rationale for them is that there is under-investment by businesses in R&D because the investing firm does not capture all of the benefits of the investment. There are likely to be spill-over benefits to New Zealand when businesses invest in R&D and providing an R&D tax credit will encourage firms to invest more in R&D.

#### Key feature

**Eligibility for the credit (sections LH 1 to LH 3 and LH 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007)**

To be eligible, a claimant must be in business in New Zealand. Non-residents must be in business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand. The expenditure for which a claim is made must relate to that business or an intended business of the claimant. An exception to the requirement to be in business exists for industry research co-operatives which have special rules.

Crown Research Institutes, tertiary institutions, District Health Boards, their associates, and entities under the control of any combination of them, are not eligible for the credit. R&D performed by a business in partnership with these entities is also ineligible.

Claimants must bear the financial risk associated with the R&D project, have control over the work and effectively own the project results. When R&D is outsourced, this distinguishes the person who commissions the R&D (who is eligible for the credit) from the person who merely performs the R&D on behalf of someone else. The performer is not eligible for the credit - the incentive is provided to the party making the R&D investment decisions.

The claimant must also spend at least $20,000 of eligible expenditure in the year a claim is made unless the R&D services are purchased from an unassociated listed research provider. These are entities that perform research for others on a commercial basis.

The business must conduct R&D activities as these are defined in section LH 7. They must be systematic, investigative and experimental activities that either seek to advance science or technology through the resolution of scientific or technological uncertainty or that involve an appreciable element of novelty. In either case, the activities must be directed at acquiring new knowledge or creating new or improved products or processes. These are "SIE" (systematic, investigative and experimental) R&D activities. Certain activities are excluded, as they are in other jurisdictions, generally to delineate more clearly the boundary between innovative and routine activity.

Activities that support SIE activities, but that are not systematic, investigative and experimental in themselves, are eligible if they are wholly or mainly for the purpose of the SIE activities and are required for, and integral to, them.

**Rate of credit (section LH 4)**

The credit applies at the rate of 15 percent of eligible expenditure.

**Eligible expenditure (sections LH 3(1)(e), LH 5, LH 6, LH 8, Schedule 21)**

Expenditure is eligible only if it is of a type listed in Schedule 21, Part A and not listed in Part B. The expenditure must also generally be deductible in the year it is incurred, although there are exceptions from this requirement for certain expenditure.

Eligible expenditure includes the cost of employee remuneration, training and travel, depreciation of tangible assets used in conducting R&D, certain overhead costs, consumables and payments to third parties for R&D performed on behalf of the claimant.

Ineligible expenditure is listed in Schedule 21, Part B. The main items are interest, loss on sale or write-off of depreciable property, the cost of acquiring core technology (technology used as a basis for further R&D), expenditure funded from a government grant or the required co-funding, expenditure on intangible assets and professional fees in determining eligibility.

Expenditure on R&D done overseas is not eligible unless it is part of a project based in New Zealand. The amount of overseas eligible expenditure available for the tax credit is limited to 10 percent of the eligible expenditure incurred on the project in New Zealand.

**Cap on internal software development (sections LH 9 to LH 13, LH 17)**

There is a cap of $3 million on eligible expenditure when the R&D activity is "internal software development". Internal software development includes the development of software without the main purpose of sale to non-associates, as well as the development of software which is used in administration of the claimant's business or to provide its customers with services other than the use of its computer technology or software. The cap applies whether the activity is a SIE activity or a support activity. The level of the cap can be increased by the Minister of Finance when it is in the national interest. Claimants under common control that undertake internal software development will be required to calculate their expenditure as a group and to allocate the cap between members.

**Administrative procedures (sections OB 4(3)(eb), OB 7C, OK 2(3)(cb), OK 4B, OP 5(2)(bb), OP 7(3)(fb), OP 11B of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections 3(1), 22(2) and (7), 33A(2), 43A(2), 68D and 68E, 91AAP, 91C(4), 108(1B), 108B(3)(d), 113(1), 113D, 141(7C) and (7D) of the Tax Administration Act 1994)**

Businesses will claim the tax credit in an income tax return. They will work out their liability for tax in the normal way, and then subtract the amount of the credit. When the amount of the credit exceeds the tax liability, the balance is used to reduce other tax liabilities, or is refundable in cash.

The credit will reduce residual income tax, which will reduce provisional tax liability, allowing businesses that pay provisional tax to receive the benefit of the credit closer to the time they incur R&D expenditure. This reduction will be immediate for people who estimate provisional tax, but delayed for people who use the "uplift" method for calculating provisional tax.

Companies and Maori authorities will receive a credit in their imputation credit accounts for an income tax liability that is satisfied by way of the credit.

To be eligible for the credit, a business must provide - in addition to the income tax return - a detailed statement of R&D activities and expenditure. This is collected for administrative and evaluation purposes.

From a date to be appointed by the Governor-General by Order in Council (but no later than 1 April 2010), a potential claimant will be able to apply to the Commissioner to determine whether an activity is R&D, whether a person is eligible for the credit, and whether expenditure is eligible for the credit. Binding rulings are not available on these matters.

There are a number of other minor and consequential amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 relating to the new tax credit.

#### Application date

The credit will apply from the 2008-09 income year.

#### Detailed analysis

Unless otherwise indicated, examples assume a standard income year and section references are to the Income Tax Act 2007.

#### Who can claim the credit (section LH 1)

**In business in** **New Zealand** **(subsection (1))**

To be eligible, a claimant must carry on business in New Zealand. Non-residents must carry on business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment.

This requires activities to be a profession, trade, manufacture or undertaking with an intention to make a pecuniary profit. All types of New Zealand businesses are eligible, whether incorporated or not, including businesses that earn only exempt income.

In the case of partnerships, the business test is applied at the partnership level, rather than to individual partners. (See discussion below on section LH 3(3)(a).)

An exception exists for industry research co-operatives which do not need to be in business. However, there is a requirement that the members of the co-operative be in business. That requirement is discussed further below in relation to section LH 3 and other requirements in relation to the co-operatives are discussed below in relation to section LH 16.

**Crown Research Institutes, tertiary institutions and District Health Boards (subsection (2))**

Crown Research Institutes, tertiary institutions, District Health Boards, and their associates, and entities controlled by any combination of those entities, are not eligible for the credit. These entities are defined in section YA 1 through cross-references to their enabling Acts. Crown Research Institutes are defined in section 12 of the Crown Research Institutes Act 1992. A tertiary institution is a body established under section 162 of the Education Act 1989. A District Health Board is a board established under section 19 of the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000.

Association is determined using the 1988 version provisions (section YB 20(2)(ob)). However, the tripartite test does not apply for the purpose of determining who is associated under section LH 1(2) (section YB 4(3B)). R&D performed by a person in partnership with one of these entities is also not eligible. (See discussion below on section LH 3(2).)

##### Example

ACo is 25 percent owned by a Crown Research Institute, 26 percent owned by a trust whose beneficiary is a tertiary institution, and 49 percent is owned by a private firm, BCo. ACo is not an eligible person.

BCo purchases 5 percent of the shares from the trust and thereby takes a controlling share in ACo which it later sells to a tertiary institution. ACo is an eligible person for the period that BCo has a controlling interest

#### Entitlement to the credit (section LH 2)

Section LH 2(2) provides for the tax credit and section LH 2(1) sets out the broad requirements for entitlement to the credit.

To claim the credit, a claimant must, for a year or part-year:

*   be an eligible person under section LH 1(1) - that is, carry on business in New Zealand;
*   meet the requirements in section LH 3 - in essence, do R&D related to the business, have the requisite control of the R&D project and effective ownership of the results and incur eligible expenditure or depreciation on the R&D that is tax deductible in the year;
*   perform the R&D activities on its own behalf and not on behalf of another person;
*   incur $20,000 or more (or a pro-rated amount) of eligible expenditure or depreciation unless the R&D is outsourced to an unassociated listed research provider; and
*   file a detailed R&D statement in relation to that year by a due date (new sections 68D or 68E of the Tax Administration Act 1994).

The amount of the credit is set out in section LH 4 at 15 percent of "eligible expenditure".

**Minimum expenditure threshold (subsections (3) and (4))**

A claimant must have eligible expenditure (as calculated under section LH 4) of at least $20,000 to qualify for the credit. This is pro-rated when a person is eligible under section LH 1(1) for part of a year only (for example, when the person carries on business for part of a year only).

An exception to the minimum threshold exists if the R&D services are outsourced to an unassociated listed research provider.

If a provider is delisted, payments under an arrangement entered into when the provider was still listed are not subject to the minimum threshold. This is to ensure that the claimant will not be subject to the minimum threshold if the provider is delisted subsequent to the parties agreeing on the arrangement for services. The claimant and the provider must not have been associated at the time the arrangement was entered into.

The requirements to be a listed research provider are set out in section LH 15.

A partnership can meet the minimum expenditure threshold for R&D activities carried out by the partnership and the individual partners claim credits in relation to their share of the expenditure. (See discussion below on section LH 3(2).)

##### Example

In 2010, ACo incurs $10,000 of eligible expenditure on R&D performed inhouse. This is not eligible for the credit.

In 2010, BCo spends $10,000 contracting an unassociated listed research provider to do its R&D. The part of the $10,000 that is eligible expenditure will not be subject to the minimum threshold.

In 2010, CCo spends $100,000 on eligible expenditure undertaking its own R&D. This expenditure exceeds the minimum threshold.

**Expenditure treated as incurred in a year (subsection (5))**

Expenditure that is deductible in a year but added back as income under the timing rules in Part CH at the end of the year is not eligible for the credit in that year. It becomes eligible for the credit in a subsequent year when it ceases to be added back. Because the expenditure is not actually incurred in that subsequent year, it needs to be treated as incurred in that year to satisfy the provisions listed. This applies to the opening value of trading stock, unexpired amounts of expenditure under section DB 50 and unpaid employment income under section DB 51.

It applies also to overseas eligible expenditure that is incurred in one year and is eligible for the credit in a subsequent year (subsection (5)(d)).

**Treatment of credits (subsection (6))**

The credit is applied to satisfy a claimant's tax liability for as far as the credit extends. Surplus credits are applied, in turn, to satisfy an income tax or provisional tax liability that is payable in relation to other years, or any amount due and payable under an Inland Revenue Act (such as GST, or PAYE). Any excess credits are refunded.

Research reinforces need for simpler, easier tax processes
==========================================================

**20 April 2018**

Recent research carried out by Victoria University and Inland Revenue (IR) underlines the importance of making tax processes easier and simpler, particularly for the self-employed and small business sector, says Inland Revenue marketing and communications manager, Andrew Stott.

The research carried out last year suggests that the self-employed sector may be under-reporting income, perhaps mistakenly or sometimes deliberately, by an average of 20% a year. The research was looking at data from 2006/7, 2009/10 and 2012/13.

“We can’t say from this that large numbers of self-employed are deliberately under-reporting,” said Mr Stott. “Most Kiwis report fully and honestly and want to get it right.

“This research suggests an average figure that could mean a small number underreporting deliberately and a larger number simply not getting things right in their returns.”

For Inland Revenue, the research results feed into issues IR has already identified related and that are driving the objectives of the $1.5b transformation programme.

“The new systems and processes transformation is bringing will help more people get their returns right first time – and make it harder for them to make mistakes,” says Mr Stott.

“Also we’re really pleased to see people’s attitudes toward tax changing for the better and we’ll continue with public communications to build understanding and awareness of tax, how it works, what the benefits are and the obligations.”

He said research carried out since 2011 showed some important gains:

*   Fewer people  saying they’re likely to ask for a ‘cash price’ knowing that tax is less likely to be paid on it - 18% in 2017, down from 27% in 2011    
*    A steady decrease in those saying that they participated in cash jobs from 34% in 2011 to 25% in 2016/17
*   And 90% of those surveyed in 2016/17 say paying tax is the right thing to do – this figure has run at that level since 2011.

“These are encouraging results but there’s still plenty of work to do,” said Mr Stott.

“Making it easier to get tax returns right and raising awareness and understanding of what not to do and why paying tax is good for us all is really important.  The more success we have in helping people get things right, the less we have to audit and chase people up.

“Having said that, there are still people deliberately under-reporting and avoiding tax and our transformation will considerably enhance our ability to deal with them.

**Research methodology**

The recent study used anonymised data collected by the Statistics NZ Household Economic Survey (HES) and data from Inland Revenue, all of which is linked in the Stats NZ data warehouse known as the Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI). The research linked declared incomes from the self-employed and from people on salaries, with expenditure for the same households.

The comparison showed a discrepancy where households with similar levels of spending had different declared income levels. Some self-employed households appeared to have significantly lower levels of declared incomes to support the same levels of spending - suggesting under-reporting of income to Inland Revenue.

“We’re sure that a great deal of this under-reporting is error and inadvertent omission, though we also know that some is deliberate avoidance” Mr Stott said. “But either way this is an important issue and something Inland Revenue will continue to work on.

“The strong focus on this area complements the progress we’re making on multi-national corporate tax compliance through the base erosion profit shifting (BEPS) work we’re doing with the OECD,” he said.

**Special note:** IDI data cannot be used to identify any individuals or businesses and cannot be used for measuring specific entity compliance.

The Court found the appellants were resident at the relevant time and were, therefore, liable to account for resident withholding tax ("RWT"). Further, the appellants' arrangement was also confirmed a tax avoidance arrangement.

### Background

This was an appeal by the appellants against the decision of the High Court upholding the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's ("the Commissioner") assessments (_Vinelight Nominees Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2012\] NZHC 3306, an appeal of a decision of the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") in _Case 11/2011_ (2011) 25 NZTC 15,177).

### Facts

The Chin family carried on business in New Zealand through Vinelight Investments Limited ("VIL"). VIL's business activities were financed by interest-free loans made by a Hong Kong registered company also owned by the family - Weyand Investments Limited ("Weyand").

In 1998, the family affairs were reorganised on advice from Ernst & Young. Briefly, the Vinelight Trust ("the Trust") and its corporate trustee, Vinelight Nominees Limited (Vinelight), were created. VIL assumed an obligation to pay management fees to Vinelight with Vinelight assuming liability for the debt then owed by VIL to Weyand (with interest now payable). The shares in Weyand were transferred from Rodney and Sandra Chin to their three children who also joined them as directors of Weyand. Vinelight then registered as an approved issuer for the purposes of approved issuer levy ("AIL") and the loan from Weyand was registered as a security. From 1998 to 2005, Vinelight paid AIL at the rate of two per cent on the amounts of interest paid.

In 2003, the arrangement was altered after an opinion provided by Ernst & Young recommended changes including the resignation of Rodney and Sandra Chin as directors of Weyand (and the children in anticipation of their return to New Zealand) and that the directors should hold directors' meetings in Hong Kong.

The Commissioner assessed Vinelight for RWT for the periods 31 March 1999 to 31 December 2002 and for non-resident withholding tax ("NRWT") for the periods ended 31 October 2003 to 28 February 2005. Weyand was also assessed for income tax for the years ended 31 March 1999 to 31 March 2003.

### Decision

The Court dismissed the appeal.

#### Residency

The Court agreed with the earlier decisions in the TRA and the High Court that at all material times, until its affairs were restructured, Weyand's centre of management lay in New Zealand. The Court noted that the conclusions of fact reached in the lower courts were not in fact disputed before the Court of Appeal and also added that the New Zealand and Hong Kong bank accounts were managed by Rodney and Sandra Chin in New Zealand.

Further, the Court did not accept that the Court should distinguish between acts of "superior" and "administrative" management, noting that this approach would have hearing authorities treating some dimensions of management as wholly irrelevant while conflating the test of "centre of management" in section OE 2(1)(c) with the "acts of directors" test in section OE 2(1)(d) of the Income Tax Act 1994 ("the Act").

#### Was Vinelight Nominees liable to account for RWT?

There were four sub-issues:

1.  Did section 138G of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") preclude Vinelight from making arguments under section NF 2(4)(b)(ii) of the Act?
2.  If not, were the interest payments made part of Vinelight's taxable activities for the purposes of section NF 2(4)(b)(ii)?
3.  Did section NF 5 of the Act apply so as to exclude Vinelight for liability to deduct RWT?
4.  Was the Commissioner time-barred from making RWT assessments for the 1999 to the 2001 income years?

_**Section 138G**_

The Court noted that section 138G of the TAA requires that the parties make full disclosure in their respective statements of position ("SOP") to ensure as far as possible tax disputes are resolved in dialogue between taxpayers and the Commissioner, not in litigation.

The Court noted that the appellants' claim under section NF 2(4)(b)(ii) of the Act did not surface until counsel opened his case before the TRA.

The Court stated that neither party's SOP identified the taxable activity issue at all. While the Commissioner listed section NF 2 in a list of provisions relied upon in her SOP in support of an unrelated proposition, this was listed only because it is the charging provision for RWT and could not put in issue all of its requirements. The Court noted that a reasonable person would not think the Commissioner had made taxable activity an issue merely by listing section NF 2 for a wholly unrelated and uncontroversial purpose. Further, the Court concluded that Vinelight knew all along that the Commissioner relied upon section NF 2 and therefore could have denied liability under that provision in its own SOP.

While the Court declined to address the merits of the submissions on the issue, for completeness the Court referred to the TRA's conclusion that the interest was paid in the course of Vinelight's taxable activities.

_**Section NF 5**_

The Court concluded that Vinelight's claim that it was not liable to deduct RWT, as it had on reasonable grounds and having made all reasonable inquiries concluded that Weyand was non-resident, could not succeed.

The Court noted that the High Court appeared to accept the appellants' argument that the "all reasonable inquiries" test was confined to inquiries as to facts. However, the Court disagreed, seeing no reason to confine the natural meaning of the language in that way. The Court noted that in this setting, it may well be reasonable to expect some taxpayers to make inquiries of a relevantly qualified professional advisor, observing that the reasonableness requirement extends to the content of the taxpayer's inquiries.

As for the "reasonable grounds" requirement, the Court accepted that advice from a qualified advisor may supply reasonable grounds provided the taxpayer has made reasonable inquiries of the advisor.

The Court considered that Vinelight had not actually concluded that Weyand was non-resident and in fact (agreeing with the High Court) all Vinelight did was follow a course of action devised by Ernst & Young, assuming it would work. The Court accepted that advice was not given by Ernst & Young on this point until 2003 and did not accept that residency advice was implicit in earlier work provided by Ernst & Young.

_**Time bar**_

The appellants argued that while RWT returns were not filed, a return need not be filed in the prescribed form and, in this case, the AIL returns were sufficient.

The Court noted that section 50 of the TAA provides that every person required to deduct RWT shall deliver to the Commissioner a statement in a form authorised by the Commissioner showing such details in relation to the payment of RWT as the Commissioner may prescribe. The Court concluded that the Commissioner has prescribed the form IR 15P (as opposed to the IR 15A for the return of AIL) and therefore agreed with the High Court that the time bar did not apply in this case.

#### Tax avoidance arrangement

The Court (agreeing with both the TRA and the High Court) found that the arrangement was a tax avoidance arrangement. Further, the Court concluded that the tax avoidance was not only a more than merely incidental purpose of the arrangement. Rather, it was the dominant purpose of the arrangement.

#### Reconstruction

There were two sub-issues:

1.  Did section 138G of the TAA prevent the appellants from challenging the Commissioner's reconstruction?
2.  If not, was the Commissioner's reconstruction possible in law?

_**Section 138G**_

The Court, agreeing with both the TRA and the High Court, considered that the reconstruction issue had not been sufficiently disclosed in the SOPs. While the Commissioner raised the reconstruction power, that discussion was directed to a different issue, namely who might suffer the consequences of reconstruction. The Court concluded that the Commissioner could not reasonably be expected to appreciate that an issue arose about her capacity to reconstruct.

_**Was reconstruction possible in law?**_

The appellants submitted that the reconstruction power does not extend to adjusting tax rates.

The Court concluded that the Commissioner did not adjust the gross resident withholding income, any deductions or available losses. Rather, the Court considered that NRWT is payable when a payment of non-resident withholding income is made, and where NRWT is not paid, the sum in default becomes a statutory debt payable to the Commissioner. In this case, the Commissioner did not need to adjust the level of non-resident withholding income. Rather, she only needed to assess Vinelight for NRWT on its reported non-resident withholding income. Accordingly, the Court considered that the Commissioner did not exercise her power of reconstruction.

#### Shortfall penalties

The Court considered that none of the grounds of appeal were about as likely as not to be correct and that the arrangement was entered into for the dominant purpose of avoiding tax. Accordingly, the shortfall penalties were correctly imposed by the Commissioner under sections 141B and 141D of the TAA.

Resident withholding tax and intermediaries or agents
=====================================================

2009 amendments clarify the tax credit and RWT rules for amounts received by agents acting for NZ residents with foreign investment fund interests.

**Sections RE 10B, RM 8(3) to (6) of the Income Tax Act 2007; section NF 2E of the Income Tax Act 2004**

The amendments clarify the operation of the tax credit and resident withholding tax (RWT) rules in relation to amounts received by intermediaries or agents acting on behalf of a New Zealand resident with foreign investment fund (FIF) interests.

The amendments apply to a natural person who begins an income year with more than $50,000 of attributing interests in a FIF, and who consequently is required to include FIF income from those interests as taxable income.

### Background

If a New Zealand resident has more than $50,000 of FIF interests during an income year:

*   section EX 59(2) requires the resident to calculate FIF income using a FIF calculation method (section EX 59(2)); and
*   all distributions derived from the attributing FIF interests in that income year are no longer treated as dividends (section CD 36).

Section NF 7(5) of the 2004 Act permitted either the intermediary or agent, or the New Zealand beneficial recipient of the distribution to apply for a refund of any amounts withheld by the intermediary or agent. However, that provision applied only if the amount withheld was in relation to resident withholding income. As the effect of section CD 36 was that distributions from the FIF were no longer dividends, technically, no refund could be made.

It is considered there are likely to be a number of cases where the intermediary or agent may not necessarily be aware of the change in circumstances of the New Zealand resident at the time the distribution is on-paid to the New Zealand resident. In these circumstances, it is appropriate that amounts withheld from a distribution from a FIF by an intermediary or agent in the belief the distribution is resident passive income should be treated as a RWT credit.

### Key features

A technical amendment is necessary for both the 2004 or 2007 Income Tax Acts to ensure that a tax credit is available for a New Zealand resident when an intermediary or agent for the resident:

*   received a distribution from attributing interests in foreign investment funds owned by the New Zealand resident; and
*   subsequently on-paid the distribution to the New Zealand resident; and
*   withheld an amount on account of resident withholding tax in the belief the resident was within the $50,000 threshold rule in section CQ 5(1)(d) or (e) and that the on-payment was resident passive income of the New Zealand resident.

The amendments provide that:

*   the intermediary, agent or the recipient can apply for a refund of the amount withheld if section EX 59(2) applies to the recipient; or
*   if no application for a refund is made by 31 March following the withholding, the amount withheld is treated as a RWT tax credit for the recipient.

### Detailed analysis

Section RM 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Act has been amended to provide that the intermediary, agent or recipient of the distribution may apply for a refund of the amount withheld. However, the application must be made to the Commissioner on or before the 31 March following the date of the withholding.

If no application is made by the 31 March following the date the amount is withheld from the distribution from the FIF interests by the intermediary or agent, section RE 10B treats the amount withheld by the intermediary or agent as a RWT tax credit of the recipient. The amount withheld by an intermediary or agent is treated as RWT for the purposes of subpart LA, section LB 3, and the refund rules in sections RM 1 to RM 10.

Section RE 10B(2) also provides that the amount withheld is treated as tax paid in excess for the purposes of Part 10B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (Transfers of excess tax). These amendments ensure both the recipient and the Commissioner can use the amount withheld to satisfy other tax obligations of the recipient.

Similar amendments have been made in section NF 2E in the Income Tax Act 2004 to permit the amount withheld to be treated as a RWT tax credit. This amendment also ensures that section NF 7(5) of the 2004 Act can operate as intended to validate past applications by the intermediary, agent, or recipient for a refund of the amounts withheld.

### Application date

The amendments in section RE 10B and RM 8 apply from the beginning of the 2008-09 income year.

The amendment made in section NF 2E of the Income tax Act 2004 applies from the beginning of the 2005-06 income year.

Resident Withholding Tax and Offshore Unit Trusts
=================================================

2005 amendment to the RWT rules establishes a RWT 'proxy' for the payer and recipient of resident withholding income when the payer is non-resident.

**Sections LD 3, NF 2(1), NF 2(1A), NF 2(1AB), NF 2(1B), NF 2AA, NF 2A(1), NF 2A(3) and NF 4(9) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 1994; sections 25(11), 26(1) and (2), 27(1), 33A(1)(b)(iv), 33A(1)(b)(x)(B), 50 and 51(6) of the Tax Administration Act 1994**

The resident withholding tax (RWT) rules in the Income Tax Act have been amended to establish an RWT "proxy" for the payer and the recipient of the resident withholding income when the payer is non-resident. The "proxy" must pay to the Commissioner the RWT calculated in relation to the resident withholding income.

The use of the new RWT proxy mechanism is voluntary for both the RWT proxy and the recipient of the resident withholding income. In addition, the recipient can elect the correct marginal tax rate.

The amendments were introduced by Supplementary Order Paper 337 at the select committee stage of the legislative process.

#### Background

The Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 enacted in December 2004 resulted in distributions from offshore unit trusts that were previously treated as "non-taxable bonus issues" for New Zealand tax purposes being treated as dividends and taxed accordingly.

As a consequence, individual investors in offshore unit trusts derive a dividend, from which no foreign or New Zealand tax has been withheld. These investors have a New Zealand income tax liability and may be required to file an income tax return.

Ideally the RWT rules should allow fund managers to withhold tax on behalf of investors. The RWT rules require the deduction of a withholding tax from interest and dividends paid to New Zealand residents. RWT is deducted at source at the time the interest or dividend income is paid, thus eliminating the need in many cases to file an income tax return because the correct amount of tax will have been withheld.

The income tax legislation did not previously allow New Zealand fund managers, who are not agents, to elect to be subject to the RWT rules in relation to investments in offshore unit trusts by New Zealand residents.

The amendments will make it easier for individuals to meet their tax obligations accurately, lowering compliance and administration costs. A key feature of the new arrangement is that it is voluntary. The decision to offer the withholding facility is a matter for each fund manager to consider.

#### Key features

The RWT rules have been amended to allow:

*   New Zealand fund managers to elect to offer a withholding tax facility (to be an RWT "proxy");
*   the correct marginal tax rate to be nominated when an investor elects to use the withholding tax facility; and
*   the requirement that the investor files an annual income tax return to be removed.

#### Application date

The amendments apply from 21 December 2004.

#### Detailed analysis

##### Liability to pay resident withholding tax

Section NF 2(1A)(b) establishes a liability to pay RWT to the Commissioner if a person is an RWT proxy for the payer and recipient of the resident withholding income. It recognises that although the RWT proxy is not the payer of the resident withholding income, the proxy must, nevertheless, pay to the Commissioner the RWT calculated in relation to that income.

Section NF 2(1A)(a) preserves the existing position for all other instances where the person who makes the payment of resident withholding income must deduct the RWT from the resident withholding income and pay the RWT to the Commissioner.

New section NF 2(1B) prescribes the formula to work out the amount of RWT to be paid to the Commissioner by the RWT proxy when resident withholding income in the form of a dividend is paid. The formula ensures that the RWT is calculated in relation to the net amount that is paid to the recipient. The formula is:

|     |
| --- |
| a x b |
| 1 \- a |

Where:

1.  is the appropriate rate of RWT, expressed as a percentage, specified in Schedule 14, clause 1
2.  is the amount paid to the recipient of the dividend.

For example, if the recipient's marginal tax rate is 33% and the recipient receives 67 cents, then the amount of resident withholding income is $1. The formula calculates the amount of RWT as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| .33 x 67 | \= 33 cents of RWT is paid to the Commissioner |
| 1 \- .33 |

The formula therefore ensures that the correct amount of RWT is paid to the Commissioner.

##### Election to be an RWT proxy

New section NF 2AA has been inserted to prescribe how a person elects to be an RWT proxy.

*   A person is an RWT proxy if: the proxy gives to the Commissioner a notice of election;
*   the payer is a non-resident unit trust;
*   the recipient is a natural person or a trustee of a qualifying trust;
*   the recipient has asked the RWT proxy to act as a proxy;
*   the proxy has agreed;
*   the resident withholding income is a dividend; and
*   the payment is made during the term of the election.

A notice of election must be in writing and contain:

*   the election to be an RWT proxy for dividends distributed by the payer;
*   the name and address of the payer; and
*   the date from which the election is effective.

The election is effective from the date nominated in the notice until the Commissioner receives written notice from the proxy that the election is cancelled.

##### Election to apply appropriate rate of deduction

Section NF 2A(1) has been amended to allow a recipient to elect that an RWT proxy apply the appropriate RWT rate specified in Schedule 14, clause 1(a), (b) or (c).

##### Payment of resident withholding tax to Commissioner

Section NF 4, concerning the payment of RWT deductions to the Commissioner, has been amended to incorporate the RWT proxy mechanism.

##### Resident withholding tax deductions to be credited against income tax assessed

Section LD 3 has been amended to ensure that the payment of RWT by an RWT proxy in relation to resident withholding income can be credited against the income tax liability of the recipient of the resident withholding income.

##### Consequential amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994

To ensure that the RWT proxy mechanism is subject to the administrative requirements in the Tax Administration Act 1994 relating to RWT, sections 25(11), 26(1) and (2), 27(1), 50 and 51(6) have been consequentially amended. In general, this has been achieved by ensuring the payer of the RWT- - either by the RWT proxy or the payer of the resident withholding income - is subject to these requirements.

##### Annual returns of income not required

Section 33A(1)(b)(iv) has been amended to provide that an annual income tax return is required when a taxpayer has not had the correct amount of tax withheld from interest or a dividend subject to the RWT proxy rules, where that amount is more than $200.

Section 33A(1)(b)(x) requires that an income tax return be filed when a taxpayer has, in effect, received more than $200 of foreign interest or dividends, irrespective of whether the correct amount of New Zealand tax has been paid on that income. This provision has been amended to ensure that it does not apply to resident withholding income subject to the RWT proxy rules.

In section 33A(2), paragraphs (cb)(ii) and (f) have been repealed because they are redundant. Their effect is already achieved in section 33A(1).

[Taxation (Consequential Rate Alignment and Remedial Matters) Act 2009](/new-legislation/act-articles/2009-63/taxation "Taxation (Consequential Rate Alignment and Remedial Matters) Act 2009")

Resident withholding tax rates on interest income
=================================================

2009 legislation introduces new resident withholding tax rates to reflect recent changes to the company and individual tax rates.

_**Section RE 12(5) and schedule 1, part D, tables 2 and 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections 25A and 33A of the Tax Administration Act 1994**_

Resident withholding tax (RWT) rates on interest income have been aligned with recent changes to the company and individual income tax rates.

### Background

RWT is a withholding tax based on the marginal tax rate of the recipient of interest income. Its purpose is to ensure that tax is paid at source on that income at a rate that closely approximates the recipient's marginal tax rate. Compliance and administrative costs are therefore minimised as recipients are less likely to request a personal tax summary or file a tax return if tax is withheld at the correct rate.

Previously the RWT rates were: 19.5%, 33% and 38% or 39%, which aligned with the former income tax rates. The default RWT rate where a person had provided a tax file number but had not elected a rate was 19.5%.

The legislation introduces new RWT rates to reflect recent changes to the company and individual tax rates.

### Key features

Schedule 1, part D, tables 2 and 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 introduces the following new RWT rates:

| **Marginal incometax rates** | **Income band** | **Former RWT rates** | **New RWT rates** | **Application date** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 12.5% | 0 - $14,000 | 19.5% | 12.5% | 1 April 2010 |
| 21% | $14,001 - $48,000 | 21% | 1 April 2010 |
| 30% | N/A - Company tax rate | 33% | 30% | 1 April 2011 or from 1 April 2010 at payer's discretion |
| 33% | $48,001 - $70,000 | 33% | No change |
| 38% | $70,001 | 38% or 39% | 38% | 1 April 2010 |

The amendments also allow Inland Revenue to instruct interest payers to change a person's RWT rate if the person's rate is inconsistent with their marginal tax rate.

### Application dates

The changes generally apply from 1 April 2010.

The 30% RWT rate for companies applies from 1 April 2011 but is optional for interest payers from 1 April 2010.

### Detailed analysis

#### _Default rate_

A new 21% RWT rate applies for those who were previously on the 19.5% default rate. Previously, the default rate of RWT that applied if the recipient of interest (not a company) did not elect a rate was 19.5%.

Consequently, row 5 of schedule 1, part D, table 2 provides that anyone who was on the 19.5% RWT rate before 1 April 2010 (either by default or by election) will have their rate changed to 21% from that date.

For people who open a new account with an interest payer after 31 March 2010 but do not elect a rate, row 2 of schedule 1, part D, table 2 introduces a new 38% default rate. This is to encourage people to elect the rate that aligns with their marginal tax rate.

#### _Non-declaration rate_

A new 38% rate applies from 1 April 2010 to persons who do not supply their tax file number to their interest payer. This new non-declaration rate aligns with the new highest marginal tax rate.

The 38% rate in row 1 of schedule 1, part D, table 2 therefore replaces the previous 39% RWT rate that applied before 1 April 2010 to those taxpayers who did not supply their tax file number to their interest payer.

#### _New 12.5% rate_

Row 7 of schedule 1, part D, table 2 introduces a new 12.5% RWT rate. A person may elect the 12.5% rate only if they have a reasonable expectation at the time of election that their income for the income year will be $14,000 or less and they provide their tax file number to their interest payer.

The 12.5% rate is not available to trustees other than those who receive interest as the trustee of a testamentary trust to which section HC 37 applies. Trustees of a testamentary trust do not need to satisfy a "reasonable expectation" test regarding their income but do need to provide their tax file number to their interest payer.

#### _38% RWT rate_

If a person has previously elected the 39% rate, it is intended that their interest payer will shift the person to the new 38% RWT rate from 1 April 2010.

Consequently, the 39% rate has been removed from table 2 and replaced with the 38% rate, in line with the reduction in the highest marginal tax rate.

#### _RWT rates for companies (section RE 12(5) and schedule_ **_1, part_** **_D, table_** **_3)_**

Section RE 12(5) introduces an optional 30% RWT rate for interest paid to a company which may be applied for the 2010-11 income year.

Specifically, an interest payer may choose to apply an RWT rate of 30% if interest is paid to a company or a portfolio investment entity (PIE) in the income year when the RWT rate would have otherwise been 33%. The provision does not apply to companies that are trustees or Māori authorities, the rates for which are set out in schedule 1, part D, table 2.

The 33% RWT rate has been replaced in schedule 1, part D, table 3 by a 30% RWT rate from 1 April 2011. The 30% rate applies to companies that are not trustees or Māori authorities and which previously elected the 33% rate before 1 April 2011. The 30% rate also applies to companies that have supplied their tax file number but which did not elect a rate

For PIEs that are trusts, the 30% rate may be applied under section RE 12(5) for the 1 April 2010-11 income year and will apply from 1 April 2011 under schedule 1, part D, table 3.

Additionally, in schedule 1, part D, table 3, the 39% RWT rate has been replaced by a 38% rate, which also applies from 1 April 2010 for companies that elected a 39% rate before that date.

#### _Inland Revenue may instruct interest payers to change an inconsistent RWT rate (section 25A of the Tax Administration Act 1994)_

New section 25A adopts a similar approach to that used by Inland Revenue in relation to secondary tax codes, where it may instruct employers to use a particular PAYE tax code for an individual taxpayer.

Accordingly, if Inland Revenue considers that a person receiving interest income is on an RWT rate (whether by election or by default) that is inconsistent with their marginal tax rate, it may instruct the interest payer to change the person's RWT rate and provide the appropriate rate. The rate provided by Inland Revenue must be used by the interest payer as soon as reasonably practicable after the date that they are notified.

The interest recipient may subsequently elect a different rate, in which case the interest payer must use that rate. However, Inland Revenue may instruct the interest payer to change the person's rate the next year.

[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

You pay tax on interest and dividends you earn from bank accounts and investments you have in New Zealand. You also pay tax on income from overseas accounts and investments. The payer of interest or dividends will withhold tax before making the payment to you. This is called [resident withholding tax (RWT)](/api/glossary/item?id={BEA5D13B-2EC0-45C7-881F-46537F7BF005})
.

Your payer, for example your bank or fund manager, deducts RWT from your interest or dividend payment before they pay you.

How much tax do I pay?
----------------------

The amount of RWT your payer deducts depends on your tax status, the type of interest or dividends you earn, and the information you give your payer. For example:

*   interest payments from a savings account or term deposit to an individual are taxed at an RWT rate that you choose, depending on your income. If you do not choose a rate, then the default rate of 33% applies.
*   dividends and unit trust distributions are all taxed at a RWT rate of 33%, while portfolio investment entities (PIEs) are taxed at different rates depending on the type of fund
*   interest payments are taxed at the non-declaration rate if you have not given your IRD number to the interest payer – from 1 April 2020, the non-declaration rate is 45%.

At the end of the tax year, your income will be squared up to see if you've paid the right amount of tax.

Investment income reporting
---------------------------

 In summary.

*   Details of all investment income are reported to us by payers on a regular basis.
*   'Investment Income Information' is included in your income profile and can be seen in myIR. This includes the income paid, and the tax withheld from the payment. Income is classified by type - interest, PIE, dividend and source (payer).

Te moni whiwhi whare rēti me te utu tāke Residential rental income and paying tax on it
=======================================================================================

Generally, the payments you get from renting out property are income. You need to pay tax on rental income in the year it's earned.

It's also important to understand your obligations for:

*   [GST](/api/glossary/item?id={682C0E7B-0612-4CC3-90E0-683E3A9F547B})
     (if you're renting out [short-stay accommodation](/api/glossary/item?id={362ACC2B-2932-4683-92E8-9A537F6C9A2E})
    )
*   rental property [excess deductions](/api/glossary/item?id={C3E1928C-9525-4DB5-BBD8-8B5FBF8EC353})
    
*   keeping records

Who must pay tax on the rental income
-------------------------------------

Most people who earn rental income will pay income tax on it. This includes people who:

*   have overseas residential property
*   are joint owners of a rental property
*   who are not New Zealand residents but earn rental income from their New Zealand properties.

[Who pays tax on rental income](/property/renting-out-residential-property/residential-rental-income-and-paying-tax-on-it/who-pays-tax-on-rental-income)
 

Rental income and expense deductions
------------------------------------

Generally, you work out what tax there is to pay by deducting your allowable rental expenses from your gross rental income.

Your total allowable rental expenses and total rental income you earn go in the tax return you must fill in every year. 

The way you work out income and expenses is not the same for all residential property.

Check out tax by rental property type to see what to do for your property:

GST and renting out residential property 
-----------------------------------------

Residential rental income from renting out long-term is exempt from [GST](/api/glossary/item?id={682C0E7B-0612-4CC3-90E0-683E3A9F547B})
. You do not have to register, file or claim GST for your rental income or expenses.

Renting out short-stay accommodation is a [taxable activity for GST](/api/glossary/item?id={F966147A-3408-4CDD-A965-AF294365FA2D})
.

If you’re not already registered for GST, you need to:

*   add your short-stay rental income to income from your other taxable activities
*   register for GST if your total turnover is over $60,000 in a 12 month period.

[GST and renting out residential property](/property/renting-out-residential-property/gst-and-renting-out-residential-property)

Rental property excess deductions
---------------------------------

Sometimes your allowable rental expenses for your residential rental property are more than the [rental income](/api/glossary/item?id={675F39E7-69B6-4841-BAC7-F43CE3A12248})
. When this happens you're left with excess deductions.

Generally, you cannot offset excess deductions against other income in your tax return. An example of other income is salary and wages.

You’ll need to carry excess deductions forward into the next tax year you earn residential rental income.

Keeping rental records
----------------------

Remember to keep records of income and expenses for 7 years.

Ngā tangohanga whare rēti Residential rental property deductions
================================================================

What

Residential property deductions rules (also known as the ring-fencing rules) and your residential rental property

Who

People who earn residential rental property income and deduct their allowable rental expenses

When

End of the tax year

When you own a rental property, you're likely to have maintenance and administrative costs. You can claim all or some of these costs as a deduction against your rental income. This reduces the tax you pay on the rental income you receive.

You can claim deductions up to the amount of rental income you earn in a year, including income from the sale of a property. This is called ring-fencing. Because rental deductions can be claimed only against rental income, you can not offset excess deductions against other income such as salary or wages.

When you have excess deductions, you must carry them forward from year to year and deduct them when your residential property makes income. 

[Rental property expenses](https://www.ird.govt.nz/property/renting-out-residential-property/residential-rental-income-and-paying-tax-on-it/rental-expense-deductions)

Check if the residential property deduction rules apply to you
--------------------------------------------------------------

The residential property deduction rules will apply if you own rental property in the following capacity:

*   individual owner
*   partner in a partnership
*   shareholder in a look-through company
*   shareholder in a close company 
*   trustee of trust.

Property the residential property deduction rules apply to
----------------------------------------------------------

The residential property deduction rules apply to all your [residential land](/api/glossary/item?id={7DA0BEE9-EA9D-4371-A402-C0A889CED321})
 including your overseas residential property.

From the 2022 income year residential land includes property used for short-stay accommodation if the dwelling is not the owner’s main home. This includes business premises rented out through a digital platform. For example, Airbnb, Bookabach, and other holiday homes.

Property the rules do not apply to
----------------------------------

The residential property deduction rules do not apply to:

*   your main home. If you have more than 1 home, this is the home you have the greatest connection with.
*   property that comes into the [mixed-use asset](/api/glossary/item?id={F1D02979-341A-48C1-A59D-72275CED41D6})
     rules (for example holiday homes)
*   property that will be taxed on sale, regardless of when it’s sold. Unless the property was acquired for a land-related business, you must let us know for it to be excluded from the residential property deduction rules.
*   farmland
*   property used mainly as business premises
*   property owned by a company other than a [close company](/api/glossary/item?id={5E2E6811-9ED0-4912-BBEC-567CD5787B6E})
     
*   employee accommodation
*   property owned by Government enterprises.

Choosing a basis to work out residential property deductions
------------------------------------------------------------

To get started, choose a basis to work out your deductions. You can use the portfolio basis, the individual property basis, or both options together if you have more than 1 property.

The key difference between the options is with the:

*   portfolio basis you can use the deductions for a property against the income from another property in the portfolio
*   individual property basis you cannot use the deductions for 1 property against the income from another property.

We recommend that you talk to a tax professional about which approach is best for you.

Resource consent not a stand-alone asset
========================================

2013 case note – High Court found that resource consents for electricity generation projects not stand-alone assets – capital, revenue, feasibility expenditure.

Case

TrustPower Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2004

### Summary

The High Court found that resource consents acquired for the purpose of constructing electricity generation projects were not stand-alone assets separate from the projects to which they related.

### Impact of decision

Resource consents obtained as part of a project, while possibly valuable as a bundle of rights, will not be stand-alone assets separable from the projects to which they relate.

While the Court found that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") could not raise the land improvement point procedurally, it indicated that the Commissioner would have been unsuccessful on this point.

### Facts

TrustPower is an electricity generator and retailer. It generates (by hydro or wind) approximately one-half of the electricity that it sells and buys the remainder.

TrustPower's approach to its generation is centred around the notion of the development pipeline, which has been set up by the company to give it flexibility in deciding which project it wishes to pursue at any given time. A project is developed along the pipeline, with a final commitment to go ahead with the construction of the project/power plant being made only when TrustPower deems the economic circumstances to be acceptable.

In the period between July 2005 and November 2007, TrustPower applied for, and obtained, consents ("the resource consents") in respect of four projects.

TrustPower refers to the resource consents obtained for the projects in the development pipeline as "Type 2" consents, to distinguish them from consents relating to existing property or plant (which are "Type 1" consents).

Each of the applications for the resource consents included an extensive "Assessment of Effects on the Environment" ("AEE"), pursuant to section 88(2) (b) and Schedule 4 of the Resource Management Act 1991.

TrustPower incurred approximately $17.7 million in expenditure in applying for and obtaining "Type 2" resource consents in the tax years ended 31 March 2006, 2007 and 2008.

### Decision

#### _Are the resource consents obtained by TrustPower, on a stand-alone basis, assets?_

Andrews J referred to the relevant case law (Case _T53_ (1998) 18 NZTC 8,404 (TRA)_, Milburn New Zealand Limited v CIR_ (2001) 20 NZTC 17,017 (HC)_,_ and _ECC Quarries Limited v Watkis (Inspector of Quarries)_ \[1977\] 1WLR 1386 (ChD)) ("_ECC Quarries_"), which discussed as obiter the nature of resource consents and licences, and distinguished all three on the basis that the taxpayer in each scenario was committed to undertaking the operation for which the consents were required. Andrews J decided that these cases are ones involving what TrustPower described as "functional capital assets", and are akin to "Type 1" consents for existing operations. Further, as each of these cases found their respective consents to be inseparable from the business or land to which they relate, case law supported the conclusion that the resource consents in this case cannot be seen as separate assets.

Andrews J also accepted TrustPower's evidence that the resource consents provided no independent value to TrustPower.

Andrews J concluded that the resource consents obtained by TrustPower with respect to the four projects were not stand-alone assets, separate from the projects to which they relate. The expenditure incurred in obtaining them must, therefore, be treated in the same manner as the projects (ie, as feasibility expenditure on revenue account).

#### _Application of BP Australia test (_BP Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation for the Commonwealth of Australia _\[1966\] AC 224 (PC))_

Although the decision on the above issue was enough for Andrews J to decide the case in favour of TrustPower, her Honour considered the _BP Australia_ indicia in order to determine, whether, if the resource consents were separate assets, they were capital or revenue assets.

#### _What was the need or occasion that called for the expenditure?_

Andrews J accepted that the purpose or occasion for the expenditure was not solely or principally to obtain resource consents. The expenditure was incurred as part of TrustPower's investigation into the feasibility of the projects to define the parameters of possible projects, and to enable an assessment of possible projects against TrustPower's other options for sourcing electricity to sell to customers.

Andrews J found that this aspect points to the expenditure being on revenue rather than capital account.

#### _Were the payments made from fixed or circulating capital?_

Andrews J did not find the fixed/circulating capital test useful in this case for two reasons:

1.  First, there is little or no evidence as to the source of funds used for the expenditure.
2.  Secondly, even if the focus is on the use of the expenditure, then it would require a determination of the nature of the resource consents (as capital or revenue assets) before it could be applied.

#### _Was the expenditure of a once and for all nature producing assets or advantages that were of an enduring benefit for TrustPower?_

Andrews J stated that she considered this test within the context of TrustPower's development pipeline.

Andrews J accepted TrustPower's submissions that most of the expenditure was not primarily directed at obtaining the resource consents, but was to assess the feasibility of the projects and so was recurrent in nature, being continually incurred to investigate and define the feasibility of the various projects.

Andrews J referred to the case of _Commissioner of Taxation v Ampol Exploration Ltd_ (1986) 13 FCR 545 to support her conclusion that this aspect of the test indicates that the expenditure was of a revenue nature.

#### _Were the assets or advantages produced of an enduring benefit to TrustPower?_

Although Andrews J accepted TrustPower's submission that there is an inherent uncertainty surrounding the terms and duration of resource consents, and whether projects will be progressed further, the consents last for a significant period, and therefore provide an enduring benefit.

Andrews J found that this aspect indicates that the expenditure incurred in obtaining resource consents should be regarded as capital rather than revenue expenditure.

#### _How would the payment be treated on ordinary principles of commercial accounting?_

Expert evidence on accounting standards was called by both parties. The experts focussed on two New Zealand Equivalent to International Accounting Standards ("NZIAS") standards: _NZIAS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment_ and _NZIAS 38 - Intangible Assets_.

For the purposes of this discussion, Andrews J found that if the resource consents are stand-alone assets (contrary to her earlier finding), they could only be intangible assets. As such, it is doubtful that NZIAS 16 would apply.

Andrews J concluded that while an offer was made to purchase one of the projects, including the resource consents, TrustPower did not apply for the consents with the intention of selling them. Further, in the light of TrustPower's evidence that there were always more projects in the development pipeline than it had the financial and resource capability to construct, TrustPower could not have demonstrated the availability of adequate technical, financial, or other resources to complete the projects and use the resource consents.

On this basis, under NZIAS 38, the expenditure would not be recognisable as capital and would properly be treated as revenue.

#### _Was the expenditure incurred on the business structure of TrustPower, or as part of the process by which income was earned?_

Andrews J accepted TrustPower's submission that the consents are not means by which TrustPower can produce income, in the absence of a commitment to proceed to construct the project concerned. Although the consents were necessary for the project to be constructed, they did not generate any electricity, and they did not create any income for TrustPower.

Andrews J was satisfied that, even if the resource consents were separate assets, they could not be regarded as part of TrustPower's business structure. Andrews J concluded that this aspect indicated that the resource consents should be found to be revenue assets.

#### _From a practical and business point of view, is the expenditure to be regarded as capital or revenue in nature?_

Andrews J concluded that, even if the resource consents were stand-alone assets, from a business and practical point of view, they were revenue assets, and the expenditure to obtain them was revenue in nature.

TrustPower did not use the resource consents in the tax years concerned, and did not generate any income from the consents. Andrews J accepted that the resource consents were of value to TrustPower only as part of a "bundle", "package", or "suite" of rights, and as part of the development pipeline, which itself is only one part of TrustPower's business development.

Andrews J found that TrustPower's expenditure incurred in obtaining the resource consents was incurred as part of the feasibility process and was, therefore, revenue in nature.

#### _Was TrustPower's expenditure in obtaining resource consents incurred for the purposes of improving its interest in the underlying land?_

The Commissioner submitted that the resource consents provided TrustPower with the rights to construct and operate power plants on the land, and thereby improved the functionality of the land. The Commissioner referred to _ECC Quarries_ as authority for the proposition that expenditure incurred to obtain planning permission to improve the functionality of land (ie, a capital asset) is capital.

Andrews J found that the present case is distinguishable from the situation in _ECC Quarries_ where the planning permission could not, by law, be transferred.

Andrews J concluded that if she was required to consider the Commissioner's argument, that the resource consents enhanced the value of the underlying land and were therefore capital, she would find against the Commissioner.

The Commissioner has appealed this decision and she will continue to apply her view of the law in the interim.
