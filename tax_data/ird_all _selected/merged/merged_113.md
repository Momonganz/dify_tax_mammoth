CbC 2.0 supports the implementation and ongoing implementation of the GloBE rules. Cabinet approval is sought to note these estimated costs and to delegate to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue the decision on funding sources for this initiative. Relation to Government Priorities 4.This proposal relates to the international tax workstream on the Government’s tax policy work programme. The Government is committed to ensuring that MNEs pay their fair share of tax. This includes participating in multilateral solutions to the challenge posed by economic globalisation to the international tax framework. Executive Summary 5.The GloBE rules are the main part of the G20/OECD-led Pillar Two proposal. The purpose of the GloBE rules is to ensure that large MNEs are subject to tax of at least 15% on their mobile income, in every country where that income is earned. This will reduce the incentive for them to take advantage of low tax rates and other tax concessions. 6.The success of this proposal depends on it being adopted by a critical mass of countries. At the moment, it appears that adoption by the EU, Japan, Switzerland and Canada is very likely, with adoption also likely in Australia and the UK. This is more than enough to be a critical mass. By adopting GloBE rules, New Zealand will contribute to that critical mass, as well as raise a modest amount of revenue and simplify compliance for New Zealand-based MNEs. Doc 1 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 7. Subject to Cabinet approval, the changes recommended in this paper will be included in the next available omnibus tax bill, and apply from a date to be specified by Order in Council, giving Cabinet the flexibility to align the application date of our GloBE rules with other countries. 8. This initiative will require up to $17.300 million operating and capital funding which will be a mix of Crown Budget 2023 funding and Vote Revenue self-funding to be agreed as part of the Budget 2023 process 9. The estimated costs of $17.300 million includes $8.600 million capital and $8.700 million operating, over the forecast period (2022/23 to 2026/27) for the up-front build and on-going administration costs, covering the GloBE rules (Pillar Two) and the associated country by country reporting (CbC 2.0). 10. We currently estimate up to $25.000 million of additional tax revenue per annum beginning from 2026/27. This equates to $25.000 million in the forecast period (2022/23 to 2026/27). We recommend that the additional tax revenue be managed as a positive impact on the 2023 Budget operating allowance. 11. The net positive financial impact of this initiative over the forecast period (2022/23 to 2026/27) is $7.700 million (2022/23 to 2026/27) and $21.900 million per annum thereafter. Background 12. Pillar Two is a G20/OECD initiative seeking to address tax base erosion risks caused by profit shifting by large MNEs. These risks arise because these MNEs can choose to shift income, particularly from capital or intangible property, to countries which charge no or little tax on that income. Sometimes this is because of general low tax rates. Other times it is because of targeted tax incentives. 13. The main plank of Pillar Two is the GloBE rules. These rules will ensure that large MNEs are subject to tax of at least 15% on their mobile income, in every country where that income is earned, reducing profit shifting incentives. They apply to MNEs with annual revenues of €750 million or more. The OECD estimates that they will increase global corporate income tax by approximately 9%, or US$220 billion pa. 14. The GloBE Model Rules (the Model Rules) were finalised by the OECD in December 2021, with detailed commentary released in March 2022 and further guidance in February 2023. 15. The rules require an MNE to calculate its effective tax rate (ETR) by comparing its tax in a country with its accounting profit (with certain adjustments) for that country. If the ETR is less than 15%, it must calculate the GloBE top-up tax it has to pay. GloBE top- up tax is the tax required to bring the ETR on mobile income in a country up to 15%. An MNE calculates this by taking its adjusted accounting profit for the country, subtracting the substance-based income exclusion (broadly, a 5% return on the tangible assets and payroll expenses in the jurisdiction 1 ), and multiplying the result by the difference between 15% and its ETR. 1 For an initial 10-year period the rate is higher than 5% and will reduce over time to 5%. 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 16. The obligation to pay GloBE top-up tax is allocated between countries according to one of three rules. 16.1 First, if the country where the income is earned has enacted a domestic minimum tax (DMT) the top up tax will be paid to that country. 16.2 Second, the tax may be paid under the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) which applies on a top-down basis, giving the ultimate parent entity (UPE) country or an intermediate parent entity country the right to collect GloBE top-up tax for the country where the income is earned, if it has not been taxed under a DMT 16.3 Third, if no DMT or IIR applies to the under-taxed profits of a member of an MNE, the Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR) will allocate GloBE top-up tax in proportion to the group’s payroll costs and tangible asset values in each country with GloBE rules. This ensures that if the country where an MNE has its headquarters decides not to implement GloBE rules, the MNE will still have to pay top up tax if it operates in countries that have GloBE rules. 17. Approximately 20-25 New Zealand headquartered MNEs are in scope. GloBE Rules for New Zealand Should New Zealand adopt GloBE rules 18. New Zealand has a relatively high corporate tax rate and (with the exception of capital gains) a broad tax base. We have robust rules for ensuring income from New Zealand activities of foreign firms is taxed in New Zealand. We also have rules ensuring that New Zealand firms cannot easily avoid New Zealand tax on foreign income, except where that income arises from the conduct of an active business in the country where the income is taxable. 19. Despite our relatively strong rules for preventing profit shifting out of New Zealand, there remains some residual ability for foreign owned MNEs to shift taxable profits out of New Zealand to lower tax countries. Our strong rules also create a risk that companies will not want to be headquartered in New Zealand. 20. If the GloBE rules are adopted by a critical mass of countries, these risks will be significantly reduced. By adopting the GloBE rules, New Zealand will be contributing to the critical mass, supporting the success of the proposal internationally. Adopting the GloBE rules would also raise a modest amount of revenue, which would otherwise be collected by other countries under the UTPR. 21. s 9(2)(f)(iv) 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 22. We propose that New Zealand adopt GloBE rules, on the basis that they will come into effect only if a critical mass of other countries is also committed to bring GloBE rules into effect. 23. We propose that the GloBE rules application date is specified by an Order in Council. This will give Cabinet the flexibility to align the application date of our GloBE rules with their application date in other countries. Incorporation into New Zealand law by reference to the Model Rules 24. If a country adopts GloBE rules, it must adopt the OECD’s Model Rules, commentary and the administrative guidance (except for a domestic minimum tax, which is optional). Adoption is proposed to be by incorporation into domestic legislation (not by treaty). Where a country’s incorporating legislation departs from the Model Rules, there is a risk its GloBE rules will not be “qualifying” and other participating countries will continue to apply GloBE top-up tax to the country’s in-scope MNEs under the UTPR. To address the risk of our GloBE rules not being qualifying, we propose that the rules are incorporated into New Zealand law by reference to the Model Rules, Commentary and ad ministrative guidance. There will be limited areas where the rules need to be adapted or clarified, but the general approach will be to follow the agreed OECD Model Rules where possible. Where changes are required, these will respect the intended outcomes agreed in the OECD. 25. The effectiveness of the GloBE rules depends on consistency in their implementation in different countries. For example, there would be a high risk of over or under-taxation if implementing countries adopted different rules to measure the level of taxation and top-ups required in each country. Incorporating the rules into New Zealand law by reference to the Model Rules will reduce these risks. 26. It will be desirable, as a default position, for future changes to the OECD Model Rules to be automatically incorporated into New Zealand law, for periods beginning after those changes are made. That will reduce the burden of the GloBE rules on the New Zealand tax legislative process and maximise the likelihood of cross-country consistency and of our rules being qualifying. It will involve no substantive loss of sovereignty, since if it wants to, Parliament can enact law declaring that a change made at OECD level should not have effect in New Zealand. It will be important to ensure that as changes become effective, they are made publicly available to New Zealand taxpayers. 27. That said, we do propose that the 15% rate of tax under the GloBE rules is included in the proposed Bill. This will ensure that the fundamental issue of the tax rate, which sets the floor on the race to the bottom on taxes, can only be changed by Act of Parliament. No imputation credits for GloBE top-up tax under the IIR or UTPR 28. The Model Rules state that if the payment of tax under a country’s IIR or UTPR gives rise to a benefit, the IIR or UTPR will not be qualifying, and other participating countries s 9(2)(f)(iv) 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] will continue to apply GloBE top-up tax to the country’s in-scope MNEs under their UTPR. 29. Generally New Zealand income tax paid by a New Zealand company gives rise to an imputation credit, which can be passed on to the company’s shareholders when the company pays a dividend. However, if New Zealand’s IIR or UTPR give rise to an imputation credit, although sufficient tax will be paid at a corporate level under the IIR or UTPR, the entire GloBE top-up tax amount will be available as a dollar-for-dollar tax reduction to the shareholder’s tax liability and the imposition of the IIR or UTPR would be unwound on distribution. This benefit would result in our IIR and UTPR being non- qualifying, so we propose that GloBE top-up tax payable under the IIR and UTPR does not give rise to imputation credits. 30. A payment of tax under a country’s DMT which gives rise to an imputation credit, will not result in the DMT being non-qualifying. This is specifically provided for in the GloBE rules and reflects that, whilst the DMT must be based on the GloBE rules, it is a local tax on local profits. Charging tax allocated to New Zealand under the UTPR 31. The Model Rules include two approaches for charging tax allocated to a country by the UTPR. Individual countries are left to choose one of these approaches. The first approach denies an income tax deduction on otherwise deductible expenses of the MNE group. The second approach treats the GloBE top-up tax as a separate tax liability independent of income tax. The outcome of either approach must be to produce an additional cash tax impost in the country equal to the top-up tax allocated to it. The amount of this impost in a particular year is subject to the limit that it should not exceed the tax benefit of tax deductions otherwise available to entities in that country in that year. 32. We propose that this GloBE top-up tax be charged as a separate tax liability in New Zealand. This will ensure that the liability will not impact provisional tax. It will also eliminate some of the complexity of using the income tax system to impose a GloBE liability. We propose that the tax would be a joint and several liability of all New Zealand entities in an MNE group. Domestic minimum tax 33. The GloBE rules give countries the option to introduce a DMT, which would use the same tax base as the GloBE rules but give the local country priority in the collection of the GloBE top-up tax. For New Zealand, this tax would be closely based on the GloBE rules but would apply to undertaxed profits in New Zealand. 34. A DMT could be imposed solely on New Zealand headquartered in-scope MNEs or expanded to apply also to foreign headquartered in-scope MNEs operating in New Zealand. The likelihood of any MNEs being subject to GloBE top-up tax on their New Zealand income is low because of our high corporate income tax rate and general lack of tax preferences. However, we propose that a DMT be adopted for New Zealand headquartered MNEs as this will ensure that whatever happens, they do not need to pay tax under any other country’s UTPR. This will minimise their compliance costs. 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Denying a deduction or foreign tax credit for GloBE taxes in another country 35. The design of the GloBE rules makes it clear that GloBE top-up tax under the IIR or UTPR should not be either creditable or deductible for non-GloBE income tax purposes. The top-up tax is determined after taking into account income tax imposed on the income attributable to a country, whether that tax is imposed by the country itself or another country. 36. Given that the GloBE top-up tax is calculated after taking into account tax imposed under a worldwide or CFC tax regime, it would clearly not be appropriate for the GloBE top-up tax to be creditable or deductible when calculating those taxes. Therefore, we propose that taxpayers be denied a foreign tax credit or deduction for GloBE top-up tax paid in another country. This does not apply to tax imposed under a DMT. Additional policy decisions 37. This paper also seeks Cabinet’s agreement to delegate authority to the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue to make additional joint decisions on any policy and drafting issues arising as appropriate. Operational and financial impacts International tax work programme 38. There are currently seven proposed international tax initiatives on the government’s tax and social policy work programme which are expected to be implemented over the next four financial years and are at various stages of development. This international tax workstream aligns with OECD initiatives and is focused on people and businesses, including multinational companies, paying their fair share of tax. The initiatives are: • Taxation of the platform economy (included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022-23, Platform Economy and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2) • OECD Pillar One • OECD Pillar Two (Global anti-Base Erosion Rules – GloBE) • Country by Country reporting (CbC 2.0) – this supports the implementation and ongoing implementation of the GloBE rules • Crypto Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) • Common Reporting Standard schema (CRS 2.0) • 39. Because the initiatives are at different stages of development there is no overall picture of the financial impact. Officials’ current assessment is that once implemented, this work programme will be overall revenue positive – the tax revenue gains will exceed the implementation and on-going administration costs of the initiatives. Inland Revenue will update Ministers on the cumulative financial impact of this programme of international tax initiatives as the individual items are reported on for policy decisions and implementation. 40. The overall net financial gain (additional tax revenue less implementation and on-going administration costs) from the GloBE rules and Country by Country reporting 2.0 over s 9(2)(f)(iv) 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] the forecast period is $7.700 million (2022/23 to 2026/27) and $21.900 million per annum thereafter. OECD Pillar Two and Country by Country reporting Financial implications - Additional tax revenue 41. The proposed GloBE rules are expected to increase tax revenue. The following table sets out the estimated tax revenue increase. The estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty and are based on a number of assumptions including the final policies and rules. The timing of these revenue benefits will be dependent on policy implementation dates, and the timing of adoption by other countries. We currently estimate up to $25.000 million of additional tax revenue over the forecast period, with ongoing additional tax revenue of $25.000 million per annum. $million Crown revenue and receipts: Tax revenue 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 & outyears OECD GloBE rules - - - - 25.000 Country by Country reporting 2.0 - - - - - Total revenue - - - - 25.000 Total operating - - - - (25.000) 42. This estimate was arrived at by Inland Revenue with the help of the OECD’s global economic impact assessments (which continue to be updated). There are a high number of assumptions in this model, as it is dependent on the final rules (in particular safe harbours), how and which countries implement GloBE rules and the behavioural response of MNEs based on work done by the OECD. 43. It is expected that some additional revenue would be raised through applying the UTPR to foreign-owned MNEs with substance in New Zealand and the DMT to New Zealand headquartered MNEs. It is also possible that additional revenue will be raised from foreign headquartered MNEs who have a reduced incentive to shift profits out of New Zealand. However it is not possible to estimate the amount of this revenue. 44. An increase in New Zealand income tax is also forecast due to reduced profit shifting by New Zealand headquartered MNEs, as a result of a critical mass of other countries adopting the GloBE rules. This has been estimated at approximately $16 million per year after the GloBE rules have been adopted by the critical mass of countries. This benefit will arise whether or not New Zealand adopts GloBE rules itself. 45. It is proposed that this additional tax revenue be managed as a positive impact against the Budget 2023 operating allowance. 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Financial implications – up-front build costs and on-going administration 46. Inland Revenue has estimated that the up-front build costs and on-going administration of these two initiatives to be $17.300 million, $8.700 million capital and $8.600 million operating over the forecast period with on-going administration cost of $3.100 million a year. These estimates are subject to any significant changes in the final policies and rules that may materially change these estimates. The following table sets out the capital and operating costs for the up-front build and on-going administration. $million Vote Revenue 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 & outyears Capital expenditure OECD GloBE rules - - 5.300 - - Country by Country reporting 2.0 - - 3.400 - - Total capital - - 8.700 - - Operating expenditure OECD Pillar Two - 0.200 1.500 2.300 2.300 Country by Country reporting 2.0 - 0.100 0.600 0.800 0.800 Total operating - 0.300 2.100 3.100 3.100 Total expenditure - 0.300 10.800 3.100 3.100 47. The up-front build and on-going administration costs involve system changes to support the standardised reporting by large multi-national groups and information exchanges between tax jurisdictions of key financial information (GloBE information return). In addition, system changes will be required to impose a standard top-up tax (a new tax) to ensure such group pay a minimum level of tax in each jurisdiction where they operate. Inland Revenue estimates that it will require an additional six staff to administer the proposed GloBE rules. 48. The Pillar Two initiative will leverage off the existing reporting requirements under the CbC rules. As part of the implementation of Pillar Two, Inland Revenue will incorporate the current CbC reporting into START and streamline the process. Leveraging off the current reporting requirements will minimise the additional compliance costs for impacted entities. Furthermore, it will provide a sustainable solution to ensure that Inland Revenue can meet its international obligations. Legislative Implications 49. Implementing these proposals requires changes to the Income Tax Act 2007 and Tax Administration Act 1994. It will also require an Order in Council to be agreed to by 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Cabinet in order to bring the rules into effect. This Order in Council will be prepared after a critical mass of countries have committed to implement the GloBE rules. 50. If approved, we propose including the legislative changes resulting from these recommendations in the next omnibus taxation bill, scheduled for introduction in early 2023. Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 51. The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the OECD’s Pillar Two GloBE Tax Rules Impact Summary and considers that the information and analysis summarised in it meets the quality criteria of the Regulatory Impact Analysis framework. This issue has been subjected to wide consultation, including through a public issues paper. As identified in the Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis section, a difficulty with assessing the revenue implications of the various options has been establishing the administrative costs of adopting the GloBE rules without knowing aspects of the detailed design, and the extent to which behavioural changes occur if a critical mass of other countries adopt the GloBE rules. Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 52. The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) team has been consulted and confirms that the CIPA requirements do not apply to this proposal as the threshold for significance is not met. Population Implications 53. There are no population implications arising from the proposals in this paper. Human Rights 54. There are no human rights implications arising from the proposals in this paper. Consultation 55. Consultation has been undertaken with affected taxpayers, representative bodies and their advisors. They are broadly supportive of proposals. However, some stakeholders do not support the proposal to incorporate the GloBE rules into New Zealand by reference to the Model Rules, and most do not support the proposal to not provide imputation credits for top-up tax paid under the IIR and UTPR. 56. The Treasury and Inland Revenue have been consulted in the preparation of this paper and support the changes. Communications 57. Subject to approval from the offices of the Ministers of Finance and Revenue, Inland Revenue will make an announcement on this policy once Cabinet decisions have been made. The Minister of Revenue will also make an announcement about the 10 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] introduction of the bill which will contain this proposal. A commentary on the bill will be released at this time. Proactive Release 58. We propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers in whole within 30 working days of the public announcement of Cabinet’s decisions.

On 5 May, Ministers approved the release of the officials’ issues paper OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand (IR2022/133 refers). This report summarises the submissions on the issues paper, our responses, and our recommendations for next steps. 2. If officials’ recommendations are accepted, we will come back to Ministers in October 2022 with a paper seeking Cabinet approval to introduce legislation implementing GloBE rules ( and a related domestic minimum tax) in the first quarter of 2023, with an effective date to be determined by order in council. The order in council is expected to make the rules effective for income years beginning on or after 1 January 2024 or 1 January 2025. Background 3. Pillar Two is an OECD/G20 initiative seeking to address tax base erosion risks caused by profit shifting by large multinationals (MNEs). The main plank of Pillar Two is the Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) rules. These rules are intended to ensure that large MNEs are subject to tax of at least 15% on their mobile income, in every country where that income is earned. They apply to MNEs with annual revenues above €750 million. The GloBE Model Rules (the Model Rules) were finalised in December 2021, with detailed commentary released in March 2022. Further guidance (referred to as administrative guidance) is expected during 2022/23 with the GloBE rules expected to be adopted by participating countries in 2023 effective 2024. 4. The GloBE rules work first by requiring an MNE to calculate its effective tax rate (ETR) on mobile income in every country where it reports income. The ETR is essentially accounting tax expense divided by accounting income. If the ETR is below 15%, then there will be a top up tax obligation on the group. This top-up tax may be imposed by the country where the income is earned, as a domestic minimum tax (DMT). If that country does not impose the tax, then it will be collected under: 4.1 The Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) which applies on a top-down basis, giving the ultimate parent entity (UPE) jurisdiction (i.e. the country where the top company in the group is tax resident) the right to collect top-up tax. If that country does not adopt the GloBE rules, then countries where the group has intermediate holding companies may apply an IIR. 4.2 The Under-Taxed Profits Rule (UTPR) which applies as a back-up to the IIR. It is intended to protect the integrity of the IIR by discouraging MNEs from relocating their UPE to a country that does not implement Pillar Two. If no II R applies to a MNE, t he UTPR will allocate top-up tax to a participating country in proportion to the group’s payroll costs and tangible asset values in that country. IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 2 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 5. If a country adopts GloBE rules, it must adopt the OECD’s Model Rules, commentary and the (yet to be released) administrative guidance. Adoption is by incorporation into local legislation (not by treaty). Where a country’s incorporating legislation departs from the Model Rules, commentary and administrative guidance, there is a risk its GloBE rules will not be “qualifying” and participating countries will continue to apply GloBE top -up tax to the country’s in-scope MNEs. 6. 20-25 New Zealand headquartered MNEs are in scope for Pillar Two. Our current forecast is that the GloBE rules could raise circa $40-45 million in additional tax revenue for New Zealand per annum, though approximately $16 million of that will be due solely to the adoption of the GloBE rules by other countries, so does not require New Zealand’s participation. The issues paper 7. The issues paper sought feedback on whether, if GloBE rules are implemented by a critical mass of other countries, New Zealand should also implement them, and how. There were 11 submitters on the issues paper, from industry groups, multinationals, accounting firms and an individual. 8. The key points from the submissions are: • Adoption of GloBE rules The majority of submitters agreed that New Zealand should adopt GloBE rules if a critical mass of other countries adopt them. • Timing Submitters said that minimising compliance costs should inform the timing of New Zealand’s adoption of GloBE rules, given the low amount of tax expected to be collected. This could be achieved, they submitted, by following other countries’ adoption. • Safe harbours and simplifications Submitters were concerned about the potential for onerous compliance obligations especially as New Zealand multinationals are relatively small and not typically engaged in significant profit shifting. Submitters requested that officials push for effective simplifications and safe harbours at the OECD and that New Zealand adopt only the minimum standard of GloBE rules required. • Mode of incorporation o Submissions on whether New Zealand should rewrite the Model Rules into New Zealand legislation or simply refer to the OECD’s Model Rules were mixed. While rewriting the rules ensures they will mesh with New Zealand’s existing tax system, some submitters were concerned with the amount of additional law that would be needed and the potential for the rewrite to cause inadvertent variations. o A number of submitters said that any changes to the GloBE rules at OECD level made after the rules become effective in New Zealand should not become part of New Zealand law without amendment of the law by Parliament (the alternative is for such changes to be automatically incorporated unless Parliament disapproves them). • Domestic minimum tax Submitters were generally in favour of New Zealand adopting a DMT for in- scope New Zealand multinationals, Submitters did not consider that New IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 3 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Zealand should adopt a DMT for foreign headquartered multinationals operating in New Zealand, but did not provide a rationale. • Interaction with imputation regime Most submitters argued that GloBE top-up tax paid by New Zealand MNEs should give rise to imputation credits in the same way as ordinary corporate income tax. This was on the basis that the purpose of the imputation system is to avoid double taxation of income by New Zealand, and that imputation credits will very rarely reduce the ETR on distributed income below the 15% level (since very few shareholders who can claim imputation credits are on a rate below 15%). This seemed to be the issue submitters felt most strongly about. Officials’ recommendations Whether or not to adopt GloBE rules 9. In line with submitters, officials recommend that New Zealand should implement the GloBE rules, if a critical mass 1 of other countries does so. The recommendation is for two reasons. 10. First, as noted by submitters, it will be better both for New Zealand as a whole and New Zealand MNEs if that tax is collected by New Zealand and not other countries. 11. The second reason for our recommendation is that adopting GloBE rules aligns with New Zealand’s goals around strengthening and adapting the international tax system in response to the challenges posed by increasing globalisation and digitalisation of the economy. MNEs are currently incentivised to shift as much of their profits as possible out of high tax jurisdictions and into low tax ones. This is particularly an issue for income derived from intangible assets, as those assets and associated income are easily moveable across jurisdictions. 12. The global minimum tax is intended to reduce the benefit that MNEs get from shifting profits to low tax jurisdictions, as well as reduce the incentive for countries to use tax competition to attract foreign capital. Both of these impacts will help to reduce the incentive for MNEs that are operating here to shift profits out of New Zealand and into a low tax jurisdiction. 13. Implementing Pillar Two will also be a strong signal that New Zealand is taking active steps to ensure that large MNEs pay a fairer amount of tax. If implemented by a critical mass of other countries, the GloBE rules will prevent MNEs from being able to manipulate the existing international tax rules to pay little tax on much of their global income. This can be expected to improve social capital and public trust in the tax system by at least partially addressing public concerns that large MNEs are not paying a fair share of tax globally. Other recommendations 14. Officials’ recommendations on the other significant points are as follows: • Timing o In order to ensure the legislation is ready to go but not effective unless and until other countries’ rules are also effective, we recommend that it be enacted with an effective date to be determined by order in council. 1 Officials generally agree with the list of critical countries proposed by submitters, though note that failure by one of those countries is unlikely to be critical. IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 4 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] o It seems likely that other countries’ DMTs and IIRs will apply for income years beginning on or after 1 January 2024, but their UTPRs may apply from a year later. If so, this would give New Zealand a choice of dates for implementation. Going later will delay the date when the proposal generates tax revenue for New Zealand, but will also give New Zealand MNEs more time to prepare for application of the rules, which would likely be favourably received by them. o Of course, the order-in-council trigger also means that even once the rules are enacted, the Government retains discretion not to make GloBE rules effective in New Zealand, even if a critical mass of other countries does adopt them. • Safe harbours and simplifications Officials are engaged at an OECD level on this issue, and are advocating for rules that are sensible and pragmatic, but do not allow the objectives of the GloBE rules to be significantly undercut. The rules adopted by the OECD should be replicated in our domestic incorporation, but there is no scope for New Zealand to adopt more generous safe harbours or simplifications, as that would run the risk of New Zealand rules being non-qualifying. • Effect of Foreign Investor Tax Credits (FITCs) on the ETR Officials’ view is that when a company reduces its corporate income tax payable by claiming, under the FITC regime, a credit for non-resident withholding tax it pays on dividends to foreign shareholders, that must be reflected by a reduced ETR. To do otherwise would call into question the foreign shareholders’ ability to claim a credit for the withholding tax. • Implementation of UTPR as a separate tax rather than a deduction denial Officials recommend that this rule is not implemented by way of denying deductions for expenditure, but as a separate tax, just like the tax payable under the IIR. This will be administratively simpler and more effective. • Mode of incorporation o Officials intend to pursue incorporation of the rules by referring to the OECD Model Rules and associated documents so far as possible. o Contrary to most submissions, officials also recommend that amendments to the GloBE rules made at the OECD level are automatically incorporated into New Zealand law for the year following amendment. This will be the most cost-effective approach to ensuring New Zealand’s rules are the same as those in other countries. It will not prevent New Zealand enacting legislation to over-ride future OECD level amendments if it wishes to do so. This approach is likely to be opposed by submitters, who will make constitutional objections to it. • Domestic minimum tax In line with submissions, officials recommend a DMT for New Zealand MNEs but not foreign headquartered. • Interaction with imputation regime Contrary to submissions, officials recommend that tax paid under the GloBE rules does not give rise to an imputation credit. Giving an imputation credit would mean the tax would not be recognised by other countries, and New IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 5 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Zealand MNEs would be subject to GloBE top-up tax in those countries. This recommendation is not expected to give rise to significant tax consequences for any MNE, given the small amount of tax expected to be paid, and the rule allowing taxed profit to be distributed before untaxed profit Despite this, we expect strong criticism from the private sector for adopting this approach. Officials propose to discuss with the OECD whether it would be acceptable for an imputation credit to be given for tax paid under the DMT. • No deduction or foreign tax credit for GloBE taxes paid to other countries Because GloBE taxes are taxes of last resort, they should not give rise to a tax credit or a deduction under any other tax systems. While a deduction is already denied for foreign income taxes, New Zealand law does provide for a credit for foreign income taxes, so a law change will be needed to exclude GloBE taxes from this rule. This will need to include additional income tax paid in another country as a result of that country’s UTPR applying to deny deductions. Fiscal Implications 15. Our initial modelling, aided by the OECD’s global economic impact assessments indicate that the GloBE rules proposals will raise a modest amount of revenue. There are a high number of assumptions in this model, as it depends on the final rules (in particular safe harbours), how and which countries implement Pillar Two and the behavioural response of MNEs. 16. Our forecast estimate of GloBE top-up tax revenue from New Zealand adoption is approximately $25 million per annum made up of: • $25 million per annum from GloBE top-up tax from applying the IIR to New Zealand MNEs. This amount makes allowance for the possibility of other countries increasing their tax rates in response to Pillar Two to reduce the amount of top-up tax collected by us. We expect this revenue to increase over time as transitional concessions are unwound. • A further positive amount from the UTPR and the DMT, however it is not possible to estimate how much this will be. 17. Officials have also estimated that the adoption of GloBE rules by other countries is likely to lead to increased income tax revenue for New Zealand from New Zealand MNEs of approximately $16 million per annum due to reduced profit shifting. 18. From a cost perspective, the build and ongoing administration costs for Inland Revenue are dependent on the final design aspects, but have been provisionally estimated at $10.9 million, to deliver the GloBE rules and $5.1 million to deliver the associated Country-by -Country reporting change. We are preparing a separate briefing note that will bring together the funding requirements and funding options for all of the OECD driven initiatives. Consultation 19. The recommendations in this report follow public consultation and consideration of submissions from Air New Zealand, CAANZ, Cantin Consulting, Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, Fonterra, KPMG, PwC, New Zealand Law Society, Tax Justice Aotearoa and an individual submitter.

If you agree to the recommendations, the next step would be for us to provide you with a Cabinet paper in early October seeking Cabinet approval to the proposals in November. Legislation could then be included in the 2023 tax bill. Provision would be made to ensure that this legislation would only become effective once the Government is satisfied that GloBE rules will be adopted by a critical mass of other countries. 21. We will continue to keep you updated as appropriate on any significant developments with regard to the adoption of GloBE rules.

Pillars One and Two are the second phase of the BEPS (“base erosion and profit shifting”) tax reform project launched by the OECD and G20 in 2013. 23. The Pillar Two GloBE rules are often referred to as the global minimum tax, as they seek to ensure that large MNEs pay tax at a rate of at least 15% on their mobile profits 2 in every country where those profits are earned. This is achieved by requiring MNEs to calculate their effective tax rate (ETR) in every country where they operate. The ETR is essentially accounting tax expense divided by accounting net income. If the ETR in a country is below 15%, then the countries that adopt GloBE rules will impose a top up tax, on MNE members in their country, to bring the rate on the low tax income up to 15%. Generally this top up tax will be imposed on MNE members outside the country where the low tax income arises. 24. In October 2021 136 members of the Inclusive Framework, including New Zealand, endorsed a high-level statement detailing the key building blocks for Pillar One and Pillar Two. In December 2021 the OECD released the GloBE Model Rules followed in March 2022 by detailed commentary to the rules. Administrative guidance is expected to be published by the OECD during 2022/23 with the rules expected to be effective in participating countries in 2024 (possibly the UTPR will be effective a year later). 25. The rules have two elements: 25.1 Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) which applies on a top-down basis, giving the ultimate parent entity (UPE) jurisdiction or an intermediate parent jurisdiction (if no UPE or intermediate parent further up the corporate chain has adopted the GloBE rules) the right to collect GloBE top-up tax for the MNE’s group entities that are below it in the corporate chain. 25.2 Under-Taxed Profits Rule (UTPR) which applies as a back-up to the IIR. The UTPR allocates GloBE top-up tax to participating countries in proportion to the group’s payroll costs and tangible asset values in each participating country. 26. The GloBE rules also allow a country to introduce a Domestic Minimum Tax (DMT) which applies the rules to income earned in the country. It gives a country priority in respect of domestic income over the IIR and UTPR, so that a country can collect the tax on any undertaxed mobile profits earned there. 27. If a country adopts the GloBE rules, it needs to adopt an IIR and UTPR that align with the OECD’s Model Rules, commentary and the (yet to be released) administrative guidance. Adopting a DMT is optional. Where a country departs from the Model R ules, there is a risk that its GloBE rules will not be “qualifying” and participating jurisdictions will continue to apply GloBE top-up tax to the country’ s in-scope MNEs. 28. We reported to you on 18 March 2022 seeking permission to consult publicly on whether and how New Zealand should implement the GloBE rules. This approval was given, and an officials’ issues paper was released for consultation in May 2022. 2 Mobile profit (called excess profit in the OECD documents) for a year is profit in excess of a percentage return on in-country tangible assets and payroll expense. The percentage return starts at 8% and 10% respectively and declines to 5% over 10 years. IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 10 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Officials’ issues paper 29. The officials’ issues paper sought feedback on whether, if GloBE rules are implemented by a critical mass of other countries, New Zealand should also implement them, and how to do so. The issues paper sought feedback on: 29.1 Whether there are any issues with the Model Rules including scope, calculating a taxpayer’s ETR and calculating top up tax. 29.2 Effective transitional, simplification and safe harbour measures. 29.3 The mode of implementation in New Zealand including whether the GloBE rules should be rewritten into New Zealand law or if the tax acts should incorporate the rules by reference to the OECD documents. 29.4 Tax administrative matters. 29.5 Implementation of the UTPR as a deduction denial or tax charge. 29.6 Whether a DMT should be adopted in New Zealand. 29.7 Interaction of the GloBE rules with New Zealand rules including the imputation and foreign investor tax credit (FITC) regimes. 30. 11 submissions were received on the issues paper. These submissions came from Air New Zealand, CAANZ, Cantin Consulting, the Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, Fonterra, KPMG, the New Zealand Law Society, PwC, Tax Justice Aotearoa and an individual. 31. Submissions are summarised below, divided by topic. For each topic there is a brief description of the issue, a summary of submissions received and officials’ response. Submissions received and officials’ response Should New Zealand adopt GloBE rules? Issue 32. Should New Zealand adopt GloBE rules if a “critical mass” of other countries adopts them? 32.1 Why or why not 32.2 If so, what is considered a “critical mass” 32.3 If so, when should New Zealand adopt the rules Submissions received Whether New Zealand should adopt GloBE rules 33. Submitters generally supported New Zealand adopting the GloBE rules if a critical mass of other countries does s o, on the basis that: 33.1 it is in New Zealand’s interests to adopt GloBE rules as the goal of the rules, to disincentivise profit shifting by MNEs, aligns with the Government’s priorities. Submitters also ac knowledged that the Government made a clear political commitment to the BEPS process and that it’s important to New Zealand’s international reputation that it is seen to be doing its part. 33.2 the operation of the rules means that were New Zealand not to adopt GloBE rules, but a critical mass of countries does adopt, taxpayers would incur the IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 11 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] compliance costs regardless and there is a risk of tax leakage to other jurisdictions. 33.3 adopting GloBE rules in New Zealand would streamline and simplify compliance for in-scope New Zealand businesses making it easier for them to pay top up tax once in New Zealand as opposed to paying tax under the UTPR to a number of other countries. There was a general preference for in- scope taxpayers to deal with Inland Revenue rather than other tax authorities. 34. Submitters were concerned about the potential for onerous compliance obligations arising from the GloBE rules compared to the tax revenue expected to be generated for New Zealand and given that New Zealand taxpayers weren’t the focus of the rules, since New Zealand has a high corporate tax rate and robust international tax settings. 34.1 KPMG said New Zealand based multinationals generally do not have the operating model attributes the GloBE rules are designed to target. In particular, New Zealand headquartered businesses will often prefer to hold their intellectual property and pay their corporate income tax in New Zealand due to for example the imputation credit regime. 34.2 Air New Zealand considered it likely that across New Zealand companies, the cost of complying with the GloBE rules will be more than the combined tax take. 35. Submitters suggested these concerns could be dealt with by : 35.1 Implementing the minimum requirements only and using any appropriate safe harbours or simplification measures made available. 35.2 Ensuring appropriate adaptation to existing New Zealand tax policy settings such that the GloBE rules work within New Zealand’s existing tax/fiscal preferences and settings. Officials’ views 36. Officials agree with submitters that if a critical mass of other countries adopt the GloBE rules, New Zealand should also adopt them. 37. On the basis that New Zealand MNEs are not generally earning significant amounts of low tax mobile income, officials expect that they will be able to use the safe harbours currently under development by the OECD to minimise the cost of compliance with the rules. 38. With respect to Air New Zealand’s comment that the cost of compliance with the GloBE rules will outweigh the revenue generated for New Zealand, this does not seem relevant to New Zealand’s decision, since those costs will have to be incurred in any case by virtue of other countries imposing GloBE rules. 39. Officials agree that implementing Pillar Two aligns with New Zealand’s goals around strengthening and adapting the international tax system in response to the challenges posed by increasing globalisation and digitalisation of the economy. There has been a long-standing issue with the current international tax framework whereby firms that operate in multiple countries are able to exploit low tax rates available in some countries by shifting income into those countries. 40. This is particularly an issue for income derived from intangible assets, as those assets and associated income are easily moveable across jurisdictions. The growth of intangibles, like patents and copyright, means that large portions of MNE profits are able to face little to no taxation. This is further exacerbated by the fact that IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 12 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] many countries are engaged in tax competition to incentivise MNEs to locate these intangibles in their jurisdiction. 41. The primary purpose of Pillar Two is to reduce the incentive for large MNEs to shift profits to low tax jurisdictions. If multinationals know they will have to pay tax of at least 15% on their mobile income, even if that income is derived from activities in a country with a tax rate substantially lower than 15%, they will be less likely to structure their activities so that most of their income is located in low-tax jurisdictions. While there will continue to be an incentive for MNEs to move profits to countries with a tax rate of at most 15% and away from countries with a higher tax rate, this incentive will be weaker than the current incentive that MNEs face to move their profits to countries that will impose a tax rate much lower than 15%. 42. Adopting Pillar Two will also be a strong signal that New Zealand is taking active steps to ensure that large MNEs pay a fairer amount of tax. While Pillar Two will not address the issue of MNEs not paying an appropriate amount of tax in market jurisdictions, if implemented by a critical mass of other countries it will prevent MNEs from being able to manipulate the existing international tax rules to pay little tax on much of their global income. This is likely to improve social capital and public trust in the tax system by at least partially addressing public concerns that large MNEs are not paying a fair share of tax. 43. By implementing these rules, New Zealand would be playing its part in a reform which goes a considerable way towards addressing MNE tax planning, by significantly reducing the tax benefit that MNEs can obtain by shifting income between countries. New Zealand has been consistent in the past in promoting strong international tax rules around profit shifting and base erosion (for example, the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018), and Pillar Two can be considered an extension of these rules. 44. In addition, there will be long-term benefits to New Zealand if Pillar Two is successful in stopping the global trend of decreasing corporate tax rates. While Pillar Two does contain a carve-out for income derived from “real” activities, limiting the incentive for countries to offer tax rates of lower than 15% on mobile income will substantially reduce the scope for tax competition between countries. What is a critical mass 45. Submitters said that the critical mass of countries was Australia, China, the European Union, Japan and the United Kingdom. Officials’ views 46. Having analysed the activities of New Zealand MNEs, officials’ view is that if the GloBE rules are adopted by Australia, the UK and the countries of the European Union, that would be sufficient to ensure that New Zealand MNEs (with one exception) would be subject to an effective UTPR if New Zealand did not impose GloBE top-up tax under an IIR. Officials therefore would exclude China and Japan from the necessary critical mass. Timing 47. Submitters’ general view was that New Zealand should not be an early adopter as this would compromise the long-term success and sustainability of the regime and put New Zealand businesses at a competitive disadvantage. 48. Submitters highlighted the previous experience with BEPS 1.0 as demonstrating the lack of consistency in implementation dates by participating jurisdictions. 49. Submitters considered that New Zealand should defer the implementation until: IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 13 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 49.1 it becomes apparent with a high degree of certainty that other jurisdictions, particularly our key economic partners, will implement the rules 49.2 there is certainty that another country’s UTPR will apply to tax a New Zealand MNE’s profits 49.3 Australia has adopted them, so we can learn from their experience 50. Given the modest amount of revenue for New Zealand, submitters considered that minimising compliance costs should inform the timing of New Zealand implementation of the GloBE rules. Officials’ views 51. Officials agree with submitters that New Zealand should not impose tax under the GloBE rules before other countries impose an IIR. There is also an argument for not imposing tax until other countries’ UTPRs are in force, since it is only at that point that Pillar Two becomes inescapable. Now that introduction of the IIR has been deferred to 2024, it is not clear whether there will in fact be any lag between the implementation of these two rules. 52. Officials propose that when legislation for the GloBE rules is prepared, it will provide for an effective date to be determined by order in council, so that the legislation can be enacted and ready to go, but not made effective until other countries have in fact made their rules (either the IIR or the IIR and UTPR) effective. Whether the revenue threshold for New Zealand’s GloBE rules should match the OECD’s Issue 53. Should the revenue threshold for New Zealand’s GloBE rules match the OECD’s €750M? 53.1 If so, why or why not? 53.2 If you think New Zealand should use an alternative domestic threshold, what should the threshold be based on and why? 53.3 Are there any difficulties in adopting a Euro threshold? Submissions received Alternative domestic threshold 54. Submitters unanimously agreed that New Zealand should follow the OECD threshold. There were concerns that if New Zealand departs from this it might: • Create a disproportionate compliance burden for smaller MNEs who may not be resourced to comply with such a tax • Create undue compliance costs because MNEs below the threshold would not be subject to Country-by -Country Reporting (CbCR) 3 • Remove the benefit of any CbCR safe harbours which may be introduced as smaller MNEs are not in-scope for CbCR reporting. Use of Euro Threshold 3 Country by Country reporting requirements have been published by the OECD as part of an agreed international tax reform package addressing base erosion and profit shifting. CbCR applies to corporate groups headquartered in New Zealand with annual consolidated group revenue of over EUR 750 million. IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 14 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 55. Submitters unanimously agreed that a EUR threshold should be used to ensure consistency with the OECD, and alignment with CbCR. General comments 56. Submitters requested Officials request confirmation from the OECD that the GloBE and CbCR threshold will be the same, or where different, further guidance is provided. As an example, CbCR guidance suggests that extraordinary income or gains from investment activity should be included in applying the CbCR threshold. However, such items may not constitute revenue for IFRS accounting purposes. 57. KPMG requested officials request an Indigenous E ntities exclusion, in particular, that we push for Māori Authorities to be excluded from the scope of the GloBE rules due to lower tax rate being attributable to underlying policy settings, not tax competition. Māori Authorities are currently subject to a tax rate in New Zealand of 17.5%, 2.5% above the GloBE minimum rate. They recognised that there are currently no Māori Authorities that are even close to being in scope of Pillar Two. Officials’ response 58. Officials: • agree with submitters that New Zealand should adopt the OECD threshold of €750M • will follow up with the OECD to ensure that the revenue thresholds for CbCR and the GloBE rules use the same measure of revenue • do not think that it would be worthwhile seeking an indigenous entities exclusion at this point in time, given that this is not and may never be a pressing issue, that Māori Authorities are currently taxed above the minimum rate, and that there is no general pressure in the OECD for such an exclusion. Issues identified with the Model Rules Submissions received 59. Few submissions addressed the substantive questions of whether there were any issues in the GloBE model rules themselves, acknowledging that the rules had been accepted by the Inclusive Framework and any adoption of the GloBE rules in New Zealand should follow the Model Rules as closely as possible to ensure they remain qualifying. 60. With respect to the application of the rules to foreign investor tax credits (FITCs) 4 provided to companies that pay supplementary dividends: 60.1 Submitters considered that no adjustment for FITCs should be required as they are not a reduction in tax payable at the corporate level 60.2 Submitters considered the objective of the FITC regime to be limiting New Zealand income tax on foreign portfolio investors to the prevailing tax rate for New Zealand companies by compensating such investors for the cost of 4 FITCs are the way that we ensure that the New Zealand tax paid by foreign portfolio (less than 10%) investors in New Zealand companies does not exceed 28%. For example, the company pays tax on $100 income at 28%. Subsequent distribution of the remaining $72 to the non-resident shareholder triggers a $12.70 tax credit (FITC) to the company, so its net tax payable is only $15.30. The company is required to distribute this credit to the shareholder as a supplementary dividend. Non-resident withholding tax on the dividend and supplementary divided is $12.70. The purpose is to ensure the shareholder can claim a foreign tax credit for the non-resident withholding tax while limiting the total tax paid on the income (by both the company on derivation and the shareholder on distribution) to 28%. IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 15 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] the NRWT impost. The end result of the FITC rules is no reduction in corporate tax and this should be reflected in any GloBE rules enacted. 61. The other points raised on the Model Rules themselves were very technical (these points were mostly raised by the Corporate Taxpayers Group and KPMG). Some of the points highlighted areas where further guidance on the Model Rules would be useful and others questioned some of the technical features of the rules from a policy perspective but did not go as far as identifying flaws that need fixing. Officials’ recommendation 62. Officials do not agree with the treatment proposed by submitters for FITCs. Submitters are correct to say that the purpose of the FITC regime is to ensure that the total tax rate imposed on the income of foreign portfolio investors in New Zealand companies is no more than the corporate rate. The more telling point is that this is achieved by way of imposing a reduced rate of corporate income tax plus non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) for distributions of that income. The integrity of the FITC regime requires that the NRWT is a real tax imposed on the shareholder. This would be called into question if the GloBE rules treated the company as having paid both the (reduced) corporate income tax and the shareholder level NRWT. Officials also note that the GloBE Model Rules specifically provide for the inclusion of only the FITC-reduced tax amount in the ETR calculation. 63. Officials plan to raise the technical points on the Model Rules themselves with the OECD as appropriate and, where needed, will advocate for clarifications from the OECD by way of administrative guidance (or develop guidance as part of the implementation process). Simplification and safe harbour measures Issue 64. Are there any simplifications that could be introduced to simplify the effective tax rate calculation? 65. What do submitters think of a safe harbour based on CbCR data? Submissions Simplification 66. Submitters generally focused on reducing the need for detailed calculations to determine whether a taxpayer is actually in scope of the Pillar Two rules and ensuring any calculations are based on existing data. 67. In acknowledging there would be a trade-off between accuracy and simplicity, a submitter proposed a simplified calculation based on adjustments arising from only the most significant items including dividends/gains and losses on non-portfolio and equity accounted interests as well as tax losses. Safe harbours 68. Submitters generally supported the introduction of a safe harbour based on country- by -country reporting (CbCR) with a higher tax rate to avoid making numerous adjustments. Officials’ response 69. Officials are continuing to engage with the OECD in the development of effective safe harbours, and will advance the submitters’ ideas as appropriate. IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 16 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Mode of implementation in New Zealand Issue 70. If adopted, a decision will need to be made on how to incorporate the GloBE Model Rules into New Zealand legislation. In particular, do we: 70.1 Rewrite the OECD’s Model Rules into New Zealand legislation (i.e., the Income Tax Act 2007) in full, with limited adaptation for New Zealand- specific concepts (‘repetition’), or 70.2 Draft legislation which so far as possible refers to, rather than repeats, the Model Rules and other dispositive documents (‘incorporation by reference’). 71. In addition, New Zealand will also need to decide how to adapt any changes to the Model Rules by the OECD into New Zealand law, in particular, do we: 71.1 Allow any changes adopted at the OECD level to automatically be incorporated into New Zealand law (‘ambulatory’), or 71.2 Require any changes made to be adopted into New Zealand law before becoming effective (‘static’). 72. These OECD-level changes may be made by way of changes to the Model Rules themselves or (more likely) by changes to the Commentary or Administrative Guidance, which have the effect of over-riding the Model Rules. Already there is some language in the Commentary which seems intended to take priority over the Model Rules. Submissions received 73. Submissions on both questions were mixed. Submitters generally favoured repetition over incorporation by reference. 74. The most common arguments in favour of repetition were that: 74.1 the process of writing the rules into New Zealand legislation would force officials to consider the New Zealand-specific issues with implementing the rules, and design legislation to deal with these appropriately. Submitters were concerned that incorporating by reference would mean New Zealand specific issues would only be considered once they created practical problems for taxpayers post-implementation. 74.2 There is a clear distinction between the automatic exchange of information rules ( where incorporation by reference is common) and the GloBE rules in that the GloBE rules create a taxing charge. As such, they needed to be housed in the Income Tax Act, not by reference to extrinsic material that the New Zealand government cannot guarantee will be readily available. 75. KMPG and CTG favoured using repetition assisted by reference to OECD materials for greater detail/aiding interpretation. 76. EY favoured using modified repetition to ensure consistency with New Zealand drafting principles. They gave as an example the fact that New Zealand drafting conventions allow for the use of flow-charts and other aids to assist comprehension and simplify complex concepts, which might be useful in relation to the GloBE rules. 77. Submissions favouring incorporation by reference highlighted the amount of drafting that would be required under an incorporation by repetition approach (considering rewriting the rules will add hundreds of pages to the Income Tax Act 2007), ensuring our rules are consistent with other jurisdictions and allowing for simpler future amendments to the rules. IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 17 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 77.1 NZLS highlighted that one of the main benefits of incorporating by reference was having globally consistent legislation but acknowledged that this could easily be negated if other jurisdictions opt for a repetition approach and heavily adapt the rules to their local circumstances. 77.2 PwC were concerned that adoption by repetition directly into legislation risks missing some of the intricacies of the rules and increases the risk of the rules being interpreted differently. They suggested Inland Revenue produce a New Zealand version of the GloBE rules commentary to demonstrate officials had considered New Zealand-specific issues arising from implementation. KPMG considered that any risks from inaccuracy arising from incorporation by repetition could be dealt with by having the OECD undertake a detailed peer review of the New Zealand rules. 78. Submissions on how to update New Zealand legislation in response to any future changes by the OECD were generally in favour of a static approach, where amendments would not automatically be incorporated into New Zealand law. While some submitters appeared to conflate a static approach with repetition, submitters stressed the need for New Zealand to retain its sovereignty in tax matters and ensure any changes made at the OECD are subject to close scrutiny by New Zealand legislators before being incorporated into law. 79. Submitting in favour of an ambulatory approach, PwC highlighted the need for New Zealand to remain aligned with the globally agreed position. They accepted the risk of a loss of sovereignty but suggested this could be countered by Inland Revenue closely monitoring changes made at the OECD and carving out undesirable OECD amendments and pointed to previous hybrids changes as an example of successful ambulatory legislation. 80. General comments included a desire for the policy process to follow the generic tax policy process. Submitters expressed dissatisfaction with the implementation of previous OECD initiatives, where they felt the drafting of legislation had been rushed and resulted in poorer quality law which created issues for taxpayers’ post- implementation. The desirability of reducing compliance costs by ensuring ou r rules will be interpreted consistently with the global standard was noted several times. Finally, almost all submitters agreed that whatever form of legislation is adopted should be included in the Income Tax Act 2007 rather than a separate Act, and almost all agreed the rules should be contained in their own part or part for ease of reference. Officials’ recommendation 81. Officials believe that in the interests of limiting the amount of policy and legislative drafting resource required, as well as ensuring our GloBE rules are qualifying and enhancing the likelihood that the rules will be the same in New Zealand as they are elsewhere, an incorporation by reference approach should continue to be explored in preference to incorporation by repetition. This will certainly involve ensuring taxpayers who are subject to the rules are able to access the OECD documents. Since these taxpayers and their advisers are the most well resourced and sophisticated, this should not be difficult. Flow charts and diagrams could be incorporated in the explanatory material that will accompany the legislation when it becomes effective. 82. Officials also believe that it would be desirable for changes to the OECD documents to be automatically incorporated into New Zealand law, at least for periods beginning after those changes are made. Again, that will reduce the burden of Pillar Two on the New Zealand tax legislative process and maximise the likelihood of cross-country consistency and of our rules being qualifying. It will involve no substantive loss of sovereignty, since Parliament can always enact law declaring that a change made at OECD level should not have effect in New Zealand (though the reasons for doing so are not obvious). IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 18 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Undertaxed profits rule Issue 83. The undertaxed profits rule (UTPR) is a backstop to the IIR and aims to ensure that top-up tax is paid even if an MNE group member is not directly or indirectly owned by a higher tier group member subject to a qualified IIR. The Model Rules do not prescribe how tax allocated to a jurisdiction by the UTPR should be brought to charge. This is left to individual jurisdictions. 84. Submitters were asked for their preference between two possible methods of charging the UTPR: • Denying income tax deductions on otherwise deductible expenses of the MNE group; or • Treating the GloBE calculation and any resulting tax liability as a separate tax liability independent of income tax (for both the UTPR and IIR). 85. Officials stated a preference for a separate tax liability in the issues paper. This is because: • It would be simpler to administer • It would avoid complex flow-on effects to other types of taxes which denying deductions would create, a nd • Denying a deduction will not result in an additional cash tax expense when the relevant New Zealand entity is in a loss position. Submissions received 86. Four submitters commented on this issue, and views were split evenly. Tax Justice Aotearoa and PwC favoured a separate tax liability for the same reasons as officials. 87. KPMG and CTG favoured denying deductions. CTG argued this was more consistent with the understood purpose of the UTPR to deny deductions for payments that are undertaxed to the payee, and that concerns regarding administrative complexity were overstated given other regimes exist which can deny deductions for income tax purposes. 88. Both submitters disagreed that denying deductions for a loss-making business would not create an additional cash tax expense, on the basis that this disregards the economic value of tax losses which can be carried forward or offset. 89. In general comments, both KPMG and CTG also submitted that because of the complexity involved and the relative flexibility the OECD has afforded countries to design their own UTPRs, New Zealand should conduct a separate consultation on the UTPR itself if New Zealand opts to adopt the GloBE rules. Officials’ recommendation 90. Officials recommend that the UTPR is implemented as a separate stand alone tax rather than denial of a deduction which would increase taxable income (or reduce losses). This is the simpler option. It is also completely consistent with the purpose of the UTPR. Initially the UTPR did attempt to impose tax only where the payee was undertaxed, but it now operates simply as a back-up to the IIR, allocating top- up tax to countries on a basis of the MNE’s relative physical substance in each country. Officials do not agree that reducing losses that may be used in the future or may expire unused is the same as imposing a current cash tax liability. They also note that the income giving rise to the current cash tax liability will in most IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 19 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] cases be income arising in another country. There is no reason to allow the liability for tax on that income to be offset against New Zealand tax losses. Tax administration impacts Issue 91. Several questions were put to submitters regarding how Inland Revenue should administer the GloBE rules in New Zealand. Questions covered practical concerns such as the format for returns, the desirability of aligning the country by country reporting with the GloBE information return, filing dates and the penalty for late or non-compliance. Submissions received 92. Few submissions addressed this section, of those that did, the submissions largely related to the penalties suggested and the format for submission: 92.1 CTG and PwC both consider the late filing penalty should be low. CTG suggested that Inland Revenue utilise the existing penalty available in section 139AB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (a maximum of $100,000) for a member of a large multinational group who fails to provide information when requested to do so under section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. P wC suggested the Commissioner be given power to serve notice of a penalty prior to enforcement, to provide the taxpayer time to remedy their late filing/payment. 92.2 PwC agreed with officials’ that an XML electronic format would be appropriate for both the GloBE return and the country by country reporting, and that (subject to the New Zealand return not requiring any further information than the GloBE return) a New Zealand filing date of one month after the GloBE return deadline is appropriate. PwC also submitted the payment date should be later than the filing date for the New Zealand GloBE return, to allow taxpayers time to coordinate funds, pointing out this was consistent with New Zealand’s terminal tax requirements. Officials’ response 93. Officials will continue to consult on the issue of penalties. Costing is being undertaken on the basis of an XML format report, which we propose will also be required for cou ntry by country reporting. Interaction with imputation Issue 94. New Zealand income tax paid by a New Zealand company gives rise to an imputation credit, which can be passed to the company’s shareholders when the company pays a dividend. Submitters were asked whether tax paid in New Zealand under the GloBE rules should give rise to an imputation credit. 95. In the issues paper Officials said that tax paid under the GloBE rules should not give rise to imputation credits, because: • Allowing them would unwind the effect of the IIR (which is to top up the amount of tax paid to a 15% rate) when income is distributed. • Allowing them would very likely mean New Zealand’s IIR would not meet the OECD’s requirements to be a ‘qualifying IIR”, meaning other countries UTPR’s would apply to New Zealand-headquartered MNEs. IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 20 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] • The imputation system is not set up to deal with tax imposed at a rate other than 28%. Submissions received 96. Almost all submitters considered the issue, with a clear pr eference for allowing imputation credits for GloBE taxes paid. Tax Justice Aotearoa supported denying imputation credits, but did not provide a reason for its view. This was the issue submitters in favour of allowing credits felt the most strongly about. 97. Several arguments for allowing imputation credits were submitted, with some appearing in most submissions: 97.1 Doing so would not unwind the IIR or disqualify New Zealand’s IIR • The model rules have been designed for the classical tax systems in use in most of the rest of the world, not the imputation system used by New Zealand. Allowing imputation credits does not defeat the IIR, but merely equalises its effect to what will apply in other jurisdictions. Imputation is purely a means to ensure there is not double taxation, it is not a benefit, it achieves the same outcome as a jurisdiction with an exemption on dividend income (i.e. one level of tax). • Imputation credits relieve double taxation at the shareholder level – they do not refund tax at the corporate level and will therefore not concern the OECD or unwind the effect of GloBE top-up tax. The OECD’s concern is to prevent countries from implementing GloBE rules whilst at the same time creating new corporate tax kickbacks which are designed to undermine their effect. • Analysing the language of the Model Rules and Commentary shows that allowing imputation credits for IIR tax would not disqualify New Zealand’s IIR. Even if this may be the case, Officials should advocate at the OECD for New Zealand’s imputation system to be permissible, and only deny them if compelled to by the OECD. 97.2 Denying credits would be contrary to core New Zealand tax principles by subjecting New Zealand taxpayers to economic double taxation • Most submitters argued that preventing double taxation is a fundamental principle of New Zealand’s tax system, and imputation credits are a means of achieving this. To disallow credits would undermine this principle and impose double taxation on affected taxpayers thereby making New Zealand companies less competitive. • Tax imposed under the IIR is a New Zealand tax, it benefits the New Zealand economy and is available for New Zealand to spend on services in New Zealand. 98. Submitters argued that GloBE top-up taxes are not conceptually different from CFC taxes: 98.1 Officials stated in the issues paper that GloBE tax can be distinguished conceptually from CFC taxes (where imputation is allowed), and this negates the argument that similar treatment should apply. Several submitters disagreed with this distinction, arguing GloBE taxes should instead be viewed as an extension of the CFC rules and therefore also be allowed credits. 99. Submitters argued that the imputation system did not need to be modified to deal with tax rates other than 28%. IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 21 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 99.1 Several submitters disagreed with officials’ view that allowing credits would create additional complexity. CAANZ, KPMG and CTG submitted the concerns of officials were unfounded, as the imputation system does not require sources of income to be tracked, income from FIF interests is in effect not taxed at 28% (due to the fair dividend rate income calculation) and partially imputed dividends are effectively taxed at a rate other than 28%. 100. Submitters argued that disallowing imputation credits on GloBE income would lead to unfair and inconsistent treatment when compared to other countries 100.1 Several submitters said that by comparison with Australia, New Zealand denying imputation credits for IIR tax would be unfair. Fonterra gave the example of a New Zealand MNE which earns a large untaxed capital gain in another country. This untaxed gain could give rise to IIR tax in New Zealand but no imputation credits under officials’ proposals. If the same gain were earned by an Australian MNE, the Australian CFC rules would tax the gain, giving rise to franking credits for the Australian company which could be passed on to its shareholders. Accordingly shareholders in the New Zealand MNE would be taxed more harshly on the same type of gain than the shareholders in the Australian MNE. Officials’ recommendation 101. For the reasons set out in paragraph 95 above, officials do not recommend allowing GloBE tax to give rise to an imputation credit. Unfortunately, there is a conflict between the objectives of imputation and the objectives of the GloBE rules. If tax paid under the GloBE rules gives rise to an imputation credit, the imposition of that tax is effectively reversed, through a reduction in the tax that would otherwise be paid by the shareholder. That would be an impermissible benefit, that would disqualify New Zealand’s IIR from recognition by other countries, and would thus expose New Zealand MNEs to other countries’ UTPRs. Officials expect that Australia will take the same approach, i .e. will not allow a franking credit for tax imposed under the GloBE rules. 102. Officials continue to believe that this outcome is of little practical significance, and no submitters have pointed to cases which would disprove that. Despite this, we expect some criticism from the private sector if the Government adopts our recommended approach. Domestic minimum tax Issue 103. The GloBE rules contemplate that countries may introduce a domestic minimum tax (DMT), which would use the same tax base as the GloBE rules but take priority over the IIR and UTPR in respect of low taxed income earned in that country. For New Zealand, this tax would be closely based on the GloBE rules but would apply to undertaxed profits in New Zealand. It would mean that New Zealand would collect all of the top-up tax on such profits, rather than sharing it with other countries with Pillar Two rules. 104. Submitters were asked whether New Zealand should adopt a DMT, whether it should apply only to New Zealand headquartered MNEs, and if so, how it should operate. Submissions received 105. Submitters favoured New Zealand adopting a DMT. CAANZ did not express a final view but said New Zealand should strongly consider a DMT if a if a critical mass of countries enact the GloBE rules and DMTs. 106. Tax Justice Aotearoa, which opposed a DMT, did not provide reasoning. Those in favour generally pointed to a preference for dealing with Inland Revenue rather IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 22 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] than overseas revenue authorities and the reduction in compliance costs this would mean for taxpayers. However, most of those in favour caveated that they would want a DMT to be defensive-only, that is, to apply only where another countries’ UTPR would otherwise apply. This logic also extended to the timing of introducing a DMT, where three submitters argued New Zealand’s DMT should only come into effect once other countries’ UTPRs are in force. 107. Four submitters stated that imputation credits should be allowed for taxes paid under a DMT, for the same reasons as outlined in the submissions on imputation credits generally. 108. KMPG and CTG both considered a DMT should apply only to New Zealand- headquartered firms. The primary reason was that the benefit of a DMT for New Zealand headquartered MNEs (simplification for taxpayers) would not apply to foreign-headquartered businesses . PwC thought it should apply to all in-scope businesses, and pointed to a need for detailed analysis of the proposed costs and revenues associated with expanding a DMT to overseas-headquartered firms. 109. Several submitters commented that the proposed introduction of a DMT should warrant its own consultation process before implementation, considering the complexity involved. Officials’ recommendation 110. In line with most of the submissions, officials recommend that the GloBE proposals be progressed on the basis that a DMT will be adopted for New Zealand headquartered MNEs. This will ensure that they do not need to pay tax under any other country’s UTPR. Officials will also raise with the OECD the possibility of allowing this tax to give rise to an imputation credit. Treatment of foreign GloBE taxes in determining New Zealand income tax liability Issue 111. Whether or not New Zealand adopts GloBE rules, if other countries do so, the status of GloBE tax for purposes of calculating New Zealand tax on foreign earnings will need to be dealt with. 112. Officials stated in the issues paper their view that the payment of foreign GloBE tax should not give rise to a tax credit or deduction in New Zealand. This was on the basis that allowing a deduction or credit for a top up tax would be illogical (as it would effectively neutralise the top up tax) and give rise to circularity problems. Submitters were asked if they agreed with this view. Submissions received 113. Only three submissions were received on this point. All three agreed with officials that there should be no tax credit or deduction allowed. Officials’ recommendation 114. In line with submissions, officials recommend that payment of GloBE taxes overseas by New Zealand companies does not give rise to a deduction or credit for New Zealand income tax purposes. Fiscal Implications 115. Our initial modelling, aided by the OECD’s global economic impact assessments (which continue to be updated) indicate that the GloBE rules proposals will raise revenue. It is noted that there are a high number of assumptions in this model, as IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 23 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] it is dependent on the final rules (in particular safe harbours), how and which countries implement GloBE rules and the behavioural response of MNEs. 116. Our forecast revenue estimate for GloBE rules in New Zealand is approximately $40-45 million per annum made up of: • $25 million per annum from GloBE top-up tax from applying the IIR to New Zealand MNEs. We expect this to increase over time as transitional concessions are unwound. • $16 million per annum from an increase in New Zealand income tax paid by New Zealand headquartered MNEs due to reduced profit shifting. This benefit arises whether or not New Zealand adopts GloBE rules itself. • It is expected that additional revenue could be raised through applying the UTPR to MNEs with substance in New Zealand and the DMT to New Zealand headquartered MNEs. It is also possible that additional revenue will be raised from foreign headquartered MNEs who have a reduced incentive to shift profits out of New Zealand. However it is not possible to estimate the amount of this revenue. 117. The first payments made by MNEs under the GloBE rules are not expected to be made until the 2026/27 fiscal year, assuming the rules come into force from 1 January 2024. It is unusual in a New Zealand context for income tax relating to a year not to be received at all until 16 months (in the initial year, 20 months) after the end of the year in which the income arises. The reason for the delay is the status of GloBE rules taxation as a taxation of last resort. It can only be determined after all other taxes are determined. In some countries, determination of income tax obligations may take a relatively long time. Administration cost 118. From a cost perspective, the build and ongoing administration costs are dependent on the final design aspects. We will provide further detail on this following the finalisation of the following areas: • The content of the GloBE information and tax returns a nd details of validations that will be stipulated for these returns • Whether New Zealand adopts the domestic minimum tax for foreign headquartered multinationals • Safe harbours and simplifications • Content of the Country by Country information exchange schema. 119. Our current estimate is that it will cost around $10.9 million to deliver the GloBE rules and $5.2 million to deliver the associated Country by Country reporting change. A separate briefing note will be prepared that will bring together the funding requirements and options for all of the OECD-driven initiatives 120. Given the 18 month delay between the effective date of the rules and the first date that a return will be required to be filed, it should be possible for most of the build and administration costs to be deferred until it is certain that New Zealand will (along with a critical mass of other countries) implement the rules. This will also be dealt with in the separate briefing note. s 9(2)(a) Doc 4 s 9(2)(a) \[IN CONFIDENCE\] POLICY AND STRATEGY Tax policy report: Global Anti-Base Erosion tax rules for New Zealand – Cabinet approval Date: 9 February 2023 Priority: Medium Security level: In Confidence Report number: IR2022/466 Action sought Action sought Deadline Minister of Revenue Sign and refer the attached Cabinet Paper to Cabinet Office 2 March 2023 Minister of Finance Sign and refer the attached Cabinet Paper to Cabinet Office 2 March 2023 Contact for telephone discussion (if required) Name Position Telephone Casey Plunket Special Policy Advisor Doc 5 In Confidence IR2022/466: Global Anti-Base Erosion Tax Rules – Cabinet approval Page 1 of 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 9 February 2023 Minister of Revenue Minister of Finance Global Anti-Base Erosion tax rules for New Zealand – Cabinet approval 1. On 22 September Treasury and Inland Revenue officials presented the tax policy report “OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand – summary of consultation and officials’ recommendations” (the Tax Policy Report). You agreed with officials that New Zealand should enact GloBE rules and that the design and delivery follow the recommendations in the Tax Policy Report. 2. On 13 October Inland Revenue officials submitted a Cabinet paper to be referred to the Cabinet Office which covered the recommendations you agreed to in the Tax Policy Report. This paper noted that the funding of the build and ongoing administrative costs required by the GloBE initiative, as well as other international initiatives, had not been determined and we would modify this paper if any changes were necessary, prior to referral to the Cabinet Office. 3. The funding decisions for the international initiatives have now been considered by Inland Revenue and the Treasury and the Cabinet paper has been modified to request Cabinet approval for the one-off and ongoing administration costs for Vote Revenue, covering the GloBE rules and country by country reporting (CbCR). 4. CbCR costs are included as Pillar Two leverages off the existing reporting requirements under CbCR. This is done to minimise the additional compliance costs for in-scope entities. Inland Revenue will incorporate the current CbCR into START and streamline the process. This provides a sustainable solution to ensure Inland Revenue can meet its international obligations. Capacity constraints 5. Inland Revenue is committed to deliver the current policy initiatives agreed to by Cabinet including the ones in this paper. We have assessed that the Government’s current tax and social policy work programme will use up most of our specialist design and delivery capacity over the next three years. Upcoming proposals in the next two omnibus taxation bills are also absorbing these same resources. In addition, if the initiatives that Ministers are currently seeking advice on proceed this will put further pressure on this capacity and will require reprioritisation and/or rescheduling of the existing work programme. Any further reduction in Inland Revenue’s Budget 23 cost pressure bid will likely exacerbate this pressure. 6. Inland Revenue is undertaking work to try to reduce its capacity constraints and continually looking at whether a reprioritisation of Inland Revenue’s existing and future commitments will be required to enable delivery of any new policy initiatives, in this timeframe, including this one. This means Inland Revenue may be unable to deliver on policy options that Ministers have already agreed to or wish to progress. Inland Revenue will report back to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue on options to reprioritise if this becomes necessary. Globe updates OECD updated economic impact assessment 7. On 18 January 2023, the OECD presented an updated economic impact assessment for the GloBE rules. The OECD estimates that the GloBE rules will increase global corporate income tax by approximately 9% or US $220 billion. This is up from 6- In Confidence IR2022/466: Global Anti-Base Erosion Tax Rules – Cabinet approval Page 2 of 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 7.5% or US $130-180 billion from the 2021 economic impact assessment. The rationale for the increase is: • Better data on global low-taxed profit • Increase in low-taxed profit over time • Modelling a consistent application of GloBE rules across jurisdictions 8. The New Zealand revenue estimate from GlobE remains unchanged from our previous analysis. This is because we used CbCR data to calculate the expected New Zealand revenue from GloBE, which provides a more accurate picture for New Zealand, whilst utilising the underlying assumptions the OECD used in its estimate. As these underlying assumptions have not changed in the updated economic impact assessment our revenue did not need to be revised. OECD release of further technical guidance on the GloBE rules 9. On 2 February 2023 the OECD released further technical guidance on the Pillar 2 GloBE rules. Of note for the government is further detail on the mechanics of the domestic minimum tax (DMT). The DMT is calculated using the GloBE rules, but only on local (in-country) profits. It has priority over the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) and the Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR). 1 10. The DMT guidance confirms that, if an in-scope MNE pays a DMT which gives rise to an imputation credit, this will not result in the DMT being non-qualifying. Consequently, for NZ MNEs whilst GloBE taxes paid under an IIR or UTPR will not give rise to an imputation credit, GloBE tax paid under the DMT will attract an imputation credit. Country updates 11. On 15 December 2022, the Council of the European Union reached unanimous agreement to implement Pillar Two. The EU Directive requires Member States to transpose the rules into domestic law by 31 December 2023. The Directive states the IIR will be effective for periods on or after 31 December 2023 and the UTPR on or after 31 December 2024. Recommendations 12. We recommend that you sign the attached Cabinet paper and refer it to the Cabinet Office. The Cabinet paper is consistent in all respects with the recommendations you agreed to in the Tax Policy Report. 13. The Cabinet paper needs to be lodged with the Cabinet Office by 10am on Thursday 2 March 2023 for consideration by the Cabinet Economic Development Committee on Wednesday 8 March 2023. 1 The IIR applies on a top-down basis, giving the ultimate parent entity country, or an intermediate parent entity country, the right to collect GloBE top-up tax where the income is earned, if it has not been taxed under a DMT. The UTPR is a back-up rule which allocates GloBE top-up tax in proportion to the group’s payroll costs and tangible asset values in each country with GloBE rules. This ensures that if the country where an MNE has its headquarters decides not to implement the GloBE rules, the MNE will still have to pay top-up tax if it operates in countries that have GloBE rules.

This report seeks joint agreement to additional decisions necessary for the introduction into Parliament of legislation giving full effect to the GloBE rules in New Zealand. Background 2. On 3 April, Cabinet agreed to: 2.1 adopt the OECD’s Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) rules in New Zealand once a critical mass of other countries do so; 2.2 incorporate the GloBE rules into New Zealand tax law by reference to the OECD Model Rules, commentary, and administrative guidance; and 2.3 delegate authority to the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue to make additional joint decisions on any policy and drafting issues arising as appropriate \[ CAB-23-MIN-0111 refers\]. 3. The GloBE rules ensure that multinational enterprises (MNEs) with annual revenues above €750 million are subject to tax of at least 15% on their mobile income, on a country-by -country basis. Where income in a country is subject to an effective tax rate (ETR) of less than 15% it will be subject to a ‘top-up tax’ . A top-up tax can be collected, in the following order, by either: 3.1 the country in which the MNE derived the relevant income, under a Domestic Minimum Tax (DMT); 3.2 the country in which the MNE is headquartered, or an intermediate parent is located, under an Income Inclusion rule (IIR); or 3.3 all countries that have adopted the rules in which the MNE has operations, under an Under-taxed Profits Rule (UTPR). 4. The OECD Model Rules were approved by the more than 130 countries in the OECD- led Inclusive Framework in December 2021, with detailed commentary released in March 2022 and further administrative guidance released in February 2023. If a country adopts the GloBE rules, it must adopt the OECD Model Rules, commentary, and administrative guidance to ensure they are applied consistently across countries. The GloBE rules are expected to be adopted by participating countries in 2023, effective from no earlier than 2024 (for DMTs and IIRs) and 2025 (for UTPRs). 5. Cabinet has agreed to incorporate the GloBE rules into legislation by reference to the OECD Model Rules, commentary, and administrative guidance, rather than by converting them into New Zealand legislation. This significantly reduces the administrative cost for government and increases the likelihood that our Gl oBE rules will be considered “qualifying”, meaning locally headquartered MNEs will be subject to New Zealand’s IIR and not be required to pay top-up tax in other jurisdictions.

Officials have identified the following areas for ministerial decisions in addition to those already made by Cabinet. GloBE Registration 7. Officials consider that a registration requirement for in-scope MNEs with operations in New Zealand, similar to the system used for GST, would significantly lower the administrative burden of the GloBE rules for IR. This would give us a defined and regularly updated population to monitor. 8. However, the exact scope of the rules will not be clear until safe harbour negotiations are finalised. To allow for flexibility as the regime develops, GloBE registration details would take an electronic form to be prescribed by the Commissioner. 9. We recommend MNEs be required to register with IR within six months of the end of the first income year in which they are in scope of New Zealand’s GloBE rules and to deregister with IR within six months of the end of the first year in which they are out of scope of New Zealand’s GloBE rules. Top-up tax return 10. The GloBE rules stipulate that in-scope MNEs must file GloBE information returns (GIRs) in jurisdictions in which they operate, which will contain the information required to calculate any top-up tax the MNE must pay. However, it is up to each jurisdiction to determine the rules for filing a tax return for the top-up tax. 11. Officials consider that all in-scope MNEs with operations in New Zealand should be required to file an annual top-up tax return in New Zealand. If they have no top-up tax liability, the return would simply be nil. This would ensure that they all make a conscious and affirmative statement regarding their New Zealand top-up tax position. 12. To allow for flexibility as the regime develops, the top-up tax return would take an electronic form to be prescribed by the Commissioner. We envisage a short return. GloBE penalties 13. The commentary on the GloBE rules states that jurisdictions should make penalties or sanctions for non-compliance with the GIR commensurate with penalties or sanctions in respect of other information return filing obligations in the jurisdiction. 14. Once the GloBE rules are incorporated, and if you agree to introduce a top-up tax return, penalties for not filing or late filing of a tax return (up to $500) and shortfall penalties (from 20% to 150% of a shortfall in a tax position) already in the Tax Administration Act can be amended to apply to top-up tax. However, we consider two new penalties are desirable. 15. Officials believe a penalty should apply where an in-scope MNE with operations in New Zealand does not register on a timely basis. The administrative burden for IR of keeping track of which MNEs are in scope would be prohibitive. If IR do es not know who is in scope of the rules it cannot apply the GloBE rules effectively. 16. We believe a penalty should also apply where an in-scope MNE with operations in New Zealand does not file a complete GIR on a timely basis. That is because IR cannot determine whether an MNE has a top-up tax liability without the information in the GIR. Moreover, with respect to a New Zealand-headquartered MNE, New IR2023/105: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules – Additional decisions Page 3 of 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Zealand is obliged to exchange certain information with other jurisdictions in which the MNE operates, fifteen months after the end of the MNEs’ fiscal year. If a GIR is incomplete or filed late, we will be unable to fulfil our information exchange obligations. 17. We have found two examples of penalties in the TAA that could be considered commensurate for non-compliance with these obligations, on the basis that they also apply to large MNEs. Both are civil penalties of up to $100,000. The relatively high penalty reflects the size of the taxpayers affected. We therefore recommend introducing equivalent civil penalties of up to $100,000 where an in-scope MNE with operations in New Zealand: 17.1 does not complete GloBE registration on a timely basis; or 17.2 does not file a complete GIR on a timely basis. 18. We note that, in Australia, a “significant global entity” who does not file a tax return by the due date can be liable for a late filing penalty of between $111,000 and $555,000, depending on how overdue the return is. Country-by-Country Report penalty 19. The Country-by -Country Reporting rules were implemented in 2016 as part of the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan to help jurisdictions risk assess large MNEs primarily as to their compliance with transfer pricing rules. They require MNEs with a combined revenue of €750 million or more (the same population that is subject to the GloBE rules) to provide an annual report that breaks down key elements relevant to their transfer pricing policies by jurisdiction. The Country-by -Country Report (CbCR) is the forerunner to the GIR. In addition to continuing to be used for transfer pricing risk assessment, it will be used for transitional safe harbour calculations under the GloBE rules and is therefore also necessary for the effective administration of the rules. 20. Currently, there is no penalty under New Zealand law for not filing a CbCR. Officials expect future OECD peer reviews of our GloBE and CbCR rules to note this and recommend a penalty be introduced to incentivise compliance, particularly given the flow-on impact to other jurisdictions with whom we are obliged to exchange information collected in the CbCR. Given this, and the size of the in-scope taxpayers, officials recommend applying an up to $100,000 civil penalty to in-scope MNEs with operations in New Zealand who do not file a complete CbCR return on a timely basis. This aligns with the penalty recommended for the GIR. Domestic Income Inclusion Rule vs Domestic Minimum Tax (DMT) 21. On 3 April Cabinet agreed to our recommendation to introduce a DMT alongside the GloBE rules (which mandatorily include an IIR and a UTPR) \[CAB-23-MIN-0111 refers\]. In the Cabinet paper, we explained that the DMT would ensure that if a New Zealand-headquartered MNE had an effective tax rate of below 15% on its New Zealand income in a given year (e.g., because it makes an untaxed capital gain), New Zealand would collect the top up tax rather than another country. 22. Following recent work by the OECD, it is now clear that the tax we described as a DMT is better described as a domestic IIR. This is because: 22.1 it is only intended to apply to New Zealand headquartered MNEs; and 22.2 if a New Zealand ultimate parent entity has a direct subsidiary that is low- taxed where there is also a minority interest, the tax is only intended to apply for the portion of the low-tax profits attributable to the New Zealand MNE’s ownership.

This change in name does not affect the policy conclusion relating to the DMT and imputation credits, i .e., that unlike other tax paid under the GloBE rules, tax paid under a DMT/domestic IIR should give rise to imputation credits. 24. As the domestic IIR matches the policy outcome Cabinet has agreed to for the DMT in all but name, we ask Ministers to note the change in the name (but not the substance) of this element of the GloBE rules that the omnibus bill will introduce. The GloBE rules in relation to tax treaties 25. The OECD has stated that the IIR and UTPR are both compatible with tax treaties, such as New Zealand’s, based on the OECD Model. Nevertheless, the compatibility of the UTPR with the OECD model treaty has been the subject of some debate. This is on the basis that the UTPR is effectively an income tax imposed by a country (say New Zealand) on non-New Zealand income earned by a non-New Zealand company , where no New Zealand person has an interest in the non-New Zealand company. Accordingly, it is possible that some companies, and also some governments, may not agree with the OECD position, and might deny our ability to tax under the UTPR relying on a tax treaty between New Zealand and another country. 26. Officials do not believe that this would be likely to succeed if challenged in court. However, we do believe that it would be desirable to eliminate any possible uncertainty in this respect. Accordingly, we recommend confirming in legislation that the GloBE rules adopted by New Zealand apply notwithstanding the terms of a tax treaty, unless those terms expressly refer to the GloBE rules. This is consistent with the intention of the rules, and with the consensus position adopted by the OECD-led Inclusive Framework which has developed and approved the Model Rules. Although tax treaties usually take priority over the provisions of the Income Tax Act, there is precedent for such an over-ride in the Act. Consultation 27. Officials have consulted with: • Australian tax officials on their administrative regime for tax reporting by large multinational groups; • the OECD on the distinction between a DMT and a domestic IIR. Next steps 28. Draft legislation will be prepared in accordance with Ministers’ decisions and included in the upcoming omnibus bill.

This report outlines the process for increasing the student loan repayment threshold for New Zealand-based borrowers from 1 April 2023 and recommends you take a paper to Cabinet on this matter. 2. Since 2016, the student loan repayment threshold has been annually adjusted for movements in the Consumer Price Index – all groups excluding cigarettes and other tobacco products (CPI-ex tobacco). This measure was used to prevent on -going increases in tobacco excise, as well as any other price changes for tobacco products, flowing through to increases in financial assistance. 3. As the tobacco excise is no longer increased on an annual basis, the Government is returning to a CPI measure which includes tobacco products (CPI-all groups) when adjusting for the cost of living in other social assistance programmes. We recommend you seek approval from the Cabinet Legislative Committee for this approach to apply to the method used to index to the student loan repayment threshold. 4. The current repayment threshold is $21,268. Adjusting for CPI-all groups inflation between September 2022 to September 2023, the new threshold would be $22,828. This would allow New Zealand-based student loan borrowers to earn an additional $1,560 of income per year (or $30 per week) before they must begin to make loan repayments. 5. The fiscal impact of adjusting the repayment threshold are already accounted for in the forecast. However, the Parliamentary Counsel Office will need to be instructed to draft the necessary regulations to increase the threshold and Cabinet authorisation is needed for the regulations to go to the Executive Council. 6. Any new repayment threshold also needs to be included into payroll software in time for the 2023/24 income year. To provide payroll providers time to make and test changes to payroll software, Inland Revenue starts issuing payroll specifications about 4 months before the start of the next income year. 7. We therefore recommend aiming to have this matter considered by Cabinet Legislative Committee on 24 November. Recommended action We recommend that you: a) Note that under current policy, the student loan repayment threshold is adjusted for inflation annually. Noted IR2021/486: Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2021 Page 2 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] b) Agree that the adjustments to the student loan income repayment threshold for 2023/24 and subsequent years will be calculated using the consumer price index- all groups measure ( noting this is a departure from the previous CPI measure which excluded tobacco products). Agreed/Not Agreed c) Agree that the Parliamentary Counsel Office be instructed to draft the necessary regulations to increase the student loan repayment threshold to $22,828 and that the threshold apply from 1 April 2023. Agreed/Not Agreed d) Agree to take the attached Cabinet paper to the Cabinet Legislation Committee on 24 November, seeking agreement to recommendation (b) and asking for authority to submit the Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2022 to the Executive Council. Agreed/Not Agreed e) Agree to proactively release the Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key papers in full, in line with the provisions of the Official information Act 1982, within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions.

The student loan repayment threshold sets the amount of annual income at which a New Zealand-based borrower is required to begin making loan repayments. The threshold is a mechanism to reduce the likelihood that a low-income borrower would be placed into financial hardship because of their student loan repayment obligations. 9. The student loan repayment threshold is prescribed by regulation through Order in Council. 10. The Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2021 set the annual repayment threshold for the 2022/23 tax year at $21,268. Process for calculating the threshold adjustment 11. Adjusting the repayment threshold for inflation maintains the real value of the amount of income someone can earn before they are required to begin repaying their student loan. 12. In 2016, Cabinet agreed that the student loan repayment threshold is adjusted annually in line with the CPI-ex tobacco (September quarter) \[CAB-16-MIN-0655 refers\]. Using this measure reflected an all of Government approach to indexation to prevent on-going increases in tobacco excise, as well as any other price changes for tobacco products, flowing through to increases in financial assistance. 13. As the tobacco excise is no longer increased on an annual basis, the Government is returning to a CPI measure which includes tobacco products (CPI-all groups) when adjusting financial assistance for inflation 1 . We recommend that this change of approach also apply to the method for indexing the student loan repayment threshold. 14. Given returning to CPI-all groups is consistent with wider government policy, this approval can be sought through the attached Cabinet paper going to the Cabinet Legislative Committee. The Cabinet Office is comfortable with this approach. The threshold for the 2023/24 tax year 15. The CPI-all groups for the quarter ending 30 September 2022 was up 7.2% from the September 2021 quarter. Applying the CPI-all groups value to the formula set out in the Appendix to this report produced a new annual repayment threshold of $22,828 2 . This would mean that New Zealand-based student loan borrowers could earn an additional $1,560 per year (or $30 per week) before being required to make loan repayments. Regulations to be made by Order in Council 16. To increase the student loan repayment threshold to $22,828 per year from 1 April 2023, the Parliamentary Counsel Office needs to be instructed to draft regulations under s 215(a) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. 17. Ideally, the Order in Council should be made before the end of 2022 to provide sufficient certainty and time for payroll providers to build the new repayment threshold amount into payroll software in time for the 1 April 2023 application date. 1 In November 2021, Cabinet agreed to update the CPI measure used to calculate the indexation of the Family Tax Credit and Best Start Tax Credit to the consumers price index-all groups \[CAB-21-MIN-0457 refers\] 2 If the CPI-ex tobacco measure was used, the 2023/24 repayment threshold would also be $22,828 IR2021/486: Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2021 Page 4 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Financial implications 18. The impacts of adjusting the threshold from 1 April 2023 using the proposed methodology are already accounted for in forecasts \[CAB-16-MIN-0655 refers\]. Administrative and system implications 19. Threshold adjustments need to be built into payroll specifications for the relevant tax year and tested. Inland Revenue issues a number of draft specifications to allow payroll providers to gauge the impacts of payroll changes well in advance of their application. These specifications are normally published in December to apply for the following tax year. Consultation 20. Inland Revenue has consulted with the Ministry of Education and the Treasury on the proposal to increase the repayment threshold for the 2023/24 tax year. Proactive release considerations 21. If the student loan repayment threshold is adjusted, officials recommend that the Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers be proactively released within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Next steps 22. We recommend the attached Cabinet paper be lodged with the Cabinet Office by 17 November for the Cabinet Legislation Committee meeting on 24 November. 23. With your agreement, we will instruct PCO to draft the necessary regulations to increase the student loan repayment threshold to $22,828, applying from 1 April 2023. Drafting instructions need to be provided to PCO by 10 November.

CPI is the value of the Consumer Price Index all groups for 30 September Y-1 1106 is the CPI all groups for September 2021 CPI = 1186 (index for September 2022) Tnew = Ru (21256.50 x CPI / 1106) = Ru (21256.50 x 1186 / 1106) = Ru (21256.50 x 1.07233) = Ru (22794.04) The next multiple of 52 above 22794.04 is 22828 (52 x 439). So 22794.04 is rounded up to 22828. Tnew = 22828 Proposed threshold from 1 April 2023 is $22,828.
1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee STUDENT LOAN SCHEME (REPAYMENT THRESHOLD FOR 2023–24 TAX YEAR AND SUBSEQUENT TAX YEARS) REGULATIONS 2022. Proposal 1 I propose that the Cabinet Legislation Committee authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the attached Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold for 2023–24 Tax Year and Subsequent Tax Years) Regulations 2022 (the R egulations). The Regulations increase the income threshold at which New Zealand based borrowers must begin to repay their student loan, from $21,268 to $22,828, for the tax year beginning 1 April 2023. Policy 2 Section 215(a) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 allows the Governor - General to make regulations setting the annual repayment threshold, or a means by which it may be calculated or ascertained, via Order in Council. The current policy is to adjust the student loan repayment threshold for inflation annually. 3 In 2016, Cabinet agreed to adjust the student loan repayment threshold annually in line with movement in the CPI-ex tobacco (September quarter) \[CAB-16-MIN-0655 refers\]. Using this measure reflected an all of government approach to indexation to prevent on-going increases in tobacco excises flowing through to increases in financial assistance. 4 As tobacco excises are no longer increased on an annual basis, Government policy is to return to a CPI measure which includes tobacco products (CPI-all groups) when adjusting financial assistance for inflation. I recommend that this approach also apply to the student loan repayment threshold adjustment. 5 Under this policy, the student loan repayment threshold will increase from $21,268 a year to $22,828 for the tax year beginning 1 April 2023. 2qddsziq5 2022-12-01 10:06:56 Doc 2 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 6 The repayment threshold limits the likelihood that a low-income borrower would be placed in financial hardship because of having to meet student loan repayment obligations. This year’s adjustment would mean New Zealand- based borrowers could earn an additional $1,560 of income per year (or $30 per week) before being required to make repayments on their outstanding student loan balance. Financial Implications 7 The impacts of adjusting the student loan repayment threshold are already accounted for in forecasts \[CAB-16-MIN-0655 refers\]. Administrative Implications 8 Threshold adjustments need to be built into payroll specifications for the relevant tax year. Inland Revenue issues specifications to allow payroll providers to gauge the impacts of payroll changes on software well in advance of their application. These specifications are normally published in December to apply for the new tax year. Impact Analysis 9 Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that the Student Loan Repayment Threshold Adjustment 2022 proposal is exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement on the grounds that it has no or only minor impacts on businesses, individuals, and not-for-profit entities. Consultation 10 Inland Revenue has consulted with the Ministry of Education and the Treasury on the proposal to increase the repayment threshold for the 2023-24 tax year . Timing and 28-Day Rule 11 A waiver of the 28-day rule is not required as the Regulations are not proposed to come into force until 1 April 2023 and will apply for the 2023-24 tax year. 2qddsziq5 2022-12-01 10:06:56 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Publicity 12 Inland Revenue will inform payroll providers and publish information about the new threshold and its impact on the student loan section of its website. 13 Inland Revenue will publish an article about this change in its Tax Information Bulletin. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 14 The Regulations have been certified by the Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO) as being in order for submission to Cabinet. Regulations Review Committee 15 Officials consider that as the adjustment is of a minor and routine nature, it is unnecessary to refer the Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold for 2023–24 Tax Year and Subsequent Tax Years) Regulations 2022 to the House of Representatives under Standing Order 319. Compliance 16 The Regulations comply with: 16.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 16.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 16.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; 16.4 relevant international standards and obligations; Proactive Release 17 I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers, in line with the provisions of the Official Information Act 1982, within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. 2qddsziq5 2022-12-01 10:06:56 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Recommendations I recommend that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: 1 note that current policy is to adjust the student loan repayment threshold for inflation every year. 2 note that an Order in Council is required under section 215(a) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 to adjust the repayment threshold. 3 agree that the adjustments to the student loan income repayment threshold for 2023-24 and subsequent years will be calculated using the consumer price index-all groups measure (noting this is a departure from the previous CPI measure which excluded tobacco products). 4 note that the Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold for 2023–24 Tax Year and Subsequent Tax Years) Regulations 2022 increase the student loan repayment threshold to $22,828 for the 2023-24 tax year and come into force on 1 April 2023. 5 authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold for 2023–24 Tax Year and Subsequent Tax Years) Regulations 2022.

The current policy is to adjust the student loan repayment threshold for inflation annually. 3 In 2016, Cabinet agreed to adjust the student loan repayment threshold annually in line with movement in the CPI-ex tobacco (September quarter) \[CAB-16-MIN-0655 refers\]. Using this measure reflected an all of government approach to indexation to prevent on-going increases in tobacco excises flowing through to increases in financial assistance. 4 As tobacco excises are no longer increased on an annual basis, Government policy is to return to a CPI measure which includes tobacco products (CPI-all groups) when adjusting financial assistance for inflation. I recommend that this approach also apply to the student loan repayment threshold adjustment. 5 Under this policy, the student loan repayment threshold will increase from $21,268 a year to $22,828 for the tax year beginning 1 April 2023. 2qddsziq5 2022-12-01 10:06:56 Doc 2 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 6 The repayment threshold limits the likelihood that a low-income borrower would be placed in financial hardship because of having to meet student loan repayment obligations. This year’s adjustment would mean New Zealand- based borrowers could earn an additional $1,560 of income per year (or $30 per week) before being required to make repayments on their outstanding student loan balance. Financial Implications 7 The impacts of adjusting the student loan repayment threshold are already accounted for in forecasts \[CAB-16-MIN-0655 refers\]. Administrative Implications 8 Threshold adjustments need to be built into payroll specifications for the relevant tax year. Inland Revenue issues specifications to allow payroll providers to gauge the impacts of payroll changes on software well in advance of their application. These specifications are normally published in December to apply for the new tax year. Impact Analysis 9 Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that the Student Loan Repayment Threshold Adjustment 2022 proposal is exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement on the grounds that it has no or only minor impacts on businesses, individuals, and not-for-profit entities. Consultation 10 Inland Revenue has consulted with the Ministry of Education and the Treasury on the proposal to increase the repayment threshold for the 2023-24 tax year . Timing and 28-Day Rule 11 A waiver of the 28-day rule is not required as the Regulations are not proposed to come into force until 1 April 2023 and will apply for the 2023-24 tax year. 2qddsziq5 2022-12-01 10:06:56 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Publicity 12 Inland Revenue will inform payroll providers and publish information about the new threshold and its impact on the student loan section of its website. 13 Inland Revenue will publish an article about this change in its Tax Information Bulletin. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 14 The Regulations have been certified by the Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO) as being in order for submission to Cabinet. Regulations Review Committee 15 Officials consider that as the adjustment is of a minor and routine nature, it is unnecessary to refer the Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold for 2023–24 Tax Year and Subsequent Tax Years) Regulations 2022 to the House of Representatives under Standing Order 319. Compliance 16 The Regulations comply with: 16.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 16.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 16.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; 16.4 relevant international standards and obligations; Proactive Release 17 I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers, in line with the provisions of the Official Information Act 1982, within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. 2qddsziq5 2022-12-01 10:06:56 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Recommendations I recommend that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: 1 note that current policy is to adjust the student loan repayment threshold for inflation every year. 2 note that an Order in Council is required under section 215(a) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 to adjust the repayment threshold. 3 agree that the adjustments to the student loan income repayment threshold for 2023-24 and subsequent years will be calculated using the consumer price index-all groups measure (noting this is a departure from the previous CPI measure which excluded tobacco products). 4 note that the Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold for 2023–24 Tax Year and Subsequent Tax Years) Regulations 2022 increase the student loan repayment threshold to $22,828 for the 2023-24 tax year and come into force on 1 April 2023. 5 authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold for 2023–24 Tax Year and Subsequent Tax Years) Regulations 2022.

1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Offi ce of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee TAX ADMINISTRATION (EXTENSION OF DEADLINE FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT LOSS TAX CREDIT STATEMENTS) ORDER 2022 Proposal 1 This paper seeks the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s agreement to submit an Order in Council making the Tax Administration (Extension of Deadline for Research and Development Loss Tax Credit Statements) Order 2022 to the Executive Council. 2 This Order would extend the deadline for submitting applications for R&D loss tax credits for the 2021–22 tax year to 30 April 2023. Relation to Government Priorities 3 This Order in Council is recommended to help administer the R&D loss tax credit regime. The Government has a goal of increasing R&D expenditure to two percent of GDP by 2027, and R&D loss tax credits are one way of supporting businesses to increase their R&D expenditure. Background 4 R&D loss tax credits (R&DLTCs) are available to loss-making businesses undertaking R&D. The regime enables businesses to “cash out” their losses to bring forward the tax benefit of those losses. This is beneficial to start-up businesses and businesses engaged in the early phases of R&D, as they may not be able to receive the tax benefit of those losses for several years until they eventually make a profit. 5 An R&DLTC statement must be submitted to Inland Revenue i n each year that a business wants to cash out its losses. This statement is due on the earlier of: 5.1 The date the taxpayer files their income tax return; and 5.2 The due date for the income tax return. 6 This means that if a business files its income tax return at least a day before it files its R&DLTC statement, then it will be denied those R&DLTCs for the year, even if the return and statement were both filed before the due date of the income tax return. 2qddsziq5 2023-01-09 11:47:30 Doc 1 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 15 Not waiving the 28-day rule would cause frustration for businesses that are seeking R&DLTCs as soon as possible but cannot have their applications approved for a further 28 days, resulting in the delayed receipt of those tax credits. This is particularly harsh when some businesses file early to receive the cash-out as soon as possible. No waiver would also mean that Inland Revenue has to wait an extra 28 days to fully process affected R&DLTC statements, which would increase the processing backlog. Financial Implications 16 The Order in Council does not have any financial implications as it would bring forward the disbursement of R&DLTCs within the same financial year. 17 The numbers of businesses that may benefit from this proposal is about 100, based on previous years’ data. Compliance 18 The Order in Council complies with: 18.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 18.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 18.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; 18.4 relevant international standards and obligations; 18.5 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. Regulations Review Committee 19 There are no anticipated grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the attached Order in Council to the attention of the house. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 20 The Parliamentary Counsel Office has certified that the attached Order in Council is in order for submission to the Executive Council, provided that the 28-day rule is waived. Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 21 The Treasury’s Regulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that the proposal to extend the deadline for R&DLTC statements is exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement on the grounds that it has no or only minor impacts on businesses, individuals, and not-for-profit entities. 2qddsziq5 2023-01-09 11:47:30 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 22 The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) team has been consulted and confirms that the CIPA requirements do not apply to this proposal as the threshold for significance is not met. Consultation 23 Inland Revenue, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Callaghan Innovation, the Treasury, and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet were consulted on this paper. Communications 24 Inland Revenue will publish an article about this Order in Council in its Tax Information Bulletin. Proactive Release 25 I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers with appropriate redactions within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Committee: 1 note that R&D loss tax credits (R&DLTCs) currently require businesses to submit an R&DLTC statement on or before the date that an income tax return is filed for the year; 2 note that the Tax Administration Act 1994 contains a broad power to extend, by Order in Council, the time provided for doing something under the Act; 3 note that the Tax Administration (Extension of Deadline for Research and Development Loss Tax Credit Statements) Order 2022 would extend the deadline in recommendation 1 until 30 April 2023 for the 2021–22 tax year; 4 agree that the Tax Administration (Extension of Deadline for Research and Development Loss Tax Credit Statements) Order 2022 give effect to this extension of the deadline for submitting an R&DLTC statement; 2qddsziq5 2023-01-09 11:47:30 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 5 note that a waiver of the 28-day rule is sought: 5.1 so that the Tax Administration (Extension of Deadline for Research and Development Loss Tax Credit Statements) Order 2022 can come into force on 22 December 2022; 5.2 on the grounds that not waiving the rule will: 5.2.1 cause frustration for businesses that are seeking R&DLTCs as soon as possible but cannot have their R&DLTC application approved for a further 28 days, resulting in the delayed receipt of those tax credits; and 5.2.2 increase the processing backlog for Inland Revenue, as Inland Revenue would not be able to fully process affected R&DLTC statements for a further 28 days; 6 agree to waive the 28-day rule so that the Tax Administration (Extension of Deadline for Research and Development Loss Tax Credit Statements) Order 2022 can come into force on 22 December 2022; 7 authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Tax Administration (Extension of Deadline for Research and Development Loss Tax Credit Statements) Order 2022.

Policy 4The making of the proposed Order is a routine matter and has not required any new policy decisions. 5AEOI is an international initiative, led by the G20 and OECD, for cooperation between jurisdictions in the detection and prevention of ‘offshore tax evasion’. Offshore tax evasion occurs when people hide their wealth from tax authorities by locating it in offshore accounts. To counter this, AEOI rules require financial institutions worldwide to (i) identify accounts held or controlled by non-residents and (ii) annually report information on those non-residents and accounts to local tax authorities. The tax authorities then may exchange the information under tax treaties, to ensure that each country receives the relevant information needed to be able to verify that its residents are correctly reporting all offshore wealth and income for tax purposes. 6New Zealand incorporated the AEOI rules into the Tax Administration Act 1994 in 2017 and Inland Revenue has been conducting annual exchanges of AEOI information since then. The original list of reportable jurisdictions established in 2017 for the initial exchanges has grown each year as additional jurisdictions joined the initiative. For this year’s update of the list, the only country to be added is Jamaica. 1 2qddsziq5 2023-03-07 13:04:19 Doc 1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 7The AEOI rules, as enacted, authorise Inland Revenue to provide AEOI information to jurisdictions approved by Order in Council as ‘reportable jurisdictions’. The Order in Council mechanism was included because AEOI involves automated exchange of a considerable amount of highly sensitive personal and financial information. Government oversight and the ability to refuse exchange with particular jurisdictions is a safeguard. It is, however, a safeguard of last resort as it co-exists with many other international and domestic safeguards that are designed to ensure information is only exchanged, held and used as intended. 8By joining the AEOI initiative, Jamaica has also become a Participating jurisdiction that shares tax information with New Zealand. Timing and 28-Day Rule 9I propose that the Order come into force on 31 March 2023, to coincide with the beginning of the next AEOI reporting/exchange cycle on 1 April 2023. This timing can be met without any need for a waiver of the 28-day rule. Compliance 10The proposed Order complies with: 10.1the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 10.2the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 10.3the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 2020; 10.4relevant international standards and obligations; and 10.5the Legislation Guidelines, which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. Regulations Review Committee 11I am not aware of any grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order in Council to the attention of the House of Representatives under Standing Order 319. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 12The Parliamentary Counsel Office has certified that the Order is ready to be submitted to Cabinet. 2 2qddsziq5 2023-03-07 13:04:19 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Impact Analysis 13The Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that the Tax Administration (Reportable Jurisdictions for Application of CRS Standard) Amendment Regulations 2023 is exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement. This is granted on the grounds that the Government has limited statutory decision-making discretion or responsibility for the content of proposed delegated legislation. 14The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) team has been consulted and confirms that the CIPA requirements do not apply to this proposal as the threshold for significance is not met. Communications 15As for previous updates, Inland Revenue will advise all financial institutions and others registered as an AEOI stakeholder of the change to the reportable jurisdictions list by email. Inland Revenue will also publish an article about the change in its monthly Tax Information Bulletin publication. Proactive Release 16I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers (except for officials’ names) within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Consultation 17Public and Agency consultation on the reportable jurisdictions list was undertaken during the development of the initial list of reportable jurisdictions in 2017. When the list was first amended, financial institutions and AEOI stakeholders were asked to provide feedback on whether adding additional reportable jurisdictions would create any difficulties or concerns. No issues were raised during either of these consultation rounds. For most New Zealand financial institutions, this change will have no implications as they have taken a wider approach and provide AEOI information of tax-residents for all jurisdictions 18Given the lack of any concern during these prior rounds, no additional public consultation was undertaken on this occasion.

This report seeks your agreement to raise the prescribed interest rate used to calculate fringe benefit tax (FBT) on low-interest loans provided by employers to employees from 6.71% to 7.89%. This change is required to align the rate with current market interest rates. The new rate should apply from the quarter beginning 1 April 2023. 2. An Order in Council is required to make this change. Therefore, this report also seeks your approval for the Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO) to draft an Order in Council to raise the rate. As changes to the FBT prescribed interest rate have become a routine matter, we consider that your approval is sufficient for PCO to draft the Order. PCO can provide the Order in Council directly to Cabinet Office. Background 3. The FBT rules tax non-cash benefits provided to employees. Included in the definition of ‘fringe benefit’ is any employment-related loan on which the employer is charging a rate of interest that is below the market rate. The interest differential is taxable. A prescribed rate set by regulations is used as a proxy for the market rate of interest, to save employers the compliance costs associated with determining the market rate relevant to loans that they have provided to their employees. 4. The Income Tax Act 2007 permits the making of regulations by Order in Council to set a prescribed rate of interest for the purpose of calculating FBT on low-interest loans. Once a rate is set, it remains the prescribed rate until changed by a subsequent Order in Council. 5. The prescribed interest rate was last changed from 4.78% to 6.71%, effective from the quarter beginning 1 January 2023. Determination of appropriate prescribed rate 6. The Reserve Bank conducts a survey of first mortgage housing interest rates on the last day of each month, producing a ‘floating first mortgage new customer housing rate’. The rate is calculated as the weighted average interest rate for the surveyed institutions, the weightings being based on each institution’s share of total lending for housing purposes. This Reserve Bank series is a suitable indication of general market interest rates and is therefore used as the benchmark for setting the FBT prescribed rate. 7. The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate of 7.89% for December 2022 indicates that the current FBT prescribed rate of 6.7 1% is lower than the prevailing market rate. 8. Longstanding administrative policy has been to adjust the FBT prescribed interest rate when there has been a change in the floating first mortgage new customer In Confidence IR2023/004: Increase in FBT prescribed rate of interest Page 2 of 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] housing rate of 20 basis points or more. We recommend that the rate be adjusted to ensure that there is no long-term misalignment. Process issues 9. When regulations are made declaring the rate of interest applying to employment- related loans, they apply to quarters starting from a date at least 1 month following the date the regulations were made. 10. The Order in Council should be referred to the Cabinet Office by 16 Fe bruary 2023, so that it can be considered by the Cabinet Legislation Committee on 23 February 2023. PCO has arranged for the Order in Council to be provided directly to the Cabinet Office. 11. A Cabinet paper recommending that Cabinet approve the Order in Council and authorise its submission to the Executive Council is attached. We recommend that you lodge the Cabinet paper with the Cabinet Office by 10am on Thursday 16 February 2023. Revenue implications 12. Raising the FBT prescribed interest rate to 7.89% will increase the amount of net tax revenue that will be collected over the remainder of the 2022/23 fiscal year by approximately $0.56 million. The full year impact is estimated to be an increase in tax revenue of $2.23 million per year for subsequent years. $millions increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 & out years FBT revenue 0.780 3.100 3.100 3.100 3.100 Company tax (0.220) (0.870) (0.870) (0.870) (0.870) Net revenue 0.560 2.230 2.230 2.230 2.230 Impact on operating balance (0.560) (2.230) (2.230) (2.230) (2.230) 13.

\[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee INCOME TAX (FRINGE BENEFIT TAX, INTEREST ON LOANS) AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2023 Proposal 1This paper seeks the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s agreement to submit an Order in Council amending the Income Tax (Fringe Benefit Tax, Interest on Loans) Amendment Regulations 2023 to the Executive Council. The proposal is to increase the FBT prescribed interest rate for low-interest, employment- related loans from 6.71% to 7.89%, in line with an increase in market interest rates. 2Changes to the prescribed interest rate are a routine matter and do not involve a change of policy. The methodology used for setting the rate has been applied consistently since the early 1990s. Policy 3The fringe benefit tax (FBT) rules tax non-cash benefits provided to employees. Included in the definition of ‘fringe benefit’ is any employment- related loan on which the employer is charging a rate of interest that is below the market rate. The interest differential is taxable. A prescribed rate set by regulations is used as a proxy for the market rate of interest to save employers the compliance costs associated with determining the market rate relevant to loans that they have provided to their employees. 4The Income Tax Act 2007 (‘the Act’) allows regulations to be made to set the prescribed rate. Once a rate is set, it remains the prescribed rate of interest until changed by a subsequent Order in Council. The current FBT prescribed rate, which has applied since 1 January 2023, is 6.71%. 5The prescribed rate of interest is based on a Reserve Bank survey of first mortgage housing interest rates on the last day of each month (‘floating first mortgage new customer housing rate’). This is calculated as the weighted average interest rate for the surveyed institutions, the weightings being based on each institution’s share of total lending for housing purposes. This Reserve Bank series is selected as the benchmark for setting the FBT prescribed rate because it is seen as a good indication of market interest rates. 1 2qddsziq5 2023-03-07 13:15:43 DOC 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Timing 6The Act provides that when regulations to change the prescribed rate of interest are made, they apply to quarters starting at least one month following the date the regulations were made by the Governor General by Order in Council. Regulations that reduce the rate may apply for the current quarter if made at least one month before the end of the quarter. 7In accordance with the Act, I recommend that the regulations to raise the rate have effect from 1 April 2023 – the beginning of the next quarter. No waiver of the 28-day rule is required. Compliance 8The regulations comply with each of the following, where applicable: 8.1 the principles of the Treaty of WaitangiNot applicable 8.2 the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990Not applicable 8.3 the Human Rights Act 1993Not applicable 8.4 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993 Not applicable 8.5 relevant international standards and obligationsNot applicable 8.6 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. Complies Regulations Review Committee 9Officials consider that there are no grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order in Council to the attention of the House under Standing Order 319. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 10 The regulations have been certified by Parliamentary Counsel as being in order for submission to Cabinet. 2 2qddsziq5 2023-03-07 13:15:43 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Impact Analysis 11 The proposal is of a minor and mechanical nature and does not substantially alter existing arrangements. Therefore, a regulatory impact assessment is not required. 12 The proposal will not increase compliance costs as it is simply a change in the prescribed interest rate. Publicity 13 Inland Revenue will publish an article about these changes in its Tax Information Bulletin. Proactive Release 14 I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Consultation 15 The Treasury has been consulted in the preparation of this paper. Revenue implications 16 Raising the prescribed interest rate to 7.89% will increase the amount of FBT that will be collected by approximately $0.56 million over the 2022/23 year and $2.23 million per year over the remaining forecast period. 3 2qddsziq5 2023-03-07 13:15:43 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Recommendations I recommend that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: 1note that the regulations set the prescribed rate of interest for calculating the taxable benefit of low-interest, employment-related loans; 2agree that, consistent with the results of the Reserve Bank’s survey for December 2022, the FBT prescribed rate of interest should be raised from 6.71% to 7.89% from the quarter commencing on 1 April 2023; 3note the following changes as a result of the decision in recommendation b, with a corresponding impact on the operating balance: $millions increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue 2022/232023/242024/252025/26 2026/27 & out years FBT revenue 0.7803.1003.1003.1003.100 Company tax (0.220)(0.870)(0.870)(0.870)(0.870) Net revenue0.5602.2302.2302.2302.230 Impact on operating balance (0.560)(2.230)(2.230)(2.230)(2.230) 4note that the changes are forecast changes and do not have appropriation implications; 5authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Income Tax (Fringe Benefit Tax, Interest on Loans) Amendment Regulations 2023.

This report discusses the outcome of the regular review of the use of money interest (UOMI) rates. It seeks your agreement to increase the rates in line with the latest increases in market interest rates. Context and background 2. The UOMI rates, along with other rates used in the tax system, 1 are reviewed regularly to ensure that they align with market interest rates. The rates are calculated using formulae based on the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) survey of interest rates. 3. The UOMI rates are an important component of the tax compliance rules. By changing in line with underlying market rates, the UOMI rates provide taxpayers with the incentive to pay the right amount of tax at the right time. They apply to all revenue and duties. UOMI rates 4. There are two UOMI rates: 4.1 the taxpayer’s paying rate (also known as the UOMI underpayment rate), which is charged on underpayments of tax to Inland Revenue; 4.2 the Commissioner’s paying rate (also known as the UOMI overpayment rate), which is paid by the Commissioner on money paid to Inland Revenue above a taxpayer’s tax liability. 5. The underpayment rate is currently 9.21%, while the overpayment rate is currently 2.31%, based on RBNZ figures from August 2022. Principles for updating the rates 6. Longstanding administrative principles in setting the rates provide that both UOMI rates should be adjusted if: 6.1 the RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate or the floating first mortgage new customer housing rate moves by 100 basis points or more from the figures used to calculate the last rate change; or 6.2 one of these indexes moves by 20 basis points or more and the UOMI rates ha ve n’t been adjusted in the last 12 months. 1 The other rates are the FBT interest rate on employment-related loans and the deemed rate of return on attributing interests in foreign investment funds. In Confidence IR2023/ 003: Use of money interest rates review Page 2 of 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 7. When regulations are made altering the UOMI rates, the adjustment is applied from the day after the next standard provisional tax payment date – which, in this case, is 7 May 2023. However, 7 May 2023 falls on a Sunday which makes 8 May 2023 the date that tax payable is due. Therefore, the increased UOMI rates should apply from the next day which is 9 May 2023. 8. The formula for setting the rates is set out in the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Regulations 1997 as follows: 8.1 Section 2 of the Regulations provides that the taxpayer’s paying rate is set at the RBNZ floating first mortgage new customer housing rate plus 250 basis points (or 2.5%); 8.2 Section 3 of the Regulations provides that the Commissioner’s paying rate is set at the RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate less 100 basis points (or 1 percentage point). However, if this calculation would produce a figure lower than 0%, the rate is instead set at 0%, to ensure overpayments do not accrue negative interest. 9. The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate is a proxy for a debt that a taxpayer might prioritise over their tax obligations. In the absence of a UOMI charge, a taxpayer wanting to borrow money could simply underpay their tax and use Inland Revenue like a bank rather than borrow from a bank at a commercial interest rate. A conservative margin of 250 basis points is added to the mortgage rate in calculating the underpayment UOMI rate because the Commissioner does not have information about the likelihood of any individual taxpayer paying the UOMI charged to them (i.e., the taxpayer’s creditworthiness). 10. The Regulations provide that the methodology for setting the interest rate for overpaid tax is the latest RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate less 100 basis points. The RBNZ 90-d ay bank bill rate is the monthly average of the daily standard rates, and approximates the return a taxpayer might expect on a low-risk investment in the New Zealand Government. Ensuring that the Commissioner pays less interest to the taxpayer on overpaid tax than the taxpayer would receive as a return from a low- risk bond aims to prevent a payment of tax to Inland Revenue being used as an investment. Results of latest RBNZ figure review 11. According to RBNZ figures from December 2022, both the floating first mortgage new customer housing rate and the 90-day bank bill rate have risen more than 100 basis points from their positions at August 2022, which triggers the UOMI rates to be reset. 12. The UOMI underpayment rate should be increased to 10.39%, while the UOMI overpayment rate should be increased to 3.53%. 13. The RBNZ floating first mortgage new customer rate has risen by 118 basis points since August 2022 (the last time the UOMI rates were set). Accordingly, the underpayment rate should be increased by 118 basis points, from 9.21% to 10.39%. 14. The RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate has risen by 122 basis points since August 2022. Accordingly, the overpayment rate should be increased from 2.3 1% to 3.53%. Fiscal Impact 15. UOMI applies to both overpayments and underpayments of tax. More is charged by the Commissioner on underpayments than is paid to the taxpayer on overpayments. In Confidence IR2023/ 003: Use of money interest rates review Page 3 of 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] However, the charges to underpayments are impaired in the Crown accounts to reflect that most UOMI charged is never paid, and therefore must be written-off. This means that an increase in the underpayment rate also produces an increase in impairment expenditure. The rate of impairment reflects the average repayment rate of recent debt, updated in October each year. The impairment rate for the year ended 30 June 2022 is 67.63%. 16. The full year net saving for the 2022/23 fiscal year is estimated to be $1 million, and $3 million per annum for 2023/24 and later years. These savings comprise a revenue increase of $6 million in 2022/23 and $38 million per annum for 2023/24 and later years, and an increase in impairment expenditure of $5 million in 2022/23 and $35 million per annum for 2023/24 and later years.

Customs advise that a change in the underpayment UOMI rate will have some small operational and financial impacts. Customs’ compensatory interest rate is aligned with the UOMI underpayment rate, and an increase in the underpayment rate will correspondingly result in an increase to the compensatory interest rate. 19. Since the rate change to 7.96% on 30 August 2022, Customs have collected $116,516.44 in compensatory interest. 2 If the compensatory interest rate had been 10.39%, they estimate they would have collected $152,086.16 instead over that period, an increase of $35,569.72.

1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee TAXATION (USE OF MONEY INTEREST RATES) AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2023 Proposal 1 This paper seeks the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s agreement to submit an Order in Council amending the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates) Regulations 1998 to the Executive Council. 2 It is proposed to amend the regulation so the underpayment use of money interest (UOMI) rate is set at 10.39%, while the overpayment UOMI rate is set at 3.53%. Policy 3 The UOMI rates play an important role in the tax compliance rules. By moving in line with underlying market rates, the UOMI rates provide taxpayers with the incentive to pay the right amount of tax at the right time. The rates apply to all revenue and duties. 4 The Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for the UOMI underpayment and overpayment interest rates to be set by Order in Council. Once the rates are set, they remain the prescribed UOMI rates unless subsequently changed by Order in Council. 5 The methodology for calculating the rates is set out in the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Regulations 1997 (the Regulations). The Regulations provide that the interest rate for underpaid tax should be set at the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) floating first mortgage new customer housing rate plus 250 basis points. The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate reflects the variable interest rate offered by surveyed institutions to new borrowers for residential property, weighted by each surveyed institution’s total lending outstanding for housing purposes. 6 The Regulations provide that the interest rate for overpaid tax is set at the latest RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate less 100 basis points, or, if this would produce a negative figure, at 0%. The RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate is the monthly average of the daily standard rates. 2qddsziq5 2023-03-14 15:12:37 Doc 2 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 7 The current underpayment and overpayment rates are 9.21% and 2.31% respectively. The UOMI rates were last changed by Order in Council with effect from 17 January 2023 and were based on the interest rates for August 2022. 8 The RBNZ interest rates for December 2022 indicate that the 90-day bank bill rate has changed by 122 basis points since the rates were last adjusted. I consider that an adjustment of the UOMI rates is necessary to avoid a long- term misalignment. I therefore recommend the overpayment rate be increased to 3.53%. 9 The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate has also changed by 118 basis points since the rates were last adjusted. Therefore, I also recommend that the underpayment rate be increased to 10.39%. Timing 10 I propose to submit the Order in Council giving effect to the change in the UOMI underpayment rate to Cabinet for approval and submission to the Executive Council at its meeting on 23 February 2023. In order to minimise compliance costs, it is proposed that the new rate comes into force on 9 May 2023, the day after the due date for the third standard instalment of provisional tax. Compliance 11 The regulations comply with the principles, Acts, guidelines, and requirements set out below as follows: 11.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi Not applicable 11.2 the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 Not applicable 11.3 the Human Rights Act 1993 Not applicable 11.4 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993 Not applicable 11.5 relevant international standards and obligations Not applicable 11.6 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee Complies Regulations Review Committee 12 There are no anticipated grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order in Council to the attention of the House under Standing Order 319.

Financial Implications 15 The proposal to increase the UOMI rates, with the effective date of 9 May 2023, is estimated to result in net positive revenue of approximately $13 million over the forecast period. This number comprises the impact of the changes on tax revenue and on impairment expenditure. 16 The forecast net tax revenue impact of the increased revenue from the underpayment adjustment and the increased cost of the overpayment adjustment is shown in the table below. $ millions increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 & outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax revenue 6.000 38.000 38.000 38.000 38.000 Total Operating (6.000) (38.000) (38.000) (38.000) (38.000) 17 However, as a large part of underpayment debt is typically written off, there is a larger cost to revenue than is factored above.

This report discusses the outcome of the regular review of the use of money interest (UOMI) rates. It seeks your agreement to increase the rates in line with the latest increases in market interest rates. Context and background 2. The UOMI rates, along with other rates used in the tax system, 1 are reviewed regularly to ensure that they align with market interest rates. The rates are calculated using formulae based on the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) survey of interest rates. 3. The UOMI rates are an important component of the tax compliance rules. By changing in line with underlying market rates, the UOMI rates provide taxpayers with the incentive to pay the right amount of tax at the right time. They apply to all revenue and duties. UOMI rates 4. There are two UOMI rates: 4.1 the taxpayer’s paying rate (also known as the UOMI underpayment rate), which is charged on underpayments of tax to Inland Revenue; 4.2 the Commissioner’s paying rate (also known as the UOMI overpayment rate), which is paid by the Commissioner on money paid to Inland Revenue above a taxpayer’s tax liability. 5. The underpayment rate is currently 9.21%, while the overpayment rate is currently 2.31%, based on RBNZ figures from August 2022. Principles for updating the rates 6. Longstanding administrative principles in setting the rates provide that both UOMI rates should be adjusted if: 6.1 the RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate or the floating first mortgage new customer housing rate moves by 100 basis points or more from the figures used to calculate the last rate change; or 6.2 one of these indexes moves by 20 basis points or more and the UOMI rates ha ve n’t been adjusted in the last 12 months. 1 The other rates are the FBT interest rate on employment-related loans and the deemed rate of return on attributing interests in foreign investment funds.

Results of latest RBNZ figure review 11. According to RBNZ figures from December 2022, both the floating first mortgage new customer housing rate and the 90-day bank bill rate have risen more than 100 basis points from their positions at August 2022, which triggers the UOMI rates to be reset. 12. The UOMI underpayment rate should be increased to 10.39%, while the UOMI overpayment rate should be increased to 3.53%. 13. The RBNZ floating first mortgage new customer rate has risen by 118 basis points since August 2022 (the last time the UOMI rates were set). Accordingly, the underpayment rate should be increased by 118 basis points, from 9.21% to 10.39%. 14. The RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate has risen by 122 basis points since August 2022.

Agreed Not agreed Agreed Not agreed 1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee TAXATION (USE OF MONEY INTEREST RATES) AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2023 Proposal 1 This paper seeks the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s agreement to submit an Order in Council amending the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates) Regulations 1998 to the Executive Council. 2 It is proposed to amend the regulation so the underpayment use of money interest (UOMI) rate is set at 10.39%, while the overpayment UOMI rate is set at 3.53%. Policy 3 The UOMI rates play an important role in the tax compliance rules. By moving in line with underlying market rates, the UOMI rates provide taxpayers with the incentive to pay the right amount of tax at the right time. The rates apply to all revenue and duties. 4 The Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for the UOMI underpayment and overpayment interest rates to be set by Order in Council. Once the rates are set, they remain the prescribed UOMI rates unless subsequently changed by Order in Council. 5 The methodology for calculating the rates is set out in the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Regulations 1997 (the Regulations). The Regulations provide that the interest rate for underpaid tax should be set at the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) floating first mortgage new customer housing rate plus 250 basis points. The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate reflects the variable interest rate offered by surveyed institutions to new borrowers for residential property, weighted by each surveyed institution’s total lending outstanding for housing purposes. 6 The Regulations provide that the interest rate for overpaid tax is set at the latest RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate less 100 basis points, or, if this would produce a negative figure, at 0%. The RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate is the monthly average of the daily standard rates. 2qddsziq5 2023-03-14 15:12:37 Doc 2 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 7 The current underpayment and overpayment rates are 9.21% and 2.31% respectively. The UOMI rates were last changed by Order in Council with effect from 17 January 2023 and were based on the interest rates for August 2022. 8 The RBNZ interest rates for December 2022 indicate that the 90-day bank bill rate has changed by 122 basis points since the rates were last adjusted. I consider that an adjustment of the UOMI rates is necessary to avoid a long- term misalignment. I therefore recommend the overpayment rate be increased to 3.53%. 9 The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate has also changed by 118 basis points since the rates were last adjusted. Therefore, I also recommend that the underpayment rate be increased to 10.39%. Timing 10 I propose to submit the Order in Council giving effect to the change in the UOMI underpayment rate to Cabinet for approval and submission to the Executive Council at its meeting on 23 February 2023. In order to minimise compliance costs, it is proposed that the new rate comes into force on 9 May 2023, the day after the due date for the third standard instalment of provisional tax. Compliance 11 The regulations comply with the principles, Acts, guidelines, and requirements set out below as follows: 11.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi Not applicable 11.2 the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 Not applicable 11.3 the Human Rights Act 1993 Not applicable 11.4 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993 Not applicable 11.5 relevant international standards and obligations Not applicable 11.6 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee Complies Regulations Review Committee 12 There are no anticipated grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order in Council to the attention of the House under Standing Order 319. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 13 The Parliamentary Counsel Office has certified that the attached Order in Council is in order for submission to Cabinet. 2qddsziq5 2023-03-14 15:12:37 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Impact Analysis 14 A regulatory impact assessment is not required as the proposal is of a minor and routine nature and does not substantially alter existing arrangements. Financial Implications 15 The proposal to increase the UOMI rates, with the effective date of 9 May 2023, is estimated to result in net positive revenue of approximately $13 million over the forecast period. This number comprises the impact of the changes on tax revenue and on impairment expenditure. 16 The forecast net tax revenue impact of the increased revenue from the underpayment adjustment and the increased cost of the overpayment adjustment is shown in the table below. $ millions increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 & outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax revenue 6.000 38.000 38.000 38.000 38.000 Total Operating (6.000) (38.000) (38.000) (38.000) (38.000) 17 However, as a large part of underpayment debt is typically written off, there is a larger cost to revenue than is factored above. To represent estimated write- offs, underpayments are impaired in the Crown accounts. The impairment rate of 67.63% is based on debt repayment rates for the year ending 30 June 2022. Forecast impairment expenditure is presented in the table below: $ millions increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 & outyears Non-Departmental Other Expenses: Impairment of debt and bad debt write-offs 5.000 35.000 35.000 35.000 35.000 Total Operating 5.000 35.000 35.000 35.000 35.000 2qddsziq5 2023-03-14 15:12:37 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Publicity 18 Inland Revenue will publish an item about these changes in the next available issue of its Tax Information Bulletin.

Recommendations I recommend that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: 1 agree that the UOMI underpayment rate increase from 9.21% to 10.39%; 2 agree that the UOMI overpayment rate increase from 2.31% to 3.53%; 3 agree that the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates) Amendment Regulations 2023 give effect to the rates referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 above; 4 agree that the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates) Amendment Regulations 2023 come into force on 9 May 2023; 5 note the following changes as a result of the decision in recommendations 1 and 2 above, with a corresponding impact on the operating balance: $ millions increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 & outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax revenue 6.000 38.000 38.000 38.000 38.000 Total Operating (6.000) (38.000) (38.000) (38.000) (38.000) 2qddsziq5 2023-03-14 15:12:37 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 6 approve the forecast change in appropriations for Non-Departmental Other Expenses set out in recommendation 5, as a result of the decision in recommendations 1 and 2, with a corresponding impact on the operating balance: $ millions increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 & outyears Non-Departmental Other Expenses: Impairment of debt and bad debt write-offs 5.000 35.000 35.000 35.000 35.000 Total Operating 5.000 35.000 35.000 35.000 35.000 7 agree that the proposed change to the Impairment of Debt and Debt Write-offs appropriation for 2022/23 above be included in the 2022/23 Supplementary Estimates and that, in the interim, the increase(s) be met from Imprest Supply; 8 authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates) Amendment Regulations 2023.

1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Offi ce of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee TAX ADMINISTRATION (EXTENSION OF DUE DATES) ORDER 2023 Proposal 1 This paper seeks the Cabinet Extreme Weather Recovery Committee’s agreement to submit an Order in Council making the Tax Administration (Extension of Due Dates) Order 2023 to the Executive Council. Background 2 Between 8 January 2023 and 3 February 2023, a series of fronts crossed the upper North Island delivering extremely heavy rain, high winds, and widespread flooding in the Auckland, Bay of Plenty, Northland, and Waikato regions. Then, between 12 February and 16 February 2023, Cyclone Gabrielle moved across the North Island, also resulting in heavy rain, high winds, and flooding. 3 These severe weather events have impacted upon taxpayer’s businesses and livelihoods. Officials have been notified by taxpayer representatives that due to the weather events, some taxpayers will struggle to meet various statutory timeframes. These include: 3.1 Making a payment of income derived by a trustee of a trust in the income year to a beneficiary of the trust in the income year in order for the income to be treated as beneficiary income; and 3.2 Writing off a debt as bad in the income year in order for a deduction to be made available to them in the income year. 4 An extension to these statutory timeframes has been requested to support impacted taxpayers. Cabinet has already agreed to other extensions of statutory deadlines via Order in Council in response to the weather events \[CAB-23-MIN-0031\]. Policy 5 The Tax Administration Act 1994 contains a broad power to extend, by Order in Council, the time provided for doing something under the Act, whether or not that time has already passed. This would include extending the timeframe f or making a payment of income derived by a trustee of a trust in the income year to a beneficiary of the trust, and, writing off a debt as bad in the income year. 2qddsziq5 2023-04-06 15:17:00 Doc 1 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 6 I therefore recommend making the Tax Administration (Extension of Due Dates) Order 2023. 7 This Order in Council would extend the time for meeting the statutory requirements for making distributions of beneficiary income and receiving a deduction for a bad debt to 31 May 2023. 8 The extension of time would only be made available to taxpayers whose ability to meet the statutory timeframes is significantly adversely affected by any of the severe weather events occurring between January and February of this year. Timing and 28-Day Rule 9 The extension would apply retrospectively to some taxpayers who were unable to meet the relevant statutory timeframes prior to the Order being made. It is therefore desirable to make the Order as soon as possible to provide certainty to taxpayers. 10 I propose that the Tax Administration (Extension of Due Dates) Order 2023 come into force as soon as possible. This would require a waiver of the 28-day rule for regulations. 11 A waiver is sought on the grounds that it is in the best interests of taxpayers to provide them certainty in an emergency time and the extension is taxpayer friendly. Financial implications 12 The Order in Council does not have any financial implications. 13 Baseline forecasts do not factor in the occurrence of weather events nor the consequent charging of penalties that might arise in absence of the proposed extension. Compliance 14 The Order in Council complies with: 14.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 14.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 14.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; 14.4 relevant international standards and obligations; 14.5 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. 2qddsziq5 2023-04-06 15:17:00 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Regulations Review Committee 15 There are no anticipated grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the attached Order in Council to the attention of the House. Although it is likely the Order in Councill would have retrospective effect for some taxpayers this is explicitly permitted by the empowering provision. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 16 The Parliamentary Counsel Office has certified that the attached Order in Council is in order for submission to the Executive Council, provided the 28-day rule is waived. Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 17 The Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that this proposal to extend the timeframes in relation to two taxpayer obligations under the Income Tax Act 2007 is exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement on the grounds that it is intended to temporarily defer or extend legislative deadlines where a declared emergency has made compliance with the existing legislative requirements impossible, impractical or unreasonably burdensome. Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 18 The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) team has been consulted and confirms that the CIPA requirements do not apply to this proposal as the threshold for significance is not met. Communications 19 Inland Revenue will publish an article about these changes in its Tax Information Bulletin. Proactive Release 20 I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers with appropriate redactions within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Consultation 21 The Treasury was consulted on this paper. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet was informed. 2qddsziq5 2023-04-06 15:17:00 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Committee: 1 note that due to the weather events some taxpayers are unable to meet statutory timeframes for making a distribution of beneficiary income and receiving a deduction for a bad debt; 2 note that the Tax Administration Act 1994 contains a broader power to extend, by Order in Council, the time provided for doing something under the Act; 3 note that the Tax Administration (Extension of Due Dates) Order 2023 would extend the statutory timeframes in recommendation 1 until 31 May 2023 for taxpayers whose ability to meet the timeframes was significantly adversely affected by any of the severe weather events occurring between January and February 2023; 4 authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Tax Administration (Extension of Due Dates) Order 2023; 5 note that a waiver of the 28-day rule is sought: 5.1 so that the regulations can come into force as soon as possible; 5.2 on the grounds that it is in the best interests of taxpayers to provide them certainty in a time of disruption; 6 agree to waive the 28-day rule so that the regulations can come into force as soon as possible.

Background 2 Between 8 January 2023 and 16 February 2023, a number of adverse weather events affected large parts of the North Island. 3 These weather events have impacted upon taxpayer’s businesses and livelihoods. In response to the events, the government enacted a number of provisions that provided tax relief from income tax and fringe benefit tax for certain cash and benefits provided by employers to flood affected employees. 4 In addition, the government enacted a provision that provides for the tax-free provision of accommodation to employees who are required to relocate to work on projects of limited duration for the rebuilding or recovery in areas covered by the North Island floods. 5 The six-month timeframe does not match the timeframe that was permitted in respect of the Canterbury earthquakes and it has been noted that timeframe is too short given the time to assess the work required. 6 Cabinet has agreed that this discrepancy be amended with retrospective effect in the next tax bill (LEG-23-MIN-0056 refers), however, the six-month timeframe for employees to commence work that is currently in the legislation will expire prior to that bill being enacted leaving taxpayers with no certainty around the tax implications of the provision of accommodation in the interim. 7 This could provide a disincentive for firms to relocate employees to work on these projects until the tax bill is enacted. Doc 1 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 2qddsziq5 2023-06-09 13:46:51 Policy 8 The provision enacted contains a power to extend or modify, by Order in Council, the time limits for an employee to commence work in a distant location affected by the North Island floods. 9 I therefore recommend making the Income Tax (Accommodation Expenditure— North Island Flooding Events) Order 2023. 10 This Order in Council would extend the time for employees relocating to a distant workplace to commence work on a limited duration project relating to the rebuild and recovery from the North Island flooding events from 6 months from the start of the relevant flooding event to 1 April 2024. 11 This will provide certainty for taxpayers who are looking to relocate staff to a distant workplace to work on these limited duration projects until the next tax bill is enacted. Timing and 28-D ay Rule 12 I propose that the Income Tax (Accommodation Expenditure—North Island Flooding Events) Order 2023 come into force 28 days after approval from the Executive Council. Financial implications 13 The Order in Council does not have any financial implications. 14 Baseline forecasts do not factor i n the occurrence of weather events nor the consequent charging of penalties that might arise in absence of the proposed extension. Compliance 15 The Order in Council complies with: 15.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 15.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 15.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; 15.4 relevant international standards and obligations; 15.5 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. Regulations Review Committee 16 There are no anticipated grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the attached Order in Council to the attention of the House. 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 2qddsziq5 2023-06-09 13:46:51 Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 17 The Parliamentary Counsel Office has certified that the attached Order in Council is in order for submission to the Executive Council. Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 18 The Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that the proposal to extend the time period for employees to relocate to a flood affected area is exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement. This is granted on the grounds that it provides limited temporary exemptions or modifications to existing legislative requirements in a situation where a declared emergency has made compliance with existing legislative requirements impossible, impractical or unreasonably burdensome. Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 19 The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) team has been consulted and confirms that the CIPA requirements do not apply to this proposal as the threshold for significance is not met. Communications 20 Inland Revenue will publish an article about these changes in its Tax Information Bulletin. Proactive Release 21 I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers with appropriate redactions within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Consultation 22 The Treasury was consulted on this paper. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Committee: 1 note that the government has previously enacted a provision to allow the provision of tax-free accommodation to employees relocating within 6 months from the start of the relevant flooding event to a distant workplace to commence work on a limited duration project relating to the rebuild and recovery from the North Island flooding events; 2 note this timeframe does not match that allowed for the Canterbury earthquakes and is too short given the time required to assess recovery and rebuild projects in the affected areas; 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 2qddsziq5 2023-06-09 13:46:51 3 note that Cabinet has previously approved a remedial amendment to correct this timeframe to match that permitted for the Canterbury earthquakes in the next tax bill (LEG-23-MIN-0056 refers); 4 note that the provision enacted contains a power to extend, by Order in Council, the time limits in that provision; 5 note that the Income Tax (Accommodation Expenditure—North Island Flooding Events) Order 2023 would extend the period for the relocation of employees relocating to a distant workplace to commence work on a limited duration project relating to the rebuild and recovery from the North Island flooding events from 6 months from the start of the relevant flooding event to 1 April 2024; 6 authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Income Tax (Accommodation Expenditure—North Island Flooding Events) Order 2023.

Attached is a Cabinet paper that recommends an Order in Council be made to set the deemed rate of return for the 2022-23 income year. Background 2. 3. 4. The Income Tax Act 2007 requires the deemed rate of return under foreign investment fund (FIF) rules for each income year to be set by Order in Council. New Zealand’s FIF rules tax New Zealand residents on attributed income from non- controlling investments in foreign companies, life insurance policies, and certain superannuation schemes. Since 1 April 2014, most interests in foreign superannuation schemes are taxed on transfer rather than under the FIF rules. The Act provides different methods to calculate FIF income or losses for tax purposes, one of which is the deemed rate of return method. An investor must use the deemed rate of return where: 4.1 The interest consists of certain non-ordinary shares that have debt characteristics; and 4.2 The comparative value method cannot be used because the end-of -year market value of the interest cannot be determined. 5. 6. Under the deemed rate of return method, income from a FIF is calculated each year by multiplying the opening value of the investment by the rate set annually by Order in Council. An Order in Council is now required to set the deemed rate of return for the 2022- 23 income year. Calculation 7. 8. The method for calculating the annual deemed rate of return was established and approved in 1994 (CAB (94) M 35/3 C(vi) refers). The calculation involves taking an average of the five-year “risk-free” Government bond rate at the end of each quarter of the income year and adding a risk premium margin of four percentage points. If the last day of a quarter falls on a weekend or statutory holiday, the rate on the next business day is used. Officials recommend that the current method for calculating the deemed rate of return be used again for the 2022-23 income year. It is a simple way of approximating the expected return on foreign equities, incorporating a risk premium of four percentage points above the return on “risk-free” debt such as Government bonds. The method has been used for every income year since 1994. \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] IR2023/149: Cabinet paper: Income tax (Deemed Rate of Return on Attributing Interests on Foreign Investment Fund, 2022-23 Income Year) Order 2023 Page 2 of 3 9. 10. The average of the quarterly five-year Government bond interest rates for the 2022–23 income year is 4.15%. This means that the deemed rate of return for the 2022–23 income year will be 8.15% (4.15% plus four percent). This is an increase from last year’s deemed rate of return, which was 6.01%. Despite an increase of 2.14%, the deemed rate of return method is used by a very small number of taxpayers, therefore, this change will have no quantifiable fiscal impact. Regulatory Impact Analysis 11.A Regulatory Impact Analysis is not required for this Cabinet paper because no policy decision is being sought. The deemed rate of return has been calculated in accordance with a formula that was approved by Cabinet in 1994 (CAB (94) M 35/3 C(vi) refers). Timing 12. 13. 14. 15. Because the deemed rate of return is based on five-year Government bond rates from across the year for which the rate applies, it must always be calculated after the end of the income year but apply retrospectively from the beginning of that year. This Order in Council will enable taxpayers using the deemed rate of return method to calculate their FIF income for the 2022–23 income year and therefore needs to apply retrospectively from 1 April 2022. Officials recommend that a waiver of the 28-day rule for regulations is sought for this Order in Council. Taxpayers that use the deemed rate of return are not able to use the old rate to file a return for the 2022–23 year; they must wait for the new rate to come into force. A waiver would be taxpayer-friendly and beneficial to the Government, as without a waiver some taxpayers would have to wait an extra 28 days to file a return because they are waiting on the rate to come into force. The attached Cabinet paper is drafted on the basis that a waiver is sought for the Order in Council. This will mean the Order comes into force on 16 June 2023 If you do not agree to recommend a waiver, we will supply you with an updated Cabinet paper. Cabinet paper and associated materials 16. 17. 18. The Cabinet paper and the advice sheet for the Order in Council are attached to this report. These should be signed and referred to the Cabinet Office by 10am, Thursday June 1, 2023, for consideration at the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s meeting on 8 June 2023. The Parliamentary Council Office will provide copies of the finalised Order in Council directly to the Cabinet Office. The rate will be published on the Inland Revenue website once the Order in Council ha s been made. Consultation 19.The Treasury was consulted on the Cabinet paper and agrees with its recommendation.
1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Associate Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee INCOME TAX (DEEMED RATE OF RETURN ON ATTRIBUTING INTERESTS IN FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUNDS, 2022-23 INCOME YEAR) ORDER 2023 Proposal 1 This paper proposes that Cabinet Legislation Committee authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the attached Order in Council, which will set the deemed rate of return on attributing interests in foreign investment funds at 8.15% for the 2022–23 income year. Background 2 New Zealand’s foreign investment fund (FIF) rules tax New Zealand residents on income from certain foreign investments. There are several methods for calculating a taxpayer’s income or loss from these investments, as set out in legislation. One of these is the deemed rate of return method. 3 The deemed rate of return method is used to calculate FIF income or loss from non-ordinary shares with debt-like properties, such as shares that guarantee a return. The method can only be used if the market value of the foreign investment cannot be determined at the end of the income year. Under the deemed rate of return method, income from a FIF is calculated each year by multiplying the opening book value of the investment by a deemed rate set annually by Order in Council. 4 The method for calculating the annual deemed rate of return was established and approved in 1994 (CAB Min (94) 35/3 C(vi) refers). The calculation takes an average of the five-year “risk-free” Government bond rates at the end of each quarter of the income year and then adds a risk premium margin of four percentage points. The current method is a suitable way of approximating the expected return on foreign equities and has been used for every income year since 1994. 2qddsziq5 2023-06-22 10:37:55 Doc 2 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Comment 5 The average of the quarterly five-year Government bond interest rates for the 2022-23 income year is 4.15%. The attached Income Tax (Deemed Rate of Return on Attributing Interests in Foreign Investment Funds, 2022–23 Income Year) Order 2023 therefore sets the deemed rate of return for the 2022–23 income year at 8.15% (4.15% plus four percent) in accordance with the current method of calculation. This is an increase from last year’s deemed rate of return, which was 6.01%. Timing and 28-D ay Rule 6 The new deemed rate of return should come into force as soon as practicable to allow taxpayers using this rate to file their tax returns as soon as they can. I therefore recommend that the new rate comes into force on 16 June 2023. 7 To ensure a commencement date of 16 June 2023, I recommend that the 28- day rule be waived for the coming into force of this Order. This will ensure that taxpayers using the deemed rate of return method for calculating their income are able to promptly file their tax return using the correct rate for the 2022–23 income year. 8 If a waiver is not agreed to, then taxpayers that use the deemed rate of return method will not be able to file a return until the 28-day period has been satisfied. Taxpayers in this situation are unable to use last year’s deemed rate of return to file for the 2022–23 income year and must wait for the current year’s rate to come into force. 9 It is of no benefit to taxpayers nor the Government to require taxpayers using the deemed rate of return method to wait an extra 28 days to file their tax return. This would be a source of frustration for taxpayers who want to file their tax returns quickly but are unable to do so. Therefore, I recommend that the 28-day rule be waived. Consultation 10 The Treasury has been consulted in the preparation of this paper and agrees with its recommendations. 2qddsziq5 2023-06-22 10:37:55 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Compliance 11 The Order complies with each of the following: 11.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 11.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 11.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; 11.4 relevant international standards and obligations; and 11.5 the Legislation Guidelines (2021 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. Legislative Implications 12 The proposal of this Cabinet paper is that the attached Order in Council be submitted to the Executive Council. Impact Analysis 13 A Regulatory Impact Analysis is not required because no policy decision is being sought. The deemed rate of return has been calculated in accordance with a formula that was approved by Cabinet in 1994 (CAB Min (94) 35/3 C(vi) refers).

Taxpayers in this situation are unable to use last year’s deemed rate of return to file for the 2022–23 income year and must wait for the current year’s rate to come into force. 9 It is of no benefit to taxpayers nor the Government to require taxpayers using the deemed rate of return method to wait an extra 28 days to file their tax return. This would be a source of frustration for taxpayers who want to file their tax returns quickly but are unable to do so. Therefore, I recommend that the 28-day rule be waived. Consultation 10 The Treasury has been consulted in the preparation of this paper and agrees with its recommendations. 2qddsziq5 2023-06-22 10:37:55 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Compliance 11 The Order complies with each of the following: 11.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 11.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 11.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; 11.4 relevant international standards and obligations; and 11.5 the Legislation Guidelines (2021 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee.

It seeks your agreement to increase the rates in line with the latest increases in market interest rates. Context and background 2.The UOMI rates, along with other rates used in the tax system, 1 are reviewed regularly to ensure that they align with market interest rates. The rates are calculated using formulae based on the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ ) survey of interest rates. 3.The UOMI rates are an important component of tax compliance rules. By changing with the underlying market rates, the UOMI rates provide taxpayers with the incentive to pay the right amount of tax at the right time. They apply to all revenue and duties. UOMI rates 4.There are two UOMI rates: 4.1 the taxpayer’s paying rate (also known as the UOMI underpayment rate), which is charged on underpayments of tax to Inland Revenue; 4.2 the Commissioner’s paying rate (also known as the UOMI overpayment rate), which is paid by the Commissioner on money paid to Inland Revenue above a taxpayer’s tax liability. 5.The underpayment rate is currently 10.39% while the overpayment rate is currently 3.53%, based on RBNZ figures for December 2022. Principles for updating the rates 6.Longstanding administrative principles in setting the rates provide that both UOMI rates should be adjusted if: 6.1 the RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate or the floating first mortgage new customer housing rate moves by 100 basis points or more from the figures used to calculate the last rate change; or 6.2 one of these indexes moves by 20 basis points or more and the UOMI rates ha ve not been adjusted in the last 12 months. 1 The other rates are the FBT interest rate on employment-related loans and the deemed rate of return on attributing interests in foreign investment funds. I n Confidence IR2023/ 190: Use of money interest rates review 2023 (No. 2) Page 2 of 5 7.When regulations are made altering the UOMI rates, the adjustment is applied from the day after the next standard provisional tax payment date – which, in this case, is 29 August 2023. 8.The formula for setting the rates is set out in the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Regulations 1997 as follows: 8.1 Section 2 of the Regulations provides that the taxpayer’s paying rate is se t a t the RBNZ floating first mortgage new customer housing rate plus 250 basis points (or 2.5%); 8.2 Section 3 of the Regulations provides that the Commissioner’s paying rate is set at the RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate less 100 basis points (or 1 %). However, if this calculation would produce a figure lower than 0%, the rate is instead set at 0%, to ensure overpayments do not accrue negative interest. 9.The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate is a proxy for a debt that a taxpayer might prioritise over their tax obligations. In the absence of a UOMI charge, a taxpayer wanting to borrow money could simply underpay their tax and use Inland Revenue like a bank rather than borrow from a bank at a commercial interest rate. A conservative margin of 250 basis points is added to the mortgage rate in calculating the underpayment UOMI rate because the Commissioner does not have information about the likelihood of any individual taxpayer paying the UOMI charged to them (i.e., the taxpayer’s creditworthiness). 10.The Regulations provide that the methodology for setting the interest rate for overpaid tax is the latest RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate less 100 basis points. The RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate is the monthly average of the daily standard rates, and approximates the return a taxpayer might expect on a low-risk investment in the New Zealand Government. Ensuring that the Commissioner pays less interest to the taxpayer on overpaid tax than the taxpayer would receive as a return from a low- risk bond aims to prevent a payment of tax to Inland Revenue being used as an investment. Results of latest RBNZ figure review 1 1.According to RBNZ figures for May 2023, the 90-day bank bill rate ha s increased by 114 basis points from its rate as at December 2022, which triggers both UOMI rates to be reset. T he UOMI underpayment rate should be increased to 10.91%, while the UOMI overpayment rate should be increased to 4.67%. 12 .The RBNZ floating first mortgage new customer rate has risen by 52 basis points since May 2023 (the last time the UOMI rates were set). Accordingly, the underpayment rate should also increase by 52 basis points, from 10.39% to 10.91%. 13 .The RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate has risen by 114 basis points since May 2023. Accordingly, the overpayment rate should also increase by 114 basis points, from 3. 53% to 4. 67 %. 14.As the 90-day bank bill rate has increased more than the RBNZ floating first mortgage new customer rate, the margin between the UOMI underpayment and overpayment rates will narrow from 6.86% to 6.24%. Fiscal impact 15.UOMI applies to both overpayments and underpayments of tax. More is charged by the Commissioner on underpayments than is paid to the taxpayer on overpayments. I n Confidence IR2023/ 190: Use of money interest rates review 2023 (No. 2) Page 3 of 5 However, the charges to underpayments are impaired in the Crown accounts to reflect that most UOMI charged is never paid, and therefore must be written-off. This means that an increase in the underpayment rate also produces an increase in impairment expenditure. The rate of impairment reflects the average repayment rate of recent debt, updated in October each year. The impairment rate for the year ended 30 June 2022 is 67.63%. 16.There is an estimated net reduction of $6 million for the 2023/24 fiscal year and $8 million per annum for 2024/25 and later years. The net reduction of $6 million for the 2023/24 fiscal year is comprised of the $7 million increase in revenue and $13 million increase in impairment expenditure. The net reduction of $8 million per annum for 2024/25 and later years are comprised of the $8 million increase in revenue and $16 million increase in impairment expenditure. 17.These are shown in the following tables: $ millions increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 & outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax revenue 7.000 8.000 8.000 8.000 Total Operating (7.000) (8.000) (8.000) (8.000) $ millions increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 & outyears Non-Departmental Other Expenses: Impairment of debt and bad debt write- offs 13.000 16.000 16.000 16.000 Total Operating 13.000 16.000 16.000 16.000 1 8.To meet the forecasted change to the revenue as above, the Impairment of Debt and Debt Write-offs appropriation needs to be amended. While the change is proposed via the 2023/24 Supplementary estimates, in the interim, the increase in the net debt should be met from Imprest Supply. C onsultation 19.Inland Revenue has consulted with the Treasury and the New Zealand Customs Service (Customs) on this report. They agree with the recommendations. 20.Customs advise that a change in the underpayment UOMI rate will have some small operational and financial impacts. Customs’ compensatory interest rate is aligned with the UOMI underpayment rate, and an increase in the underpayment rate will correspondingly result in an increase to the compensatory interest rate. I n Confidence IR2023/ 190: Use of money interest rates review 2023 (No. 2) Page 4 of 5 Next steps 21.Attached is a paper to the Cabinet Legislation Committee that recommends the approval of the Order in Council, and authorise their submission to Cabinet and the Executive Council. If you decide to increase the UOMI rates, the paper should be referred to Cabinet Office by 10am, Thursday 13 July 2023. This would enable the Cabinet Legislation Committee to consider the paper on 20 July 2023. Recommended action I recommend that you: Recommendations Minister of Finance Associate Minister of Revenue a)agree to increase the UOMI underpayment rate to 10.91% ( from 10.39%) and the UOMI overpayment rate to 4.67 % ( from 3.53%), effective from 29 August 2023.

Paul Fulton Principal Policy Advisor Hon Grant Robertson Minister of Finance Hon Dr. Deborah Russell Associate Minister of Revenue I /2023 I /2023 IR2023/190: Use of money interest rates review 2023 (No. 2) In Confidence Associate Minister of Revenue Agreed Not agreed Agreed Not agreed Approved Not approved Page 5 of 5 1 In Confidence Offic e of the Associate Minister of Revenue Cabinet Legislation Committee TAXATION (USE OF MONEY INTEREST RATES) AMENDMENT REGULATIONS (NO 2) 2023 Proposal 1 This paper seeks the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s agreement to submit an Order in Council amending the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates) Regulations 1998 to the Executive Council. 2 It is proposed to amend the Regulations so the underpayment use of money interest (UOMI) rate is set at 10.91%, while the overpayment UOMI rate is set at 4.67%. Policy 3 The UOMI rates are an important component of tax compliance rules. By changing with the underlying market rates, the UOMI rates provide taxpayers with the incentive to pay the right amount of tax at the right time. They apply to all revenue and duties. 4 The Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for the UOMI underpayment and overpayment interest rates to be set by Order in Council. Once the rates are set, they remain the prescribed UOMI rates unless subsequently changed by another Order in Council. 5 The rates are calculated using formulae established in the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Regulations 1997 (the Regulations) and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) survey of interest rates. 6 The Regulations provide that the interest rate for underpaid tax should be set at the RBNZ floating first mortgage new customer housing rate plus 250 basis points. The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate reflects the variable interest rate offered by surveyed institutions to new borrowers for residential property, weighted by each surveyed institution’s total lending outstanding for housing purposes. 7 The Regulations provide that the interest rate for overpaid tax is set at the latest RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate less 100 basis points, or, if this would produce a negative figure, at 0%. The RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate is the monthly average of the daily standard rates. 8 The current underpayment and overpayment rates are 10.39% and 3.53% respectively. The UOMI rates were last changed by Order in Council with effect from 9 May 2023 and were based on the interest rates for December 2022. DOC 2 2 9 The RBNZ interest rates for May 2023 indicate that the 90-day bank bill rate has changed by 114 basis points since the rates were last adjusted. I consider that an adjustment of the UOMI rates is necessary to avoid a long-term misalignment. I therefore recommend the overpayment rate be increased to 4.67%. 10 The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate has also changed by 52 basis points since the rates were last adjusted. Therefore, I also recommend that the underpayment rate be increased to 10.91%. Cost-of-living implications 11 The proposal effectively increases the cost of tax debt and so may have an impact on people and businesses that have underpaid their tax. The impact i s consistent with movements in market interest rates. Conversely, people and businesses that have overpaid their tax will receive slightly more compensation for doing so. Timing and 28-D ay Rule 12 I propose to submit the Order in Council giving effect to the changes in the UOMI rates to Cabinet for approval and submission to the Executive Council. To minimise compliance costs, it is proposed that the new rates come into force on 29 August 2023, the day after the due date for the first standard instalment of provisional tax. Compliance 13 The regulations comply with the principles, Acts, guidelines, and requirements set out below as follows: 13.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi Not applicable 13.2 the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 Not applicable 13.3 the Human Rights Act 1993 Not applicable 13.4 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993 Not applicable 13.5 relevant international standards and obligations Not applicable 13.6 the Legislation Guidelines ( 2021 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee Complies Regulations Review Committee 14 There are no anticipated grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order in Council to the attention of the House under Standing Order 327. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 15 The Parliamentary Counsel Office has certified that the attached Order in Council is in order for submission to Cabinet. 3 Impact Analysis 16 A Regulatory Impact Assessment is not required because the proposal is of a minor and routine nature and does not substantially alter existing arrangements. Use of external resources 17 No external resources were used for developing this proposal or in the preparation of this paper. Financial Implications 18 The proposal to increase the UOMI rates, with the effective date of 29 August 2023, is estimated to result in net negative revenue of approximately $30 million over the forecast period. This number comprises the impact of the changes on tax revenue and on impairment expenditure. 19 The forecast net tax revenue impact of the increased revenue from the underpayment adjustment and the increased cost of the overpayment adjustment is shown in the table below. $m increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 & outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax revenue 7.000 8.000 8.000 8.000 Total Operating (7.000) (8.000) (8.000) (8.000) 20 However, as a large part of underpayment debt is typically written off, there is a larger cost to revenue than is factored above. To represent estimated write-offs, underpayments are impaired in the Crown accounts. The impairment rate of 67.63% is based on debt repayment rates for the year ending 30 June 2022. Forecast impairment expenditure is presented in the table below: $m increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 & outyears Non-Departmental Other expenses: Impairment of debt and debt write-offs 13.000 16.000 16.000 16.000 Total operating 13.000 16.000 16.000 16.000 21 T o meet the forecasted change to the revenue, the Impairment of Debt and Debt Write- offs appropriation needs to be amended. While the change is proposed via the 2023/24 4 Supplementary Estimates, in the interim, the increase in the net debt should be met from Imprest Supply. Communications 22 Inland Revenue will publish an article about these changes in its Tax Information Bulletin.

Consultation 24 The Treasury and the New Zealand Customs Service have been consulted in the preparation of this paper and agree with its recommendations.

This change is required to align the rate with current market interest rates. The new rate should apply from the quarter beginning 1 October 2023. 2.An Order in Council is required to make this change. Therefore, this report als o s eeks your approval for the Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO) to draft an Order in Council to raise the rate. As changes to the FBT prescribed interest rate have become a routine matter, we consider that your approval is sufficient for PCO t o d raft the Order. PCO can provide the Order in Council directly to Cabinet Office. Background 3.The FBT rules tax non-cash benefits provided to employees. Included in the definition of ‘fringe benefit’ is any employment-related loan on which the employer is charging a rate of interest that is below the market rate. The interest differential is taxable. A prescribed rate set by regulations is used as a proxy for the market rate of interest, to save employers the compliance costs associated with determining the market rate relevant to loans that they have provided to their employees. 4.The Income Tax Act 2007 permits the making of regulations by Order in Council to set a prescribed rate of interest for the purpose of calculating FBT on low-interest loans. Once a rate is set, it remains the prescribed rate until changed by a subsequent Order in Council. 5.The prescribed interest rate was last changed from 6.71% to 7.89%, effective from the quarter beginning 1 April 2023. Determination of appropriate prescribed rate 6.The Reserve Bank conducts a survey of first mortgage housing interest rates on the last day of each month, producing a ‘floating first mortgage new customer housing rate’. The rate is calculated as the weighted average interest rate for the surveyed institutions, the weightings being based on each institution’s share of total lending for housing purposes. This Reserve Bank series is a suitable indication of general market interest rates and is therefore used as the benchmark for setting the FBT prescribed rate. 7.The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate of 8.41% for May 2023 indicates that the current FBT prescribed rate of 7.89% is lower than the prevailing market rate. 8.Longstanding administrative policy has been to adjust the FBT prescribed interes t rat e when there has been a change in the floating first mortgage new custome r I n Confidence IR2023/194: Increase in FBT prescribed rate of interest Page 2 of 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] housing rate of 20 basis points or more. We recommend that the rate be adjusted to ensure that there is no long-term misalignment. Process issues 9.When regulations are made declaring the rate of interest applying to employment- related loans, they apply to quarters starting from a date at least 1 month following the date the regulations were made. 10.The Order in Council should be referred to the Cabinet Office by 20 July 2023 so that it can be considered by the Cabinet Legislation Committee on 27 July 2023. PCO has arranged for the Order in Council to be provided directly to the Cabinet Office. 11.A Cabinet paper recommending that Cabinet approve the Order in Council and authorise its submission to the Executive Council is attached. Revenue implications 12.Raising the FBT prescribed interest rate to 8.41% will increase the amount of ne t ta x revenue that will be collected over the remainder of the 2023/24 fiscal year by approximately $0.74 million. The full year impact is estimated to be an increase in tax revenue of $0.98 million per year for subsequent years. $millions increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 & out years FBT revenue 1.030 1.370 1.370 1.370 Company tax (0.290) (0.380) (0.380) (0.380) Net revenue 0.740 0.980 0.980 0.980 Impact on operating balance (0.740) (0.980) (0.980) (0.980) 13.A forecasting adjustment will be necessary to account for the increase in expected F BT revenue.

The proposal is to increase the FBT prescribed interest rate for low-interest, employment-related loans from 7.89% to 8.41%, in line with an increase in market interest rates. Changes to the prescribed interest rate are a routine matter and do not involve a change of policy. The methodology used for setting the rate has been applied consistently since the early 1990s. Policy The fringe benefit tax (FBT) rules tax non-cash benefits provided to employees. Included in the definition of ‘fringe benefit’ is any employment-related loan on which the employer is charging a rate of interest that is below the market rate. The interest differential is taxable. A prescribed rate set by regulations is used as a proxy for the market rate of interest to save employers the compliance costs associated with determining the market rate relevant to loans that they have provided to their employees. The Income Tax Act 2007 (‘the Act’) allows regulations to be made to set the prescribed rate. Once a rate is set, it remains the prescribed rate of interest until changed by a subsequent Order in Council. The current FBT prescribed rate, which has applied since 1 April 2023, is 7.89%. The prescribed rate of interest is based on a Reserve Bank survey of first mortgage housing interest rates on the last day of each month (‘floating first mortgage new customer housing rate’). This is calculated as the weighted average interest rate for the surveyed institutions, the weightings being based on each institution’s share of total lending for housing purposes. This Reserve Bank series is selected as the benchmark for setting the FBT prescribed rate because it is seen as a good indication of market interest rates. ai7afsf7n5 2023-08-28 11:22:13 DOC 2 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Cost-of-living implications The proposal does not have any direct cost-of-living implications. The higher FBT prescribed rate will increase employees’ interest costs for employment- related loans, unless the increase is not passed on to employees in which case businesses will incur a higher FBT charge. Timing The Act provides that when regulations to change the prescribed rate of interest are made, they apply to quarters starting at least one month following the date the regulations were made by the Governor-General by Order in Council. Regulations that reduce the rate may apply for the current quarter if made at least one month before the end of the quarter. In accordance with the Act, I recommend that the regulations to raise the rate have effect from 1 October 2023 – the beginning of the next quarter. No waiver of the 28-day rule is required. Compliance The regulations comply with each of the following, where applicable: 9.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi Not applicable 9.2 the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 Not applicable 9.3 the Human Rights Act 1993 Not applicable 9.4 the principles and guidelines set out in Not applicable the Privacy Act 1993 9.5 relevant international standards Not applicable and obligations 9.6 the Legislation Guidelines (2021 edition), Complies which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee Regulations Review Committee Officials consider that there are no grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order in Council to the attention of the House under Standing Order 327. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel The regulations have been certified by Parliamentary Counsel as being in order for submission to Cabinet. ai7afsf7n5 2023-08-28 11:22:13 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Impact Analysis The proposal is of a minor and mechanical nature and does not substantially alter existing arrangements. Therefore, a regulatory impact assessment is not required. The proposal will not increase compliance costs as it is simply a change in the prescribed interest rate. Use of external resources No external resources were used for developing this proposal or in the preparation of this paper. Publicity Inland Revenue will publish an article about these changes in its Tax Information Bulletin. Proactive Release I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Consultation The Treasury has been consulted in the preparation of this paper. Revenue implications Raising the prescribed interest rate to 8.41% will increase the amount of FBT that will be collected by approximately $0.74 million over the 2023/24 year and $0.98 million per year over the remaining forecast period. ai7afsf7n5 2023-08-28 11:22:13 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Recommendations I recommend that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: note that the regulations set the prescribed rate of interest for calculating the taxable benefit of low-interest, employment-related loans; agree that, consistent with the results of the Reserve Bank’s survey for May 2023, the FBT prescribed rate of interest should be raised from 7.89% to 8.41% from the quarter commencing on 1 October 2023; note the following forecast changes as a result of the decision in recommendation 2, with a corresponding impact on the operating balance and/or net debt (note that some totals do not sum due to rounding): $m– increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 & out years FBT revenue 1.030 1.370 1.370 1.370 Company tax (0.290) (0.380) (0.380) (0.380) Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax revenue 0.740 0.980 0.980 0.980 Total operating (0.740) (0.980) (0.980) (0.980) authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Income Tax (Fringe Benefit Tax, Interest on Loans) Amendment Regulations (No 2) 2023.

These issues have recently been brought to our attention as requiring an urgent fix and cannot be delayed until the March 2023 omnibus bill. 4.While none of these amendments are material enough to require Cabinet approval, they require approval from the Minister of Revenue and, where there are fiscal implications, the Minister of Finance. Only two of the recommended changes have fiscal implications and these would be funded through the Tax Policy Scorecard. 5.None of these changes give rise to any material compliance or administration costs, or any significant systems or technology implications. 6.Treasury has been consulted on this report and agrees that the changes proposed in this report are consistent with Ministers’ criteria for the Scorecard. There is no risk that the Scorecard may exceed its limits as a result of these changes. Next steps 7.If you agree to the changes in this report, these will be drafted for inclusion in the officials’ report. Subject to the FEC’s agreement, these changes would be included in the revision-tracked version of the Bill to be reported back to the House in early March 2023. 8.Written submissions closed on 2 November 2022 and oral submissions commenced on 9 November 2022. Subsequent hearings of oral evidence are scheduled for 7 and 14 December 2022. 9.We will report to you on 1 December 2022 with a summary of submissions and our proposed recommendations to be included in the officials’ report. 10.The finalised officials’ report is due to the FEC no later than 20 January 2023. This will allow the Bill to be progressed in line with the FEC’s current timetable, reporting back to the house by 2 March 2023. We will report to you with a draft version of the officials’ report for noting in the week beginning 16 January 2023. IR2022/488: Matters raised by officials in the officials’ report on the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2). Page 3 of 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Background 16.The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2) is currently being considered by the Finance and Expenditure Committee (“FEC”). The officials’ report on submissions is due to the FEC no later than 20 January 2023. 17.This report sets out recommended changes that could be included as “matters raised by officials” in the officials’ report to FEC as matters raised by officials. Many of these 18.We do not consider that the recommended changes in this report require Cabinet approval. Two changes in this report have fiscal implications and subject to your agreement, would be managed through the Tax Policy Scorecard. Items with fiscal implications (Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue) Cost of vehicle for fringe benefit tax purposes part-funded by the State Sector Decarbonisation Fund 19.Fringe benefit tax (FBT) on a vehicle is calculated with reference to the “cost price” or the “tax value” of the vehicle to the employer or vehicle owner. The calculation is designed to reflect the average after-tax benefit an employee receives through not needing to purchase their own vehicle, which saves the employee finance, depreciation, maintenance and other running costs. FBT is designed to equate with the PAYE (pay as you earn) tax that applies to salary and wages. This promotes fairness between employees, whether they are paid in cash or in kind, and helps preserve the integrity of the employment income tax base. 20.The Public Sector Decarbonisation Fund is available to the state sector for updating their assets to less carbon intensive alternatives to reduce their carbon emissions. It is administered by the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority, Te Tari Tiaki Pūngao. The fund could be used to purchase vehicles that are subject to FBT. 21. 22. the general public does not have access to this fund, overall purpose of the FBT regime and original policy intent, which is to tax the value of the benefit that the employee receives on the basis that it is equivalent to the payment of additional salary or wages. 23.We recommend an amendment to clarify that the “cost price” and “tax value” of a vehicle for the purposes of the FBT rules is the gross cost before any State Sector Decarbonisation Fund funding. 24.The amendment should apply prospectively for benefits provided from 1 April 2023. 25.The financial implication of this proposed remedial amendment is a revenue gain of approximately $0.28 million over the forecast period, with a corresponding impact on the operating balance and net debt. s 9(2)(h) s 9(2)(h) s 9(2)(h) IR2022/488: Matters raised by officials in the officials’ report on the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2). Page 4 of 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Recommendations Agree to amend the Income Tax Act 2007 to clarify that the “cost price” and “tax value” of a vehicle for FBT purposes is the gross costs of the vehicle to the employer or vehicle owner before any amount received from the State Sector Decarbonisation Fund reduces the price or value. Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed Agree that this should apply for benefits provided from 1 April 2023. Agreed/Not Agreed Agreed/Not agreed Note the following changes to tax revenue as a result of the decisions above, with a corresponding impact on the operating balance and net debt: $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue - 0.070 0.080 0.080 0.050 Noted Noted Agree that the fiscal implications resulting from this change will be managed through the Tax Policy Scorecard. Agreed/Not Agreed Agreed/Not agreed Tax debt write-off rules 26.The Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) requires that when a taxpayer has a tax debt written off, a corresponding tax loss should be extinguished if the taxpayer has accrued tax losses. This ensures that taxpayers who benefit from a debt write- off do not receive an undue advantage. 27.The Bill contains a proposal that would allow the Commissioner to extinguish a taxpayer’s ring-fenced residential rental loss when they have tax debt written off, on the basis that these ring-fenced losses are not considered to form part of a taxpayer’s “tax loss”. 28.In finalising the systems and operational changes for this amendment, two issues relating to the tax debt write-off rules have arisen. The first issue has a fiscal impact and requires the agreement of both the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue. The second issue does not have a fiscal impact and only requires approval by the Minister of Revenue. Extinguishing excess bright-line losses 29.When someone makes a loss under the bright-line test, that loss (referred to as excess deductions) is carried forward to a later year in which the taxpayer has bright-line income and/or income from land. 30.Similar to ring-fenced residential rental losses, excess bright-line deductions are not considered a “tax loss,” and therefore cannot be extinguished when a taxpayer IR2022/488: Matters raised by officials in the officials’ report on the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2). Page 5 of 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] has a tax debt written off. This does not align with the policy intent of the debt write-off rules. 31.We recommend that for the purpose of the tax debt write-off rules, the Commissioner should be able to extinguish bright-line losses. We recommend that this should apply in relation to tax debts written off on or after 1 April 2024. This is to allow sufficient time for the required system and annual return changes to be made. 32.Because the law does not currently provide for excess bright-line deductions to be extinguished when a tax debt is written off, the fiscal cost of this change is not reflected in current tax forecasts. 33.Officials recommend that you note the reduction in tax revenue and then agree to the proposed amendment to resolve the issue, restoring tax forecasts to their present track, but for a $200,000 cost in 2022/23 and 2023/2024. This is because the forecast change applies immediately, but the recommended amendment would only take effect for tax debts written off on or after 1 April 2024. 34.The fiscal cost of the issue is difficult to quantify because data on excess bright-line deductions is not currently collected. We therefore recommend adjusting tax revenue forecasts downwards from 2022/23 onwards by $200,000 per year, and likewise treating the proposed amendment as resulting in $200,000 of additional tax revenue per year. 35.The Treasury has advised that the fiscal impact of the proposed amendment, but not the forecasting change, should be managed against the Tax Policy Scorecard.

In practice, several of these tax write-offs occur via Inland Revenue’s auto-calc process. 1 37.Legally, there is a concern that the loss extinguishment rules apply to these types of write-offs. However, under current practice this process does not automatically extinguish taxpayers’ corresponding tax losses. 38.These types of write-offs generally relate to small balances or to liabilities that arise through no fault of the taxpayer. Consequently, to extinguish losses in these cases would seem harsh and involve significant compliance and administration costs which would outweigh any benefit from the extinguishment of losses. 39.We recommend an amendment to ensure that write-offs occurring through the auto-calc process do not result in a tax loss extinguishment. This rule would apply to general tax losses, as well as ring-fenced residential rental property and bright- line losses. 40.The proposed change has no fiscal impact as current administrative practice is not to extinguish those losses, so this amendment would bring the legislation in line with existing administrative practice. This differs from the change for extinguishing bright-line losses above as that proposal would allow bright-line losses to be extinguished, which is currently not permitted. This change would align legislation with administrative practice and as result, would not impact revenue. 41.If instead of a legislative change, Inland Revenue amended the current administrative practice to align with the current law, there would be administrative and compliance costs that would outweigh any additional benefit. 42.This proposed amendment should apply retrospectively from the 2018–19 income year following the implementation of the auto-calc process. Recommendations Agree that tax write-offs currently included in the auto-calc process should not result in a tax loss extinguishment. Agreed/Not Agreed Agree that this should apply from the 2018–19 income year. Agreed/Not Agreed Imputation credit accounts 43.Companies have imputation credit accounts (ICAs) to keep track of company income tax paid on their income. They attach these imputation credits to dividends paid to shareholders to ensure there is no double taxation of income. ICA companies are required to file annual ICA returns (IR4J) accounting for their ICA balance. 1 The auto-calc process is the process that automatically calculates the tax liabilities for those taxpayers who receive only income with tax deducted at source (e.g., salary and wages).

Page 8 of 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 44.Under the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA), a group of wholly-owned companies may form a consolidated imputation group. This group has one ICA, which consolidates any debits or credits that would have arisen in individual members’ ICAs. 45.When a company is part of a consolidated imputation group, these individual company returns are likely to be nil. Leaving a consolidated imputation group 46.A concern arises when a member of the consolidated imputation group leaves the group. There are no legislative provisions regarding the allocation of the group’s imputation credits that are associated with departing member’s tax payments yet to be used against a liability. All imputation credits remain in the consolidated imputation group’s ICA. 47.A mismatch arises because even though the imputation credits remain in the group’s ICA, tax payments made to the Inland Revenue or a tax pool intermediary by the departing member remain owned by that member. This means that if the departing member obtains a tax refund or transfers their entitlement in a tax pooling account, they would have insufficient imputation credits to cover the required debits to their account. If this occurs, the refund or transfer cannot be processed. 48.Conversely, the imputation group retains excess imputation credits, allowing it to impute more than it should be able to. 49.We recommend amending the ITA so that when a member departs a consolidated imputation group, a debit arises to the consolidated imputation group’s ICA and a credit arises to the departing member’s ICA. The size of the debit and credit should be equivalent to the size of income tax payments made by the departing member and credited to the group’s ICA which have not yet been credited to a tax liability that has or will be assessed on the departing member. 50.The proposed amendment would have no fiscal cost as there would be no change in the number of imputation credits or a company’s ability to generate new imputation credits. 51.The proposed amendment would apply for the 2021–22 and later imputation years. Recommendations Note that this amendment does not have fiscal implications. Noted Agree to amend the Income Tax Act 2007 so that when a member departs a consolidated imputation group a debit arises to the consolidated imputation group’s ICA and a credit arise to the ICA of the departing member Agreed/Not Agreed Agree that this should apply for the 2021–22 and later imputation years. Agreed/Not Agreed ICA returns for members of consolidated groups 52.Under current legislation, taxpayers who are members of a consolidated imputation group are required to file an IR4J return no matter whether that return is nil or not. IR2022/488: Matters raised by officials in the officials’ report on the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2). Page 9 of 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 53.Filing these nil ICA returns has significant compliance and administrative costs for no benefit. This is because generally most changes to ICAs occur at the consolidated group level and would be included in the group’s IR4J. It is therefore the norm that the ICA return of an individual member of a consolidated ICA group would be nil. Members of a consolidated group have nil ICAs because once they are a member of the group, all debits and credits will arise in the group ICA and any balance they had in their individual ICA is likely to have been transferred to the group account over time. 54.To remove these unnecessary costs, we propose an amendment that would not require an ICA company who is a member of a consolidated imputation group to file an ICA with the Commissioner if the balance of that ICA is nil at all times during the imputation year. 55.We recommend this change apply retrospectively to the 2021–22 and later imputation years to validate those taxpayers who have not filed such returns. Recommendations Agree to amend the Tax Administration Act 1994 to not require an ICA company who is a member of a consolidated imputation group to file an ICA with the Commissioner if the balance of that ICA is nil at all times during the imputation year. Agreed/Not Agreed Agree that this change apply for the 2021–22 imputation year. Agreed/Not Agreed Inland Revenue’s confidentiality provision and its application to staff from other government departments 56.Tax legislation requires that all Inland Revenue and other agency staff who have access to taxpayer information to keep that information confidential and to sign a confidentiality declaration before accessing the information. This was the position for both Inland Revenue and other agency staff up to 18 March 2019. 57.However, in March 2019, an unintended change was made which required other agency staff to keep all Inland Revenue information confidential, not just taxpayer information. “Inland Revenue information” is broad and includes information that could be in the public domain (e.g., the number of audit staff, which could be available in Inland Revenue’s annual report). This was not the policy intent of the provision as it imposes a higher obligation on staff from other government departments than those from Inland Revenue. 58.We recommend that the confidentiality provision for staff from other government departments be amended to refer to only taxpayer information instead of all Inland Revenue information. This would mirror the provision that applies to Inland Revenue staff. 59.We recommend a retrospective application date of 18 March 2019, being when the provision was amended, to ensure that other agency staff are not disadvantaged by the unintended law change. We are not aware of any instances to date where other agency staff have been adversely impacted by this error.

Page 10 of 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Recommendations Agree to amend the Tax Administration Act 1994 to require other agency staff to keep taxpayer information shared with them confidential, instead of all Inland Revenue information. Agreed/Not Agreed Agree that this should applyfrom 18 March 2019. Agreed/Not Agreed Meaning of “company” and application to foreign companies 60.Recent work undertaken by Inland Revenue’s Tax Counsel Office found that a literal interpretation of the definition of “company” in the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) should be clarified to preclude unintended effects. The definition specifically excludes a partnership. However, the definition of a “partnership” under the Partnership Law Act 2019 means that a company incorporated outside of New Zealand is considered a “partnership” for tax purposes rather than a “company”. Foreign companies are therefore excluded from the legal definition of a “company.” 61.This interpretation means that foreign companies are not subject to portions of the ITA, including the foreign investment fund (FIF) or controlled foreign company (CFC) rules. This is contrary to the policy intent as the FIF and CFC rules were designed to apply to foreign companies. 62.We recommend an amendment to the definition of “company” to exclude a limited partnership rather than a partnership. This would enable the rules to function as intended. 63.The amendment should apply retrospectively from 1 April 2008, as this was the date that a partnership was excluded from the definition of a “company” in the ITA. 64.There is no fiscal cost associated with the proposal as the change would clarify legislation in accordance with existing practice and policy intent. Recommendations Agree to amend the Income Tax Act 2007 to exclude a limited partnership rather than a partnership from the definition of a “company”. Agreed/Not Agreed Agree that this should apply retrospectively from 1 April 2008. Agreed/Not Agreed Interest limitation: Grandparenting variable loans for disallowed residential property 65.Under the interest limitation rules, interest deductions for residential property loans drawn down before 27 March 2021 are gradually phased out between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2025 (referred to as grandparented loans and interest). 66.When a loan drawn down before 27 March 2021 relates to both disallowed residential property and allowed property, and the borrower cannot reasonably IR2022/488: Matters raised by officials in the officials’ report on the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2). Page 11 of 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] trace between these purposes, there is a formula to effectively apportion between the two property types. 67.This formula is used to calculate what portion of interest can be grandparented and can continue to be deducted, rather than being fully disallowed. 68.There is an error in the formula used to calculate deductible interest on certain untraceable variable loans when one of the properties is sold. If a repayment is sourced from the sale proceeds of allowed property, there should be no change to the affected loan balance that is grandparented. However, the current law does not achieve this. 69.To correct this, we recommend an amendment to ensure that sales proceeds from allowed property do not impact the affected loan balance used to calculate deductible interest for untraceable loans. 70.This change should apply from 27 March 2021, to align with the introduction of the interest limitation rules. Recommendations Agree that the formula in the interest limitation rules for certain grandparented variable loans should be corrected to ensure that sales proceeds from allowed property do not impact the affected loan balance. Agreed/Not Agreed Agree that this should apply from 27 March 2021. Agreed/Not Agreed Investments in Australian unit trusts 71.The Bill contains proposed changes to the foreign investment fund (FIF) and controlled foreign company (CFC) rules to limit economic double taxation of New Zealand resident investors with indirect investments in certain FIFs. These issues were identified specifically in relation to investments in Australian unit trusts (AUT). 72.The proposed changes to the dividend rules would limit economic double taxation where an investor holds an interest in an AUT CFC, which in turn holds an interest in an AUT FIF. This double economic taxation can arise if the investor is taxed in relation to the AUT FIF (under the FIF rules), in relation to the AUT CFC (under the CFC rules) and when it receives a dividend from the AUT CFC. However, a similar economic double taxation issue can arise where an AUT CFC holds an interest in an ordinary (that is, non-AUT) FIF. 73.To address this economic double taxation, it is proposed that the changes in the Bill to the dividend rules be extended to include any situations where an AUT CFC holds an interest in a FIF that has been appropriately taxed under the FIF rules. 74.This proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2023, in line with the proposed changes in the Bill. 75.There is no additional fiscal cost with this remedial, as it falls within the original costing of the related changes that are proposed in the Bill.

We also recommend making an Order in Council to extend the due date for applying for R&DLTCs for the 2021–22 tax year. We also seek authorisation to issue a drafting instruction to the Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft the Order. 3.Given tight timeframes, we have attached a draft Cabinet paper in advance of the Order in Council being drafted. This report seeks authorisation to lodge this Cabinet paper with the Cabinet Office. 4.This issue only relates to R&DLTCs and is not relevant to the R&D Tax Incentive, which is entirely separate. Background 5.Under the R&DLTC regime, loss-making taxpayers undertaking R&D can “cash out” their losses. This provides a timing benefit only, as receiving R&DLTCs means the taxpayer cannot carry forward those cashed-out losses to lower their taxable income in future years (once they are profitable). However, R&DLTCs provide short- term cashflow assistance during the start-up phase of a business undertaking R&D. 6.A business must file a statement to apply for R&DLTCs each year. The current issue regards the due date for that statement. Under the existing law, the R&DLTC statement is due by the earlier of: 6.1 The day a taxpayer files their income tax return; and 6.2 The income tax return due date. 7.Under current settings, the due date for the R&DLTC statement is usually the date a taxpayer files their income tax return. This date can be well in advance of the due date for the return because taxpayers may file their returns and R&DLTC statements early so they can cash out their losses sooner. 8.This creates a problem when a taxpayer files their R&DLTC statement after their income tax return. Current law would require Inland Revenue to decline the taxpayer’s application, even if both the return and the statement were filed well before the return due date. 9. s 9(2)(g)(i) s IR2022/513: D ue date for R&D loss tax credit applications Page 2 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 10.After identifying the issue in October 2022, Inland Revenue changed its administrative approach to be consistent with the law. However, this new approach means that some taxpayers will no longer receive R&DLTCs when they were expecting to, despite following the same filing process as in previous years. 11.Several external stakeholders have raised concerns with Inland Revenue’s new approach and have called for flexibility and/or legislative solutions. These issues may be raised at the Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand conference on 24–25 November 2022. 12.The R&DLTC was introduced in the 2015–16 income year, so Inland Revenue has more familiarity with taxpayer behaviour now compared to when the rules were being developed. Given the recent change in administrative approach, it is timely to consider whether the current legislative settings are appropriate. 13.We recommend that changes are made to primary legislation in response to this issue, and that you also recommend an Order in Council to extend the due date for taxpayers currently affected. We set out these recommendations below. Changes to primary legislation 14.The existing requirement to file an R&DLTC statement by the date a taxpayer files their income tax return is difficult and obscure. It is unusual to pin the deadline for doing something on the date that an income tax return is filed rather than the date that the return is due. 15.We recommend making the following changes: 15.1 Removing the requirement that a statement be filed before or on the date a taxpayer files their income tax return. We recommend making this change retrospectively, to remove the legal uncertainty concerning R&DLTCs that have been incorrectly paid out to date. 15.2 Changing the due date for R&DLTC statements going forward, so that a taxpayer’s R&DLTC statement is due 30 days after their income tax return due date. We recommend making this change prospectively from the 2022–23 income year. 15.3 Changing the due date for R&DLTC statements in prior years to 31 March in the year following the relevant income year. We recommend making this change retrospectively up until the 2021–22 income year. This would legitimise the previous losses cashed out to businesses for which their R&DLTC statements had been accepted after the income tax return due date but before the relevant 31 March date. 16.These amendments will make the due date settings for applying for the R&DLTC more intuitive and fairer for taxpayers, as well as giving certainty for taxpayers and Inland Revenue regarding losses already cashed out. The proposed due date going forward would also match the equivalent setting for the R&D Tax Incentive, which is more convenient for taxpayers. Many taxpayers are registered for both regimes. 17.We recommend that these amendments be included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2), which is currently being considered by the Finance and Expenditure Committee. This would mean the amendments would be in force as early as March 2023. Order in Council 18.If changes to primary legislation are not enacted until March 2023, the current issue remains until that date. For the 2021–22 tax year, some taxpayers have now filed IR2022/513: D ue date for R&D loss tax credit applications Page 3 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] their income tax returns without having filed their R&DLTC statements, despite intending to claim R&DLTCs for the year. In previous years, Inland Revenue would still have approved these applications, but now no longer will. 19.This R&DLTC regime is intended to encourage and incentivise R&D expenditure by businesses, including loss-making start-ups. Taxpayers that did not submit R&DLTC statements prior to filing their income tax returns for the 2021–22 tax year would fail on a minor procedural ground rather than a substantive requirement, which we consider undermines the policy intent of the regime. 20.The Tax Administration Act 1994 contains a broad power to extend the time for doing something under the Act. This would include extending the deadline for businesses to submit an R&DLTC statement. 21.To ensure taxpayers are not unexpectedly disadvantaged by Inland Revenue’s change in administrative approach, we recommend that you make an Order in Council extending the deadline for submitting an R&DLTC statement for the 2021– 22 tax year until 30 April 2023. This would allow businesses to still receive their R&DLTCs for the 2021–22 tax year even if they had failed the filing requirements on a minor procedural ground. Affected taxpayers would still be required to file a statement before being allowed R&DLTCs. 22.If this Order in Council is not agreed to, affected taxpayers will experience a delay in receiving R&DLTCs for the 2021–22 year, or will miss out altogether if the amendments to primary legislation are not enacted. This situation is exacerbated by the fact that Inland Revenue does not have any other discretion for accepting R&DLTC statements that are filed late. Consequently, denying applications for R&DLTCs when they previously would not have been denied would be (and already has been) controversial amongst stakeholders. 23.The attached Cabinet paper recommending the Order in Council seeks agreement to a waiver of the 28-day rule for Orders in Council coming into force. This waiver is sought on the grounds that not waiving the rule will: 23.1 Cause frustration for R&D businesses that are seeking R&DLTCs as soon as possible but cannot have their R&DLTC statement approved for a further 28 days, resulting in the delayed receipt of those tax credits; and 23.2 Increase the processing backlog for Inland Revenue, if it cannot fully process statements filed under the extended due date for a further 28 days. Financial implications 24.The proposed amendments to primary legislation, and the Order in Council, would not have a fiscal impact. 25.The current due date settings are not designed to increase or decrease the number of eligible taxpayers for R&DLTCs. Changing the due date settings is intended to make it easier for businesses to access R&DLTCs but is not expected to result in an increase in claims, particularly as businesses had adjusted to Inland Revenue’s original (incorrect) approach. 26.The Order in Council would only bring forward the disbursement of R&DLTCs within the same financial year. Consultation 27.The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Callaghan Innovation, the Treasury, and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet have been consulted on this report and the attached Cabinet paper. IR2022/513: D ue date for R&D loss tax credit applications Page 4 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 28.This issue has been discussed with some (tax) external stakeholders, including individual taxpayers/advisors as well as groups including Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand. Next steps 29.Subject to your agreement, we will prepare the amendments to primary legislation for inclusion in the officials’ report on the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2). 30.If authorised, we will also issue a drafting instruction to the Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft an Order in Council giving effect to an extension of the filing deadline for R&DLTC statements for the 2021–22 tax year. We will provide this Order to your office in advance of the Cabinet Legislation Committee meeting that considers this Cabinet paper on either 8 December 2022 or 15 December 2022.

Otherwise, lodgement should occur by 10am Thursday 8 December for consideration at the Cabinet Legislation Committee meeting on Thursday 15 December. 32.Subject to your agreement, we will communicate to external stakeholders and affected taxpayers that the primary legislation changes will be included in the officials’ report to the Bill to change the current due date settings. We will also communicate that an Order in Council will be recommended to extend the current deadline for the 2021–22 tax year.

Those are: 1.1 1.2 1.3 A technical amendment to the government grants exclusion due to the introduction of the New to R&D Grant. Not in scope Not in scope IR2022/500: R&D Tax Incentive: Matters for consideration Page 2 of 10 Carve-ou t from government grants exclusion for the New to R&D Grant 12.R&D expenditure funded by government grants is generally excluded from being eligible for the RDTI as that expenditure does not require support provided by the RDTI to induce it. 13.The legislation provides for some carve-outs from this exclusion. For example, Callaghan Innovation Project Grants are carved out to the extent that R&D expenditure exceeds an amount contracted for under the Project Grant. This was intended to make any unexpected expenditure eligible for the RDTI given that amount is not supported by the Project Grant. 14.Project Grants have been phased out and the New to R&D Grant is being introduced in its place. The terms of the New to R&D Grant are similar to the Project Grant in that it provides for co-funding of up to 40% of the eligible R&D expenditure. 15.We recommend that a carve-out is made for the New to R&D Grant with respect to the RDTI government grants exclusion. This would be similar to the carve-out that was made for Project Grants. R&D expenditure by businesses that receive a New to R&D Grant would be carved out from the exclusion to the extent that their R&D expenditure exceeds the amount contracted for under the New to R&D Grant. 16.We estimate the fiscal impact of this amendment to be $75,000 per year. Baseline forecasts originally assumed R&D expenditure that was not eligible for other government grants would be eligible for the RDTI. Hence, agreeing to this amendment would have no fiscal impact, while not agreeing to this amendment would have a fiscal saving of $75,000 per year.

R&D tax credits are processed after the end of the income year. 18.This report seeks joint decisions on three current matters in relation to the RDTI. 19. 20. 21.The third issue considers a technical amendment to the RDTI government grants exclusion due to the introduction of the New to R&D Grant. This is to ensure that amounts of R&D expenditure incurred by a business in excess of an amount the business has contracted for under the New to R&D Grant can still be eligible for the RDTI.

Ineligible/excluded activities and expenditures are listed in the Income Tax Act 2007. One type of exclusion is expenditure or loss that is undertaken in conjunction with receipt of a government grant. Such expenditure is already being induced by a government grant and is occurring without RDTI support, so it is not necessary to allow R&D tax credits to encourage that expenditure. 49.The provision implementing this exclusion, however, unintentionally excludes from the RDTI some R&D expenditure that is not covered by those grants. As a result, that expenditure would not be eligible for either the government grant or the RDTI. 50.To correct this, the legislation provides some carve-outs to this exclusion. One example is Callaghan Innovation Project Grants, which are carved out from the exclusion to the extent that the business’ R&D expenditure exceeds the amount contracted for under the Project Grant. This was intended to make any unexpected R&D expenditure eligible for the RDTI, given that amount is not supported by the Project Grant contract. 51.For example, a Project Grant contract for $500,000 would require the business to spend $300,000 and the grant would provide $200,000. If the project ended up costing $900,000, then the business will have spent an extra $400,000 to complete the project but that amount would not be covered by the Project Grant contract. However, the $400,000 would be ineligible for RDTI support due to the government grants exclusion. Carving out Project Grants from that exclusion to the extent that the overall expenditure ($900,000) exceeds the Project Grant contract amount Not in scope IR2022/500 : R&D Tax Incentive: Matters for consideration Page 8 of 10 ($500,000) ensures that the additional $400,000 of R&D expenditure can still be supported by the RDTI. Carve-out from government grants exclusion for the New to R&D Grant 52.Project Grants have been phased out and New to R&D Grants have been introduced in their place. The New to R&D Grant encourages new businesses and businesses that are new to R&D to establish an R&D programme. They may then move onto the RDTI in the future. 53.The terms of the New to R&D Grant are similar to the Project Grant in that they provide for co-funding of 40% of the eligible R&D expenditure. The amount of government funding allocated to the grant is similar (approximately $22.5 million). 54.Unlike the Project Grant, which covered expenditure for particular R&D projects, the New to R&D Grant covers expenditure over two years up to a specified maximum amount. It Is also limited to businesses that have not performed a significant amount of R&D in the past and do not have R&D capabilities to begin with. 55.We have concluded that R&D expenditure incurred by a New to R&D Grant recipient beyond the maximum amount specified in a contract could be impacted by the government grants exclusion in a similar way that equivalent amounts under a Project Grant would have been if not for the carve-out. This means that some R&D expenditure that is not supported by the New to R&D Grant will be excluded from the RDTI. 56.We recommend that a carve-out to the RDTI government grants exclusion is made for the New to R&D Grant, similar to the carve-out that was made for Project Grants. R&D expenditure by businesses that receive a New to R&D Grant would be carved out from the exclusion to the extent that R&D expenditure exceeds the maximum amount covered in the New to R&D Grant contract. 57.This will ensure that R&D expenditure continues to be supported in cases where the business’ R&D expenditure during the grant period exceeds the amount that is covered by the New to R&D Grant. This will make it easier for businesses to transition to the RDTI at the conclusion of their New to R&D Grant. The carve-out does not allow an amount of R&D expenditure to be subsidised by both the New to R&D Grant and the RDTI. Fiscal implications 58.This carve-out is unlikely to have a significant impact on the cost of the RDTI because: 58.1 Only a small number of New to R&D Grant recipients are likely to exceed the maximum amount of R&D expenditure permitted within the maximum two- year period allowed under a New to R&D Grant contract; 58.2 To the extent that a recipient’s R&D expenditure does exceed the maximum amount, the excess amount (that would be covered by the exclusion) is likely to be small; and 58.3 The New to R&D Grant contract can be drafted to make clear that the grant only applies to R&D expenditure up to the maximum specified amount and does not apply to R&D expenditure incurred by the recipient in excess of that amount. 59.As the New to R&D Grant has not yet been introduced, there is no data we can use to accurately estimate the cost of this carve-out. Instead, we make the following assumptions using information currently available to provide a rough estimate: IR2022/500: R&D Tax Incentive: Matters for consideration Page 9 of 10 59.1 To receive the maximum grant amount, a recipient would have to spend between $500,000 and $1,000,000 1 on R&D over the two-year period of the grant. Callaghan Innovation is currently expected to issue approximately 100 grants per year. We assume that only one (i.e., 1% of the total) will exceed the maximum grant amount in a given year. 2 59.2 We assume that, on average, the one New to R&D Grant recipient per year whose R&D expenditure exceeds the maximum grant amount does so by $500,000. 60.Based on these assumptions, we estimate this amendment would impact $500,000 of R&D expenditure per year. With a tax credit rate of 15%, this corresponds to a fiscal impact of $75,000 per year. 61.It is important to note that baseline forecasts assumed that R&D expenditure that was not eligible for other government grants would be eligible for the RDTI (consistent with the original intent). This means that agreeing to this amendment would effectively have no fiscal impact, while not agreeing to this amendment would have a fiscal saving of $75,000 per year. Consultation 62.MBIE, Callaghan Innovation, and the Treasury have been consulted on this report. 63. 64. 65. Next steps 66. 1 The Minister of Research, Science and Innovation has set the maximum grant amount at $400,000. This means that the maximum RDTI-eligible expenditure that could be covered is $1,000,000 (given a co-funding rate of 40%). However, up to half of the grant may be used to cover R&D setup costs that are not necessarily eligible for the RDTI. 2 According to the 2021 R&D Survey results, 810 out of 2,346 R&D-performing businesses spent above $500,000 on R&D and 468 spent above $1,000,000 in the 2021 financial year. However, in almost all cases, these are well- established R&D-performing businesses. Due to the steep learning curve that the New to R&D Grant is specifically designed to alleviate, the probability of a business that qualifies for the New to R&D Grant reaching this threshold within its first two years of R&D activity is very low.

Oral hearings of evidence commenced on 9 November 2022 and are scheduled to continue on 7 and 19 December 2022. 4.Most of the recommendations in this report are in response to issues raised by submitters. Subject to your approval, we will include these recommendations in the officials’ report. 5.The items in this report relate to remedial amendments proposed in the Bill. A separate report relating to the policy proposals has been provided to the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue (IR2022/542 refers). 6.None of these proposed amendments are significant enough to require Cabinet approval. 7.None of the recommendations in this report have fiscal implications. These recommendations require approval by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the Minister of Revenue and endorsement by the Minister of Revenue. These recommendations are set out in the body of the report. 8.None of these changes give rise to any material compliance or administration costs, or any significant systems or technology implications. 9.Treasury has been consulted on this report. Next steps 10.Subject to your agreement, recommendations outlined in this report will be drafted for inclusion in the officials’ report. Subject to the FEC’s agreement, these changes would be included in the revision-tracked version of the Bill to be reported back to the House by 2 March 2023. 11.The finalised officials’ report is due to the FEC no later than 20 January 2023. We will report to you with a draft version of the officials’ report for noting in the week beginning 16 January 2023. IR2022/538; Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): remedial amendments Page 3 of 9 Background 17.The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2) is currently being considered by the Finance and Expenditure Committee (“FEC”). The officials’ report on submissions is due to the FEC no later than 20 January 2023 to enable the Committee to report back to the House by 2 March 2023. 18.Written submissions on the Bill closed on 2 November 2022. The first hearing of oral evidence was held on 9 November 2022 and subsequent hearings are scheduled for 7 and 19 December 2022. A submitter’s oral submission should align with their written submission, so we do not anticipate new issues to arise at the two remaining hearings. However, if new issues do arise, we will co-ordinate with your offices to seek your approval where appropriate. 19.Approximately 800 written submissions were received. In addition to submissions by stakeholders such as law and accounting firms, most of the submissions relate to either the proposed exemption from FBT for public transport or the proposal to require digital platforms to collect GST on certain accommodation and transport services. 20.This report sets out recommended changes that could be included in the officials’ report to the FEC. The items in this report relate to remedial amendments proposed in the Bill. A separate report relating to the policy proposals has been provided to the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue (IR2022/542 refers). 21.None of the proposed amendments in this report have a fiscal impact and require approval by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the Minister of Revenue and endorsement by the Minister of Revenue. 22.We do not consider that the recommended changes in this report require Cabinet approval. GST proposals which allow suppliers to rely on certain commercial information to determine if their customer is non-resident or GST registered 23.The Bill proposes to reduce compliance costs by allowing more businesses to use certain commercial information (proxies) to help them determine if their customer is non-resident or a GST-registered person. 24.PwC and the Corporate Taxpayers Group submitted that many suppliers may already have existing systems or processes for applying the relevant GST rules which may collect more accurate information than the proxies (such as directly asking if the customer is non-resident or a GST registered person). Accordingly, they consider that the proxies should be optional to use. 25.We agree with the submitters because this allows such suppliers to continue with their existing systems and processes, while other suppliers which would benefit from the proposed proxies can choose to use them to reduce their own compliance costs. This would not have a fiscal cost as it would either provide the affected taxpayers with the same GST outcome as the existing proposal in the Bill or allow them to continue with their current tax practices which are in the revenue baselines. Recommendation Agree that the proposed amendments in the Bill (to allow more businesses to use certain commercial information to help them determine if their customer is non- resident or a GST registered person) should be optional for these suppliers to apply. Agreed/Not agreed IR2022/538; Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): remedial amendments Page 4 of 9 Method of calculating provisional tax 26.The proposed amendment clarifies which method of standard uplift is to be used when a taxpayer files a tax return for the prior year when calculating provisional tax (i.e., either 105% or 110%). It also clarifies the position when the due date for an instalment falls on a non-working day. 27.Submissions were generally supportive of the change, although two submissions suggested that application date of the provision may retrospectively impose penalties and interest on taxpayers who have been charged with penalties and interest on a different basis. This was not intended. 28.To avoid this outcome, we propose inserting a savings clause into the application of the provision so that if a taxpayer has been charged penalties and interest on a different basis than that set out in the proposed amendment, the proposed amendment will not apply to them. 29.There are no fiscal implications to this amendment as this change does not alter the liability of a taxpayer just, potentially, the timing of payment within the year. Recommendation Agree to insert a savings provision to the proposed amendments relating to the method of calculating provisional tax to preserve the position if any taxpayer has been charged with penalties and interest on a different basis than the proposed amendments. Agreed/Not agreed Income of deceased persons 30.The proposed amendment allows taxpayers to include in their tax return to date of death any reportable income paid to the deceased person up to 28 days after their date of death to save the compliance costs of filing an estate tax return. 31.Submissions were generally supportive of the change, although one submission suggested that the scope of the provision should be extended beyond 28 days and include all types of income. Such an extension is out of scope and will need further policy work as the work programme permits. This submission will be declined but noted for potential further work. 32.After reviewing the provision, a wording change is required to the proposed amendment to make the treatment optional on the taxpayer – if they would prefer to continue filing two returns then they should be able to do that. 33.There are no fiscal implications to this amendment as this change only alters the particular form that an amount of income is returned in, not the taxation of the income. Recommendation Agree to allow taxpayers the option of returning reportable income received by the deceased person either in the taxpayer’s return to date of death or in the tax return of the estate. Agreed/Not agreed IR2022/538; Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): remedial amendments Page 5 of 9 Non-active trusts and estates 34.The proposed amendment in the Bill would ensure that trusts and estates that derive small amounts of income are not required to file a tax return and therefore not required to comply with the new trust disclosure requirements. We received several submissions on this remedial and intended to recommend the following changes below. 35.None of these changes have fiscal implications because these changes only relate to whether a taxpayer is required to file a tax return. The underlying income in that return is either already subject to withholding tax (as with reportable income) or is currently not taxable in any case (the under $200 non-reportable income exemption). Neither of these changes is likely to alter the net amount of tax paid by the trust or estate. Proposed changes Administration fees threshold 36.The proposed amendment in the Bill allows trusts or estates which have incurred less than $1,000 of administrative fees to still be considered non-active. This was an increase from the current $200. 37.One submitter suggested this should be increased to $1,500. We agree with this change as it does not materially increase the threshold but does give some additional leeway to smaller trusts to maintain their non-active status. Threshold for distributions from testamentary trusts 38.In developing the proposals for these amendments, we undertook some targeted consultation with industry representatives on the requirements for testamentary trusts and estates to be permitted not to file a tax return. During that consultation, one of the parties suggested that a limit on the distribution amount from a trust be included within the provision. 39.The proposal in the Bill reflected that suggestion and required testamentary trusts who made distributions over $100,000 to file a tax return. Some submissions on the Bill indicated that this is an onerous requirement that could include a number of trusts that are simply distributing assets from a will. 40.There is no distribution requirement for other trusts, so we recommend accepting the submission and removing the threshold for distributions from a testamentary trust from the Bill. Transactions with other parties 41.A trust cannot be considered non-active if it has been a party to transactions with assets of the trust or estate that results in income in any person’s hands or gives rise to a fringe benefit to an employee. 42.The Bill did not propose a change to this rule, however, several submitters pointed out that this rule is particularly wide and makes a number of trusts that generate no income file a tax return. 43.An example would be a trust that owns a family house but has no income. If they install a heat pump, they would have to file a return in that year because the purchase and installation of the heat pump would result in income to the installer’s hands. IR2022/538; Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): remedial amendments Page 6 of 9 44.We agree that this test is set too wide and recommend an adjustment to target the requirement at higher-risk transactions related-party transactions. 45.We propose partly agreeing with the submission and amending the test to allow taxpayers who have transactions with non-related parties to not have to file a tax return but require those trusts who have transactions with parties related to the trust to file. Submissions to be declined Reportable income threshold 46.The Bill proposes that trusts or estates that earn less than $1,000 of reportable income (essentially income with tax deducted at source) could still be considered non-active. 47.One submitter suggested this should be increased to $5,000 in line with the proposal for testamentary trusts. We consider there is a still a distinction that should be maintained between testamentary trusts and other trusts and recommend declining the submission. Recommendations Note there are no fiscal implications to these amendments Noted Agree to allow trusts and estates who incur less than $1,500 of administrative and bank charges to remain non-active or non-filing trusts. Agreed/Not agreed Agree that the threshold for reportable income for a non-filing trust that is not a testamentary trust be set at $1,000 as proposed in the Bill. Agreed/Not agreed Agree that the threshold for distributions from a testamentary trust be removed from the Bill and allow testamentary trusts to not file a tax return no matter the level of distributions from the trust. Agreed/Not agreed Agree that trusts or estates who have transactions with non-related parties which give rise to income in those parties’ hands to not have to file a tax return if they meet the other requirements not to file. Agreed/Not agreed Tax treatment of distribution networks 48.The proposals in the Bill identify utilities distribution network operators and confirm that for tax purposes their assets are the component assets of their network rather than the network themselves. 49.Two submissions considered that the drafting is overly prescriptive and were concerned it would provide less flexibility for network operators already applying a component items approach. We discussed these concerns with the submitters before the Bill was introduced. We continue to consider that this approach to be appropriate and will not lead to the concerns they have suggested. IR2022/538; Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): remedial amendments Page 7 of 9 50.To provide additional certainty, we recommend that an additional definition be added to confirm that, for the purpose of these proposals, the term “goods and services” includes electricity, telecommunications services, gas and water. 51.This change should apply from 1 April 2008 to align with the earliest application date of the proposals. 52.There is no fiscal implication associated with this change as it is only a clarification of an item that is already included in the Bill. Recommendations Agree that for the purpose of these proposals, the term “goods and services” includes electricity, telecommunications services, gas and water. Agreed/Not agreed Agree that this change should apply from 1 April 2008. Agreed/Not agreed Updating the insurance tax provisions following the adoption of IFRS 17 53.The current accounting standard, NZ IFRS 4, will be replaced by NZ IFRS 17 from 1 January 2023. General insurers will continue to use the accounting standard, while life insurers will use the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) for their Outstanding Claims Reserve (OCR) methodology. The Bill includes proposed amendments to update existing section references for insurers. 54.In response to submissions on the Bill, we recommend some minor amendments to clarify the operation of the provisions. These changes do not have any fiscal or operational implications as the remedials are clarificatory in character and do not give rise to costs. 55.In addition, you previously agreed to the inclusion of a grandparenting provision for existing spreading arrangements entered into under NZ IFRS 4 for financial life insurance (IR2022/255 refers). This grandparenting provision was not included in the Bill at introduction and we will recommend in the officials’ report that it be inserted. Treatment of the changes to the general insurance contracts outstanding claims reserve income during the year of transition 56.Currently, a transitional provision provides a rule for when a general insurance OCR is eligible for a deduction. However, there is no mirroring provision to prescribe the method to apply when an insurer receives OCR income. We recommend this be rectified and a mirroring provision be inserted. Life insurers must use the same discount rate as accounting when determining the present value of contracts for life and general insurance 57.While general insurers will use NZ IFRS 17 to determine their OCR, life insurers will continue to use the valuation method prescribed by the ITA for contracts of both life and general insurance. Life insurers will continue to use the same discount rate for calculating present value as they use in their financial statements. We recommend this be clarified. IR2022/538; Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): remedial amendments Page 8 of 9 Recommendations Agree to include an OCR income provision for general insurance contracts to mirror the OCR allowable deduction provision in the transitional year for IFRS 17. Agreed/Not agreed Agree to clarify that life insurers should continue to use the same discount rates as used in their financial statements to determine present values within the OCR for both life and general insurance. Agreed/Not agreed Agree that these should apply for the 2023–24 and later income years. Agreed/Not agreed Financial arrangements – debt equity swaps 58.The proposed amendment would apply when an insolvent company issues shares for consideration and all or part of that consideration is used to make a payment for a financial arrangement. The amendment would treat the payment as being the market value of the shares. 59.Two submitters were concerned that the proposals would increase the compliance costs for valuing shares and would be an impediment for start-ups that were experiencing financial distress from raising additional capital. We accept that these transactions may be commercially motivated, but the lender will be subscribing for shares in an insolvent issuer for an overvalue (compared with a third party that would pay very little for those shares) and would only do so where the overvalue is used to repay debt that would not otherwise be repaid. 60.We agree with a submitter that the definition of an insolvent company in the Bill can be clarified to use the solvency test in the Companies Act 1993. 61.This change should apply from the day after the date the Bill receives the Royal asset to be consistent with the underlying proposed change. 62.There are no fiscal implications associated with this change as this is only a clarification of a point that was already included in the Bill. Recommendation Agree that the test for insolvency should be based on the solvency test in the Companies Act 1993. Agreed/Not agreed Interest rate swaps held by multi-rate Portfolio Investment Entities (PIEs) 63.Submitters were supportive of the proposed amendment to allow multi-rate PIEs to elect to follow the spreading method in Determination G27 for their interest rate swaps. This determination is available under the financial arrangements rules but cannot currently be used by PIEs. 64.We agree with a submitter that a mechanism is required for an existing PIE to transition to this election. We recommend that this election apply only to swaps entered into on or after the date of the election with the previous method continuing to apply to swaps entered into before this date until they subsequently mature. IR2022/538; Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): remedial amendments Page 9 of 9 65.This change should apply from the 2023–24 income year to align with the underlying proposed change. 66.There is no fiscal implication associated with this change as all spreading methods return the correct amount of tax over the term of the arrangement and there is no way of predicting in advance which method will accelerate or decelerate tax relative to the other methods. Recommendations Agree that when a PIE chooses to apply determination G27 to its swaps this should apply only to swaps entered into on or after the date they made that choice. Agreed/Not agreed

IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 3 of 26 Background 16.The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2) is currently being considered by the Finance and Expenditure Committee (“FEC”). The officials’ report on submissions is due to the FEC no later than 20 January 2023 to enable the Committee to report back to the House by 2 March 2023. 17.Written submissions on the Bill closed on 2 November 2022. The first hearing of oral evidence was held on 9 November 2022 and subsequent hearings are scheduled for 7 and 19 December 2022. A submitter’s oral submission should align with their written submission, so we do not anticipate new issues to arise at the two remaining hearings. However, if new issues do arise, we will co-ordinate with your offices to seek your approval where appropriate. 18.Approximately 800 written submissions were received. In addition to submissions by stakeholders such as law and accounting firms, most of the submissions relate to either the proposed exemption from FBT for public transport or the GST platform economy proposal. 19.Around 415 submissions were received on the proposed exemption from FBT for public transport which were largely connected to a campaign launched by the Cycling Action Network in early October. Many of these submissions submit that clause 6 of Hon Julie Anne Genter’s Income Tax (Clean Transport FBT Exclusions) Amendment Bill should be adopted to exempt bicycles from FBT. The Income Tax (Clean Transport FBT Exclusions) Amendment Bill is a Member’s Bill that has not yet been drawn from the ballot. 20.310 submissions were received on the proposal to apply GST to certain types of services provided on digital platforms. Many of these were from individuals following an email from Airbnb to them encouraging them to submit against the proposal in the Bill. Most of these submitters opposed the proposal for different reasons, including being worried about the compliance costs associated with GST registration (though, we note that under the proposals in the Bill, hosts would not need to register for GST unless they were above the $60,000 registration threshold and this is the status quo) and being concerned about the impact of GST on demand for their accommodation. 21.This report sets out recommended changes that could be included in the officials’ report to the FEC. 22.Only one recommended change has a fiscal impact and requires approval by the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue. The recommendation relates to the proposed fringe benefit tax exemption for certain public transport fares. 23.None of the other proposed amendments in this report have a fiscal impact and require approval by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the Minister of Revenue and endorsement by the Minister of Revenue. 24.We do not consider that the recommended changes in this report require Cabinet approval. Fringe benefit tax exemption for certain public transport fares 25.The Bill proposes an exemption from fringe benefit tax (FBT) for public transport fares that are subsidised by an employer mainly for the purpose of their employees travelling between their home and place of work. The proposal seeks to produce a more neutral FBT outcome between two modes of transport between home and work: IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 4 of 26 •by car, with an FBT exemption currently in place for employer-provided on- premises car parks, and •by more environmentally friendly public transport, which is currently subject to FBT. 26.The proposal received more than 400 submissions, with most relating to a campaign launched by the Cycling Action Network to include bicycles. Overall, submitters supported the proposal to exempt public transport from FBT. However, one submitter pointed out that the proposal added a distortion to the tax system relative to other fringe benefits and another submitted that the proposal would be a move away from the principle that home-to-work travel is a private expense. 27.Some suggested that coverage of the “public transport” exemption should be clarified or extended to include on-demand services, transport covered by the Total Mobility Scheme, and all public transport beyond the home-to-work commute. As noted above, the majority of submitters suggested an FBT exemption for bicycles. Some also suggested additional FBT exemptions to encourage environmentally desirable behaviours, such as electric vehicles (EVs), e-scooters, ridesharing, and bike locks. 28.Several submissions suggested an equivalent exemption for employers reimbursing or paying an allowance towards their employees’ public transport fares. These would not be covered by the proposed FBT exemption but would be taxed as salary and wages under PAYE system and therefore subject to income tax. 29.Submitters considered that guidance for employers needs to be published on the boundary between fringe benefits and PAYE payments, particularly in the context of the proposed FBT exemption. We agree with this and will include guidance in the relevant Tax Information Bulletin item on the Bill following enactment. Proposed changes 30.Based on submissions, we recommend two changes to the FBT exemption proposal: •including the Total Mobility Scheme in the proposed exemption, and •confirming on-demand services are covered by the proposed exemption. Total Mobility Scheme (Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue approval required) 31.The Total Mobility Scheme is a nationwide scheme administered by regional councils and Waka Kotahi to support people who cannot use public transport all or some of the time. Total Mobility customers pay 50% of the cost of travel (for example, by shuttle with a wheelchair hoist) up to a regional cap and any additional cost that is over the regional cap. Their regional council reimburses the transport operator directly for the remaining 50% of the cost. 32.Subject to your agreement, we will recommend that employer-provided fringe benefits for travel between home and work that are part funded by the Total Mobility Scheme should be covered by the proposed FBT exemption. While the original policy intent of the exemption focused on environmental and neutrality concerns, including this situation within the exemption addresses equity concerns. It would ensure that employers are able to provide fringe benefits for transport part funded by the Total Mobility Scheme for employees with impairments without attracting FBT. 33.The impact of the proposed change is hard to quantify. There is no data available on how many Total Mobility card holders are employed and how many Total Mobility IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 5 of 26 trips are for work purposes (as the purpose of the trip does not need to be specified). 34.The proposed amendment is likely to have a very small fiscal cost. For this reason, we have estimated a nominal revenue loss of approximately $0.2 million a year, with a corresponding impact on the operating balance funded through the Tax Policy Scorecard: $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 & outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue - (0.200) (0.200) (0.200) (0.200) On-demand services 35.On-demand services are increasingly being offered by public transport providers in areas of lower demand. These public transport services are booked and service a set area, rather than having a set timetable and route. Standard public transport fares apply. 36.Based on the current wording of the provision, on-demand services may not be covered by the proposed exemption. 37.We agree with submitters that this service forms part of the public transport network. We recommend clarifying that on-demand services are included in the proposed FBT exemption, where the service is part of a public transport provider’s network and is subject to a public transport fare. Submissions to be declined Widening the proposed public transport exemption to all transport, not just commuting 38.Some submitters suggested extending the exemption to all public transport, not just commuting, would further encourage environmentally desirable behaviour. However, we think that limiting the exemption to between home and work travel would best achieve the policy objective of improving neutrality in the FBT rules. Widening the proposed exemption would increase distortions and further reduce coherence and neutrality in the tax system. Additional exemption for bicycles 39.Submitters suggested that bicycles should be exempt from FBT to increase the number of people commuting by bicycle, as this has positive effects on the environment as well as on wellbeing and health. 40.The proposed public transport FBT exemption seeks to achieve a more neutral FBT outcome between travelling to and from work by car and parking in an employer- provided car park (currently FBT exempt) and travelling by the main alternative transport for that commute (i.e., public transport). This is in line with the specific Tax Working Group recommendation. IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 6 of 26 41.New Zealand’s tax system uses a broad-base framework. This means that taxes are applied neutrally with few exemptions and subsidies, which minimises the distortion of economic activity. There is a high threshold to depart from this neutrality approach and there are few exemptions from FBT. Where exemptions are provided, the scope of the exemption is important in managing the potential distortion. The proposed FBT exemption for public transport and the existing FBT exemption for car parks share a similar focus that manages this risk. Both exemptions relate to providing access rather than funding or enabling the purchase of an underlying asset, such as a bicycle or EV. 42.Further FBT exemptions, particularly for underlying assets, would increase the distortion between the taxation of transport benefits and other fringe benefits. This would reduce the overall fairness of the tax system. While many other employer- provided benefits could also provide socially desirable outcomes, introducing additional exemptions would further reduce the coherence and neutrality of the tax system. 43.We therefore do not recommend an FBT exemption for bicycles. Equivalent income tax exemption for public transport reimbursements and allowances 44.Some submitters were concerned that the application of the proposed FBT exemption will be administratively difficult for employers, resulting in a low usage of the exemption. 45.Submitters considered that it would be more effective to provide an income tax exemption for allowances for, or reimbursements of, public transport costs to encourage environmentally friendly outcomes. Allowances and reimbursements are not covered by the proposed FBT exemption but are subject to income tax through the PAYE system. Submitters emphasised this was important given recent announcements about the new National Ticketing Solution project (to be piloted in Canterbury in 2024 and expanded to other regions by 2026) which would allow for the use of debit or credit cards and other digital payment methods on public transport. 46.The existing neutrality issue the exemption tries to address does not arise in relation to reimbursements and allowances. This is because reimbursements and allowances for both car parks and public transport costs are subject to income tax. Integrity concerns also arise for tax free allowances, which means that there are very few tax-free employer allowances in the income tax rules. Existing tax-free allowances are mostly limited to unusual work circumstances that cause additional costs, such as certain additional transport costs when there is no adequate public transport for the place of work, or short out-of-town secondments and conferences. 47.We have talked to some large public transport providers that are in the process of developing products that may address some of the administrative difficulties of providing these fringe benefits. They also stated that, while the national ticketing solution is in the initial stages of development, they understand that specific public transport ticketing solutions will be available alongside the ability to use debit, credit cards and other digital payment methods. 48.We do not recommend an equivalent income tax exemption for allowance or reimbursements relating to public transport costs.

The information reported and exchanged would relate to taxpayers’ income-earning activities on digital platforms. It is estimated to raise an additional $11 million to $22 million per annum through improved income tax collection arising from Inland Revenue having more information about taxpayers’ incomes. This would apply from the 2024 calendar year; and IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 8 of 26 •Require digital platforms to collect and return GST on supplies of short-term accommodation, ridesharing, and food and beverage delivery services. These changes are estimated to raise an additional $47 million per annum in GST revenue. This would apply from 1 April 2024. 50.We have provided the Minister of Revenue’s office with a more detailed overview of submissions on the Bill (BN2022/530 refers). Other than the change recommended below, we are not recommending any substantive or material changes to the Bill that would require Ministerial or Cabinet approval. The other changes we intend to recommend in the officials’ report will be of a technical and minor nature, focused on detailed aspects of the proposals and ensuring there is sufficient clarity and guidance available within the rules. 1 Proposed changes: recent developments at the OECD on the reporting rules 51.At the November 2022 OECD meeting, the digital platform information reporting requirements were discussed. At that meeting, the European Commission provided an update on the interaction between their rules (DAC7, which applies to digital platforms based in Europe) and the OECD’s reporting rules. 52.The European Commission confirmed that European jurisdictions would be able to exchange information with jurisdictions outside of Europe that had “partial equivalence” with DAC7. This means that New Zealand could receive information from tax authorities in Europe on income earned by New Zealand taxpayers through European-based digital platforms in relation to accommodation and personal services. 53.This also means we would no longer be required to implement the “full” reporting rules that would require digital platforms in New Zealand to report to Inland Revenue regarding income earned by non-residents operating through New Zealand platforms from the sale of goods and vehicle rentals. The downsides to not implementing the “full” reporting rules are still being considered in consultation with affected New Zealand digital platforms, but these include: •New Zealand not receiving information from foreign tax authorities about income earned by New Zealand tax residents from the sale of goods and vehicle rentals facilitated by foreign digital platforms; and •New Zealand-based digital platforms would have to report to foreign tax authorities in respect of income earned by non-residents in relation to the sale of goods and vehicle rentals (as opposed to New Zealand digital platforms instead reporting only to Inland Revenue, which would then share information with foreign tax authorities). It is possible that digital platforms would prefer to report this information to Inland Revenue for exchange purposes as it means they do not need to navigate foreign laws and processes. This is something we are exploring with them. 54.Since these implications are still being worked through, subject to your agreement, we intend to recommend to the FEC that the extended reporting rules (which covers the sale of goods and vehicle rentals) be brought into force by Order in Council at some point within the next three years (otherwise, the extended reporting rules would not be given legislative effect in New Zealand). This provides the Government with an opportunity to implement the rules if it is considered desirable, but also provides sufficient time for us to work with New Zealand-based digital platforms to determine the implications of the sale of goods reporting requirements and their preferences. 1 For example, some submitters sought additional guidance and clarity on aspects of the reporting rules and the GST proposals through further legislative amendments (for example, including definitions within the Bill instead of leaving it to supplementary guidance). IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 9 of 26 55.This decision does not have financial implications because the original decision to implement the OECD’s extended reporting rules covering the sale of goods and vehicle rentals did not affect the estimated additional revenue. The $11 million to $22 million of additional revenue was based on income earned from accommodation rental and personal services only. Submissions to be declined Implementation should be delayed 56.Submitters considered that both proposals should be delayed providing more time for affected digital platforms to consider and implement the required changes. 57.We note that the OECD’s information reporting and exchange framework is being implemented in Canada and the United Kingdom on the same timeline as is proposed for New Zealand, and in Europe from 2023. The proposed GST changes would also come into force 12 months following the expected enactment of the Bill, which is what digital platforms signalled was sufficient development time for changes of this scale. For these reasons, we do not recommend deferring implementation of either change proposed in the Bill. Submitters also said that the proposals should not be implemented in New Zealand until there was clearer evidence that this was direction being headed in by other jurisdictions. 58.We do not agree with these submissions. The information reporting and exchange framework is being implemented by approximately two-thirds of OECD members on a faster, or comparable, timeframe as is proposed in New Zealand. We consider there are strong arguments for implementing the GST changes, and do not agree that there are benefits in waiting to see what other jurisdictions decide to do in this area. Scope of the rules 59.A common concern raised by submitters is that under the reporting rules, New Zealand digital platforms would be required to report to Inland Revenue by 31 January in relation to the preceding calendar year. Submitters have suggested this date be deferred because staff will be on annual leave. 60.While we understand submitters’ concerns, the due date for this information is driven by the desire of foreign tax authorities to use the information from the exchange for pre-populating tax returns of their tax residents. Under the rules, Inland Revenue would need to share information with foreign tax authorities by the end of February. We are therefore unable to shift the 31 January platform to Inland Revenue reporting date of without compromising Inland Revenue’s ability to fulfil New Zealand’s obligations under the OECD’s rules. 61.We do, however, intend to work with affected digital platforms to provide them with additional time where practical. We also note that, as the OECD’s rules require information to be broken down into quarterly periods, 75% of the information could be collated well in advance of the 31 January reporting date. This means that digital platforms with a reporting obligation would only need to verify information for the last quarter of the calendar year before reporting by 31 January.

Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed Agree that the application date for the GST changes requiring digital platforms to collect GST on short-term rental accommodation, ridesharing, and food and beverage delivery services remains 1 April 2024. Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed Note that deferring the implementation date of either of these proposals would have a fiscal cost equal to the estimated additional revenue which would be foregone. Noted Noted Agree to defer implementation of the OECD’s extended reporting rules (covering the sale of goods and vehicle rentals) until such time that an Order in Council, made on recommendation of the Minister of Revenue, brings them into force. Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed If you agree to the recommendation above, agree that the extended reporting rules would not be given legislative effect in New Zealand unless brought into force by Order in Council within three years following enactment of the Bill. Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed Cross-border workers 62.The Bill contains proposals which seek to clarify and modernise the administrative aspects of the rules applying to cross-border workers and to reduce the cost of complying with New Zealand’s pay as you earn (PAYE), fringe benefit tax (FBT) and employer’s superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) and non-resident contractor tax (NRCT) rules. 63.Submitters broadly welcomed reform to the tax settings that apply to employers of cross-border employees and payers of NRCT. Submitters made helpful suggestions to improve the implementation of the policies. 64.Some submitters felt that the proposals could have gone further. One common concern raised by submitters relates to practical difficulties in obtaining an IRD number. These submitters felt that legislative change was required to simplify the process for cross-border workers and non-resident employers. We acknowledge this concern but changes to IRD number requirements are out of scope of the current project and would be better addressed through operational change or as part of wider reforms. Proposed changes 65.Two proposals attracted widespread comment: IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 11 of 26 •the proposal to introduce an NRCT reporting requirement, and •the proposal to transfer FBT and ESCT obligations to an employee where the employer does not have a sufficient presence in New Zealand to be subject to New Zealand employment-related tax obligations. NRCT reporting and the “single payer” view 66.The rationale behind the proposed reporting requirement is that it would support the proposed simplification of the NRCT withholding thresholds (the “single payer” view). Submitters were concerned that the information required was broad and likely to require manual intervention to prepare and submit reports. Further, the information requirements were out of balance to the purpose of supporting the proposed NRCT reforms or the cost of compliance. 67.Subject to your agreement, we intend to recommend in the officials’ report that proposals relating to the “single payer” view of the NRCT withholding thresholds and NRCT reporting be removed from the Bill. We consider that these proposals require further consideration and consultation before reintroduction in a future tax bill. 68.This change does not have a fiscal impact because it would be a postponement of an administrative measure that does not have a fiscal impact. Transfer of FBT and ESCT obligations to an employee 69.Submitters were concerned that FBT and ESCT are ordinarily paid by employers and the transfer of these obligations to the employee may cause the employee cashflow difficulties. In addition, the calculation of these taxes requires information that may not be readily available to the employee. 70.Conversations with submitters indicate that the most common fringe benefits received by remote employees are employer contributions to foreign superannuation schemes and the payment of insurance premiums. One submitter had seen company vehicles used by remote employees. 71.Subject to your agreement, we will recommend that a de minimis for fringe benefits be introduced for employees managing their employment-related tax obligations. We propose that the de minimis be set at $2,500 per income year. Domestic employers are entitled to a de minimis threshold of $1,200 per income year per employee for unclassified benefits (subject to conditions). The higher proposed de minimis for remote employees recognises that, in these limited circumstances, the employee bears the tax cost and compliance burden. 72.This means that an employee would not be required to report or pay tax on fringe benefits if their total taxable benefits per income year was $2,500 or less. Where fringe benefits provided exceed this amount, the benefits would be taxed in full. 73.We consider that this FBT change has no fiscal impact as the original fiscal impact was small and unquantifiable. As such, it falls within the costing of the original proposal. 74.We do not recommend a similar de minimis for employer contributions to foreign superannuation schemes. Employer contributions to foreign superannuation schemes may be a valuable element of an employee’s total remuneration. A meaningful ESCT de minimis for remote workers would not be possible without creating a significant gap between the treatment of non-resident employers (who do not have a sufficient presence in New Zealand) and their employees, and New Zealand employers and employees. IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 12 of 26 Drafting clarifications 75.We will recommend a clarification to ensure any tax due on fringe benefits is paid via PAYE at the employee’s marginal tax rate. This is necessary for the payment of the tax to be processed correctly by Inland Revenue’s systems. This will result in a small under-taxation of the benefit compared to the employer paying FBT. FBT is paid at a grossed-up tax rate (63.93% for an individual on the top income tax rate of 39%), but the employer can claim the tax paid as a deduction from its own income. This reduces the tax paid from the headline rate to an effective rate that is close to but lower than the employee’s marginal tax rate. Inland Revenue will monitor taxpayer behaviour and may recommend further policy changes if taxpayers begin to exploit this difference. 76.We will also recommend a further drafting clarification to reflect that the employer superannuation contributions to foreign schemes should be subject to ESCT. ESCT enables the contribution to be excluded income for certain purposes, such as entitlement to Working for Families. Under existing rules, an employer and employee may, in some circumstances, opt out of ESCT and choose taxation under PAYE instead. This option will be preserved as it enables employers and employees to agree the appropriate treatment for their circumstances. 77.There are no fiscals associated with these clarifications because the original fiscal impact was small and unquantifiable. As such, it falls within the costing of the original proposal. Submissions to be declined Commencement date 78.Submitters considered that all proposals which apply to employers and cross-border employees should have a consistent application date of 1 April 2023. 79.The proposals to address PAYE, FBT and ESCT integrity measures would apply from 1 April 2023. The later application date for other proposals allows time for the development of systems and guidance by Inland Revenue for employers and tax advisors. We consider that having different commencement dates for different proposals remains appropriate. Shadow payroll rule 80.The existing shadow payroll rule applies where an employee works in New Zealand but remains on the employer’s payroll system in a different jurisdiction. The rule treats the income as being derived 20 days after payment to ensure that employers of cross-border workers have sufficient time to collate and report information to Inland Revenue. The Bill proposes to rationalise the legislation by relocating the shadow payroll rule to a new section for cross-border employees. 81.Submitters suggested that the current shadow payroll rule should be changed from a deeming rule to a rule which better aligns with the employee’s actual payment date. 82.From a policy perspective, we do not oppose the submission, but it is outside the scope of the current Bill and would require significant systems changes. This would require further work and would be better suited for a future tax bill. IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 13 of 26 Annual PAYE arrangement 83.Two submitters did not support an annual payment basis for PAYE in special circumstances because of the risk of non-compliance. 84.We do not consider non-compliance to be a material risk. Employers who engage with Inland Revenue (which is required to access the annual payment basis) are more likely to be seeking to lower their compliance burden than to avoid their tax obligations. Payroll subsidies 85.Two submitters thought that the Government should reinstate payroll subsidies considering the proposals to transfer FBT and ESCT obligations to an employee who manages their own employment taxes. 86.We do not recommend the reintroduction of payroll subsidies. We do not provide them for other taxpayers, and we do not consider it appropriate to make an exception for cross border workers as it would undermine the coherence of the tax system. Longer period for retroactive NRCT exemptions 87.The Bill proposes a period of 92 days for retroactive NRCT exemptions. We do not support extending this period as this may reduce the incentive to apply for an exemption or conflate the exemption with a reclaim of overpaid tax via a tax return. We think that 92 days is sufficient to enable a contractor to obtain an exemption on a timely basis which covers the relevant contract payments. Exemption from NRCT withholding for GST-registered persons 88.GST-registered non-resident contractors are already able to obtain an NRCT withholding exemption. Exemptions are available based on a good compliance history. GST registration is only part of that picture. Further, GST registration is not indicative of tax residence or presence in New Zealand. They may be registered for GST to claim input tax. This does not signify the kind of connection with the New Zealand tax system required to reduce the integrity risk which NRCT seeks to address. Recommendations Agree to remove the “single payer” view and the non-resident contractor’s tax reporting requirement from the current Bill for further consultation. Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed Agree to include a $2,500 de minimis where an employee is responsible for paying fringe benefit tax. Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed Agree to Inland Revenue officials informing affected submitters of these changes to minimise impacts on stakeholders’ systems and processes. Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 14 of 26 GST apportionment and adjustment rules 89.The Bill proposes a package of changes to the GST apportionment and adjustment rules to reduce the compliance costs they impose on businesses and better align them with current taxpayer practices. These changes include: •introducing a principal purpose test for goods and services acquired for $10,000 or less (GST exclusive) that would allow a registered person to claim a full GST input tax deduction for taxable use instead of applying the apportionment rules, and •allowing GST-registered persons to elect to treat certain assets that have mainly private or exempt use, such as dwellings, as if they only had private or exempt use. 90.Submissions supported the GST apportionment proposals and suggested some small changes to make the proposals easier for the affected taxpayers to comply with. Proposed changes 91.We intend to recommend that the FEC accept most, but not all, of the changes suggested by submitters. The main submissions we agree with are described below. None of these submissions would have a fiscal cost as they either provide the affected taxpayers with the same GST outcome as the existing proposal in the Bill or allow them to continue with their current tax practices which are in the revenue baselines. 92.Other suggested changes that we do not support were because they would undermine the policy intent, may not be effective at reducing overall compliance costs, or could have a fiscal cost. Principal purpose test: optionality for GST registered persons 93.Deloitte and PwC submitted that the proposed principal purpose test for goods and services acquired for $10,000 or less should be optional for GST-registered persons. We agree that this could reduce compliance costs for some businesses, as it would mean they would not need to apply a different method for goods or services depending on whether they were acquired for $10,000 or less. However, as most businesses will face lower compliance costs under the proposed principal purpose test, we expect that few businesses would be likely to opt out in practice. To prevent “cherry picking,” we recommend that the registered person (or GST group if relevant) would be required to “opt out” of applying the principal purpose test for all goods or services they acquire for $10,000 or less for a minimum period such as 24 months. Private use election: change from exempt to non-taxable supplies 94.The Bill proposes some new rules which would allow GST-registered persons to elect to treat certain assets that have mainly private or exempt use, such as dwellings, as if they only had private or exempt use. The current Bill provisions would achieve this by making the sale of these assets an exempt supply. Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand submitted it would be better to make the sale of the assets a non-taxable supply. 95.We agree this would be more intuitive (as goods used for private purposes are generally non-taxable supplies) and could prevent some unintended complexity (as other rules can apply when a person makes exempt supplies). IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 15 of 26 Use of agreed apportionment methods 96.The Goods and Services Act 1985 (GST Act) allows registered persons or industry associations to apply to the Commissioner to agree an apportionment method as an alternative to applying the general apportionment rules. The scope of these alternative methods is being widened in the Bill. Deloitte submitted that registered persons should be able to adopt an alternative apportionment method that Inland Revenue have published (if it is appropriate for the registered person’s situation). 97.We agree that providing an ability for the Commissioner to publish acceptable methods could reduce compliance costs as the affected persons would not have to develop and agree their own bespoke methods with the Commissioner. 98.We also agree with a submission from KPMG that businesses that are members of an industry association which has agreed an alternative apportionment method with Inland Revenue should be able to choose whether they either apply the method agreed by the industry association or the general apportionment rules. Recommendations Agree that the proposed principal purpose test for goods and services acquired for $10,000 or less should be optional for GST-registered persons to use. Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed Agree that the proposal to allow GST-registered persons to treat certain assets that have mainly private or exempt use as an exempt supply when sold, should be amended to make the sale of these assets a non-taxable supply instead. Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed Agree to expand the existing ability whereby registered persons or industry associations can apply to the Commissioner to agree an apportionment method, so the Commissioner can also publish acceptable methods that the relevant registered persons can then choose to use. Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed Agree that businesses that are members of an industry association which has agreed an alternative apportionment method with Inland Revenue should be able to choose whether they either apply the method agreed by the industry association or the general apportionment rules. Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed Build-to-rent exclusion from interest limitation 99.The Bill proposes to exempt large-scale “build-to-rent” assets from the interest limitation rules for residential investment properties in perpetuity. The Bill defines this new asset class as 20 or more dwellings in a single development. Tenants must also be offered a 10-year tenancy under the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (RTA) with the ability for the tenant to exit the lease with 56 days’ notice and personalisation policies that set out the alterations a tenant can make under the RTA. 100.Feedback on the build-to-rent exclusion has generally supported the introduction of a defined asset class and in-perpetuity exclusion from the interest limitation rules for build-to-rent developments. Submitters who did not favour the policy were concerned that it was unfair to give tax breaks to large wealthy investors, and not to small-scale developers or landlords who were still increasing housing supply. IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 16 of 26 101.Submitters requested clarification on some aspects of the policy, for example, what the term ‘contiguous land’ covered, what was required in a personalisation policy, and whether the term ‘single ownership’ allowed for business structures such as joint ventures and limited partnerships. 102.In addition to the proposed changes outlined below, Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga has reported separately to the Minister of Housing regarding an issue with the RTA. The RTA does not explicitly permit landlords to offer fixed term tenancies that can be terminated with 56 days’ notice. An amendment to the RTA is required to ensure the build-to-rent exclusion operates as intended. Subject to the Minister of Housing’s agreement, this will be raised as a matter raised by officials in the officials’ report. A copy of that report will be referred to the Minister of Revenue. Proposed changes Information sharing between Inland Revenue and Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga 103.A register of assets is required to be set up and maintained by Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga to enable Inland Revenue to correctly apply the exclusion to eligible taxpayers. Setting up and maintaining the register requires taxpayer information to be shared between Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga and Inland Revenue. This would include: •a reactive information share where Inland Revenue requests information from Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga for auditing purposes, and •a proactive information share from Inland Revenue to inform Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga that an asset no longer meets the build-to-rent requirements and should be removed from the register. 104.Information would only be shared if it is necessary for the administration of the build-to-rent exclusion from interest limitation. 105.We recommend inserting a disclosure provision into the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow Inland Revenue to share the necessary information with Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga. This provision would apply from 1 April 2023. 106.The proposed change has no impact on the costing of the policy as it simply allows for the sharing of information between Inland Revenue and Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga. Other minor changes 107.Following submissions on the Bill, we will recommend to the FEC minor technical amendments to ensure the language better reflects the original intent of the policy. For example, some submitters raised the concern that the term ‘contiguous land’ applied too narrowly and would bar certain build-to-rent configurations (such as mixed tenure developments that also contain owner-occupied dwellings) from qualifying. We agree that the term ‘contiguous land’ is not consistent with the policy intent and recommend that a project-based requirement should be used instead. Submissions to be declined No 20-unit dwelling requirement 108.Several submitters considered that the proposed exclusion should be available to anyone increasing housing supply and the requirement for the development to consist of at least 20 dwellings should be removed. IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 17 of 26 109.We do not agree with this submission as the intent of the proposal to encourage the development of new housing supply at scale. The minimum requirement was chosen to reflect both the international standards for build-to-rent, and the New Zealand context. Small-scale investors who contribute to new housing supply already benefit from the 20-year new build exemption from interest limitation, and the five-year new build bright-line test. Application of 20-dwelling requirement to all properties owned by a person 110.Other submitters considered that the 20-dwelling requirement should not be restricted to properties in one location. Instead, submitters suggested that as long as the person owns at least 20 properties in any location, the requirement should be satisfied. 111.The exemption targets build-to-rent accommodation which is a specific model of housing that delivers quality rental housing at pace and scale in a given location, rather than having a wider application to accommodation generally. Build-to-rent also provides tenant benefits that are associated with the configuration of the development including professional asset and tenancy management, shared amenities and increased sense of community generated by medium-high density housing. 112.We do not consider it appropriate to extend the proposed exemption to a landlord who simply owns 20 dwellings around New Zealand as it would not be in line with the goal of build-to-rent to provide cohesively managed developments that encourage a sense of community. Removal of the requirement to offer personalisation policies 113.Submitters consider that the requirement to offer personalisation policies should be removed because the protections are already afforded under the RTA, and it would create confusion and lead disputes between tenants and landlords. Many submitters were also unclear on what a personalisation policy had to allow, and whether they could require a tenant to rectify or “make good” any alterations at the end of the tenancy. 114.The requirement for landlords to offer personalisation policies to tenants is intended to ensure that tenants are aware of their right to make certain alterations as set out under the RTA. This will likely mitigate the likelihood of disputes between landlords and tenants. 115.The level of personalisation set out in the policy can, but does not have to, go beyond what is already afforded under the RTA. It does not prohibit the use of “make good” penalties. We will propose minor drafting changes to clarify these points. Removal of “same person” requirement 116.Some submitters considered the requirement that the development be owned by a single owner should be removed as it is not necessary given the other build-to-rent requirements (such as the requirement for 20 dwellings to be on contiguous land). 117.This requirement ensures that assets accessing the build-to-rent exclusion are cohesive developments. 118.Some submitters were also concerned that the current drafting would exclude joint ventures and limited partnerships. The term is not intended to exclude joint ventures or limited partnerships. IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 18 of 26 Use of other policy tools to encourage build-to-rent developments 119.Submitters in the build-to-rent industry suggested that other policy tools should be used to encourage build-to-rent developments. Examples included the reinstatement of depreciation deductions, an exclusion from the bright-lines rules, or changes to the Overseas Investment Act 2005. 120.We recommend these submissions be declined for reason of being outside the scope of the Bill. Recommendations Agree to amend the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow Inland Revenue to share build-to-rent provider information with Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga. Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 19 of 26 Dual-resident companies (Minister of Revenue only) 121.The recommendations in this section do not require approval by the Minister of Finance. 122.The Bill contains proposals that: •Amend the loss grouping, consolidation, and imputation credit account (ICA) rules to ensure New Zealand resident companies can continue to access certain beneficial tax regimes that are not ordinarily available to dual- resident companies, and •Amend the domestic dividend exemption and corporate migration rules to ensure companies within a wholly-owned group can no longer shift income out of New Zealand without the anticipated New Zealand income tax by changing their tax residence and obtaining relief from taxation under a double tax agreement (DTA). 123.Submitters welcomed the amendments to the loss grouping, consolidation, and ICA rules. Several submitters suggested the ICA amendments should be extended beyond Australia. However, this would be a significant change to the overall imputation credit regime and would require substantial further policy analysis. 124.Submitters raised several concerns with the integrity proposals, mainly focused on the risk of overreach of the rules for taxpayers that may inadvertently change their residence under a DTA but continue to pay tax as if they were New Zealand DTA resident. Submitters suggested changes that would reduce the risk of overreach and compliance costs, while still ensuring that aggressive tax planning arrangements are prevented. Proposed changes 125.Both the dividend integrity and corporate migration integrity proposals received extensive comments from submitters. 126.Submitters were concerned that the dividend integrity proposal would impose additional compliance costs. The proposal may result in companies conducting tax residence checks when a dividend is paid between members of the same wholly- owned group to determine whether the recipient is potentially a dual-resident company. Where a dividend has not been on-paid by a dual-resident company to a non-resident, and where New Zealand has not lost its taxing rights or non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) has been assessed, then these dividends should not be subject to the proposed dividend integrity rules. 127.Submitters were also concerned that the corporate migration proposals will impose significant risk on some companies inadvertently falling into the integrity rules. This would result in the company being liable for income tax based on a deemed liquidation. This would be the case even where the company has not deliberately sought to undermine the integrity of the New Zealand tax base. For many companies, this tax liability may be significant. Consequently, in response to this risk, many companies would incur additional compliance costs, including making permanent changes to their corporate structure (for example, using a branch structure). 128.In response to these concerns, we propose several changes to the proposals. The proposed changes would have the same application date as the underlying integrity proposals (30 August 2022). There is no change to the fiscal costing associated with the recommended changes to the proposals. This is because the initial fiscal costing had a nominal annual benefit (about $200k per annum) and the recommended changes would still capture the arrangements that give rise to integrity concerns. IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 20 of 26 Dividend integrity Exclusion of dividends paid to companies that are dual resident in Australia and New Zealand 129.We recommend the dividend integrity rules should exclude dividends paid to companies that are dual resident in Australia and New Zealand. We believe this will reduce the compliance costs for many companies, while ensuring the integrity rules achieve their intended purpose. This is because New Zealand retains its taxing rights under the Australia/New Zealand DTA on New Zealand sourced dividends paid by dual resident companies whose residence tie-breaks to Australia, so the risk to the New Zealand tax base is minimal. On-payment of fully-imputed dividends 130.Where a dividend has been on-paid by a DTA non-resident company to a non- resident company, to the extent the dividend is fully imputed (that is, imputation credits attached to the dividend), it does not pose any integrity risk because company income tax has been paid. We recommend that fully-imputed dividends paid by a DTA non-resident company should be excluded from the proposed integrity rules. Retrospective imputation credit attachment 131.Under the existing proposal, dividends paid to a DTA non-resident company that are fully imputed are excluded from the proposed dividend integrity rules. This is because New Zealand income tax has effectively already been paid on this income at the company level. There is a concern that some companies may pay an unimputed dividend believing they are a New Zealand resident company, whereas it is later found the taxpayer was actually DTA non-resident and the dividend is subject to NRWT. 132.In this situation, we recommend that the company should be able to retrospectively impute the dividend, provided sufficient imputation credits were available at the time the dividend was paid. There is legislative precedent for allowing retrospective attachment of imputation credits. Reinstatement of New Zealand residence where dividends have not been on paid 133.The proposed changes allow for the NRWT liability to be eliminated if the dividend recipient is treated as New Zealand resident under the relevant DTA within a two- year period of the dividend payment, assuming the recipient has not paid a dividend to its shareholders. However, if the recipient has only on-paid a portion of the dividend it received and then becomes resident in New Zealand under the DTA, New Zealand would have taxing rights on any future dividend payments by the company. 134.For this reason, we suggest a change to the proposals so that that NRWT is only imposed on the payer to the extent the DTA non-resident company pays a dividend while it is DTA non-resident. Corporate migration Limit application of corporate migration integrity rules 135.Several submitters have suggested that the scope of the integrity rules should be narrowed so they only apply in circumstances where the company is aware they are IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 21 of 26 DTA non-resident. Based on these submissions, we recommend that the integrity rules should apply at the earlier of either: •The company files a return claiming relief under a DTA on the basis it is DTA non-resident; and •Two years after the company has received a competent authority determination it is DTA non-resident, and it has not reverted their tax residence back to New Zealand for the purposes of the relevant DTA. 136.While this approach would be a substantial shift away from what is currently proposed, we believe there is merit in the approach suggested by submitters. It would ensure that significant consequences from the corporate migration rules will not apply to inadvertent residence changes but integrity risks will still be addressed. Retrospective attachment of imputation credits to deemed dividends 137.Any tax resulting under the proposed rules from a DTA residence migration should be the same as under the current domestic law for a formal corporate residence migration. We believe a taxpayer should be able to retrospectively attach imputation credits against a deemed dividend arising from the application of the proposed DTA corporate migration rules, provided imputation credits were available at the time the dividend was paid. The existing corporate migration rules already allow for retrospective imputation credit attachment, so this would be an extension of that approach. Submissions to be declined Extension of imputation credit changes beyond Australia 138.Some submitters suggested that the ICA changes should be extended beyond Australia. The rationale for the ICA changes being limited to Australia is because Australian-resident companies can already elect to maintain an ICA (known as an Australian ICA company). The proposed amendments allow a New Zealand resident company to automatically carry over its accumulated imputation credits at the point of becoming Australian tax resident, rather than having to make an election. This will prevent the forfeiture of a company’s ICA balance if it inadvertently becomes Australian tax resident and has not made an election to be an Australian ICA company. 139.Our view is that expanding the imputation credit regime beyond what was proposed would be a significant change to the overall imputation credit regime and would require substantial further policy analysis. Income tax treatment of dual-resident look-through companies 140.One stakeholder was concerned that the existing criteria for New Zealand look- through companies excludes dual-resident companies – including New Zealand companies that have inadvertently become dual resident in Australia. This submission is out of the scope of the proposals in the Bill. 141.Our view is that the issue will be resolved if, as expected, Australia enacts legislation with retrospective effect to revert to the prior corporate tax residence interpretation. If Australia does not achieve this, then we will consider whether the criteria for look-through companies requires amendment. Two-year grace period for the dividend integrity proposal IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 22 of 26 142.The proposed two-year grace period provides time for the company to undertake due diligence to determine its tax residence if there is some doubt about the tax residence of the dividend recipient. Submitters suggested a number of changes to the two-year grace period for the dividend integrity proposals, including that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue should have the discretion to extend the period, that the period should begin following a competent authority residence decision (rather than the payment of the dividend), and that the integrity rule should only apply if the dividend is then on-paid within two years following a competent authority residence decision. 143.We do not agree with these submissions. 144.Given the company will be aware of relevant dividend transaction and has control when the dividend will be paid, we do not consider it necessary to extend the period. 145.We believe the two-year period should commence at the time the dividend is paid, which is a clear transaction at which time an assessment can made of the tax residence of the recipient company. There is no guarantee the payer of the dividend will subsequently be informed that the recipient is DTA non-resident, especially if the respective companies are no longer commonly owned. In most circumstances, the recipient company will have up to two years to revert to New Zealand tax residence under a DTA before the integrity rules will apply and NRWT must be paid. 146.Providing a two-year period to change a company’s residence only after a competent authority residence determination has been provided would significantly increase the period from which the dividend is paid to any potential NRWT liability is due. This is undesirable and would give rise to additional risks (e.g., that the payer may not be informed of the residence determination, the payer may no longer have the capacity to meet the NRWT obligation). Recommendations (Minister of Revenue only) Agree to amend the dividend exemption integrity proposal by excluding dividends paid to companies that are dual resident in Australia and New Zealand. Agreed/Not agreed Agree to allow imputation credits to be retrospectively attached to dividends where the proposed changes to the domestic dividend exemption or corporate migration rules apply. Agreed/Not agreed Agree that where a recipient of dividends reinstates its New Zealand residence under the relevant DTA within the two-year grace period, the dividend integrity proposal should apply only to the extent of the amount of non-fully imputed dividends paid by that company while it was DTA non-resident. Agreed/Not agreed Agree to amend the corporate migration integrity proposals so they only apply at the earlier of a DTA non-resident company claiming tax relief under a DTA in a return, or once two years have passed since the company received a competent authority determination that it is DTA non-resident, and it has not become New Zealand resident for the purposes of the relevant DTA. Agreed/Not agreed Agree the recommendations above apply from 30 August 2022, in line with the application date for the integrity measures in the Bill. Agreed/Not agreed IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 23 of 26 Housing: remedial amendments (Minister of Revenue only) 147.The recommendations in this section do not require approval by the Minister of Finance. 148.The Bill proposes remedial amendments to the rollover relief provisions introduced in the previous omnibus bill for the bright-line test and interest limitation rules. Submitters were generally supportive of the proposed amendments, although a few submitters commented that the legislative drafting could be made clearer and suggested refinements. 149.Several commented on the application date (being date of enactment of the Bill) and stated that the amendments should be retrospective to 27 March 2021, with application for the purposes of the bright-line test to transfers occurring on or after 1 April 2022. We note that most of the amendments were intended to apply retrospectively, which the Minister of Revenue agreed to in July 2022 (IR2022/293 refers). We intend to recommend the submissions be accepted except where a specific amendment is intended to apply prospectively because it would be a change in policy. Proposed changes in response to submissions 150.Based on submissions, we propose the changes below to the rollover relief amendments in the Bill. 151.The changes recommended to the rollover relief and changes in co-ownership provisions do not have any fiscal implications as they are mere clarifications of the policy intent or, in the case of our suggested amendment at paragraph 159, would ensure that an existing proposal in the Bill works as intended. Permissible charitable beneficiaries 152.Submitters suggested that for discretionary family trusts, the class of permissible charitable beneficiaries should be expanded. 153.At present, permissible charitable beneficiaries are limited to charities registered under the Charities Act 2005. However, most discretionary trusts in New Zealand (many of which are family trusts) have a standard clause in their trust deeds that defines a charitable/non-profit beneficiary class very broadly, beyond entities registered under the Charites Act 2005. As a result, transfers to or from these discretionary trusts are never eligible for rollover relief, which was not intended. 154.We recommend amending the definition of ‘close family beneficiary’ to include the types of organisations listed in the standard discretionary trust clause. 2 155.We consider the potential integrity risk to be low as rollover relief does not apply to distributions to beneficiaries. This means that if residential land is transferred to a beneficiary, then the transfer would be subject to the bright-line test if relevant. 156.However, we do recommend inserting a criterion that there is at least one natural person beneficiary (other than the principal settlor, if there is just one principal settlor) who is a close family associate of the principal settlor. This would limit the amendment’s scope to discretionary trusts that are family trusts and thus avoid 2 The standard clause includes within the beneficiary class any association, club, institution, society, organisation or trust not carried on for the private profit of any person whose funds are to be applied wholly or principally to any civic, community, charitable, philanthropic, religious, benevolent or cultural purpose, whether within New Zealand or elsewhere. IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 24 of 26 making the rules inappropriately broad in their application. We recommend an effective date of 27 March 2021. Relevant bright-line test settings for recipient 157.Submitters suggested that clarification is needed to ensure that when rollover relief applies to a transfer, the recipient is subject to the same bright-line settings or bright-line test length as the original transferor. Amendments in the Bill would address most of these situations, but there are two examples that submitters have raised that are not currently addressed by the Bill. This includes when inherited property is transferred by a settlor of a family trust to the trust. Inherited property is exempt from the bright-line test, but at present the trustee in this situation would be taxed under the bright-line test on a subsequent transfer of the property if it occurs within 10 years of the date it was inherited by the settlor. An effective date of 27 March 2021 is recommended for this change. Proposed changes: matters raised by officials 158.The Minister of Revenue previously agreed that the rollover relief provision applying to a transfer of residential property from an eligible family trust to a settlor of the trust should be clarified to ensure that rollover relief applies in the situation where a settlor previously made cash settlements on the trust or guaranteed its obligations to enable it to acquire the property (IR2022/293 refers). 159.Subject to your agreement, we will also recommend further amendments so that the proposed new rule would only apply in limited circumstances when the settlor receiving the property from the trust was not the original owner of the property. This is in line with the purpose of the amendment. If the settlor was the original owner of the property, then the pre-existing rule for transfers to settlors would apply to determine whether the transfer qualifies for rollover relief. We recommend this change apply from the date of enactment. 160.We also propose further drafting changes to clarify the provisions that apply to changes in co-ownership of residential property. While submitters did not submit on the proposed amendments to these provisions, we have had some discussion with stakeholders about remaining errors and ambiguities in these provisions that ought to be fixed. This includes making these changes retrospective to 1 October 2015, the date the original two-year bright-line test applied from. Submissions to be declined A rollover relief provision providing for transfers between spouses, civil union, and de facto partners 161.The law provides rollover relief when residential property is transferred on a settlement of relationship property. There is nothing that requires the transaction to occur as part of a separation or relationship breakup, so the law already applies broadly. We do not consider there to be a convincing case for having rollover relief apply in situations where, for example, a person transfers a 50 percent interest in their property to their new partner without there being a formal relationship agreement providing for this. Look-through companies (LTCs) and partnerships 162.Several submitters commented on the application of the rollover reliefs for LTCs and partnerships. They suggested that rollover relief should be available for: IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 25 of 26 •transfers of shares in a land-rich LTC from an individual to a family trust, •transfers of residential property to partners/LTC owners on the dissolution of the partnership or liquidation of the LTC, and •extending rollover relief to deemed transfers arising on the cessation of an LTC. 163.The intent of the rollover relief rules is to provide rollover relief for the most common and straightforward ownership change scenarios where economic ownership of residential property is unchanged. 164.The rollover relief rules explicitly prevent relief from applying for the transfer of shares in a land-rich LTC to a trust. This provision was added out of concern that providing rollover relief might incentivise holding assets in a trust structure, which could lead to unintended outcomes and raise integrity concerns. 165.The partnership and LTC rules have specific rules concerning the transfer of assets upon the dissolution of the partnership, or liquidation or cessation of an LTC and provide that these are treated as disposals occurring at market value. These rules have wider application than just the bright-line rules and apply to assets other than residential property. As such, there is a clear policy intention for these events to trigger a taxable event with the amount of tax calculated on the market value of the property. The purpose is to ensure there is not a permanent avoidance of tax on partnership or LTC assets held on revenue account. 166.Submitters consider the rollover relief rules should address the issue of latent tax liabilities for dual-resident LTCs that, following a change in interpretation by the Australian Tax Office, have ceased to meet the definition of LTC because they are now treated as not resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the Australia—New Zealand DTA. We note that the previous Australian Government announced in 2020 that remedial changes would be made to Australia’s corporate tax residence test with retrospective application. The problem the submitter has raised would be resolved if the announced changes proceed. Residential property transfers between mirror trusts or to a newly resettled unified trust 167.Mirror trusts, while not commonly used today, were common in the 1990s and early 2000s. According to the submitter, there are many mirror trusts still in existence. A typical structure was for one spouse to settle a trust with the other spouse and their children as beneficiaries, and for the second spouse to also settle a trust of their own with the first spouse and the children as beneficiaries. The first spouse would not be a beneficiary of their own trust, and likewise, the second spouse would also not be a beneficiary of the trust they settled for the benefit of the first spouse and the children. 168.The issue is that, in their current form, the rollover relief provisions do not apply when a property is transferred from one mirror trust to the other, as may occur when one settlor dies. While we consider there is a case for providing rollover relief in this scenario, given the complexities in drafting a rule that does not give rise to an integrity risk and the amount of time available, we think it would be better to consider this issue further with a view to including any resulting amendment in the next tax bill, rather than make a change to this Bill at the Select Committee stage. Recommendations (Minister of Revenue only) Agree to expand the class of permissible charitable beneficiaries for a discretionary family trust for the purpose of the rollover relief provisions to include the types of organisations listed in the standard discretionary trust clause. IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 26 of 26 Agreed/Not agreed Agree that rollover relief should only apply for a transfer to or from a family trust if there is at least one natural person beneficiary, other than the principal settlor, who is a close family associate of the principal settlor. Agreed/Not agreed Agree to remedial changes to ensure that, when rollover relief applies to a transfer of residential property, the recipient is subject to the same bright-line settings or bright-line test length as the transferor in all instances. Agreed/Not agreed Agree that the proposal expanding the circumstances in which rollover relief applies to a transfer from a family trust to a settlor should only apply when the settlor receiving the residential property from the trust is not the original owner of the property.

Most of the submissions related to a public campaign by the Cycling Action Network to exempt bicycles from FBT (approximately 415 submissions), and the proposal to apply GST to certain types of services provided on digital platforms (310 submissions). 3.We previously reported to Ministers in November and December 2022 regarding our proposed recommendations to be included in the officials’ report \[IR2022/488, IR2022/538 and IR2022/542 refer\]. These decisions are reflected in the attached draft officials’ report. Further issues Imputation credit account returns for members of consolidated imputation groups 4.In IR2022/488, the Minister of Revenue approved a change relating to the filing of imputation credit account (ICA) returns for members of a consolidated imputation group. This clarified that where a member’s ICA had a nil balance at all times during the tax year, they were not required to file an ICA return. This was to reduce the compliance costs of filing nil ICA returns for taxpayers. 5.However, an incorrect application date was included in that recommendation. The Minister approved an application date of 2021–22 imputation year, however, we have been advised the issue also arises for the 2020–21 imputation year. 6.We propose to change that application date which will ensure that members of consolidated imputation groups who have not filed nil ICA returns will not be Document 6 Page 2 of 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] policed for those returns. This will provide more certainty to the affected taxpayers and has no fiscal cost. Interest limitation: exemption for build-to-rent assets 7.The Bill proposes an in-perpetuity exemption for “build-to-rent” developments from the interest limitation rules. The exemption would be administered by Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga - the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 8.Inconsistencies between the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (RTA) and the proposed provision were raised by submitters. In August 2022, Cabinet agreed to a draft definition for build-to-rent \[DEV-22-MIN-0163 refers\]. A s part of this definition, build-to-rent providers must offer tenants a 10-year fixed term tenancy with the ability for tenants to terminate the tenancy with 56 days’ notice. It has become apparent that the 56-day notice period is inconsistent with the RTA, as a fixed term tenancy cannot include a tenancy that is terminable by notice. In HUD2022-001095, the Minister of Housing approved a consequential amendment to the RTA to align the definition of a fixed-term tenancy with the build-to-rent tenancy requirement. 9.For Inland Revenue to apply the exclusion, it is necessary for information to be shared between Inland Revenue and HUD. In IR2022/542, the Minister approved a consequential amendment to the Tax Administration Act 1994 to insert a disclosure provision to allow for this. Consultation with Treasury 10.Treasury was informed about this briefing note. Next steps 11.HUD has requested that you provide a copy of the draft officials’ report to the Minister of Housing’s office. 12.The finalised report is due to the Committee no later than 2pm, 20 January 2023. This will allow the Bill to be progressed in line with the FEC’s current timetable. The Finance and Expenditure Committee’s report to the House and the revision-tracked version of the Bill are due by 2 March 2023. 13.As the Bill sets the annual income tax rates for 2022–23, the remaining Parliamentary stages should be completed by 31 March 2023. We will liaise with the relevant offices regarding speeches for the remaining stages and a flight plan for the Committee of the whole House debate.

POLICY AND REGULATORY STEWARDSHIP Tax policy report: Supplementary Order Paper: North Island floods Date: 1 March 2023 Priority: High Security level: In Confidence Report number: IR2023/077 Action sought Action sought Deadline Minister of Revenue Agree to recommendations 2 March 2023 Contact for telephone discussion (if required) Name Position Telephone Peter Frawley Policy Lead Bary Hollow Principal Policy Advisor Carl Harris Senior Policy Advisor Document 7 s 9(2)(a) IR2023/077: Suppementary Order Paper: North Island floods Page 1 of 7 1 March 2023 Minister of Revenue Supplementary Order Paper: North Island floods Summary 1.This report seeks your agreement to include legislative amendments in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022—23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2) (“the Bill”) by Supplementary Order Paper (“SOP”). The recommended legislative amendments would provide relief in response to the recent North Island flood events. 2.These amendments provide relief from income tax and fringe benefit tax for cash and benefits provided by employers to employees who have been adversely affected by the North Island flood events, as well as those employees who relocate to the affected areas to assist with the rebuild and recovery. 3.We recommend that the SOP also includes several minor technical amendments to existing measures in the Bill, which are all consistent with the policy intent. 4.We also recommend extending the final date for eligibility for the Cost of Living payment to ensure that individuals do not miss out on the payment because their ability to file their tax return has been impacted by the North Island flooding events. Supplementary Order Paper items that require Cabinet approval 5.In response to the recent North Island flooding events, we recommend including legislative amendments in the Bill to provide relief for employees who relocate to the affected areas to assist with the rebuild and recovery, and exemptions from income tax and fringe benefit tax (FBT) for cash and benefits provided by employers to employees who have been adversely affected by the flooding events. 6.The proposed tax relief provisions will apply to a “North Island flood event” which essentially covers the geographical districts and regions that were affected by: 6.1 Cyclone Hale, which crossed the North Island of New Zealand during the period starting on 8 January 2023 and ending on 12 January 2023; 6.2 the heavy rainfall starting on 26 January and ending on 3 February 2023; and 6.3 Cyclone Gabrielle, which crossed the North Island of New Zealand during the period starting on 12 February 2023 and ending on 16 February 2023. Tax relief for accommodation expenditure for employees working on limited duration projects 7.To remove some of the adverse impacts of employees relocating to assist in the Christchurch rebuild project, the Government provided tax relief in respect of accommodation provided to employees where their employment duties required them to work on a limited duration project relating to the rebuilding or recovery. This included the repair and reconstruction of land, infrastructure, and other property in greater Christchurch as a result of the Canterbury earthquakes. IR2023/077: Suppementary Order Paper: North Island floods Page 2 of 7 8.This extended the standard period that accommodation could be provided to employees who were working on limited duration projects from three years to up to five years depending on when the employee relocated. It was limited to relocations to a workplace in the greater Christchurch region. 9.We consider it appropriate to replicate this provision for the regions affected by the North Island flood events to remove a tax barrier to employers relocating staff to assist in the rebuilding and recovery of those areas. 10.We recommend that the definition of limited duration project be extended for an initial period of five years where the employee relocates to an area affected by a North Island flood event within six months after the first event. 11.However, given the unknown duration that a rebuild programme may take in the affected areas, we also recommend providing for an ability for the Minister of Revenue to extend or modify that period by Order in Council. This will add flexibility to the relief as work commences and more accurate assessments of the duration of the rebuild can be made. Tax relief for employers’ welfare contributions and accommodation provided to employees 12.Under existing tax law (with a few limited exclusions), payments made from an employer to an employee are taxable as monetary remuneration. 13.Following the major Christchurch earthquakes in 2010–11, a number of employers made ex-gratia welfare contributions of cash to their earthquake-affected employees. A legislative provision was inserted to provide that income (which could include accommodation benefits) derived by an employee from an employer was exempt income if: 13.1 it was provided by the employer for the purpose of relief of employees from the adverse effects of the Canterbury earthquakes; 13.2 it would have otherwise been taxable income; 13.3 it was derived in the eight weeks after each of the two earthquakes; 13.4 it was not paid in substitution for salary or wages; 13.5 the amount provided did not depend on the seniority of the employee; 13.6 the employee was associated with the employer, then the payment was also available to an unrelated full-time employee; and 13.7 the employer elected to treat the income as being exempt income of the employee. 14.This exemption covered most accommodation benefits and, in relation to each of the two major earthquakes, the first $3,200 paid to each employee (other than accommodation benefits). 1 15.We recommend this provision be updated and enacted with reference to the North Island flood events. We recommend the amount of $3,200 be increased to account for inflation and the scale of the damage in the North Island flood events. 16.Adding pure wage inflation since 2011 would bring the amount to $4,731 but we recommend rounding this to $5,000. We also recommend that the time-limited 1 This allowed total payments of $6,400 to be made as there were two events. IR2023/077: Suppementary Order Paper: North Island floods Page 3 of 7 application of eight weeks be retained, as this would seem an appropriate period to allow any such payments to be made or benefits to be provided. Tax relief for certain fringe benefits provided to employees 17.Fringe benefits provided to an employee are generally subject to FBT. After the Christchurch earthquakes, a number of employers provided benefits to employees or to recovery centres where employees may have received benefits. In response to the Christchurch earthquakes, the Government also introduced an FBT exemption where a benefit was provided to an employee and: 17.1 it was provided by the employer to employees for the purpose of relief of employees from the adverse effects of the Canterbury earthquakes; 17.2 it would have otherwise been a fringe benefit; 17.3 it was received by the employee in the eight weeks after each of the two earthquakes; 17.4 it was not provided in substitution for wages and salary; 17.5 its provision and amount did not depend on the seniority of the employee; 17.6 if the employee was associated with the employer, the benefit was also available to an unrelated full-time employee; and 17.7 the employer elected to treat the benefit as not being a taxable benefit. 18.This exemption covered all “sundry benefits” – for example, benefits that were provided at a drop-in centre. This is because in these cases the employer may not know which employee had received which benefit and thus the employer cannot estimate the value of the benefit. 19.The exemption also covers benefits where the value can be estimated to the extent that the remuneration exemption noted above has not also been paid (i.e., the employer can provide an amount up to $5,000 2 in cash or in benefits but not both). 20.As employers are likely to provide benefits to their employees affected by the North Island flood events, we recommend that this temporary FBT exemption be replicated with reference to those recent events. We recommend that this relief be subject to similar restrictions to the provision enacted for the Canterbury earthquakes. Financial implications 21.There is no fiscal cost to these proposed exemptions. This is because any revenue in the absence of the exemptions would be “windfall” revenue that has not been forecasted. Therefore, the amendments would not affect fiscal baselines. Administrative implications 22.These proposals would have no systems or administration costs for Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue would communicate the changes to taxpayers and update staff and online content. 2 $3,200 in respect of the Canterbury earthquakes IR2023/077: Suppementary Order Paper: North Island floods Page 4 of 7 Supplementary Order Paper items that do not require Cabinet approval Technical amendments to the Bill 23.We recommend including in the SOP several minor technical amendments to the Bill, such as corrections to commencement dates and cross-references. The amendments relate to the platform economy, cross-border workers, tax debt write- off rules and ring-fenced losses, and the financial arrangements taxation proposals in the Bill, and are all consistent with the policy intent. Donated trading stock 24.Recent Orders in Council have provided tax relief for donated trading stock. We recommend including in the SOP a retrospective technical amendment to ensure this relief applies as intended. Cost of Living payment: amendment to final date to be considered for eligibility (non-legislative change) 25.The Cost of Living payment was implemented to cover a particular time period and there is a set timeframe for individuals to have their payment approved. Individuals will not be considered for eligibility if they file their tax return after the final date. 26.The last date for eligibility is currently 31 March 2023. This aligns with the final date for all individual income tax returns to be filed for the 2021–22 tax year. 3 27.Inland Revenue has decided to defer imposing late filing penalties until 31 May 2023, as part of its North Island flood response. We recommend that the final eligibility date for the Cost of Living payment also be extended to 31 May 2023. This would ensure that individuals intended to be eligible for the payment do not miss out because their ability to file on time has been impacted by the North Island floods. 28.Amending the final date for eligibility for the Cost of Living payment would require Cabinet approval but does not require legislative change. This is because the eligibility criteria for the Cost of Living payment are not set in legislation, but instead were agreed by Cabinet and are published on the Inland Revenue website (CAB-22- MIN-0130 refers). Without the amendment to the criteria, Inland Revenue will not be able to assess eligibility to the Cost of Living payment for anyone who files their tax return after 31 March 2023, regardless of the reason. Financial implications 29.Extending the Cost of Living payment eligibility period has no fiscal implications as it relates to a timing change within the same fiscal year. The appropriation is expected to cover all remaining payments. Administrative implications 30.Extending the final date would require a moderate level of system change to ensure we can assess eligibility for the Cost of Living payment for returns filed up to 31 May. We would also need to update both internal and external information sources, such as Inland Revenue's website to explain the change. We also expect an increase in contacts from customers and their agents, via both web and phone, as people query their eligibility and the impact of filing after 31 March. These increased contacts are expected to occur from April to August which is our peak busy period when we are finalising income tax assessments for the 2021–22 tax year. This will increase pressure on our frontline staff. 3 Eligibility Cost of Living payment is based on an individual’s income for the 2021/22 tax year. IR2023/077: Suppementary Order Paper: North Island floods Page 5 of 7 Consultation 31.The Treasury were consulted on these proposals. Next steps 32.The attached Cabinet paper should be lodged with the Cabinet Office as soon as possible in order to be considered by Cabinet on 6 March 2023. 33.The proposed SOP would be released, in consultation with the Leader of the House, prior to the Committee of the whole House stage of the Bill, currently scheduled for 14 March 2023.

1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet NORTH ISLAND FLOODS SUPPLEMENTARY ORDER PAPER – APPROVAL FOR RELEASE Proposal 1 This paper seeks Cabinet’s approval to policy proposals that would provide temporary tax relief in response to the recent North Island flood events. It also seeks approval to delegate authority to the Minister of Revenue to release a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2) (“the Bill”) to give effect to the proposals. T he SOP also includes several minor technical amendments to existing measures in the Bill, which are all consistent with the policy intent. 2 Cabinet approval is also sought to extend the eligibility of the Cost of Living payment. The proposed extension would align with Inland Revenue’s decision to defer imposing late filing penalties until 31 May 2023, as part of its North Island floods response. This would ensure that individuals intended to be eligible for the payment do not miss out because their ability to file on time has been impacted by the North Island floods. This would not require a legislative change. Relation to Government Priorities 3 The proposals in this paper are focused on keeping communities safe following recent weather events in the North Island and the cost of living. 4 I propose providing limited tax relief for accommodation for employees working on limited duration projects assisting with the rebuild and recovery of areas affected by the North Island flooding events. I also propose introducing limited tax relief measures will remove tax barriers for employers seeking to provide a range of welfare benefits to their employees to help them cope with the recent weather. 2qddsziq5 2023-03-07 13:07:46 Document 8 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 5 Budget 2022 included a Cost of Living payment to help New Zealanders with the rising costs of inflation. The payment is administered by Inland Revenue and is based on individuals that earned $70,000 or less in the 2021–22 tax year. The last date for eligibility for the payment is currently 31 March 2023 (being the last date for tax returns to be filed for that tax year). I propose extending the final eligibility date until 31 May 2023 to ensure that individuals do not miss out on the Cost of Living payment because their ability to file their tax return has been impacted by the North Island flooding events. Executive summary 6 To support the recovery of the North Island from recent weather events, I propose providing tax relief for accommodation expenditure for employees working on limited duration projects relating to rebuilding or recovery of affected areas. The proposal would extend the standard period that accommodation can be provided to employees who are working on limited duration projects from three years up to five years. 7 Under existing law, payments made from an employer to an employee and fringe benefits provided to an employee are generally taxable, either as monetary remuneration or by way of fringe benefit tax (FBT). I propose providing limited tax exemptions for employers and their employees for employer welfare contributions related to the recent North Island flooding events. This will support employees who have been adversely affected by the flooding events. 8 I recommend that the above tax relief measures be included in a SOP to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2) . The SOP also includes several minor technical amendments to existing measures in the Bill, which are all consistent with the policy intent. The Bill has a category 1 priority on the 2023 Legislation Programme (must be enacted before the general election as a matter of law), and is expected to be enacted before the end of March 2023. 9 The last date for filing tax returns for the 2021–22 tax year is 31 March 2023. Inland Revenue has exercised its operational discretion to defer imposing penalties on taxpayers who file late tax returns until 31 May 2023, as part of its North Island floods response. The eligibility for the Cost of Living payment is linked to income tax returns filed for the 2021–22 tax year. I recommend that the final eligibility date for the Cost of Living payment is also extended to 31 May 2023. This would ensure that individuals intended to be eligible for the payment do not miss out because their ability to file on time has been impacted by the North Island floods. Background 10 In response to the Christchurch earthquakes in 2010–11, limited tax relief was provided for accommodation of employees relocated to work on limited duration projects assisting with rebuilding and recovery of affected areas, and welfare payments and benefits provided by employers to employees affected by the earthquakes. 2qddsziq5 2023-03-07 13:07:46 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 11 The proposed amendments for inclusion in an SOP would mirror some of the tax relief measures provided in response to the Christchurch earthquakes. These measures would provide relief from income tax and fringe benefit tax for cash and benefits provided by employers to employees who have been adversely affected by the North Island flood events, as well as those employees who relocate to the affected areas to assist with the rebuild and recovery. 12 Inland Revenue officials are developing advice on other tax relief measures that could be introduced in response to the recent North Island flood events. These potential measures are expected to mainly relate to assets that have been damaged or destroyed (plant, equipment, buildings, and other land improvements). This advice will consider the nature and extent of the damage caused by the recent weather events and stakeholders’ perspectives and concerns. This advice is less urgent because taxpayers using tax agents have about 12 months before they need to file a tax position in relation to damaged or destroyed assets (31 March 2024 for the 2022–23 tax year). Supplementary Order Paper 13 The proposed SOP will include limited tax measures to provide relief in response to the recent North Island flood events and minor technical amendments to the Bill. The SOP is necessary as amendments to existing legislation are required to implement the proposed policy changes in a timely manner. 14 I recommend that the proposed tax relief provisions relating to accommodation and employer‘s welfare contributions apply to a “North Island flood event”, which would be defined as the geographical districts and regions that were affected by: 14.1 Cyclone Hale, which crossed the North Island of New Zealand during the period starting on 8 January 2023 and ending on 12 January 2023; 14.2 the heavy rainfall starting on 26 January and ending on 3 February 2023; and 14.3 Cyclone Gabrielle, which crossed the North Island of New Zealand during the period starting on 12 February 2023 and ending on 16 February 2023. Tax relief for accommodation expenditure for employees working on limited duration projects 15 To remove some of the adverse impacts of employees relocating to assist in the Christchurch rebuild project, the Government provided tax relief in respect of accommodation provided to employees where their employment duties required them to work on a limited duration project relating to the rebuilding or recovery. This included the repair and reconstruction of land, infrastructure, and other property in greater Christchurch as a result of the Canterbury earthquakes. 2qddsziq5 2023-03-07 13:07:46 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 16 This extended the standard period that accommodation could be provided to employees who were working on limited duration projects from three years to up to five years depending on when the employee relocated. It was limited to relocations to a workplace in the greater Christchurch region. 17 I recommend that the definition of limited duration project be extended for an initial period of five years where the employee relocates to an area affected by a North Island flood event within six months after the first event. 18 Given the unknown duration that a rebuild programme may take in the affect areas, I also recommend introducing an ability for the Minister of Revenue to extend or modify that period by Order in Council. This will provide flexibility to the proposed relief as work commences and more accurate assessments of the duration of the rebuild can be made. Tax relief for employers’ welfare contributions and accommodation provided to employees 19 Under existing law (with a few limited exceptions), payments made from an employer to an employee are taxable as monetary remuneration. Following the major Christchurch earthquakes in 2010–11, a number of employers made ex- gratia welfare contributions of cash to their earthquake-affected employees. A legislative provision was inserted to provide that income (which could include accommodation benefits) derived by an employee from an employer was exempt income if: 19.1 it was provided by the employer for the purpose of relief of employees from the adverse effects of the Canterbury earthquakes; 19.2 it would have otherwise been taxable income; 19.3 it was derived in the eight weeks after each of the two earthquakes; 19.4 it was not paid in substitution for wages or salary; 19.5 the amount provided did not depend on the seniority of the employer; 19.6 the employee was associated with the employer, then it was also available to an unrelated full-time employee; and 19.7 the employer elected to treat the income as being exempt income of the employee. 20 The exemption covered most accommodation benefits and in, in relation to each of the two major earthquakes, the first $3,200 paid to each employee other than accommodation benefits. 21 I recommend introducing a provision along the same criteria with reference to the North Island flood events. I also recommend that the amount of $3,200 be increased to $5,000 to account for inflation and the scale of the damage from the recent flooding events. This will help employers support their employees that have been affected by the recent weather events. 2qddsziq5 2023-03-07 13:07:46 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Tax relief for certain fringe benefits provided to employees 22 Fringe benefits provided to an employee are generally taxable by way of FBT. After the Christchurch earthquakes, a number of employers provided benefits to employees or to recovery centres where employees may have received benefits. The Government provided an exemption from FBT where a benefit was provided to an employee and: 22.1 it was provided by the employer to employees for the purpose of relief of employees from the adverse effects of the Canterbury earthquakes; 22.2 it would have otherwise been a fringe benefit; 22.3 it was received by the employee in the eight weeks after each of the two earthquakes; 22.4 it was not provided in substitution for wages and salary; 22.5 its provision and amount did not depend on the seniority of the employee; 22.6 if the employee was associated with the employer, then it was also available to an unrelated full-time employee; and 22.7 the employer elected to treat the benefit as not being a taxable benefit. 23 This exemption covered all “sundry benefits” – for example benefits that were provided at a drop-in centre. This is because in these cases the employer may not know which employee had received what benefits and thus the employer cannot estimate the value of the benefit. 24 I recommend introducing a similar temporary relief provision with reference to the North Island flood events. The exemption would also cover benefits where the value can be estimated to the extent that the remuneration exemption noted above has not also been paid (i.e., and employer can provide an amount up to $5,000 in cash or in benefits but not both). Cost of Living payment eligibility 25 The Cost of Living payment was implemented to cover a particular time period and there is a set timeframe for individuals to have their payment approved. Individuals will not be considered for eligibility if they file their tax return after the final date. 26 The last date for eligibility is currently 31 March 2023. This aligns to the final date for all individual income tax returns to be filed for the 2021–22 tax year. 27 Inland Revenue has exercised its operational discretion to defer imposing late filing penalties until 31 May 2023, as part of its North Island flood response. I recommend that Cabinet also extend the final eligibility date for the Cost of Living payment to 31 May 2023. This would ensure that individuals intended to be eligible for the payment do not miss out because their ability to file on time has been impacted by the North Island floods. 2qddsziq5 2023-03-07 13:07:46 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 28 Without amending the criteria, Inland Revenue would not be able to assess eligibility to the Cost of Living payment for anyone who files their tax return after 31 March 2023, regardless of the reason. Financial implications 29 There are no fiscal implications of the proposed tax relief measures as tax revenue in the absence of the proposed exemptions would be “windfall” gains in tax revenue that have not been forecasted. 30 Extending the Cost of Living payment eligibility period has no fiscal implications as it relates to a timing change within the same fiscal year. The appropriation is expected to cover all remaining payments. Administrative implications 31 The proposed limited tax relief measures will have no systems implications for Inland Revenue, and other administrative implications (such as guidance) will fall within Inland Revenue’s existing change capacity. 32 The change to the Cost of Living payment eligibility will require a moderate level of system change to ensure Inland Revenue can assess eligibility for the Cost of Living payment for tax returns filed up to 31 May 2023. Inland Revenue will update both internal and external information sources, such as Inland Revenue’s website to explain the change. Inland Revenue expects an increased level of contacts from taxpayers and their agents, via both web and phone, as people query their eligibility and the impact of filing after 31 March 2023. These increased contacts are expected to occur from April to August which is Inland Revenue’s peak busy period when income tax assessments for the 2021–22 tax year are finalised. This will increase pressure on Inland Revenue’s frontline staff. Legislative implications 33 Implementing the proposed tax relief measures will require changes to the Income Tax Act 2007. I propose to include the necessary legislative changes in a SOP to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2) prior to the Committee of the whole House stage. 34 The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2) holds a category 1 priority on the 2023 Legislation Programme (must be enacted before the general election as a matter of law) and is expected to be enacted by the end of March 2023. 35 The change to the Cost of Living payment eligibility period does not require a legislative amendment. The Cost of Living payment criteria was not set in legislation, but was agreed to by Cabinet and published on Inland Revenue’s website \[CAB-22-MIN-0130 refers\]. 2qddsziq5 2023-03-07 13:07:46 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 36 The Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that the proposed tax relief in response to Cyclone Gabrielle and the Auckland Anniversary flooding is exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement. This is granted on the grounds that the proposals are intended to manage the direct actions taken to protect the public in response to a declared emergency event and required urgently to be effective (making a complete, robust and timely Regulatory Impact Statement unfeasible). 37 The Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that the proposed extension of the eligibility date for Cost of Living payments is exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement, as it is intended to temporarily defer or extend legislative deadlines where a declared emergency has made compliance with the existing legislative requirements impossible, impractical, or unreasonably burdensome. Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 38 The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) team has been consulted and confirms that the CIPA requirements do not apply to these proposals as the threshold for significance is not met. Population 39 Due to the urgency of the response to the recent weather events, Inland Revenue officials have been unable to determine how many taxpayers would be impacted by the proposed limited tax relief measures. 40 As of 26 February 2023, Inland Revenue estimated that a further 290,000 individual income tax returns are due to be filed for the 2021–22 tax year. Officials estimate that about 50 percent of these individuals may be eligible for the Cost of Living payment based on their income. It is unclear how many of these returns will be filed during the proposed extended eligibility period. Human Rights 41 The proposals comply with the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993. Consultation Relevant Government Departments or Other Public Bodies 42 Inland Revenue consulted the Treasury and informed the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet of the proposals. Relevant Private Sector Organisations and Public Consultation Processes 43 Inl and Revenue officials have sought input from key stakeholders on potential tax relief measures in response to the North Island flooding events. 2qddsziq5 2023-03-07 13:07:46 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 44 No public consultation has been undertaken on the proposal to extend the Cost of Living Payment eligibility criteria. Communications 45 I will work with Inland Revenue on communicating the proposed changes to taxpayers. 46 Inland Revenue will include details of the new legislation in a Tax Information Bulletin after the Bill is enacted. Proactive Release 47 I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper and associated Cabinet minute in full shortly after the proposed release of the SOP. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that Cabinet: 1 agree to extend the time limit for accommodation provided to employees working on limited duration projects to the extent those projects are related to the rebuild and recovery from a North Island flood event to five years for employees who relocate within six months after the date of the first event. 2 agree to include the ability for the Minister of Revenue to extend or modify the time limit for the limited duration project exemption (outlined in recommendation 1) in respect of a North Island flood event by Order in Council. 3 agree to include an exemption from income tax, subject to the same restrictions as the previous exemptions made for the Canterbury earthquakes, for employees for: 3.1 accommodation provided by their employer; and 3.2 amounts paid by their employer that do not exceed $5,000. 4 agree to include an exemption from fringe benefit tax (FBT), subject to the same restrictions as the previous exemptions made for the Canterbury earthquakes, for employees for: 4.1 all sundry benefits provided by their employer; and 4.2 benefits provided by their employer that do not exceed $5,000 (or such less amount taking into account any cash paid to the employee and subject to the tax exemption in recommendation 3). 5 agree that the final date to be considered for eligibility for the Cost of Living payment be extended to 31 May 2023. 2qddsziq5 2023-03-07 13:07:46 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Financial implications 6 note that recommendations 1 to 5 have no fiscal implications. Legislative implications 7 agree to authorise the Minister of Revenue, in consultation with the Leader of the House, to release a Supplementary Order Paper to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2) prior to its Committee of the whole House stage, containing the measures in recommendations 1 to 4.

These issues have recently been brought to our attention as requiring an urgent fix and cannot be delayed until the March 2023 omnibus bill. 4.While none of these amendments are material enough to require Cabinet approval, they require approval from the Minister of Revenue and, where there are fiscal implications, the Minister of Finance. Only two of the recommended changes have fiscal implications and these would be funded through the Tax Policy Scorecard. 5.None of these changes give rise to any material compliance or administration costs, or any significant systems or technology implications. 6.Treasury has been consulted on this report and agrees that the changes proposed in this report are consistent with Ministers’ criteria for the Scorecard. There is no risk that the Scorecard may exceed its limits as a result of these changes. Next steps 7.If you agree to the changes in this report, these will be drafted for inclusion in the officials’ report. Subject to the FEC’s agreement, these changes would be included in the revision-tracked version of the Bill to be reported back to the House in early March 2023. 8.Written submissions closed on 2 November 2022 and oral submissions commenced on 9 November 2022. Subsequent hearings of oral evidence are scheduled for 7 and 14 December 2022. 9.We will report to you on 1 December 2022 with a summary of submissions and our proposed recommendations to be included in the officials’ report. 10.The finalised officials’ report is due to the FEC no later than 20 January 2023. This will allow the Bill to be progressed in line with the FEC’s current timetable, reporting back to the house by 2 March 2023. We will report to you with a draft version of the officials’ report for noting in the week beginning 16 January 2023. IR2022/488: Matters raised by officials in the officials’ report on the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2). Page 3 of 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Background 16.The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2) is currently being considered by the Finance and Expenditure Committee (“FEC”). The officials’ report on submissions is due to the FEC no later than 20 January 2023. 17.This report sets out recommended changes that could be included as “matters raised by officials” in the officials’ report to FEC as matters raised by officials. Many of these 18.We do not consider that the recommended changes in this report require Cabinet approval. Two changes in this report have fiscal implications and subject to your agreement, would be managed through the Tax Policy Scorecard. Items with fiscal implications (Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue) Cost of vehicle for fringe benefit tax purposes part-funded by the State Sector Decarbonisation Fund 19.Fringe benefit tax (FBT) on a vehicle is calculated with reference to the “cost price” or the “tax value” of the vehicle to the employer or vehicle owner. The calculation is designed to reflect the average after-tax benefit an employee receives through not needing to purchase their own vehicle, which saves the employee finance, depreciation, maintenance and other running costs. FBT is designed to equate with the PAYE (pay as you earn) tax that applies to salary and wages. This promotes fairness between employees, whether they are paid in cash or in kind, and helps preserve the integrity of the employment income tax base. 20.The Public Sector Decarbonisation Fund is available to the state sector for updating their assets to less carbon intensive alternatives to reduce their carbon emissions. It is administered by the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority, Te Tari Tiaki Pūngao. The fund could be used to purchase vehicles that are subject to FBT. 21. 22. the general public does not have access to this fund, overall purpose of the FBT regime and original policy intent, which is to tax the value of the benefit that the employee receives on the basis that it is equivalent to the payment of additional salary or wages. 23.We recommend an amendment to clarify that the “cost price” and “tax value” of a vehicle for the purposes of the FBT rules is the gross cost before any State Sector Decarbonisation Fund funding. 24.The amendment should apply prospectively for benefits provided from 1 April 2023. 25.The financial implication of this proposed remedial amendment is a revenue gain of approximately $0.28 million over the forecast period, with a corresponding impact on the operating balance and net debt. s 9(2)(h) s 9(2)(h) s 9(2)(h) IR2022/488: Matters raised by officials in the officials’ report on the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2). Page 4 of 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Recommendations Agree to amend the Income Tax Act 2007 to clarify that the “cost price” and “tax value” of a vehicle for FBT purposes is the gross costs of the vehicle to the employer or vehicle owner before any amount received from the State Sector Decarbonisation Fund reduces the price or value. Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed Agree that this should apply for benefits provided from 1 April 2023. Agreed/Not Agreed Agreed/Not agreed Note the following changes to tax revenue as a result of the decisions above, with a corresponding impact on the operating balance and net debt: $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue - 0.070 0.080 0.080 0.050 Noted Noted Agree that the fiscal implications resulting from this change will be managed through the Tax Policy Scorecard. Agreed/Not Agreed Agreed/Not agreed Tax debt write-off rules 26.The Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) requires that when a taxpayer has a tax debt written off, a corresponding tax loss should be extinguished if the taxpayer has accrued tax losses. This ensures that taxpayers who benefit from a debt write- off do not receive an undue advantage. 27.The Bill contains a proposal that would allow the Commissioner to extinguish a taxpayer’s ring-fenced residential rental loss when they have tax debt written off, on the basis that these ring-fenced losses are not considered to form part of a taxpayer’s “tax loss”. 28.In finalising the systems and operational changes for this amendment, two issues relating to the tax debt write-off rules have arisen. The first issue has a fiscal impact and requires the agreement of both the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue. The second issue does not have a fiscal impact and only requires approval by the Minister of Revenue. Extinguishing excess bright-line losses 29.When someone makes a loss under the bright-line test, that loss (referred to as excess deductions) is carried forward to a later year in which the taxpayer has bright-line income and/or income from land. 30.Similar to ring-fenced residential rental losses, excess bright-line deductions are not considered a “tax loss,” and therefore cannot be extinguished when a taxpayer IR2022/488: Matters raised by officials in the officials’ report on the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2). Page 5 of 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] has a tax debt written off. This does not align with the policy intent of the debt write-off rules. 31.We recommend that for the purpose of the tax debt write-off rules, the Commissioner should be able to extinguish bright-line losses. We recommend that this should apply in relation to tax debts written off on or after 1 April 2024. This is to allow sufficient time for the required system and annual return changes to be made. 32.Because the law does not currently provide for excess bright-line deductions to be extinguished when a tax debt is written off, the fiscal cost of this change is not reflected in current tax forecasts. 33.Officials recommend that you note the reduction in tax revenue and then agree to the proposed amendment to resolve the issue, restoring tax forecasts to their present track, but for a $200,000 cost in 2022/23 and 2023/2024. This is because the forecast change applies immediately, but the recommended amendment would only take effect for tax debts written off on or after 1 April 2024. 34.The fiscal cost of the issue is difficult to quantify because data on excess bright-line deductions is not currently collected. We therefore recommend adjusting tax revenue forecasts downwards from 2022/23 onwards by $200,000 per year, and likewise treating the proposed amendment as resulting in $200,000 of additional tax revenue per year. 35.The Treasury has advised that the fiscal impact of the proposed amendment, but not the forecasting change, should be managed against the Tax Policy Scorecard.

Page 7 of 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Items without fiscal implications (Minister of Revenue only) Limiting tax loss extinguishment obligations to align with current practice 36.The TAA also requires some tax to be written off if it meets certain qualifying criteria (e.g., low-balance write-offs). Other tax is eligible to be written off, but not mandated. In practice, several of these tax write-offs occur via Inland Revenue’s auto-calc process. 1 37.Legally, there is a concern that the loss extinguishment rules apply to these types of write-offs. However, under current practice this process does not automatically extinguish taxpayers’ corresponding tax losses. 38.These types of write-offs generally relate to small balances or to liabilities that arise through no fault of the taxpayer. Consequently, to extinguish losses in these cases would seem harsh and involve significant compliance and administration costs which would outweigh any benefit from the extinguishment of losses. 39.We recommend an amendment to ensure that write-offs occurring through the auto-calc process do not result in a tax loss extinguishment. This rule would apply to general tax losses, as well as ring-fenced residential rental property and bright- line losses. 40.The proposed change has no fiscal impact as current administrative practice is not to extinguish those losses, so this amendment would bring the legislation in line with existing administrative practice. This differs from the change for extinguishing bright-line losses above as that proposal would allow bright-line losses to be extinguished, which is currently not permitted. This change would align legislation with administrative practice and as result, would not impact revenue. 41.If instead of a legislative change, Inland Revenue amended the current administrative practice to align with the current law, there would be administrative and compliance costs that would outweigh any additional benefit. 42.This proposed amendment should apply retrospectively from the 2018–19 income year following the implementation of the auto-calc process. Recommendations Agree that tax write-offs currently included in the auto-calc process should not result in a tax loss extinguishment. Agreed/Not Agreed Agree that this should apply from the 2018–19 income year. Agreed/Not Agreed Imputation credit accounts 43.Companies have imputation credit accounts (ICAs) to keep track of company income tax paid on their income. They attach these imputation credits to dividends paid to shareholders to ensure there is no double taxation of income. ICA companies are required to file annual ICA returns (IR4J) accounting for their ICA balance. 1 The auto-calc process is the process that automatically calculates the tax liabilities for those taxpayers who receive only income with tax deducted at source (e.g., salary and wages). IR2022/488: Matters raised by officials in the officials’ report on the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2). Page 8 of 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 44.Under the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA), a group of wholly-owned companies may form a consolidated imputation group. This group has one ICA, which consolidates any debits or credits that would have arisen in individual members’ ICAs. 45.When a company is part of a consolidated imputation group, these individual company returns are likely to be nil. Leaving a consolidated imputation group 46.A concern arises when a member of the consolidated imputation group leaves the group. There are no legislative provisions regarding the allocation of the group’s imputation credits that are associated with departing member’s tax payments yet to be used against a liability. All imputation credits remain in the consolidated imputation group’s ICA. 47.A mismatch arises because even though the imputation credits remain in the group’s ICA, tax payments made to the Inland Revenue or a tax pool intermediary by the departing member remain owned by that member. This means that if the departing member obtains a tax refund or transfers their entitlement in a tax pooling account, they would have insufficient imputation credits to cover the required debits to their account. If this occurs, the refund or transfer cannot be processed. 48.Conversely, the imputation group retains excess imputation credits, allowing it to impute more than it should be able to. 49.We recommend amending the ITA so that when a member departs a consolidated imputation group, a debit arises to the consolidated imputation group’s ICA and a credit arises to the departing member’s ICA. The size of the debit and credit should be equivalent to the size of income tax payments made by the departing member and credited to the group’s ICA which have not yet been credited to a tax liability that has or will be assessed on the departing member. 50.The proposed amendment would have no fiscal cost as there would be no change in the number of imputation credits or a company’s ability to generate new imputation credits. 51.The proposed amendment would apply for the 2021–22 and later imputation years. Recommendations Note that this amendment does not have fiscal implications. Noted Agree to amend the Income Tax Act 2007 so that when a member departs a consolidated imputation group a debit arises to the consolidated imputation group’s ICA and a credit arise to the ICA of the departing member Agreed/Not Agreed Agree that this should apply for the 2021–22 and later imputation years. Agreed/Not Agreed ICA returns for members of consolidated groups 52.Under current legislation, taxpayers who are members of a consolidated imputation group are required to file an IR4J return no matter whether that return is nil or not. IR2022/488: Matters raised by officials in the officials’ report on the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2). Page 9 of 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 53.Filing these nil ICA returns has significant compliance and administrative costs for no benefit. This is because generally most changes to ICAs occur at the consolidated group level and would be included in the group’s IR4J. It is therefore the norm that the ICA return of an individual member of a consolidated ICA group would be nil. Members of a consolidated group have nil ICAs because once they are a member of the group, all debits and credits will arise in the group ICA and any balance they had in their individual ICA is likely to have been transferred to the group account over time. 54.To remove these unnecessary costs, we propose an amendment that would not require an ICA company who is a member of a consolidated imputation group to file an ICA with the Commissioner if the balance of that ICA is nil at all times during the imputation year. 55.We recommend this change apply retrospectively to the 2021–22 and later imputation years to validate those taxpayers who have not filed such returns. Recommendations Agree to amend the Tax Administration Act 1994 to not require an ICA company who is a member of a consolidated imputation group to file an ICA with the Commissioner if the balance of that ICA is nil at all times during the imputation year. Agreed/Not Agreed Agree that this change apply for the 2021–22 imputation year. Agreed/Not Agreed Inland Revenue’s confidentiality provision and its application to staff from other government departments 56.Tax legislation requires that all Inland Revenue and other agency staff who have access to taxpayer information to keep that information confidential and to sign a confidentiality declaration before accessing the information. This was the position for both Inland Revenue and other agency staff up to 18 March 2019. 57.However, in March 2019, an unintended change was made which required other agency staff to keep all Inland Revenue information confidential, not just taxpayer information. “Inland Revenue information” is broad and includes information that could be in the public domain (e.g., the number of audit staff, which could be available in Inland Revenue’s annual report). This was not the policy intent of the provision as it imposes a higher obligation on staff from other government departments than those from Inland Revenue. 58.We recommend that the confidentiality provision for staff from other government departments be amended to refer to only taxpayer information instead of all Inland Revenue information. This would mirror the provision that applies to Inland Revenue staff. 59.We recommend a retrospective application date of 18 March 2019, being when the provision was amended, to ensure that other agency staff are not disadvantaged by the unintended law change. We are not aware of any instances to date where other agency staff have been adversely impacted by this error. IR2022/488: Matters raised by officials in the officials’ report on the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2). Page 10 of 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Recommendations Agree to amend the Tax Administration Act 1994 to require other agency staff to keep taxpayer information shared with them confidential, instead of all Inland Revenue information. Agreed/Not Agreed Agree that this should applyfrom 18 March 2019. Agreed/Not Agreed Meaning of “company” and application to foreign companies 60.Recent work undertaken by Inland Revenue’s Tax Counsel Office found that a literal interpretation of the definition of “company” in the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) should be clarified to preclude unintended effects. The definition specifically excludes a partnership. However, the definition of a “partnership” under the Partnership Law Act 2019 means that a company incorporated outside of New Zealand is considered a “partnership” for tax purposes rather than a “company”. Foreign companies are therefore excluded from the legal definition of a “company.” 61.This interpretation means that foreign companies are not subject to portions of the ITA, including the foreign investment fund (FIF) or controlled foreign company (CFC) rules. This is contrary to the policy intent as the FIF and CFC rules were designed to apply to foreign companies. 62.We recommend an amendment to the definition of “company” to exclude a limited partnership rather than a partnership. This would enable the rules to function as intended. 63.The amendment should apply retrospectively from 1 April 2008, as this was the date that a partnership was excluded from the definition of a “company” in the ITA. 64.There is no fiscal cost associated with the proposal as the change would clarify legislation in accordance with existing practice and policy intent. Recommendations Agree to amend the Income Tax Act 2007 to exclude a limited partnership rather than a partnership from the definition of a “company”. Agreed/Not Agreed Agree that this should apply retrospectively from 1 April 2008. Agreed/Not Agreed Interest limitation: Grandparenting variable loans for disallowed residential property 65.Under the interest limitation rules, interest deductions for residential property loans drawn down before 27 March 2021 are gradually phased out between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2025 (referred to as grandparented loans and interest). 66.When a loan drawn down before 27 March 2021 relates to both disallowed residential property and allowed property, and the borrower cannot reasonably IR2022/488: Matters raised by officials in the officials’ report on the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2). Page 11 of 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] trace between these purposes, there is a formula to effectively apportion between the two property types. 67.This formula is used to calculate what portion of interest can be grandparented and can continue to be deducted, rather than being fully disallowed. 68.There is an error in the formula used to calculate deductible interest on certain untraceable variable loans when one of the properties is sold. If a repayment is sourced from the sale proceeds of allowed property, there should be no change to the affected loan balance that is grandparented. However, the current law does not achieve this. 69.To correct this, we recommend an amendment to ensure that sales proceeds from allowed property do not impact the affected loan balance used to calculate deductible interest for untraceable loans. 70.This change should apply from 27 March 2021, to align with the introduction of the interest limitation rules. Recommendations Agree that the formula in the interest limitation rules for certain grandparented variable loans should be corrected to ensure that sales proceeds from allowed property do not impact the affected loan balance. Agreed/Not Agreed Agree that this should apply from 27 March 2021. Agreed/Not Agreed Investments in Australian unit trusts 71.The Bill contains proposed changes to the foreign investment fund (FIF) and controlled foreign company (CFC) rules to limit economic double taxation of New Zealand resident investors with indirect investments in certain FIFs. These issues were identified specifically in relation to investments in Australian unit trusts (AUT). 72.The proposed changes to the dividend rules would limit economic double taxation where an investor holds an interest in an AUT CFC, which in turn holds an interest in an AUT FIF. This double economic taxation can arise if the investor is taxed in relation to the AUT FIF (under the FIF rules), in relation to the AUT CFC (under the CFC rules) and when it receives a dividend from the AUT CFC. However, a similar economic double taxation issue can arise where an AUT CFC holds an interest in an ordinary (that is, non-AUT) FIF. 73.To address this economic double taxation, it is proposed that the changes in the Bill to the dividend rules be extended to include any situations where an AUT CFC holds an interest in a FIF that has been appropriately taxed under the FIF rules. 74.This proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2023, in line with the proposed changes in the Bill. 75.There is no additional fiscal cost with this remedial, as it falls within the original costing of the related changes that are proposed in the Bill.

We also recommend making an Order in Council to extend the due date for applying for R&DLTCs for the 2021–22 tax year. We also seek authorisation to issue a drafting instruction to the Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft the Order. 3.Given tight timeframes, we have attached a draft Cabinet paper in advance of the Order in Council being drafted. This report seeks authorisation to lodge this Cabinet paper with the Cabinet Office. 4.This issue only relates to R&DLTCs and is not relevant to the R&D Tax Incentive, which is entirely separate. Background 5.Under the R&DLTC regime, loss-making taxpayers undertaking R&D can “cash out” their losses. This provides a timing benefit only, as receiving R&DLTCs means the taxpayer cannot carry forward those cashed-out losses to lower their taxable income in future years (once they are profitable). However, R&DLTCs provide short- term cashflow assistance during the start-up phase of a business undertaking R&D. 6.A business must file a statement to apply for R&DLTCs each year. The current issue regards the due date for that statement. Under the existing law, the R&DLTC statement is due by the earlier of: 6.1 The day a taxpayer files their income tax return; and 6.2 The income tax return due date. 7.Under current settings, the due date for the R&DLTC statement is usually the date a taxpayer files their income tax return. This date can be well in advance of the due date for the return because taxpayers may file their returns and R&DLTC statements early so they can cash out their losses sooner. 8.This creates a problem when a taxpayer files their R&DLTC statement after their income tax return. Current law would require Inland Revenue to decline the taxpayer’s application, even if both the return and the statement were filed well before the return due date. 9. s 9(2)(g)(i) s IR2022/513: D ue date for R&D loss tax credit applications Page 2 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 10.After identifying the issue in October 2022, Inland Revenue changed its administrative approach to be consistent with the law. However, this new approach means that some taxpayers will no longer receive R&DLTCs when they were expecting to, despite following the same filing process as in previous years. 11.Several external stakeholders have raised concerns with Inland Revenue’s new approach and have called for flexibility and/or legislative solutions. These issues may be raised at the Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand conference on 24–25 November 2022. 12.The R&DLTC was introduced in the 2015–16 income year, so Inland Revenue has more familiarity with taxpayer behaviour now compared to when the rules were being developed. Given the recent change in administrative approach, it is timely to consider whether the current legislative settings are appropriate. 13.We recommend that changes are made to primary legislation in response to this issue, and that you also recommend an Order in Council to extend the due date for taxpayers currently affected. We set out these recommendations below. Changes to primary legislation 14.The existing requirement to file an R&DLTC statement by the date a taxpayer files their income tax return is difficult and obscure. It is unusual to pin the deadline for doing something on the date that an income tax return is filed rather than the date that the return is due. 15.We recommend making the following changes: 15.1 Removing the requirement that a statement be filed before or on the date a taxpayer files their income tax return. We recommend making this change retrospectively, to remove the legal uncertainty concerning R&DLTCs that have been incorrectly paid out to date. 15.2 Changing the due date for R&DLTC statements going forward, so that a taxpayer’s R&DLTC statement is due 30 days after their income tax return due date. We recommend making this change prospectively from the 2022–23 income year. 15.3 Changing the due date for R&DLTC statements in prior years to 31 March in the year following the relevant income year. We recommend making this change retrospectively up until the 2021–22 income year. This would legitimise the previous losses cashed out to businesses for which their R&DLTC statements had been accepted after the income tax return due date but before the relevant 31 March date. 16.These amendments will make the due date settings for applying for the R&DLTC more intuitive and fairer for taxpayers, as well as giving certainty for taxpayers and Inland Revenue regarding losses already cashed out. The proposed due date going forward would also match the equivalent setting for the R&D Tax Incentive, which is more convenient for taxpayers. Many taxpayers are registered for both regimes. 17.We recommend that these amendments be included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2), which is currently being considered by the Finance and Expenditure Committee. This would mean the amendments would be in force as early as March 2023. Order in Council 18.If changes to primary legislation are not enacted until March 2023, the current issue remains until that date. For the 2021–22 tax year, some taxpayers have now filed IR2022/513: D ue date for R&D loss tax credit applications Page 3 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] their income tax returns without having filed their R&DLTC statements, despite intending to claim R&DLTCs for the year. In previous years, Inland Revenue would still have approved these applications, but now no longer will. 19.This R&DLTC regime is intended to encourage and incentivise R&D expenditure by businesses, including loss-making start-ups. Taxpayers that did not submit R&DLTC statements prior to filing their income tax returns for the 2021–22 tax year would fail on a minor procedural ground rather than a substantive requirement, which we consider undermines the policy intent of the regime. 20.The Tax Administration Act 1994 contains a broad power to extend the time for doing something under the Act. This would include extending the deadline for businesses to submit an R&DLTC statement. 21.To ensure taxpayers are not unexpectedly disadvantaged by Inland Revenue’s change in administrative approach, we recommend that you make an Order in Council extending the deadline for submitting an R&DLTC statement for the 2021– 22 tax year until 30 April 2023. This would allow businesses to still receive their R&DLTCs for the 2021–22 tax year even if they had failed the filing requirements on a minor procedural ground. Affected taxpayers would still be required to file a statement before being allowed R&DLTCs. 22.If this Order in Council is not agreed to, affected taxpayers will experience a delay in receiving R&DLTCs for the 2021–22 year, or will miss out altogether if the amendments to primary legislation are not enacted. This situation is exacerbated by the fact that Inland Revenue does not have any other discretion for accepting R&DLTC statements that are filed late. Consequently, denying applications for R&DLTCs when they previously would not have been denied would be (and already has been) controversial amongst stakeholders. 23.The attached Cabinet paper recommending the Order in Council seeks agreement to a waiver of the 28-day rule for Orders in Council coming into force. This waiver is sought on the grounds that not waiving the rule will: 23.1 Cause frustration for R&D businesses that are seeking R&DLTCs as soon as possible but cannot have their R&DLTC statement approved for a further 28 days, resulting in the delayed receipt of those tax credits; and 23.2 Increase the processing backlog for Inland Revenue, if it cannot fully process statements filed under the extended due date for a further 28 days. Financial implications 24.The proposed amendments to primary legislation, and the Order in Council, would not have a fiscal impact. 25.The current due date settings are not designed to increase or decrease the number of eligible taxpayers for R&DLTCs. Changing the due date settings is intended to make it easier for businesses to access R&DLTCs but is not expected to result in an increase in claims, particularly as businesses had adjusted to Inland Revenue’s original (incorrect) approach. 26.The Order in Council would only bring forward the disbursement of R&DLTCs within the same financial year. Consultation 27.The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Callaghan Innovation, the Treasury, and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet have been consulted on this report and the attached Cabinet paper. IR2022/513: D ue date for R&D loss tax credit applications Page 4 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 28.This issue has been discussed with some (tax) external stakeholders, including individual taxpayers/advisors as well as groups including Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand. Next steps 29.Subject to your agreement, we will prepare the amendments to primary legislation for inclusion in the officials’ report on the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2). 30.If authorised, we will also issue a drafting instruction to the Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft an Order in Council giving effect to an extension of the filing deadline for R&DLTC statements for the 2021–22 tax year. We will provide this Order to your office in advance of the Cabinet Legislation Committee meeting that considers this Cabinet paper on either 8 December 2022 or 15 December 2022. We will also provide you with speaking notes to accompany consideration of the attached Cabinet paper. 31.The attached Cabinet paper should be authorised for lodgement to the Cabinet Office by 10am Thursday 1 December if the Cabinet paper is considered at the Cabinet Legislation Committee meeting on Thursday 8 December. Otherwise, lodgement should occur by 10am Thursday 8 December for consideration at the Cabinet Legislation Committee meeting on Thursday 15 December. 32.Subject to your agreement, we will communicate to external stakeholders and affected taxpayers that the primary legislation changes will be included in the officials’ report to the Bill to change the current due date settings. We will also communicate that an Order in Council will be recommended to extend the current deadline for the 2021–22 tax year.

Those are: 1.1 1.2 1.3 A technical amendment to the government grants exclusion due to the introduction of the New to R&D Grant. Not in scope Not in scope IR2022/500: R&D Tax Incentive: Matters for consideration Page 2 of 10 Carve-ou t from government grants exclusion for the New to R&D Grant 12.R&D expenditure funded by government grants is generally excluded from being eligible for the RDTI as that expenditure does not require support provided by the RDTI to induce it. 13.The legislation provides for some carve-outs from this exclusion. For example, Callaghan Innovation Project Grants are carved out to the extent that R&D expenditure exceeds an amount contracted for under the Project Grant. This was intended to make any unexpected expenditure eligible for the RDTI given that amount is not supported by the Project Grant. 14.Project Grants have been phased out and the New to R&D Grant is being introduced in its place. The terms of the New to R&D Grant are similar to the Project Grant in that it provides for co-funding of up to 40% of the eligible R&D expenditure. 15.We recommend that a carve-out is made for the New to R&D Grant with respect to the RDTI government grants exclusion. This would be similar to the carve-out that was made for Project Grants. R&D expenditure by businesses that receive a New to R&D Grant would be carved out from the exclusion to the extent that their R&D expenditure exceeds the amount contracted for under the New to R&D Grant. 16.We estimate the fiscal impact of this amendment to be $75,000 per year. Baseline forecasts originally assumed R&D expenditure that was not eligible for other government grants would be eligible for the RDTI. Hence, agreeing to this amendment would have no fiscal impact, while not agreeing to this amendment would have a fiscal saving of $75,000 per year. Recommended action We recommend that you: Not in scope Not in scope IR2022/500: R&D Tax Incentive: Matters for consideration Page 4 of 10 Introduction 17.The Research and Development Tax Incentive (RDTI) operates as a 15% tax credit for eligible R&D expenditure on eligible R&D activities. R&D tax credits are processed after the end of the income year. 18.This report seeks joint decisions on three current matters in relation to the RDTI. 19. 20. 21.The third issue considers a technical amendment to the RDTI government grants exclusion due to the introduction of the New to R&D Grant. This is to ensure that amounts of R&D expenditure incurred by a business in excess of an amount the business has contracted for under the New to R&D Grant can still be eligible for the RDTI. Not in scope Not in scope IR2022/500: R&D Tax Incentive: Matters for consideration Page 5 of 10 Not in scope IR2022/500: R&D Tax Incentive: Matters for consideration Page 6 of 10 Not in scope IR2022/500: R&D Tax Incentive: Matters for consideration Page 7 of 10 Carve-ou t from government grants exclusion for the New to R&D Grant Background 48.The RDTI is available for eligible R&D expenditure on eligible R&D activities. Ineligible/excluded activities and expenditures are listed in the Income Tax Act 2007. One type of exclusion is expenditure or loss that is undertaken in conjunction with receipt of a government grant. Such expenditure is already being induced by a government grant and is occurring without RDTI support, so it is not necessary to allow R&D tax credits to encourage that expenditure. 49.The provision implementing this exclusion, however, unintentionally excludes from the RDTI some R&D expenditure that is not covered by those grants. As a result, that expenditure would not be eligible for either the government grant or the RDTI. 50.To correct this, the legislation provides some carve-outs to this exclusion. One example is Callaghan Innovation Project Grants, which are carved out from the exclusion to the extent that the business’ R&D expenditure exceeds the amount contracted for under the Project Grant. This was intended to make any unexpected R&D expenditure eligible for the RDTI, given that amount is not supported by the Project Grant contract. 51.For example, a Project Grant contract for $500,000 would require the business to spend $300,000 and the grant would provide $200,000. If the project ended up costing $900,000, then the business will have spent an extra $400,000 to complete the project but that amount would not be covered by the Project Grant contract. However, the $400,000 would be ineligible for RDTI support due to the government grants exclusion. Carving out Project Grants from that exclusion to the extent that the overall expenditure ($900,000) exceeds the Project Grant contract amount Not in scope IR2022/500 : R&D Tax Incentive: Matters for consideration Page 8 of 10 ($500,000) ensures that the additional $400,000 of R&D expenditure can still be supported by the RDTI. Carve-out from government grants exclusion for the New to R&D Grant 52.Project Grants have been phased out and New to R&D Grants have been introduced in their place. The New to R&D Grant encourages new businesses and businesses that are new to R&D to establish an R&D programme. They may then move onto the RDTI in the future. 53.The terms of the New to R&D Grant are similar to the Project Grant in that they provide for co-funding of 40% of the eligible R&D expenditure. The amount of government funding allocated to the grant is similar (approximately $22.5 million). 54.Unlike the Project Grant, which covered expenditure for particular R&D projects, the New to R&D Grant covers expenditure over two years up to a specified maximum amount. It Is also limited to businesses that have not performed a significant amount of R&D in the past and do not have R&D capabilities to begin with. 55.We have concluded that R&D expenditure incurred by a New to R&D Grant recipient beyond the maximum amount specified in a contract could be impacted by the government grants exclusion in a similar way that equivalent amounts under a Project Grant would have been if not for the carve-out. This means that some R&D expenditure that is not supported by the New to R&D Grant will be excluded from the RDTI. 56.We recommend that a carve-out to the RDTI government grants exclusion is made for the New to R&D Grant, similar to the carve-out that was made for Project Grants. R&D expenditure by businesses that receive a New to R&D Grant would be carved out from the exclusion to the extent that R&D expenditure exceeds the maximum amount covered in the New to R&D Grant contract. 57.This will ensure that R&D expenditure continues to be supported in cases where the business’ R&D expenditure during the grant period exceeds the amount that is covered by the New to R&D Grant. This will make it easier for businesses to transition to the RDTI at the conclusion of their New to R&D Grant. The carve-out does not allow an amount of R&D expenditure to be subsidised by both the New to R&D Grant and the RDTI. Fiscal implications 58.This carve-out is unlikely to have a significant impact on the cost of the RDTI because: 58.1 Only a small number of New to R&D Grant recipients are likely to exceed the maximum amount of R&D expenditure permitted within the maximum two- year period allowed under a New to R&D Grant contract; 58.2 To the extent that a recipient’s R&D expenditure does exceed the maximum amount, the excess amount (that would be covered by the exclusion) is likely to be small; and 58.3 The New to R&D Grant contract can be drafted to make clear that the grant only applies to R&D expenditure up to the maximum specified amount and does not apply to R&D expenditure incurred by the recipient in excess of that amount. 59.As the New to R&D Grant has not yet been introduced, there is no data we can use to accurately estimate the cost of this carve-out. Instead, we make the following assumptions using information currently available to provide a rough estimate: IR2022/500: R&D Tax Incentive: Matters for consideration Page 9 of 10 59.1 To receive the maximum grant amount, a recipient would have to spend between $500,000 and $1,000,000 1 on R&D over the two-year period of the grant. Callaghan Innovation is currently expected to issue approximately 100 grants per year. We assume that only one (i.e., 1% of the total) will exceed the maximum grant amount in a given year. 2 59.2 We assume that, on average, the one New to R&D Grant recipient per year whose R&D expenditure exceeds the maximum grant amount does so by $500,000. 60.Based on these assumptions, we estimate this amendment would impact $500,000 of R&D expenditure per year. With a tax credit rate of 15%, this corresponds to a fiscal impact of $75,000 per year. 61.It is important to note that baseline forecasts assumed that R&D expenditure that was not eligible for other government grants would be eligible for the RDTI (consistent with the original intent). This means that agreeing to this amendment would effectively have no fiscal impact, while not agreeing to this amendment would have a fiscal saving of $75,000 per year. Consultation 62.MBIE, Callaghan Innovation, and the Treasury have been consulted on this report. 63. 64. 65. Next steps 66. 1 The Minister of Research, Science and Innovation has set the maximum grant amount at $400,000. This means that the maximum RDTI-eligible expenditure that could be covered is $1,000,000 (given a co-funding rate of 40%). However, up to half of the grant may be used to cover R&D setup costs that are not necessarily eligible for the RDTI. 2 According to the 2021 R&D Survey results, 810 out of 2,346 R&D-performing businesses spent above $500,000 on R&D and 468 spent above $1,000,000 in the 2021 financial year. However, in almost all cases, these are well- established R&D-performing businesses. Due to the steep learning curve that the New to R&D Grant is specifically designed to alleviate, the probability of a business that qualifies for the New to R&D Grant reaching this threshold within its first two years of R&D activity is very low.

Oral hearings of evidence commenced on 9 November 2022 and are scheduled to continue on 7 and 19 December 2022. 4.Most of the recommendations in this report are in response to issues raised by submitters. Subject to your approval, we will include these recommendations in the officials’ report. 5.The items in this report relate to remedial amendments proposed in the Bill. A separate report relating to the policy proposals has been provided to the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue (IR2022/542 refers). 6.None of these proposed amendments are significant enough to require Cabinet approval. 7.None of the recommendations in this report have fiscal implications. These recommendations require approval by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the Minister of Revenue and endorsement by the Minister of Revenue. These recommendations are set out in the body of the report. 8.None of these changes give rise to any material compliance or administration costs, or any significant systems or technology implications. 9.Treasury has been consulted on this report. Next steps 10.Subject to your agreement, recommendations outlined in this report will be drafted for inclusion in the officials’ report. Subject to the FEC’s agreement, these changes would be included in the revision-tracked version of the Bill to be reported back to the House by 2 March 2023. 11.The finalised officials’ report is due to the FEC no later than 20 January 2023. We will report to you with a draft version of the officials’ report for noting in the week beginning 16 January 2023. IR2022/538; Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): remedial amendments Page 3 of 9 Background 17.The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2) is currently being considered by the Finance and Expenditure Committee (“FEC”). The officials’ report on submissions is due to the FEC no later than 20 January 2023 to enable the Committee to report back to the House by 2 March 2023. 18.Written submissions on the Bill closed on 2 November 2022. The first hearing of oral evidence was held on 9 November 2022 and subsequent hearings are scheduled for 7 and 19 December 2022. A submitter’s oral submission should align with their written submission, so we do not anticipate new issues to arise at the two remaining hearings. However, if new issues do arise, we will co-ordinate with your offices to seek your approval where appropriate. 19.Approximately 800 written submissions were received. In addition to submissions by stakeholders such as law and accounting firms, most of the submissions relate to either the proposed exemption from FBT for public transport or the proposal to require digital platforms to collect GST on certain accommodation and transport services. 20.This report sets out recommended changes that could be included in the officials’ report to the FEC. The items in this report relate to remedial amendments proposed in the Bill. A separate report relating to the policy proposals has been provided to the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue (IR2022/542 refers). 21.None of the proposed amendments in this report have a fiscal impact and require approval by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the Minister of Revenue and endorsement by the Minister of Revenue. 22.We do not consider that the recommended changes in this report require Cabinet approval. GST proposals which allow suppliers to rely on certain commercial information to determine if their customer is non-resident or GST registered 23.The Bill proposes to reduce compliance costs by allowing more businesses to use certain commercial information (proxies) to help them determine if their customer is non-resident or a GST-registered person. 24.PwC and the Corporate Taxpayers Group submitted that many suppliers may already have existing systems or processes for applying the relevant GST rules which may collect more accurate information than the proxies (such as directly asking if the customer is non-resident or a GST registered person). Accordingly, they consider that the proxies should be optional to use. 25.We agree with the submitters because this allows such suppliers to continue with their existing systems and processes, while other suppliers which would benefit from the proposed proxies can choose to use them to reduce their own compliance costs. This would not have a fiscal cost as it would either provide the affected taxpayers with the same GST outcome as the existing proposal in the Bill or allow them to continue with their current tax practices which are in the revenue baselines. Recommendation Agree that the proposed amendments in the Bill (to allow more businesses to use certain commercial information to help them determine if their customer is non- resident or a GST registered person) should be optional for these suppliers to apply. Agreed/Not agreed IR2022/538; Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): remedial amendments Page 4 of 9 Method of calculating provisional tax 26.The proposed amendment clarifies which method of standard uplift is to be used when a taxpayer files a tax return for the prior year when calculating provisional tax (i.e., either 105% or 110%). It also clarifies the position when the due date for an instalment falls on a non-working day. 27.Submissions were generally supportive of the change, although two submissions suggested that application date of the provision may retrospectively impose penalties and interest on taxpayers who have been charged with penalties and interest on a different basis. This was not intended. 28.To avoid this outcome, we propose inserting a savings clause into the application of the provision so that if a taxpayer has been charged penalties and interest on a different basis than that set out in the proposed amendment, the proposed amendment will not apply to them. 29.There are no fiscal implications to this amendment as this change does not alter the liability of a taxpayer just, potentially, the timing of payment within the year. Recommendation Agree to insert a savings provision to the proposed amendments relating to the method of calculating provisional tax to preserve the position if any taxpayer has been charged with penalties and interest on a different basis than the proposed amendments. Agreed/Not agreed Income of deceased persons 30.The proposed amendment allows taxpayers to include in their tax return to date of death any reportable income paid to the deceased person up to 28 days after their date of death to save the compliance costs of filing an estate tax return. 31.Submissions were generally supportive of the change, although one submission suggested that the scope of the provision should be extended beyond 28 days and include all types of income. Such an extension is out of scope and will need further policy work as the work programme permits. This submission will be declined but noted for potential further work. 32.After reviewing the provision, a wording change is required to the proposed amendment to make the treatment optional on the taxpayer – if they would prefer to continue filing two returns then they should be able to do that. 33.There are no fiscal implications to this amendment as this change only alters the particular form that an amount of income is returned in, not the taxation of the income. Recommendation Agree to allow taxpayers the option of returning reportable income received by the deceased person either in the taxpayer’s return to date of death or in the tax return of the estate. Agreed/Not agreed IR2022/538; Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): remedial amendments Page 5 of 9 Non-active trusts and estates 34.The proposed amendment in the Bill would ensure that trusts and estates that derive small amounts of income are not required to file a tax return and therefore not required to comply with the new trust disclosure requirements. We received several submissions on this remedial and intended to recommend the following changes below. 35.None of these changes have fiscal implications because these changes only relate to whether a taxpayer is required to file a tax return. The underlying income in that return is either already subject to withholding tax (as with reportable income) or is currently not taxable in any case (the under $200 non-reportable income exemption). Neither of these changes is likely to alter the net amount of tax paid by the trust or estate. Proposed changes Administration fees threshold 36.The proposed amendment in the Bill allows trusts or estates which have incurred less than $1,000 of administrative fees to still be considered non-active. This was an increase from the current $200. 37.One submitter suggested this should be increased to $1,500. We agree with this change as it does not materially increase the threshold but does give some additional leeway to smaller trusts to maintain their non-active status. Threshold for distributions from testamentary trusts 38.In developing the proposals for these amendments, we undertook some targeted consultation with industry representatives on the requirements for testamentary trusts and estates to be permitted not to file a tax return. During that consultation, one of the parties suggested that a limit on the distribution amount from a trust be included within the provision. 39.The proposal in the Bill reflected that suggestion and required testamentary trusts who made distributions over $100,000 to file a tax return. Some submissions on the Bill indicated that this is an onerous requirement that could include a number of trusts that are simply distributing assets from a will. 40.There is no distribution requirement for other trusts, so we recommend accepting the submission and removing the threshold for distributions from a testamentary trust from the Bill. Transactions with other parties 41.A trust cannot be considered non-active if it has been a party to transactions with assets of the trust or estate that results in income in any person’s hands or gives rise to a fringe benefit to an employee. 42.The Bill did not propose a change to this rule, however, several submitters pointed out that this rule is particularly wide and makes a number of trusts that generate no income file a tax return. 43.An example would be a trust that owns a family house but has no income. If they install a heat pump, they would have to file a return in that year because the purchase and installation of the heat pump would result in income to the installer’s hands. IR2022/538; Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): remedial amendments Page 6 of 9 44.We agree that this test is set too wide and recommend an adjustment to target the requirement at higher-risk transactions related-party transactions. 45.We propose partly agreeing with the submission and amending the test to allow taxpayers who have transactions with non-related parties to not have to file a tax return but require those trusts who have transactions with parties related to the trust to file. Submissions to be declined Reportable income threshold 46.The Bill proposes that trusts or estates that earn less than $1,000 of reportable income (essentially income with tax deducted at source) could still be considered non-active. 47.One submitter suggested this should be increased to $5,000 in line with the proposal for testamentary trusts. We consider there is a still a distinction that should be maintained between testamentary trusts and other trusts and recommend declining the submission. Recommendations Note there are no fiscal implications to these amendments Noted Agree to allow trusts and estates who incur less than $1,500 of administrative and bank charges to remain non-active or non-filing trusts. Agreed/Not agreed Agree that the threshold for reportable income for a non-filing trust that is not a testamentary trust be set at $1,000 as proposed in the Bill. Agreed/Not agreed Agree that the threshold for distributions from a testamentary trust be removed from the Bill and allow testamentary trusts to not file a tax return no matter the level of distributions from the trust. Agreed/Not agreed Agree that trusts or estates who have transactions with non-related parties which give rise to income in those parties’ hands to not have to file a tax return if they meet the other requirements not to file. Agreed/Not agreed Tax treatment of distribution networks 48.The proposals in the Bill identify utilities distribution network operators and confirm that for tax purposes their assets are the component assets of their network rather than the network themselves. 49.Two submissions considered that the drafting is overly prescriptive and were concerned it would provide less flexibility for network operators already applying a component items approach. We discussed these concerns with the submitters before the Bill was introduced. We continue to consider that this approach to be appropriate and will not lead to the concerns they have suggested. IR2022/538; Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): remedial amendments Page 7 of 9 50.To provide additional certainty, we recommend that an additional definition be added to confirm that, for the purpose of these proposals, the term “goods and services” includes electricity, telecommunications services, gas and water. 51.This change should apply from 1 April 2008 to align with the earliest application date of the proposals. 52.There is no fiscal implication associated with this change as it is only a clarification of an item that is already included in the Bill. Recommendations Agree that for the purpose of these proposals, the term “goods and services” includes electricity, telecommunications services, gas and water. Agreed/Not agreed Agree that this change should apply from 1 April 2008. Agreed/Not agreed Updating the insurance tax provisions following the adoption of IFRS 17 53.The current accounting standard, NZ IFRS 4, will be replaced by NZ IFRS 17 from 1 January 2023. General insurers will continue to use the accounting standard, while life insurers will use the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) for their Outstanding Claims Reserve (OCR) methodology. The Bill includes proposed amendments to update existing section references for insurers. 54.In response to submissions on the Bill, we recommend some minor amendments to clarify the operation of the provisions. These changes do not have any fiscal or operational implications as the remedials are clarificatory in character and do not give rise to costs. 55.In addition, you previously agreed to the inclusion of a grandparenting provision for existing spreading arrangements entered into under NZ IFRS 4 for financial life insurance (IR2022/255 refers). This grandparenting provision was not included in the Bill at introduction and we will recommend in the officials’ report that it be inserted. Treatment of the changes to the general insurance contracts outstanding claims reserve income during the year of transition 56.Currently, a transitional provision provides a rule for when a general insurance OCR is eligible for a deduction. However, there is no mirroring provision to prescribe the method to apply when an insurer receives OCR income. We recommend this be rectified and a mirroring provision be inserted. Life insurers must use the same discount rate as accounting when determining the present value of contracts for life and general insurance 57.While general insurers will use NZ IFRS 17 to determine their OCR, life insurers will continue to use the valuation method prescribed by the ITA for contracts of both life and general insurance. Life insurers will continue to use the same discount rate for calculating present value as they use in their financial statements. We recommend this be clarified. IR2022/538; Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): remedial amendments Page 8 of 9 Recommendations Agree to include an OCR income provision for general insurance contracts to mirror the OCR allowable deduction provision in the transitional year for IFRS 17. Agreed/Not agreed Agree to clarify that life insurers should continue to use the same discount rates as used in their financial statements to determine present values within the OCR for both life and general insurance. Agreed/Not agreed Agree that these should apply for the 2023–24 and later income years. Agreed/Not agreed Financial arrangements – debt equity swaps 58.The proposed amendment would apply when an insolvent company issues shares for consideration and all or part of that consideration is used to make a payment for a financial arrangement. The amendment would treat the payment as being the market value of the shares. 59.Two submitters were concerned that the proposals would increase the compliance costs for valuing shares and would be an impediment for start-ups that were experiencing financial distress from raising additional capital. We accept that these transactions may be commercially motivated, but the lender will be subscribing for shares in an insolvent issuer for an overvalue (compared with a third party that would pay very little for those shares) and would only do so where the overvalue is used to repay debt that would not otherwise be repaid. 60.We agree with a submitter that the definition of an insolvent company in the Bill can be clarified to use the solvency test in the Companies Act 1993. 61.This change should apply from the day after the date the Bill receives the Royal asset to be consistent with the underlying proposed change. 62.There are no fiscal implications associated with this change as this is only a clarification of a point that was already included in the Bill. Recommendation Agree that the test for insolvency should be based on the solvency test in the Companies Act 1993. Agreed/Not agreed Interest rate swaps held by multi-rate Portfolio Investment Entities (PIEs) 63.Submitters were supportive of the proposed amendment to allow multi-rate PIEs to elect to follow the spreading method in Determination G27 for their interest rate swaps. This determination is available under the financial arrangements rules but cannot currently be used by PIEs. 64.We agree with a submitter that a mechanism is required for an existing PIE to transition to this election. We recommend that this election apply only to swaps entered into on or after the date of the election with the previous method continuing to apply to swaps entered into before this date until they subsequently mature. IR2022/538; Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): remedial amendments Page 9 of 9 65.This change should apply from the 2023–24 income year to align with the underlying proposed change. 66.There is no fiscal implication associated with this change as all spreading methods return the correct amount of tax over the term of the arrangement and there is no way of predicting in advance which method will accelerate or decelerate tax relative to the other methods. Recommendations Agree that when a PIE chooses to apply determination G27 to its swaps this should apply only to swaps entered into on or after the date they made that choice.

Oral hearings of evidence commenced on 9 November 2022 and are scheduled to continue on 7 and 19 December 2022. 4.Most of the recommendations in this report are in response to issues raised by submitters. Subject to your approval, we will include these recommendations in the officials’ report. 5.In addition to the specific policy and remedial changes outlined in this report, we seek your approval to recommend drafting changes to the Committee where the Bill as introduced does not achieve the policy intent or where the drafting could be improved or clarified. 6.None of these proposed amendments are significant enough to require Cabinet approval. 7.One proposed change, relating to the proposal to exempt public transport from fringe benefit tax, has a fiscal cost 8.None of these changes give rise to any material compliance or administration costs, or any significant systems or technology implications. 9.Treasury has been consulted on this report. Next steps 10.Subject to your agreement, recommendations outlined in this report will be drafted for inclusion in the officials’ report. Subject to the FEC’s agreement, these changes would be included in the revision-tracked version of the Bill to be reported back to the House by 2 March 2023. 11.The finalised officials’ report is due to the FEC no later than 20 January 2023. We will report to you with a draft version of the officials’ report for noting in the week beginning 16 January 2023. IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 3 of 26 Background 16.The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2) is currently being considered by the Finance and Expenditure Committee (“FEC”). The officials’ report on submissions is due to the FEC no later than 20 January 2023 to enable the Committee to report back to the House by 2 March 2023. 17.Written submissions on the Bill closed on 2 November 2022. The first hearing of oral evidence was held on 9 November 2022 and subsequent hearings are scheduled for 7 and 19 December 2022. A submitter’s oral submission should align with their written submission, so we do not anticipate new issues to arise at the two remaining hearings. However, if new issues do arise, we will co-ordinate with your offices to seek your approval where appropriate. 18.Approximately 800 written submissions were received. In addition to submissions by stakeholders such as law and accounting firms, most of the submissions relate to either the proposed exemption from FBT for public transport or the GST platform economy proposal. 19.Around 415 submissions were received on the proposed exemption from FBT for public transport which were largely connected to a campaign launched by the Cycling Action Network in early October. Many of these submissions submit that clause 6 of Hon Julie Anne Genter’s Income Tax (Clean Transport FBT Exclusions) Amendment Bill should be adopted to exempt bicycles from FBT. The Income Tax (Clean Transport FBT Exclusions) Amendment Bill is a Member’s Bill that has not yet been drawn from the ballot. 20.310 submissions were received on the proposal to apply GST to certain types of services provided on digital platforms. Many of these were from individuals following an email from Airbnb to them encouraging them to submit against the proposal in the Bill. Most of these submitters opposed the proposal for different reasons, including being worried about the compliance costs associated with GST registration (though, we note that under the proposals in the Bill, hosts would not need to register for GST unless they were above the $60,000 registration threshold and this is the status quo) and being concerned about the impact of GST on demand for their accommodation. 21.This report sets out recommended changes that could be included in the officials’ report to the FEC. 22.Only one recommended change has a fiscal impact and requires approval by the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue. The recommendation relates to the proposed fringe benefit tax exemption for certain public transport fares. 23.None of the other proposed amendments in this report have a fiscal impact and require approval by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the Minister of Revenue and endorsement by the Minister of Revenue. 24.We do not consider that the recommended changes in this report require Cabinet approval. Fringe benefit tax exemption for certain public transport fares 25.The Bill proposes an exemption from fringe benefit tax (FBT) for public transport fares that are subsidised by an employer mainly for the purpose of their employees travelling between their home and place of work. The proposal seeks to produce a more neutral FBT outcome between two modes of transport between home and work: IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 4 of 26 •by car, with an FBT exemption currently in place for employer-provided on- premises car parks, and •by more environmentally friendly public transport, which is currently subject to FBT. 26.The proposal received more than 400 submissions, with most relating to a campaign launched by the Cycling Action Network to include bicycles. Overall, submitters supported the proposal to exempt public transport from FBT. However, one submitter pointed out that the proposal added a distortion to the tax system relative to other fringe benefits and another submitted that the proposal would be a move away from the principle that home-to-work travel is a private expense. 27.Some suggested that coverage of the “public transport” exemption should be clarified or extended to include on-demand services, transport covered by the Total Mobility Scheme, and all public transport beyond the home-to-work commute. As noted above, the majority of submitters suggested an FBT exemption for bicycles. Some also suggested additional FBT exemptions to encourage environmentally desirable behaviours, such as electric vehicles (EVs), e-scooters, ridesharing, and bike locks. 28.Several submissions suggested an equivalent exemption for employers reimbursing or paying an allowance towards their employees’ public transport fares. These would not be covered by the proposed FBT exemption but would be taxed as salary and wages under PAYE system and therefore subject to income tax. 29.Submitters considered that guidance for employers needs to be published on the boundary between fringe benefits and PAYE payments, particularly in the context of the proposed FBT exemption. We agree with this and will include guidance in the relevant Tax Information Bulletin item on the Bill following enactment. Proposed changes 30.Based on submissions, we recommend two changes to the FBT exemption proposal: •including the Total Mobility Scheme in the proposed exemption, and •confirming on-demand services are covered by the proposed exemption. Total Mobility Scheme (Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue approval required) 31.The Total Mobility Scheme is a nationwide scheme administered by regional councils and Waka Kotahi to support people who cannot use public transport all or some of the time. Total Mobility customers pay 50% of the cost of travel (for example, by shuttle with a wheelchair hoist) up to a regional cap and any additional cost that is over the regional cap. Their regional council reimburses the transport operator directly for the remaining 50% of the cost. 32.Subject to your agreement, we will recommend that employer-provided fringe benefits for travel between home and work that are part funded by the Total Mobility Scheme should be covered by the proposed FBT exemption. While the original policy intent of the exemption focused on environmental and neutrality concerns, including this situation within the exemption addresses equity concerns. It would ensure that employers are able to provide fringe benefits for transport part funded by the Total Mobility Scheme for employees with impairments without attracting FBT. 33.The impact of the proposed change is hard to quantify. There is no data available on how many Total Mobility card holders are employed and how many Total Mobility IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 5 of 26 trips are for work purposes (as the purpose of the trip does not need to be specified). 34.The proposed amendment is likely to have a very small fiscal cost. For this reason, we have estimated a nominal revenue loss of approximately $0.2 million a year, with a corresponding impact on the operating balance funded through the Tax Policy Scorecard: $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 & outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue - (0.200) (0.200) (0.200) (0.200) On-demand services 35.On-demand services are increasingly being offered by public transport providers in areas of lower demand. These public transport services are booked and service a set area, rather than having a set timetable and route. Standard public transport fares apply. 36.Based on the current wording of the provision, on-demand services may not be covered by the proposed exemption. 37.We agree with submitters that this service forms part of the public transport network. We recommend clarifying that on-demand services are included in the proposed FBT exemption, where the service is part of a public transport provider’s network and is subject to a public transport fare. Submissions to be declined Widening the proposed public transport exemption to all transport, not just commuting 38.Some submitters suggested extending the exemption to all public transport, not just commuting, would further encourage environmentally desirable behaviour. However, we think that limiting the exemption to between home and work travel would best achieve the policy objective of improving neutrality in the FBT rules. Widening the proposed exemption would increase distortions and further reduce coherence and neutrality in the tax system. Additional exemption for bicycles 39.Submitters suggested that bicycles should be exempt from FBT to increase the number of people commuting by bicycle, as this has positive effects on the environment as well as on wellbeing and health. 40.The proposed public transport FBT exemption seeks to achieve a more neutral FBT outcome between travelling to and from work by car and parking in an employer- provided car park (currently FBT exempt) and travelling by the main alternative transport for that commute (i.e., public transport). This is in line with the specific Tax Working Group recommendation. IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 6 of 26 41.New Zealand’s tax system uses a broad-base framework. This means that taxes are applied neutrally with few exemptions and subsidies, which minimises the distortion of economic activity. There is a high threshold to depart from this neutrality approach and there are few exemptions from FBT. Where exemptions are provided, the scope of the exemption is important in managing the potential distortion. The proposed FBT exemption for public transport and the existing FBT exemption for car parks share a similar focus that manages this risk. Both exemptions relate to providing access rather than funding or enabling the purchase of an underlying asset, such as a bicycle or EV. 42.Further FBT exemptions, particularly for underlying assets, would increase the distortion between the taxation of transport benefits and other fringe benefits. This would reduce the overall fairness of the tax system. While many other employer- provided benefits could also provide socially desirable outcomes, introducing additional exemptions would further reduce the coherence and neutrality of the tax system. 43.We therefore do not recommend an FBT exemption for bicycles. Equivalent income tax exemption for public transport reimbursements and allowances 44.Some submitters were concerned that the application of the proposed FBT exemption will be administratively difficult for employers, resulting in a low usage of the exemption. 45.Submitters considered that it would be more effective to provide an income tax exemption for allowances for, or reimbursements of, public transport costs to encourage environmentally friendly outcomes. Allowances and reimbursements are not covered by the proposed FBT exemption but are subject to income tax through the PAYE system. Submitters emphasised this was important given recent announcements about the new National Ticketing Solution project (to be piloted in Canterbury in 2024 and expanded to other regions by 2026) which would allow for the use of debit or credit cards and other digital payment methods on public transport. 46.The existing neutrality issue the exemption tries to address does not arise in relation to reimbursements and allowances. This is because reimbursements and allowances for both car parks and public transport costs are subject to income tax. Integrity concerns also arise for tax free allowances, which means that there are very few tax-free employer allowances in the income tax rules. Existing tax-free allowances are mostly limited to unusual work circumstances that cause additional costs, such as certain additional transport costs when there is no adequate public transport for the place of work, or short out-of-town secondments and conferences. 47.We have talked to some large public transport providers that are in the process of developing products that may address some of the administrative difficulties of providing these fringe benefits. They also stated that, while the national ticketing solution is in the initial stages of development, they understand that specific public transport ticketing solutions will be available alongside the ability to use debit, credit cards and other digital payment methods. 48.We do not recommend an equivalent income tax exemption for allowance or reimbursements relating to public transport costs.

The information reported and exchanged would relate to taxpayers’ income-earning activities on digital platforms. It is estimated to raise an additional $11 million to $22 million per annum through improved income tax collection arising from Inland Revenue having more information about taxpayers’ incomes. This would apply from the 2024 calendar year; and IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 8 of 26 •Require digital platforms to collect and return GST on supplies of short-term accommodation, ridesharing, and food and beverage delivery services. These changes are estimated to raise an additional $47 million per annum in GST revenue. This would apply from 1 April 2024. 50.We have provided the Minister of Revenue’s office with a more detailed overview of submissions on the Bill (BN2022/530 refers). Other than the change recommended below, we are not recommending any substantive or material changes to the Bill that would require Ministerial or Cabinet approval. The other changes we intend to recommend in the officials’ report will be of a technical and minor nature, focused on detailed aspects of the proposals and ensuring there is sufficient clarity and guidance available within the rules. 1 Proposed changes: recent developments at the OECD on the reporting rules 51.At the November 2022 OECD meeting, the digital platform information reporting requirements were discussed. At that meeting, the European Commission provided an update on the interaction between their rules (DAC7, which applies to digital platforms based in Europe) and the OECD’s reporting rules. 52.The European Commission confirmed that European jurisdictions would be able to exchange information with jurisdictions outside of Europe that had “partial equivalence” with DAC7. This means that New Zealand could receive information from tax authorities in Europe on income earned by New Zealand taxpayers through European-based digital platforms in relation to accommodation and personal services. 53.This also means we would no longer be required to implement the “full” reporting rules that would require digital platforms in New Zealand to report to Inland Revenue regarding income earned by non-residents operating through New Zealand platforms from the sale of goods and vehicle rentals. The downsides to not implementing the “full” reporting rules are still being considered in consultation with affected New Zealand digital platforms, but these include: •New Zealand not receiving information from foreign tax authorities about income earned by New Zealand tax residents from the sale of goods and vehicle rentals facilitated by foreign digital platforms; and •New Zealand-based digital platforms would have to report to foreign tax authorities in respect of income earned by non-residents in relation to the sale of goods and vehicle rentals (as opposed to New Zealand digital platforms instead reporting only to Inland Revenue, which would then share information with foreign tax authorities). It is possible that digital platforms would prefer to report this information to Inland Revenue for exchange purposes as it means they do not need to navigate foreign laws and processes. This is something we are exploring with them. 54.Since these implications are still being worked through, subject to your agreement, we intend to recommend to the FEC that the extended reporting rules (which covers the sale of goods and vehicle rentals) be brought into force by Order in Council at some point within the next three years (otherwise, the extended reporting rules would not be given legislative effect in New Zealand). This provides the Government with an opportunity to implement the rules if it is considered desirable, but also provides sufficient time for us to work with New Zealand-based digital platforms to determine the implications of the sale of goods reporting requirements and their preferences. 1 For example, some submitters sought additional guidance and clarity on aspects of the reporting rules and the GST proposals through further legislative amendments (for example, including definitions within the Bill instead of leaving it to supplementary guidance). IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 9 of 26 55.This decision does not have financial implications because the original decision to implement the OECD’s extended reporting rules covering the sale of goods and vehicle rentals did not affect the estimated additional revenue. The $11 million to $22 million of additional revenue was based on income earned from accommodation rental and personal services only. Submissions to be declined Implementation should be delayed 56.Submitters considered that both proposals should be delayed providing more time for affected digital platforms to consider and implement the required changes. 57.We note that the OECD’s information reporting and exchange framework is being implemented in Canada and the United Kingdom on the same timeline as is proposed for New Zealand, and in Europe from 2023. The proposed GST changes would also come into force 12 months following the expected enactment of the Bill, which is what digital platforms signalled was sufficient development time for changes of this scale. For these reasons, we do not recommend deferring implementation of either change proposed in the Bill. Submitters also said that the proposals should not be implemented in New Zealand until there was clearer evidence that this was direction being headed in by other jurisdictions. 58.We do not agree with these submissions. The information reporting and exchange framework is being implemented by approximately two-thirds of OECD members on a faster, or comparable, timeframe as is proposed in New Zealand. We consider there are strong arguments for implementing the GST changes, and do not agree that there are benefits in waiting to see what other jurisdictions decide to do in this area. Scope of the rules 59.A common concern raised by submitters is that under the reporting rules, New Zealand digital platforms would be required to report to Inland Revenue by 31 January in relation to the preceding calendar year. Submitters have suggested this date be deferred because staff will be on annual leave. 60.While we understand submitters’ concerns, the due date for this information is driven by the desire of foreign tax authorities to use the information from the exchange for pre-populating tax returns of their tax residents. Under the rules, Inland Revenue would need to share information with foreign tax authorities by the end of February. We are therefore unable to shift the 31 January platform to Inland Revenue reporting date of without compromising Inland Revenue’s ability to fulfil New Zealand’s obligations under the OECD’s rules. 61.We do, however, intend to work with affected digital platforms to provide them with additional time where practical. We also note that, as the OECD’s rules require information to be broken down into quarterly periods, 75% of the information could be collated well in advance of the 31 January reporting date. This means that digital platforms with a reporting obligation would only need to verify information for the last quarter of the calendar year before reporting by 31 January. IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 10 of 26 Recommendations Agree that the application date for implementation of the OECD’s information reporting and exchange framework for accommodation rental and personal services remains 1 January 2024. Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed Agree that the application date for the GST changes requiring digital platforms to collect GST on short-term rental accommodation, ridesharing, and food and beverage delivery services remains 1 April 2024. Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed Note that deferring the implementation date of either of these proposals would have a fiscal cost equal to the estimated additional revenue which would be foregone. Noted Noted Agree to defer implementation of the OECD’s extended reporting rules (covering the sale of goods and vehicle rentals) until such time that an Order in Council, made on recommendation of the Minister of Revenue, brings them into force. Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed If you agree to the recommendation above, agree that the extended reporting rules would not be given legislative effect in New Zealand unless brought into force by Order in Council within three years following enactment of the Bill. Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed Cross-border workers 62.The Bill contains proposals which seek to clarify and modernise the administrative aspects of the rules applying to cross-border workers and to reduce the cost of complying with New Zealand’s pay as you earn (PAYE), fringe benefit tax (FBT) and employer’s superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) and non-resident contractor tax (NRCT) rules. 63.Submitters broadly welcomed reform to the tax settings that apply to employers of cross-border employees and payers of NRCT. Submitters made helpful suggestions to improve the implementation of the policies. 64.Some submitters felt that the proposals could have gone further. One common concern raised by submitters relates to practical difficulties in obtaining an IRD number. These submitters felt that legislative change was required to simplify the process for cross-border workers and non-resident employers. We acknowledge this concern but changes to IRD number requirements are out of scope of the current project and would be better addressed through operational change or as part of wider reforms. Proposed changes 65.Two proposals attracted widespread comment: IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 11 of 26 •the proposal to introduce an NRCT reporting requirement, and •the proposal to transfer FBT and ESCT obligations to an employee where the employer does not have a sufficient presence in New Zealand to be subject to New Zealand employment-related tax obligations. NRCT reporting and the “single payer” view 66.The rationale behind the proposed reporting requirement is that it would support the proposed simplification of the NRCT withholding thresholds (the “single payer” view). Submitters were concerned that the information required was broad and likely to require manual intervention to prepare and submit reports. Further, the information requirements were out of balance to the purpose of supporting the proposed NRCT reforms or the cost of compliance. 67.Subject to your agreement, we intend to recommend in the officials’ report that proposals relating to the “single payer” view of the NRCT withholding thresholds and NRCT reporting be removed from the Bill. We consider that these proposals require further consideration and consultation before reintroduction in a future tax bill. 68.This change does not have a fiscal impact because it would be a postponement of an administrative measure that does not have a fiscal impact. Transfer of FBT and ESCT obligations to an employee 69.Submitters were concerned that FBT and ESCT are ordinarily paid by employers and the transfer of these obligations to the employee may cause the employee cashflow difficulties. In addition, the calculation of these taxes requires information that may not be readily available to the employee. 70.Conversations with submitters indicate that the most common fringe benefits received by remote employees are employer contributions to foreign superannuation schemes and the payment of insurance premiums. One submitter had seen company vehicles used by remote employees. 71.Subject to your agreement, we will recommend that a de minimis for fringe benefits be introduced for employees managing their employment-related tax obligations. We propose that the de minimis be set at $2,500 per income year. Domestic employers are entitled to a de minimis threshold of $1,200 per income year per employee for unclassified benefits (subject to conditions). The higher proposed de minimis for remote employees recognises that, in these limited circumstances, the employee bears the tax cost and compliance burden. 72.This means that an employee would not be required to report or pay tax on fringe benefits if their total taxable benefits per income year was $2,500 or less. Where fringe benefits provided exceed this amount, the benefits would be taxed in full. 73.We consider that this FBT change has no fiscal impact as the original fiscal impact was small and unquantifiable. As such, it falls within the costing of the original proposal. 74.We do not recommend a similar de minimis for employer contributions to foreign superannuation schemes. Employer contributions to foreign superannuation schemes may be a valuable element of an employee’s total remuneration. A meaningful ESCT de minimis for remote workers would not be possible without creating a significant gap between the treatment of non-resident employers (who do not have a sufficient presence in New Zealand) and their employees, and New Zealand employers and employees. IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 12 of 26 Drafting clarifications 75.We will recommend a clarification to ensure any tax due on fringe benefits is paid via PAYE at the employee’s marginal tax rate. This is necessary for the payment of the tax to be processed correctly by Inland Revenue’s systems. This will result in a small under-taxation of the benefit compared to the employer paying FBT. FBT is paid at a grossed-up tax rate (63.93% for an individual on the top income tax rate of 39%), but the employer can claim the tax paid as a deduction from its own income. This reduces the tax paid from the headline rate to an effective rate that is close to but lower than the employee’s marginal tax rate. Inland Revenue will monitor taxpayer behaviour and may recommend further policy changes if taxpayers begin to exploit this difference. 76.We will also recommend a further drafting clarification to reflect that the employer superannuation contributions to foreign schemes should be subject to ESCT. ESCT enables the contribution to be excluded income for certain purposes, such as entitlement to Working for Families. Under existing rules, an employer and employee may, in some circumstances, opt out of ESCT and choose taxation under PAYE instead. This option will be preserved as it enables employers and employees to agree the appropriate treatment for their circumstances. 77.There are no fiscals associated with these clarifications because the original fiscal impact was small and unquantifiable. As such, it falls within the costing of the original proposal. Submissions to be declined Commencement date 78.Submitters considered that all proposals which apply to employers and cross-border employees should have a consistent application date of 1 April 2023. 79.The proposals to address PAYE, FBT and ESCT integrity measures would apply from 1 April 2023. The later application date for other proposals allows time for the development of systems and guidance by Inland Revenue for employers and tax advisors. We consider that having different commencement dates for different proposals remains appropriate. Shadow payroll rule 80.The existing shadow payroll rule applies where an employee works in New Zealand but remains on the employer’s payroll system in a different jurisdiction. The rule treats the income as being derived 20 days after payment to ensure that employers of cross-border workers have sufficient time to collate and report information to Inland Revenue. The Bill proposes to rationalise the legislation by relocating the shadow payroll rule to a new section for cross-border employees. 81.Submitters suggested that the current shadow payroll rule should be changed from a deeming rule to a rule which better aligns with the employee’s actual payment date. 82.From a policy perspective, we do not oppose the submission, but it is outside the scope of the current Bill and would require significant systems changes. This would require further work and would be better suited for a future tax bill. IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 13 of 26 Annual PAYE arrangement 83.Two submitters did not support an annual payment basis for PAYE in special circumstances because of the risk of non-compliance. 84.We do not consider non-compliance to be a material risk. Employers who engage with Inland Revenue (which is required to access the annual payment basis) are more likely to be seeking to lower their compliance burden than to avoid their tax obligations. Payroll subsidies 85.Two submitters thought that the Government should reinstate payroll subsidies considering the proposals to transfer FBT and ESCT obligations to an employee who manages their own employment taxes. 86.We do not recommend the reintroduction of payroll subsidies. We do not provide them for other taxpayers, and we do not consider it appropriate to make an exception for cross border workers as it would undermine the coherence of the tax system. Longer period for retroactive NRCT exemptions 87.The Bill proposes a period of 92 days for retroactive NRCT exemptions. We do not support extending this period as this may reduce the incentive to apply for an exemption or conflate the exemption with a reclaim of overpaid tax via a tax return. We think that 92 days is sufficient to enable a contractor to obtain an exemption on a timely basis which covers the relevant contract payments. Exemption from NRCT withholding for GST-registered persons 88.GST-registered non-resident contractors are already able to obtain an NRCT withholding exemption. Exemptions are available based on a good compliance history. GST registration is only part of that picture. Further, GST registration is not indicative of tax residence or presence in New Zealand. They may be registered for GST to claim input tax. This does not signify the kind of connection with the New Zealand tax system required to reduce the integrity risk which NRCT seeks to address. Recommendations Agree to remove the “single payer” view and the non-resident contractor’s tax reporting requirement from the current Bill for further consultation. Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed Agree to include a $2,500 de minimis where an employee is responsible for paying fringe benefit tax. Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed Agree to Inland Revenue officials informing affected submitters of these changes to minimise impacts on stakeholders’ systems and processes. Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 14 of 26 GST apportionment and adjustment rules 89.The Bill proposes a package of changes to the GST apportionment and adjustment rules to reduce the compliance costs they impose on businesses and better align them with current taxpayer practices. These changes include: •introducing a principal purpose test for goods and services acquired for $10,000 or less (GST exclusive) that would allow a registered person to claim a full GST input tax deduction for taxable use instead of applying the apportionment rules, and •allowing GST-registered persons to elect to treat certain assets that have mainly private or exempt use, such as dwellings, as if they only had private or exempt use. 90.Submissions supported the GST apportionment proposals and suggested some small changes to make the proposals easier for the affected taxpayers to comply with. Proposed changes 91.We intend to recommend that the FEC accept most, but not all, of the changes suggested by submitters. The main submissions we agree with are described below. None of these submissions would have a fiscal cost as they either provide the affected taxpayers with the same GST outcome as the existing proposal in the Bill or allow them to continue with their current tax practices which are in the revenue baselines. 92.Other suggested changes that we do not support were because they would undermine the policy intent, may not be effective at reducing overall compliance costs, or could have a fiscal cost. Principal purpose test: optionality for GST registered persons 93.Deloitte and PwC submitted that the proposed principal purpose test for goods and services acquired for $10,000 or less should be optional for GST-registered persons. We agree that this could reduce compliance costs for some businesses, as it would mean they would not need to apply a different method for goods or services depending on whether they were acquired for $10,000 or less. However, as most businesses will face lower compliance costs under the proposed principal purpose test, we expect that few businesses would be likely to opt out in practice. To prevent “cherry picking,” we recommend that the registered person (or GST group if relevant) would be required to “opt out” of applying the principal purpose test for all goods or services they acquire for $10,000 or less for a minimum period such as 24 months. Private use election: change from exempt to non-taxable supplies 94.The Bill proposes some new rules which would allow GST-registered persons to elect to treat certain assets that have mainly private or exempt use, such as dwellings, as if they only had private or exempt use. The current Bill provisions would achieve this by making the sale of these assets an exempt supply. Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand submitted it would be better to make the sale of the assets a non-taxable supply. 95.We agree this would be more intuitive (as goods used for private purposes are generally non-taxable supplies) and could prevent some unintended complexity (as other rules can apply when a person makes exempt supplies). IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 15 of 26 Use of agreed apportionment methods 96.The Goods and Services Act 1985 (GST Act) allows registered persons or industry associations to apply to the Commissioner to agree an apportionment method as an alternative to applying the general apportionment rules. The scope of these alternative methods is being widened in the Bill. Deloitte submitted that registered persons should be able to adopt an alternative apportionment method that Inland Revenue have published (if it is appropriate for the registered person’s situation). 97.We agree that providing an ability for the Commissioner to publish acceptable methods could reduce compliance costs as the affected persons would not have to develop and agree their own bespoke methods with the Commissioner. 98.We also agree with a submission from KPMG that businesses that are members of an industry association which has agreed an alternative apportionment method with Inland Revenue should be able to choose whether they either apply the method agreed by the industry association or the general apportionment rules. Recommendations Agree that the proposed principal purpose test for goods and services acquired for $10,000 or less should be optional for GST-registered persons to use. Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed Agree that the proposal to allow GST-registered persons to treat certain assets that have mainly private or exempt use as an exempt supply when sold, should be amended to make the sale of these assets a non-taxable supply instead. Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed Agree to expand the existing ability whereby registered persons or industry associations can apply to the Commissioner to agree an apportionment method, so the Commissioner can also publish acceptable methods that the relevant registered persons can then choose to use. Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed Agree that businesses that are members of an industry association which has agreed an alternative apportionment method with Inland Revenue should be able to choose whether they either apply the method agreed by the industry association or the general apportionment rules. Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed Build-to-rent exclusion from interest limitation 99.The Bill proposes to exempt large-scale “build-to-rent” assets from the interest limitation rules for residential investment properties in perpetuity. The Bill defines this new asset class as 20 or more dwellings in a single development. Tenants must also be offered a 10-year tenancy under the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (RTA) with the ability for the tenant to exit the lease with 56 days’ notice and personalisation policies that set out the alterations a tenant can make under the RTA. 100.Feedback on the build-to-rent exclusion has generally supported the introduction of a defined asset class and in-perpetuity exclusion from the interest limitation rules for build-to-rent developments. Submitters who did not favour the policy were concerned that it was unfair to give tax breaks to large wealthy investors, and not to small-scale developers or landlords who were still increasing housing supply. IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 16 of 26 101.Submitters requested clarification on some aspects of the policy, for example, what the term ‘contiguous land’ covered, what was required in a personalisation policy, and whether the term ‘single ownership’ allowed for business structures such as joint ventures and limited partnerships. 102.In addition to the proposed changes outlined below, Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga has reported separately to the Minister of Housing regarding an issue with the RTA. The RTA does not explicitly permit landlords to offer fixed term tenancies that can be terminated with 56 days’ notice. An amendment to the RTA is required to ensure the build-to-rent exclusion operates as intended. Subject to the Minister of Housing’s agreement, this will be raised as a matter raised by officials in the officials’ report. A copy of that report will be referred to the Minister of Revenue. Proposed changes Information sharing between Inland Revenue and Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga 103.A register of assets is required to be set up and maintained by Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga to enable Inland Revenue to correctly apply the exclusion to eligible taxpayers. Setting up and maintaining the register requires taxpayer information to be shared between Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga and Inland Revenue. This would include: •a reactive information share where Inland Revenue requests information from Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga for auditing purposes, and •a proactive information share from Inland Revenue to inform Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga that an asset no longer meets the build-to-rent requirements and should be removed from the register. 104.Information would only be shared if it is necessary for the administration of the build-to-rent exclusion from interest limitation. 105.We recommend inserting a disclosure provision into the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow Inland Revenue to share the necessary information with Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga. This provision would apply from 1 April 2023. 106.The proposed change has no impact on the costing of the policy as it simply allows for the sharing of information between Inland Revenue and Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga. Other minor changes 107.Following submissions on the Bill, we will recommend to the FEC minor technical amendments to ensure the language better reflects the original intent of the policy. For example, some submitters raised the concern that the term ‘contiguous land’ applied too narrowly and would bar certain build-to-rent configurations (such as mixed tenure developments that also contain owner-occupied dwellings) from qualifying. We agree that the term ‘contiguous land’ is not consistent with the policy intent and recommend that a project-based requirement should be used instead. Submissions to be declined No 20-unit dwelling requirement 108.Several submitters considered that the proposed exclusion should be available to anyone increasing housing supply and the requirement for the development to consist of at least 20 dwellings should be removed. IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 17 of 26 109.We do not agree with this submission as the intent of the proposal to encourage the development of new housing supply at scale. The minimum requirement was chosen to reflect both the international standards for build-to-rent, and the New Zealand context. Small-scale investors who contribute to new housing supply already benefit from the 20-year new build exemption from interest limitation, and the five-year new build bright-line test. Application of 20-dwelling requirement to all properties owned by a person 110.Other submitters considered that the 20-dwelling requirement should not be restricted to properties in one location. Instead, submitters suggested that as long as the person owns at least 20 properties in any location, the requirement should be satisfied. 111.The exemption targets build-to-rent accommodation which is a specific model of housing that delivers quality rental housing at pace and scale in a given location, rather than having a wider application to accommodation generally. Build-to-rent also provides tenant benefits that are associated with the configuration of the development including professional asset and tenancy management, shared amenities and increased sense of community generated by medium-high density housing. 112.We do not consider it appropriate to extend the proposed exemption to a landlord who simply owns 20 dwellings around New Zealand as it would not be in line with the goal of build-to-rent to provide cohesively managed developments that encourage a sense of community. Removal of the requirement to offer personalisation policies 113.Submitters consider that the requirement to offer personalisation policies should be removed because the protections are already afforded under the RTA, and it would create confusion and lead disputes between tenants and landlords. Many submitters were also unclear on what a personalisation policy had to allow, and whether they could require a tenant to rectify or “make good” any alterations at the end of the tenancy. 114.The requirement for landlords to offer personalisation policies to tenants is intended to ensure that tenants are aware of their right to make certain alterations as set out under the RTA. This will likely mitigate the likelihood of disputes between landlords and tenants. 115.The level of personalisation set out in the policy can, but does not have to, go beyond what is already afforded under the RTA. It does not prohibit the use of “make good” penalties. We will propose minor drafting changes to clarify these points. Removal of “same person” requirement 116.Some submitters considered the requirement that the development be owned by a single owner should be removed as it is not necessary given the other build-to-rent requirements (such as the requirement for 20 dwellings to be on contiguous land). 117.This requirement ensures that assets accessing the build-to-rent exclusion are cohesive developments. 118.Some submitters were also concerned that the current drafting would exclude joint ventures and limited partnerships. The term is not intended to exclude joint ventures or limited partnerships. IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 18 of 26 Use of other policy tools to encourage build-to-rent developments 119.Submitters in the build-to-rent industry suggested that other policy tools should be used to encourage build-to-rent developments. Examples included the reinstatement of depreciation deductions, an exclusion from the bright-lines rules, or changes to the Overseas Investment Act 2005. 120.We recommend these submissions be declined for reason of being outside the scope of the Bill. Recommendations Agree to amend the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow Inland Revenue to share build-to-rent provider information with Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga. Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 19 of 26 Dual-resident companies (Minister of Revenue only) 121.The recommendations in this section do not require approval by the Minister of Finance. 122.The Bill contains proposals that: •Amend the loss grouping, consolidation, and imputation credit account (ICA) rules to ensure New Zealand resident companies can continue to access certain beneficial tax regimes that are not ordinarily available to dual- resident companies, and •Amend the domestic dividend exemption and corporate migration rules to ensure companies within a wholly-owned group can no longer shift income out of New Zealand without the anticipated New Zealand income tax by changing their tax residence and obtaining relief from taxation under a double tax agreement (DTA). 123.Submitters welcomed the amendments to the loss grouping, consolidation, and ICA rules. Several submitters suggested the ICA amendments should be extended beyond Australia. However, this would be a significant change to the overall imputation credit regime and would require substantial further policy analysis. 124.Submitters raised several concerns with the integrity proposals, mainly focused on the risk of overreach of the rules for taxpayers that may inadvertently change their residence under a DTA but continue to pay tax as if they were New Zealand DTA resident. Submitters suggested changes that would reduce the risk of overreach and compliance costs, while still ensuring that aggressive tax planning arrangements are prevented. Proposed changes 125.Both the dividend integrity and corporate migration integrity proposals received extensive comments from submitters. 126.Submitters were concerned that the dividend integrity proposal would impose additional compliance costs. The proposal may result in companies conducting tax residence checks when a dividend is paid between members of the same wholly- owned group to determine whether the recipient is potentially a dual-resident company. Where a dividend has not been on-paid by a dual-resident company to a non-resident, and where New Zealand has not lost its taxing rights or non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) has been assessed, then these dividends should not be subject to the proposed dividend integrity rules. 127.Submitters were also concerned that the corporate migration proposals will impose significant risk on some companies inadvertently falling into the integrity rules. This would result in the company being liable for income tax based on a deemed liquidation. This would be the case even where the company has not deliberately sought to undermine the integrity of the New Zealand tax base. For many companies, this tax liability may be significant. Consequently, in response to this risk, many companies would incur additional compliance costs, including making permanent changes to their corporate structure (for example, using a branch structure). 128.In response to these concerns, we propose several changes to the proposals. The proposed changes would have the same application date as the underlying integrity proposals (30 August 2022). There is no change to the fiscal costing associated with the recommended changes to the proposals. This is because the initial fiscal costing had a nominal annual benefit (about $200k per annum) and the recommended changes would still capture the arrangements that give rise to integrity concerns. IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 20 of 26 Dividend integrity Exclusion of dividends paid to companies that are dual resident in Australia and New Zealand 129.We recommend the dividend integrity rules should exclude dividends paid to companies that are dual resident in Australia and New Zealand. We believe this will reduce the compliance costs for many companies, while ensuring the integrity rules achieve their intended purpose. This is because New Zealand retains its taxing rights under the Australia/New Zealand DTA on New Zealand sourced dividends paid by dual resident companies whose residence tie-breaks to Australia, so the risk to the New Zealand tax base is minimal. On-payment of fully-imputed dividends 130.Where a dividend has been on-paid by a DTA non-resident company to a non- resident company, to the extent the dividend is fully imputed (that is, imputation credits attached to the dividend), it does not pose any integrity risk because company income tax has been paid. We recommend that fully-imputed dividends paid by a DTA non-resident company should be excluded from the proposed integrity rules. Retrospective imputation credit attachment 131.Under the existing proposal, dividends paid to a DTA non-resident company that are fully imputed are excluded from the proposed dividend integrity rules. This is because New Zealand income tax has effectively already been paid on this income at the company level. There is a concern that some companies may pay an unimputed dividend believing they are a New Zealand resident company, whereas it is later found the taxpayer was actually DTA non-resident and the dividend is subject to NRWT. 132.In this situation, we recommend that the company should be able to retrospectively impute the dividend, provided sufficient imputation credits were available at the time the dividend was paid. There is legislative precedent for allowing retrospective attachment of imputation credits. Reinstatement of New Zealand residence where dividends have not been on paid 133.The proposed changes allow for the NRWT liability to be eliminated if the dividend recipient is treated as New Zealand resident under the relevant DTA within a two- year period of the dividend payment, assuming the recipient has not paid a dividend to its shareholders. However, if the recipient has only on-paid a portion of the dividend it received and then becomes resident in New Zealand under the DTA, New Zealand would have taxing rights on any future dividend payments by the company. 134.For this reason, we suggest a change to the proposals so that that NRWT is only imposed on the payer to the extent the DTA non-resident company pays a dividend while it is DTA non-resident. Corporate migration Limit application of corporate migration integrity rules 135.Several submitters have suggested that the scope of the integrity rules should be narrowed so they only apply in circumstances where the company is aware they are IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 21 of 26 DTA non-resident. Based on these submissions, we recommend that the integrity rules should apply at the earlier of either: •The company files a return claiming relief under a DTA on the basis it is DTA non-resident; and •Two years after the company has received a competent authority determination it is DTA non-resident, and it has not reverted their tax residence back to New Zealand for the purposes of the relevant DTA. 136.While this approach would be a substantial shift away from what is currently proposed, we believe there is merit in the approach suggested by submitters. It would ensure that significant consequences from the corporate migration rules will not apply to inadvertent residence changes but integrity risks will still be addressed. Retrospective attachment of imputation credits to deemed dividends 137.Any tax resulting under the proposed rules from a DTA residence migration should be the same as under the current domestic law for a formal corporate residence migration. We believe a taxpayer should be able to retrospectively attach imputation credits against a deemed dividend arising from the application of the proposed DTA corporate migration rules, provided imputation credits were available at the time the dividend was paid. The existing corporate migration rules already allow for retrospective imputation credit attachment, so this would be an extension of that approach. Submissions to be declined Extension of imputation credit changes beyond Australia 138.Some submitters suggested that the ICA changes should be extended beyond Australia. The rationale for the ICA changes being limited to Australia is because Australian-resident companies can already elect to maintain an ICA (known as an Australian ICA company). The proposed amendments allow a New Zealand resident company to automatically carry over its accumulated imputation credits at the point of becoming Australian tax resident, rather than having to make an election. This will prevent the forfeiture of a company’s ICA balance if it inadvertently becomes Australian tax resident and has not made an election to be an Australian ICA company. 139.Our view is that expanding the imputation credit regime beyond what was proposed would be a significant change to the overall imputation credit regime and would require substantial further policy analysis. Income tax treatment of dual-resident look-through companies 140.One stakeholder was concerned that the existing criteria for New Zealand look- through companies excludes dual-resident companies – including New Zealand companies that have inadvertently become dual resident in Australia. This submission is out of the scope of the proposals in the Bill. 141.Our view is that the issue will be resolved if, as expected, Australia enacts legislation with retrospective effect to revert to the prior corporate tax residence interpretation. If Australia does not achieve this, then we will consider whether the criteria for look-through companies requires amendment. Two-year grace period for the dividend integrity proposal IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 22 of 26 142.The proposed two-year grace period provides time for the company to undertake due diligence to determine its tax residence if there is some doubt about the tax residence of the dividend recipient. Submitters suggested a number of changes to the two-year grace period for the dividend integrity proposals, including that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue should have the discretion to extend the period, that the period should begin following a competent authority residence decision (rather than the payment of the dividend), and that the integrity rule should only apply if the dividend is then on-paid within two years following a competent authority residence decision. 143.We do not agree with these submissions. 144.Given the company will be aware of relevant dividend transaction and has control when the dividend will be paid, we do not consider it necessary to extend the period. 145.We believe the two-year period should commence at the time the dividend is paid, which is a clear transaction at which time an assessment can made of the tax residence of the recipient company. There is no guarantee the payer of the dividend will subsequently be informed that the recipient is DTA non-resident, especially if the respective companies are no longer commonly owned. In most circumstances, the recipient company will have up to two years to revert to New Zealand tax residence under a DTA before the integrity rules will apply and NRWT must be paid. 146.Providing a two-year period to change a company’s residence only after a competent authority residence determination has been provided would significantly increase the period from which the dividend is paid to any potential NRWT liability is due. This is undesirable and would give rise to additional risks (e.g., that the payer may not be informed of the residence determination, the payer may no longer have the capacity to meet the NRWT obligation). Recommendations (Minister of Revenue only) Agree to amend the dividend exemption integrity proposal by excluding dividends paid to companies that are dual resident in Australia and New Zealand. Agreed/Not agreed Agree to allow imputation credits to be retrospectively attached to dividends where the proposed changes to the domestic dividend exemption or corporate migration rules apply. Agreed/Not agreed Agree that where a recipient of dividends reinstates its New Zealand residence under the relevant DTA within the two-year grace period, the dividend integrity proposal should apply only to the extent of the amount of non-fully imputed dividends paid by that company while it was DTA non-resident. Agreed/Not agreed Agree to amend the corporate migration integrity proposals so they only apply at the earlier of a DTA non-resident company claiming tax relief under a DTA in a return, or once two years have passed since the company received a competent authority determination that it is DTA non-resident, and it has not become New Zealand resident for the purposes of the relevant DTA. Agreed/Not agreed Agree the recommendations above apply from 30 August 2022, in line with the application date for the integrity measures in the Bill. Agreed/Not agreed IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 23 of 26 Housing: remedial amendments (Minister of Revenue only) 147.The recommendations in this section do not require approval by the Minister of Finance. 148.The Bill proposes remedial amendments to the rollover relief provisions introduced in the previous omnibus bill for the bright-line test and interest limitation rules. Submitters were generally supportive of the proposed amendments, although a few submitters commented that the legislative drafting could be made clearer and suggested refinements. 149.Several commented on the application date (being date of enactment of the Bill) and stated that the amendments should be retrospective to 27 March 2021, with application for the purposes of the bright-line test to transfers occurring on or after 1 April 2022. We note that most of the amendments were intended to apply retrospectively, which the Minister of Revenue agreed to in July 2022 (IR2022/293 refers). We intend to recommend the submissions be accepted except where a specific amendment is intended to apply prospectively because it would be a change in policy. Proposed changes in response to submissions 150.Based on submissions, we propose the changes below to the rollover relief amendments in the Bill. 151.The changes recommended to the rollover relief and changes in co-ownership provisions do not have any fiscal implications as they are mere clarifications of the policy intent or, in the case of our suggested amendment at paragraph 159, would ensure that an existing proposal in the Bill works as intended. Permissible charitable beneficiaries 152.Submitters suggested that for discretionary family trusts, the class of permissible charitable beneficiaries should be expanded. 153.At present, permissible charitable beneficiaries are limited to charities registered under the Charities Act 2005. However, most discretionary trusts in New Zealand (many of which are family trusts) have a standard clause in their trust deeds that defines a charitable/non-profit beneficiary class very broadly, beyond entities registered under the Charites Act 2005. As a result, transfers to or from these discretionary trusts are never eligible for rollover relief, which was not intended. 154.We recommend amending the definition of ‘close family beneficiary’ to include the types of organisations listed in the standard discretionary trust clause. 2 155.We consider the potential integrity risk to be low as rollover relief does not apply to distributions to beneficiaries. This means that if residential land is transferred to a beneficiary, then the transfer would be subject to the bright-line test if relevant. 156.However, we do recommend inserting a criterion that there is at least one natural person beneficiary (other than the principal settlor, if there is just one principal settlor) who is a close family associate of the principal settlor. This would limit the amendment’s scope to discretionary trusts that are family trusts and thus avoid 2 The standard clause includes within the beneficiary class any association, club, institution, society, organisation or trust not carried on for the private profit of any person whose funds are to be applied wholly or principally to any civic, community, charitable, philanthropic, religious, benevolent or cultural purpose, whether within New Zealand or elsewhere. IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 24 of 26 making the rules inappropriately broad in their application. We recommend an effective date of 27 March 2021. Relevant bright-line test settings for recipient 157.Submitters suggested that clarification is needed to ensure that when rollover relief applies to a transfer, the recipient is subject to the same bright-line settings or bright-line test length as the original transferor. Amendments in the Bill would address most of these situations, but there are two examples that submitters have raised that are not currently addressed by the Bill. This includes when inherited property is transferred by a settlor of a family trust to the trust. Inherited property is exempt from the bright-line test, but at present the trustee in this situation would be taxed under the bright-line test on a subsequent transfer of the property if it occurs within 10 years of the date it was inherited by the settlor. An effective date of 27 March 2021 is recommended for this change. Proposed changes: matters raised by officials 158.The Minister of Revenue previously agreed that the rollover relief provision applying to a transfer of residential property from an eligible family trust to a settlor of the trust should be clarified to ensure that rollover relief applies in the situation where a settlor previously made cash settlements on the trust or guaranteed its obligations to enable it to acquire the property (IR2022/293 refers). 159.Subject to your agreement, we will also recommend further amendments so that the proposed new rule would only apply in limited circumstances when the settlor receiving the property from the trust was not the original owner of the property. This is in line with the purpose of the amendment. If the settlor was the original owner of the property, then the pre-existing rule for transfers to settlors would apply to determine whether the transfer qualifies for rollover relief. We recommend this change apply from the date of enactment. 160.We also propose further drafting changes to clarify the provisions that apply to changes in co-ownership of residential property. While submitters did not submit on the proposed amendments to these provisions, we have had some discussion with stakeholders about remaining errors and ambiguities in these provisions that ought to be fixed. This includes making these changes retrospective to 1 October 2015, the date the original two-year bright-line test applied from. Submissions to be declined A rollover relief provision providing for transfers between spouses, civil union, and de facto partners 161.The law provides rollover relief when residential property is transferred on a settlement of relationship property. There is nothing that requires the transaction to occur as part of a separation or relationship breakup, so the law already applies broadly. We do not consider there to be a convincing case for having rollover relief apply in situations where, for example, a person transfers a 50 percent interest in their property to their new partner without there being a formal relationship agreement providing for this. Look-through companies (LTCs) and partnerships 162.Several submitters commented on the application of the rollover reliefs for LTCs and partnerships. They suggested that rollover relief should be available for: IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 25 of 26 •transfers of shares in a land-rich LTC from an individual to a family trust, •transfers of residential property to partners/LTC owners on the dissolution of the partnership or liquidation of the LTC, and •extending rollover relief to deemed transfers arising on the cessation of an LTC. 163.The intent of the rollover relief rules is to provide rollover relief for the most common and straightforward ownership change scenarios where economic ownership of residential property is unchanged. 164.The rollover relief rules explicitly prevent relief from applying for the transfer of shares in a land-rich LTC to a trust. This provision was added out of concern that providing rollover relief might incentivise holding assets in a trust structure, which could lead to unintended outcomes and raise integrity concerns. 165.The partnership and LTC rules have specific rules concerning the transfer of assets upon the dissolution of the partnership, or liquidation or cessation of an LTC and provide that these are treated as disposals occurring at market value. These rules have wider application than just the bright-line rules and apply to assets other than residential property. As such, there is a clear policy intention for these events to trigger a taxable event with the amount of tax calculated on the market value of the property. The purpose is to ensure there is not a permanent avoidance of tax on partnership or LTC assets held on revenue account. 166.Submitters consider the rollover relief rules should address the issue of latent tax liabilities for dual-resident LTCs that, following a change in interpretation by the Australian Tax Office, have ceased to meet the definition of LTC because they are now treated as not resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the Australia—New Zealand DTA. We note that the previous Australian Government announced in 2020 that remedial changes would be made to Australia’s corporate tax residence test with retrospective application. The problem the submitter has raised would be resolved if the announced changes proceed. Residential property transfers between mirror trusts or to a newly resettled unified trust 167.Mirror trusts, while not commonly used today, were common in the 1990s and early 2000s. According to the submitter, there are many mirror trusts still in existence. A typical structure was for one spouse to settle a trust with the other spouse and their children as beneficiaries, and for the second spouse to also settle a trust of their own with the first spouse and the children as beneficiaries. The first spouse would not be a beneficiary of their own trust, and likewise, the second spouse would also not be a beneficiary of the trust they settled for the benefit of the first spouse and the children. 168.The issue is that, in their current form, the rollover relief provisions do not apply when a property is transferred from one mirror trust to the other, as may occur when one settlor dies. While we consider there is a case for providing rollover relief in this scenario, given the complexities in drafting a rule that does not give rise to an integrity risk and the amount of time available, we think it would be better to consider this issue further with a view to including any resulting amendment in the next tax bill, rather than make a change to this Bill at the Select Committee stage. Recommendations (Minister of Revenue only) Agree to expand the class of permissible charitable beneficiaries for a discretionary family trust for the purpose of the rollover relief provisions to include the types of organisations listed in the standard discretionary trust clause. IR2022/542: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): policy items Page 26 of 26 Agreed/Not agreed Agree that rollover relief should only apply for a transfer to or from a family trust if there is at least one natural person beneficiary, other than the principal settlor, who is a close family associate of the principal settlor. Agreed/Not agreed Agree to remedial changes to ensure that, when rollover relief applies to a transfer of residential property, the recipient is subject to the same bright-line settings or bright-line test length as the transferor in all instances. Agreed/Not agreed Agree that the proposal expanding the circumstances in which rollover relief applies to a transfer from a family trust to a settlor should only apply when the settlor receiving the residential property from the trust is not the original owner of the property. Agreed/Not agreed Agree to further clarify the legislative provisions applying to changes in co- ownership of residential property.

Most of the submissions related to a public campaign by the Cycling Action Network to exempt bicycles from FBT (approximately 415 submissions), and the proposal to apply GST to certain types of services provided on digital platforms (310 submissions). 3.We previously reported to Ministers in November and December 2022 regarding our proposed recommendations to be included in the officials’ report \[IR2022/488, IR2022/538 and IR2022/542 refer\]. These decisions are reflected in the attached draft officials’ report. Further issues Imputation credit account returns for members of consolidated imputation groups 4.In IR2022/488, the Minister of Revenue approved a change relating to the filing of imputation credit account (ICA) returns for members of a consolidated imputation group. This clarified that where a member’s ICA had a nil balance at all times during the tax year, they were not required to file an ICA return. This was to reduce the compliance costs of filing nil ICA returns for taxpayers. 5.However, an incorrect application date was included in that recommendation. The Minister approved an application date of 2021–22 imputation year, however, we have been advised the issue also arises for the 2020–21 imputation year. 6.We propose to change that application date which will ensure that members of consolidated imputation groups who have not filed nil ICA returns will not be Document 6 Page 2 of 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] policed for those returns. This will provide more certainty to the affected taxpayers and has no fiscal cost. Interest limitation: exemption for build-to-rent assets 7.The Bill proposes an in-perpetuity exemption for “build-to-rent” developments from the interest limitation rules. The exemption would be administered by Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga - the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 8.Inconsistencies between the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (RTA) and the proposed provision were raised by submitters. In August 2022, Cabinet agreed to a draft definition for build-to-rent \[DEV-22-MIN-0163 refers\]. A s part of this definition, build-to-rent providers must offer tenants a 10-year fixed term tenancy with the ability for tenants to terminate the tenancy with 56 days’ notice. It has become apparent that the 56-day notice period is inconsistent with the RTA, as a fixed term tenancy cannot include a tenancy that is terminable by notice. In HUD2022-001095, the Minister of Housing approved a consequential amendment to the RTA to align the definition of a fixed-term tenancy with the build-to-rent tenancy requirement. 9.For Inland Revenue to apply the exclusion, it is necessary for information to be shared between Inland Revenue and HUD. In IR2022/542, the Minister approved a consequential amendment to the Tax Administration Act 1994 to insert a disclosure provision to allow for this. Consultation with Treasury 10.Treasury was informed about this briefing note. Next steps 11.HUD has requested that you provide a copy of the draft officials’ report to the Minister of Housing’s office. 12.The finalised report is due to the Committee no later than 2pm, 20 January 2023. This will allow the Bill to be progressed in line with the FEC’s current timetable. The Finance and Expenditure Committee’s report to the House and the revision-tracked version of the Bill are due by 2 March 2023. 13.As the Bill sets the annual income tax rates for 2022–23, the remaining Parliamentary stages should be completed by 31 March 2023. We will liaise with the relevant offices regarding speeches for the remaining stages and a flight plan for the Committee of the whole House debate.

The recommended legislative amendments would provide relief in response to the recent North Island flood events. 2.These amendments provide relief from income tax and fringe benefit tax for cash and benefits provided by employers to employees who have been adversely affected by the North Island flood events, as well as those employees who relocate to the affected areas to assist with the rebuild and recovery. 3.We recommend that the SOP also includes several minor technical amendments to existing measures in the Bill, which are all consistent with the policy intent. 4.We also recommend extending the final date for eligibility for the Cost of Living payment to ensure that individuals do not miss out on the payment because their ability to file their tax return has been impacted by the North Island flooding events. Supplementary Order Paper items that require Cabinet approval 5.In response to the recent North Island flooding events, we recommend including legislative amendments in the Bill to provide relief for employees who relocate to the affected areas to assist with the rebuild and recovery, and exemptions from income tax and fringe benefit tax (FBT) for cash and benefits provided by employers to employees who have been adversely affected by the flooding events. 6.The proposed tax relief provisions will apply to a “North Island flood event” which essentially covers the geographical districts and regions that were affected by: 6.1 Cyclone Hale, which crossed the North Island of New Zealand during the period starting on 8 January 2023 and ending on 12 January 2023; 6.2 the heavy rainfall starting on 26 January and ending on 3 February 2023; and 6.3 Cyclone Gabrielle, which crossed the North Island of New Zealand during the period starting on 12 February 2023 and ending on 16 February 2023. Tax relief for accommodation expenditure for employees working on limited duration projects 7.To remove some of the adverse impacts of employees relocating to assist in the Christchurch rebuild project, the Government provided tax relief in respect of accommodation provided to employees where their employment duties required them to work on a limited duration project relating to the rebuilding or recovery. This included the repair and reconstruction of land, infrastructure, and other property in greater Christchurch as a result of the Canterbury earthquakes. IR2023/077: Suppementary Order Paper: North Island floods Page 2 of 7 8.This extended the standard period that accommodation could be provided to employees who were working on limited duration projects from three years to up to five years depending on when the employee relocated. It was limited to relocations to a workplace in the greater Christchurch region. 9.We consider it appropriate to replicate this provision for the regions affected by the North Island flood events to remove a tax barrier to employers relocating staff to assist in the rebuilding and recovery of those areas. 10.We recommend that the definition of limited duration project be extended for an initial period of five years where the employee relocates to an area affected by a North Island flood event within six months after the first event. 11.However, given the unknown duration that a rebuild programme may take in the affected areas, we also recommend providing for an ability for the Minister of Revenue to extend or modify that period by Order in Council. This will add flexibility to the relief as work commences and more accurate assessments of the duration of the rebuild can be made. Tax relief for employers’ welfare contributions and accommodation provided to employees 12.Under existing tax law (with a few limited exclusions), payments made from an employer to an employee are taxable as monetary remuneration. 13.Following the major Christchurch earthquakes in 2010–11, a number of employers made ex-gratia welfare contributions of cash to their earthquake-affected employees. A legislative provision was inserted to provide that income (which could include accommodation benefits) derived by an employee from an employer was exempt income if: 13.1 it was provided by the employer for the purpose of relief of employees from the adverse effects of the Canterbury earthquakes; 13.2 it would have otherwise been taxable income; 13.3 it was derived in the eight weeks after each of the two earthquakes; 13.4 it was not paid in substitution for salary or wages; 13.5 the amount provided did not depend on the seniority of the employee; 13.6 the employee was associated with the employer, then the payment was also available to an unrelated full-time employee; and 13.7 the employer elected to treat the income as being exempt income of the employee. 14.This exemption covered most accommodation benefits and, in relation to each of the two major earthquakes, the first $3,200 paid to each employee (other than accommodation benefits). 1 15.We recommend this provision be updated and enacted with reference to the North Island flood events. We recommend the amount of $3,200 be increased to account for inflation and the scale of the damage in the North Island flood events. 16.Adding pure wage inflation since 2011 would bring the amount to $4,731 but we recommend rounding this to $5,000. We also recommend that the time-limited 1 This allowed total payments of $6,400 to be made as there were two events. IR2023/077: Suppementary Order Paper: North Island floods Page 3 of 7 application of eight weeks be retained, as this would seem an appropriate period to allow any such payments to be made or benefits to be provided. Tax relief for certain fringe benefits provided to employees 17.Fringe benefits provided to an employee are generally subject to FBT. After the Christchurch earthquakes, a number of employers provided benefits to employees or to recovery centres where employees may have received benefits. In response to the Christchurch earthquakes, the Government also introduced an FBT exemption where a benefit was provided to an employee and: 17.1 it was provided by the employer to employees for the purpose of relief of employees from the adverse effects of the Canterbury earthquakes; 17.2 it would have otherwise been a fringe benefit; 17.3 it was received by the employee in the eight weeks after each of the two earthquakes; 17.4 it was not provided in substitution for wages and salary; 17.5 its provision and amount did not depend on the seniority of the employee; 17.6 if the employee was associated with the employer, the benefit was also available to an unrelated full-time employee; and 17.7 the employer elected to treat the benefit as not being a taxable benefit. 18.This exemption covered all “sundry benefits” – for example, benefits that were provided at a drop-in centre. This is because in these cases the employer may not know which employee had received which benefit and thus the employer cannot estimate the value of the benefit. 19.The exemption also covers benefits where the value can be estimated to the extent that the remuneration exemption noted above has not also been paid (i.e., the employer can provide an amount up to $5,000 2 in cash or in benefits but not both). 20.As employers are likely to provide benefits to their employees affected by the North Island flood events, we recommend that this temporary FBT exemption be replicated with reference to those recent events. We recommend that this relief be subject to similar restrictions to the provision enacted for the Canterbury earthquakes. Financial implications 21.There is no fiscal cost to these proposed exemptions. This is because any revenue in the absence of the exemptions would be “windfall” revenue that has not been forecasted. Therefore, the amendments would not affect fiscal baselines. Administrative implications 22.These proposals would have no systems or administration costs for Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue would communicate the changes to taxpayers and update staff and online content. 2 $3,200 in respect of the Canterbury earthquakes IR2023/077: Suppementary Order Paper: North Island floods Page 4 of 7 Supplementary Order Paper items that do not require Cabinet approval Technical amendments to the Bill 23.We recommend including in the SOP several minor technical amendments to the Bill, such as corrections to commencement dates and cross-references. The amendments relate to the platform economy, cross-border workers, tax debt write- off rules and ring-fenced losses, and the financial arrangements taxation proposals in the Bill, and are all consistent with the policy intent. Donated trading stock 24.Recent Orders in Council have provided tax relief for donated trading stock. We recommend including in the SOP a retrospective technical amendment to ensure this relief applies as intended. Cost of Living payment: amendment to final date to be considered for eligibility (non-legislative change) 25.The Cost of Living payment was implemented to cover a particular time period and there is a set timeframe for individuals to have their payment approved. Individuals will not be considered for eligibility if they file their tax return after the final date. 26.The last date for eligibility is currently 31 March 2023. This aligns with the final date for all individual income tax returns to be filed for the 2021–22 tax year. 3 27.Inland Revenue has decided to defer imposing late filing penalties until 31 May 2023, as part of its North Island flood response. We recommend that the final eligibility date for the Cost of Living payment also be extended to 31 May 2023. This would ensure that individuals intended to be eligible for the payment do not miss out because their ability to file on time has been impacted by the North Island floods. 28.Amending the final date for eligibility for the Cost of Living payment would require Cabinet approval but does not require legislative change. This is because the eligibility criteria for the Cost of Living payment are not set in legislation, but instead were agreed by Cabinet and are published on the Inland Revenue website (CAB-22- MIN-0130 refers). Without the amendment to the criteria, Inland Revenue will not be able to assess eligibility to the Cost of Living payment for anyone who files their tax return after 31 March 2023, regardless of the reason. Financial implications 29.Extending the Cost of Living payment eligibility period has no fiscal implications as it relates to a timing change within the same fiscal year. The appropriation is expected to cover all remaining payments. Administrative implications 30.Extending the final date would require a moderate level of system change to ensure we can assess eligibility for the Cost of Living payment for returns filed up to 31 May. We would also need to update both internal and external information sources, such as Inland Revenue's website to explain the change. We also expect an increase in contacts from customers and their agents, via both web and phone, as people query their eligibility and the impact of filing after 31 March. These increased contacts are expected to occur from April to August which is our peak busy period when we are finalising income tax assessments for the 2021–22 tax year. This will increase pressure on our frontline staff. 3 Eligibility Cost of Living payment is based on an individual’s income for the 2021/22 tax year. IR2023/077: Suppementary Order Paper: North Island floods Page 5 of 7 Consultation 31.The Treasury were consulted on these proposals. Next steps 32.The attached Cabinet paper should be lodged with the Cabinet Office as soon as possible in order to be considered by Cabinet on 6 March 2023. 33.The proposed SOP would be released, in consultation with the Leader of the House, prior to the Committee of the whole House stage of the Bill, currently scheduled for 14 March 2023.

Agreed/Not agreed 1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet NORTH ISLAND FLOODS SUPPLEMENTARY ORDER PAPER – APPROVAL FOR RELEASE Proposal 1 This paper seeks Cabinet’s approval to policy proposals that would provide temporary tax relief in response to the recent North Island flood events. It also seeks approval to delegate authority to the Minister of Revenue to release a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2) (“the Bill”) to give effect to the proposals. T he SOP also includes several minor technical amendments to existing measures in the Bill, which are all consistent with the policy intent. 2 Cabinet approval is also sought to extend the eligibility of the Cost of Living payment. The proposed extension would align with Inland Revenue’s decision to defer imposing late filing penalties until 31 May 2023, as part of its North Island floods response. This would ensure that individuals intended to be eligible for the payment do not miss out because their ability to file on time has been impacted by the North Island floods. This would not require a legislative change. Relation to Government Priorities 3 The proposals in this paper are focused on keeping communities safe following recent weather events in the North Island and the cost of living. 4 I propose providing limited tax relief for accommodation for employees working on limited duration projects assisting with the rebuild and recovery of areas affected by the North Island flooding events. I also propose introducing limited tax relief measures will remove tax barriers for employers seeking to provide a range of welfare benefits to their employees to help them cope with the recent weather. 2qddsziq5 2023-03-07 13:07:46 Document 8 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 5 Budget 2022 included a Cost of Living payment to help New Zealanders with the rising costs of inflation. The payment is administered by Inland Revenue and is based on individuals that earned $70,000 or less in the 2021–22 tax year. The last date for eligibility for the payment is currently 31 March 2023 (being the last date for tax returns to be filed for that tax year). I propose extending the final eligibility date until 31 May 2023 to ensure that individuals do not miss out on the Cost of Living payment because their ability to file their tax return has been impacted by the North Island flooding events. Executive summary 6 To support the recovery of the North Island from recent weather events, I propose providing tax relief for accommodation expenditure for employees working on limited duration projects relating to rebuilding or recovery of affected areas. The proposal would extend the standard period that accommodation can be provided to employees who are working on limited duration projects from three years up to five years. 7 Under existing law, payments made from an employer to an employee and fringe benefits provided to an employee are generally taxable, either as monetary remuneration or by way of fringe benefit tax (FBT). I propose providing limited tax exemptions for employers and their employees for employer welfare contributions related to the recent North Island flooding events. This will support employees who have been adversely affected by the flooding events. 8 I recommend that the above tax relief measures be included in a SOP to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2) . The SOP also includes several minor technical amendments to existing measures in the Bill, which are all consistent with the policy intent. The Bill has a category 1 priority on the 2023 Legislation Programme (must be enacted before the general election as a matter of law), and is expected to be enacted before the end of March 2023. 9 The last date for filing tax returns for the 2021–22 tax year is 31 March 2023. Inland Revenue has exercised its operational discretion to defer imposing penalties on taxpayers who file late tax returns until 31 May 2023, as part of its North Island floods response. The eligibility for the Cost of Living payment is linked to income tax returns filed for the 2021–22 tax year. I recommend that the final eligibility date for the Cost of Living payment is also extended to 31 May 2023. This would ensure that individuals intended to be eligible for the payment do not miss out because their ability to file on time has been impacted by the North Island floods. Background 10 In response to the Christchurch earthquakes in 2010–11, limited tax relief was provided for accommodation of employees relocated to work on limited duration projects assisting with rebuilding and recovery of affected areas, and welfare payments and benefits provided by employers to employees affected by the earthquakes. 2qddsziq5 2023-03-07 13:07:46 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 11 The proposed amendments for inclusion in an SOP would mirror some of the tax relief measures provided in response to the Christchurch earthquakes. These measures would provide relief from income tax and fringe benefit tax for cash and benefits provided by employers to employees who have been adversely affected by the North Island flood events, as well as those employees who relocate to the affected areas to assist with the rebuild and recovery. 12 Inland Revenue officials are developing advice on other tax relief measures that could be introduced in response to the recent North Island flood events. These potential measures are expected to mainly relate to assets that have been damaged or destroyed (plant, equipment, buildings, and other land improvements). This advice will consider the nature and extent of the damage caused by the recent weather events and stakeholders’ perspectives and concerns. This advice is less urgent because taxpayers using tax agents have about 12 months before they need to file a tax position in relation to damaged or destroyed assets (31 March 2024 for the 2022–23 tax year). Supplementary Order Paper 13 The proposed SOP will include limited tax measures to provide relief in response to the recent North Island flood events and minor technical amendments to the Bill. The SOP is necessary as amendments to existing legislation are required to implement the proposed policy changes in a timely manner. 14 I recommend that the proposed tax relief provisions relating to accommodation and employer‘s welfare contributions apply to a “North Island flood event”, which would be defined as the geographical districts and regions that were affected by: 14.1 Cyclone Hale, which crossed the North Island of New Zealand during the period starting on 8 January 2023 and ending on 12 January 2023; 14.2 the heavy rainfall starting on 26 January and ending on 3 February 2023; and 14.3 Cyclone Gabrielle, which crossed the North Island of New Zealand during the period starting on 12 February 2023 and ending on 16 February 2023. Tax relief for accommodation expenditure for employees working on limited duration projects 15 To remove some of the adverse impacts of employees relocating to assist in the Christchurch rebuild project, the Government provided tax relief in respect of accommodation provided to employees where their employment duties required them to work on a limited duration project relating to the rebuilding or recovery. This included the repair and reconstruction of land, infrastructure, and other property in greater Christchurch as a result of the Canterbury earthquakes. 2qddsziq5 2023-03-07 13:07:46 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 16 This extended the standard period that accommodation could be provided to employees who were working on limited duration projects from three years to up to five years depending on when the employee relocated. It was limited to relocations to a workplace in the greater Christchurch region. 17 I recommend that the definition of limited duration project be extended for an initial period of five years where the employee relocates to an area affected by a North Island flood event within six months after the first event. 18 Given the unknown duration that a rebuild programme may take in the affect areas, I also recommend introducing an ability for the Minister of Revenue to extend or modify that period by Order in Council. This will provide flexibility to the proposed relief as work commences and more accurate assessments of the duration of the rebuild can be made. Tax relief for employers’ welfare contributions and accommodation provided to employees 19 Under existing law (with a few limited exceptions), payments made from an employer to an employee are taxable as monetary remuneration.

I also recommend that the amount of $3,200 be increased to $5,000 to account for inflation and the scale of the damage from the recent flooding events. This will help employers support their employees that have been affected by the recent weather events. 2qddsziq5 2023-03-07 13:07:46 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Tax relief for certain fringe benefits provided to employees 22 Fringe benefits provided to an employee are generally taxable by way of FBT. After the Christchurch earthquakes, a number of employers provided benefits to employees or to recovery centres where employees may have received benefits. The Government provided an exemption from FBT where a benefit was provided to an employee and: 22.1 it was provided by the employer to employees for the purpose of relief of employees from the adverse effects of the Canterbury earthquakes; 22.2 it would have otherwise been a fringe benefit; 22.3 it was received by the employee in the eight weeks after each of the two earthquakes; 22.4 it was not provided in substitution for wages and salary; 22.5 its provision and amount did not depend on the seniority of the employee; 22.6 if the employee was associated with the employer, then it was also available to an unrelated full-time employee; and 22.7 the employer elected to treat the benefit as not being a taxable benefit. 23 This exemption covered all “sundry benefits” – for example benefits that were provided at a drop-in centre. This is because in these cases the employer may not know which employee had received what benefits and thus the employer cannot estimate the value of the benefit. 24 I recommend introducing a similar temporary relief provision with reference to the North Island flood events. The exemption would also cover benefits where the value can be estimated to the extent that the remuneration exemption noted above has not also been paid (i.e., and employer can provide an amount up to $5,000 in cash or in benefits but not both). Cost of Living payment eligibility 25 The Cost of Living payment was implemented to cover a particular time period and there is a set timeframe for individuals to have their payment approved. Individuals will not be considered for eligibility if they file their tax return after the final date. 26 The last date for eligibility is currently 31 March 2023. This aligns to the final date for all individual income tax returns to be filed for the 2021–22 tax year. 27 Inland Revenue has exercised its operational discretion to defer imposing late filing penalties until 31 May 2023, as part of its North Island flood response. I recommend that Cabinet also extend the final eligibility date for the Cost of Living payment to 31 May 2023. This would ensure that individuals intended to be eligible for the payment do not miss out because their ability to file on time has been impacted by the North Island floods. 2qddsziq5 2023-03-07 13:07:46 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 28 Without amending the criteria, Inland Revenue would not be able to assess eligibility to the Cost of Living payment for anyone who files their tax return after 31 March 2023, regardless of the reason. Financial implications 29 There are no fiscal implications of the proposed tax relief measures as tax revenue in the absence of the proposed exemptions would be “windfall” gains in tax revenue that have not been forecasted. 30 Extending the Cost of Living payment eligibility period has no fiscal implications as it relates to a timing change within the same fiscal year. The appropriation is expected to cover all remaining payments. Administrative implications 31 The proposed limited tax relief measures will have no systems implications for Inland Revenue, and other administrative implications (such as guidance) will fall within Inland Revenue’s existing change capacity. 32 The change to the Cost of Living payment eligibility will require a moderate level of system change to ensure Inland Revenue can assess eligibility for the Cost of Living payment for tax returns filed up to 31 May 2023. Inland Revenue will update both internal and external information sources, such as Inland Revenue’s website to explain the change. Inland Revenue expects an increased level of contacts from taxpayers and their agents, via both web and phone, as people query their eligibility and the impact of filing after 31 March 2023. These increased contacts are expected to occur from April to August which is Inland Revenue’s peak busy period when income tax assessments for the 2021–22 tax year are finalised. This will increase pressure on Inland Revenue’s frontline staff. Legislative implications 33 Implementing the proposed tax relief measures will require changes to the Income Tax Act 2007. I propose to include the necessary legislative changes in a SOP to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2) prior to the Committee of the whole House stage. 34 The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2) holds a category 1 priority on the 2023 Legislation Programme (must be enacted before the general election as a matter of law) and is expected to be enacted by the end of March 2023. 35 The change to the Cost of Living payment eligibility period does not require a legislative amendment. The Cost of Living payment criteria was not set in legislation, but was agreed to by Cabinet and published on Inland Revenue’s website \[CAB-22-MIN-0130 refers\]. 2qddsziq5 2023-03-07 13:07:46 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 36 The Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that the proposed tax relief in response to Cyclone Gabrielle and the Auckland Anniversary flooding is exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement. This is granted on the grounds that the proposals are intended to manage the direct actions taken to protect the public in response to a declared emergency event and required urgently to be effective (making a complete, robust and timely Regulatory Impact Statement unfeasible). 37 The Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that the proposed extension of the eligibility date for Cost of Living payments is exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement, as it is intended to temporarily defer or extend legislative deadlines where a declared emergency has made compliance with the existing legislative requirements impossible, impractical, or unreasonably burdensome. Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 38 The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) team has been consulted and confirms that the CIPA requirements do not apply to these proposals as the threshold for significance is not met. Population 39 Due to the urgency of the response to the recent weather events, Inland Revenue officials have been unable to determine how many taxpayers would be impacted by the proposed limited tax relief measures. 40 As of 26 February 2023, Inland Revenue estimated that a further 290,000 individual income tax returns are due to be filed for the 2021–22 tax year. Officials estimate that about 50 percent of these individuals may be eligible for the Cost of Living payment based on their income. It is unclear how many of these returns will be filed during the proposed extended eligibility period. Human Rights 41 The proposals comply with the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993. Consultation Relevant Government Departments or Other Public Bodies 42 Inland Revenue consulted the Treasury and informed the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet of the proposals. Relevant Private Sector Organisations and Public Consultation Processes 43 Inl and Revenue officials have sought input from key stakeholders on potential tax relief measures in response to the North Island flooding events. 2qddsziq5 2023-03-07 13:07:46 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 44 No public consultation has been undertaken on the proposal to extend the Cost of Living Payment eligibility criteria. Communications 45 I will work with Inland Revenue on communicating the proposed changes to taxpayers. 46 Inland Revenue will include details of the new legislation in a Tax Information Bulletin after the Bill is enacted. Proactive Release 47 I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper and associated Cabinet minute in full shortly after the proposed release of the SOP. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that Cabinet: 1 agree to extend the time limit for accommodation provided to employees working on limited duration projects to the extent those projects are related to the rebuild and recovery from a North Island flood event to five years for employees who relocate within six months after the date of the first event. 2 agree to include the ability for the Minister of Revenue to extend or modify the time limit for the limited duration project exemption (outlined in recommendation 1) in respect of a North Island flood event by Order in Council. 3 agree to include an exemption from income tax, subject to the same restrictions as the previous exemptions made for the Canterbury earthquakes, for employees for: 3.1 accommodation provided by their employer; and 3.2 amounts paid by their employer that do not exceed $5,000. 4 agree to include an exemption from fringe benefit tax (FBT), subject to the same restrictions as the previous exemptions made for the Canterbury earthquakes, for employees for: 4.1 all sundry benefits provided by their employer; and 4.2 benefits provided by their employer that do not exceed $5,000 (or such less amount taking into account any cash paid to the employee and subject to the tax exemption in recommendation 3). 5 agree that the final date to be considered for eligibility for the Cost of Living payment be extended to 31 May 2023. 2qddsziq5 2023-03-07 13:07:46 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Financial implications 6 note that recommendations 1 to 5 have no fiscal implications. Legislative implications 7 agree to authorise the Minister of Revenue, in consultation with the Leader of the House, to release a Supplementary Order Paper to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2) prior to its Committee of the whole House stage, containing the measures in recommendations 1 to 4.

The proposed framework is attached as Appendix One. 2 The paper also provides a more general update on the debt to government work programme. Relation to government priorities 3 The framework has a particular focus on the way government agencies create and manage personal debt 1 owed by low-income households. This supports the Government’s priority of reducing child poverty and mitigating the impacts of poverty and socio-economic disadvantage. Executive Summary 4 Many low-income New Zealand households owe debt to the government, and the level of outstanding debt is increasing. While not all of this debt is necessarily problem debt, the policies guiding the creation and management of this debt can in some cases exacerbate financial and emotional hardship. 5 This Government has made significant investments in improving income adequacy and is also investing in policy change and systems transformation that will help prevent overpayments. The proposal for an all-of-government policy framework is part of this wider work programme to reduce the incidence and impact of debt to government. 1 The framework is aimed at personal debt, and is not intended to be applied to commercial debt or debt owed by companies, partnerships, trusts or other organisations.

It is not prescriptive as it recognises that decisions relating to debt owed to government must take into account financial, behavioural and administrative trade-offs. 7 The proposal for implementing the framework is that Cabinet adopt it as a policy tool, published on the Inland Revenue (IR) website. Ministers would agree to analyse any Cabinet proposal relating to debt to government against the framework’s principles and include a discussion of that assessment in the Cabinet submission. 8 The framework is forward-looking: it will not apply to existing policies except insofar as Ministers agree to do this on a case-by-case basis. To understand the extent to which existing policies may not comply with the framework, Joint Ministers’ view is that over time all Ministers should agree to carry out a one-off scan of their agencies’ existing debt management policies and identify any inconsistencies. In the first instance, Joint Ministers are proposing to build on their own agencies’ work to date and undertake a comprehensive scan of the policies they have in place. 9 Joint Ministers propose to report back to Cabinet after twelve months. The report-back would: 9.1 assess the effectiveness of the framework as a tool to inform policy decisions, 9.2 note any changes in their agencies’ debt policies or operations that have been implemented (or are recommended to be implemented) as a result of the scan exercise discussed above, and 9.3 advise on future reporting and evaluation. 10 The report will also provide an opportunity for Ministers to feed lessons back from the scan of their agencies and consider whether the debt policy work programme should be extended to a wider set of portfolios. 11 The paper also updates Ministers on the debt to government work programme more generally. Some good progress has been made. However, in some cases, it has been challenging to secure departmental resources and/or new budget funding to advance debt initiatives. 11.1 Successes to date include the Budget 2022 changes to hardship assistance and legal aid, the development of a new housing-related hardship assistance programme, and some minor improvements to information sharing. 11.2 s 9(2)(f)(iv) 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 11.3 MS D is progressing work related to more substantive improvements to information sharing, and changes to recoverable hardship assistance settings will be revisited through future Budgets. 11.4 Kainga Ora and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) continue policy work on options for dealing with rent arrears. 11.5 Further policy work on the development of a common hardship test across government agencies is not recommended at this time. 11.6 The MSD and IR pilot of three-way calls with common debtors has come to an end, and agencies are following up lessons learnt in the pilot. 12 Work on attachment orders has not progressed while the judiciary are considering other proposals affecting civil debt creation. 13 Ongoing review and reporting against the debt policy framework will help determine whether it will be a n effective tool for making progress on debt- related issues. Background 14 Many New Zealanders have some kind of debt to government, and levels of debt are increasing. A total of 762,460 New Zealand residents owe $4.68 billion of combined debt to MSD, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), and IR. Of these people, more than a quarter (28%) owe debt to two or more agencies, and 6 percent owe debt to all three 2 . Around three quarters of that debt is owed by low-income individuals, many of whom rely on government benefits as their main or sole form of income. 15 While 47 percent of debtors owe less than $1,000, 13 percent owe more than $10,000. More than 85 percent of people who owe debt to government have owed debt for at least one year. More than 45 percent have owed debt for at least four years. 16 Māori and Pacific people are overrepresented in almost all categories of debt to MSD, MoJ, and IR (with Māori comprising 44 percent of those with debt to all three agencies). 17 Both the Tax Working Group and Whakamana Tangata, the report of the Welfare Expert Advisory Group, recommended that the Government look further into issues around debt to government. A cross-agency group of officials was convened in 2019 to consider a cross-government approach to prevent and manage debt. The Cabinet Social Wellbeing Committee (SWC) has agreed that this work programme should have the dual focuses of: 2 From the Social Wellbeing Agency report Persistence of debt to government (November 2022). s 9(2)(f)(iv) 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 17.1 ensuring debt recovery is fair, effective, and avoids exacerbating hardship, and 17.2 preventing debt from occurring so that it does not create future problems for those in hardship. 18 In September 2022, SWC invited Joint Ministers to report back in June 2023 with progress on the debt to government framework, including results from agency consultation and further development of the work programme \[SWC- 2022-MIN-0170 refers\]. 19 There are many different causes of debt to government, which can accrue over long periods of time and under a range of policy settings. However, we know that it is driven to a significant extent by income inadequacy and issues with the systems that deliver government supports and collect money from New Zealanders. 20 The Government has made significant investments in improving income adequacy. The Minister for Social Development and Employment’s Welfare Overhaul update in November 2022 noted our significant investments across various initiatives to improve the lives of the most vulnerable New Zealanders \[CAB-22-MIN-0581.02 refers\]. 21 These investments have had a tangible impact on the lives of New Zealanders. In April 2023, approximately 356,000 beneficiaries were, on average, $118 per week better off compared to 2017 policy settings as a result of the welfare overhaul. Rates on all measures of child poverty have reduced since 2017/18, fewer households with children report not having enough income for basics, and total incomes are higher for those supported by benefits in 2022 than in 2018, even after accounting for increases to housing and the cost of living. 22 We are also investing in improving the systems involved in the creation of debt to government, for example MSD’s Te Pae Tawhiti Transformation Programme will support the sequenced delivery of foundational changes to income support systems through improved information sharing with IR and complementary policy changes \[GOV-23-SUB-0016 refers\]. 23 It is also important to note that not all debt is problem debt. Although we have invested significantly in income and other supports for New Zealanders, the Government cannot afford at this time to write off all debt, or to replace all existing loans with grants. We continue to believe that in the right circumstances lending can be a useful tool to support households. Debt to government will also, in some cases, be a far better option than other types of debt. 24 The Ministers responsible for the debt to government work programme have progressed policy work on key mahi to, for example, make some recoverable hardship grants non-recoverable and reduce the incidence of Working for Families overpayments.

Why we are proposing a policy framework for debt to government 25 Collaboration in respect of debt collection is not straightforward. Different debts will often have distinct policy contexts that justify different treatments, and agencies must work within legislative, privacy and resourcing constraints. The proposed framework would encourage alignment of debt management practices across government, while recognising that there is no one-size-fits all approach. Instead, the framework aims to ensure that consideration of debt is factored appropriately into agencies’ policy and operational processes. It also provides guidance on good practice in the identification and management of debtors in hardship or at risk of hardship. 26 The framework has three main parts: 26.1 A set of over-arching principles for creating and managing debt, 26.2 A “purpose-centred approach”, which classifies debt into different groups according to its policy purpose and discusses how different settings might be more appropriate for some purposes than others, and 26.3 A “person-centred approach”, which discusses how to take a debtor’s personal circumstances into account, with a focus on the consideration of financial hardship. 27 The framework is not prescriptive. It recognises that decisions relating to debt owed to government must take into account many difficult trade-offs, including the financial, behavioural and administrative impacts of different options. Consultation on the framework 28 In September 2022, Cabinet agreed that officials would carry out a two-stage consultation on the proposed all-of-government framework for addressing debt owed to government (“the framework”). The first stage of consultation with government agencies was carried out in late 2022. The second stage of targeted external consultation was carried out between 28 February and 6 April 2023. 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 29 A detailed summary of the feedback we received from external consultation is attached as Appendix Two. Feedback was generally positive. While many groups consulted would like to see a more ambitious approach to policy change, they see the framework as a step in right direction. Respondents also identified areas where they considered government agencies could make policy and operational changes that would mitigate some of the impacts on low- income households, and suggested ways for agencies to work more effectively with financial mentor services. 30 Government agencies generally supported the framework. Agencies echoed much of the feedback from external consultation, with an emphasis on the importance of considering debt in upfront policy design. How the framework will be implemented 31 The proposal for implementing the framework is that Cabinet formally adopt it as a policy tool. This would require Ministers to analyse any Cabinet submission relating to debt to government against the framework’s principles. This is intended to improve the quality of the policy advice around debt and ensure that trade-offs are transparent to Ministers when they make decisions. 32 In terms of driving change, the framework can only be effective to the extent that Ministers choose to give effect to its principles in Cabinet decisions. The framework is forward-looking: there will be no application of the framework to existing policies, except insofar as Ministers agree to do this on a case-by-case basis. 33 To understand the extent to which existing policies may not comply with the framework, Joint Ministers’ view is that over time all Ministers should agree to carry out a one-off scan of their agencies’ existing debt management policies and identify any inconsistencies. In the first instance, Joint Ministers are proposing to build on their own agencies’ work to date and undertake a comprehensive scan of the policies they have in place. 34 Joint Ministers propose to report back to Cabinet after twelve months. The report-back would: 34.1 assess the effectiveness of the framework as a tool to inform policy decisions, 34.2 note any changes in their agencies’ debt policies or operations that have been implemented (or are recommended to be implemented) as a result of the scan exercise discussed above, and 34.3 advise on future reporting and evaluation, including a data collection strategy to support ongoing reporting on debt outcomes. 35 The twelve-month report-back will also provide an opportunity for Ministers to feed back lessons from the scan of their agencies and consider whether the debt policy work programme should be extended to a wider set of portfolios. 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 41 42 43 44 45 45.1 45.2 45.3 D efinitions of hardship across government 46 Last year, we said that officials would undertake work to determine whether the current definitions of hardship are appropriate, and what opportunities there were to improve consistency. 47 In general terms, the concept of hardship refers to exclusion from a minimum adequate standard of living, including a lack of basic necessities. Within legislation that underpins government debt collection, definitions of ‘serious hardship’ all use broadly similar language to define this term. However, the use in MSD’s legislation of the term ‘undue hardship’ rather than ‘serious hardship’ reflects a deliberate distinction with regard to the policy context and intent s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] across systems. The result is that MSD’s definition of hardship for the purpose of debt management is more targeted t han that of other agencies. 48 We could undertake further work to explore legislative and/or operational changes to more closely align existing definitions of ‘serious hardship’. However, a lignment of definitions between MSD’s income support system and other agencies would either severely restrict the ability of MSD to collect debts or severely tighten the definition of hardship used by other organisations. 49 We, therefore, propose that we do not pursue further work to look at aligning definitions of hardship in the short term. 50 Consultation on the framework has reinforced the need to focus on hardship, and the framework provides explicit support for agencies on how to carry out assessments of hardship. A possible direction for further work would be to focus on improving consistency in the types and formats of information required to assess hardship, to reduce the compliance requirements for individuals. Update on the debt to government work programme 51 Cabinet last received an update on the debt to government work programme in September 2022. The work programme since then has been focused on developing the all-of-government policy framework. Current workstream updates are outlined below. Hardship assistance 52 Budget 2022 introduced two initiatives as part of the Hardship Assistance Review, and further advice on the review was provided by MSD at the end of 2022 exploring the amounts, categories, and recoverability of hardship assistance. Changing the recoverability settings for assistance is a powerful tool for providing targeted and specific support to people on the lowest incomes. For example, recoverability settings could be aligned to support Government priorities, such as child or whānau wellbeing. This is in addition to considering the extent to which a cost is foreseeable rather than due to an emergency situation or event beyond the client’s control. Potential changes to these settings will be revisited through future Budgets. Common debtors pilot 53 Following the initial pilot programme of three-way calls between Inland Revenue, MSD and clients with debt to both agencies (which has now come to an end), MSD and Inland Revenue are jointly exploring and implementing a number of lessons learnt, including information sharing opportunities and capability building. Attachment orders 54 In September 2022 SWC noted that work to improve information sharing for court attachment orders would be reported back on in the next Cabinet report back \[SWC-2022-MIN-0170\]. 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] and what engagement with Māori is required. Agencies are also encouraged to incorporate a tikanga values perspective in policy development relating to debt, for example by using Treasury’s He Ara Waiora framework. 70 The framework also advises agencies to collect data to help them understand debt management outcomes both for Māori and for other affected population groups. Data can inform decisions around what measures might be needed to ensure that everyone has equitable access to debt relief. 71 Engagement with Māori around outcomes is an ongoing obligation. Māori groups who were consulted on the draft framework emphasised that they would like to see ongoing, early engagement from the Crown both in relation to the operation of the framework and in relation to problem debt more generally. 72 As a result of consultation with representatives of impacted population groups, the framework now includes a greater emphasis on: 72.1 the need for more equitable access to debt relief for people who experience barriers to engagement with government agencies, whether through language, mental or physical disability, geographical isolation or inability to use digital services, 72.2 the importance of religious and cultural obligations being taken into account for the purpose of hardship assessment, and 72.3 the need for agencies to put in place specific policies to address debt that is incurred as a result of family violence or economic harm. 73 Adoption of the framework will not in itself have any impact on the population groups currently over-represented in debt statistics. However, if the framework is successful in driving more concrete policy and operational changes to the way debt is created and managed then this should lead to lower levels of debt- related hardship in these communities, and more consistent and equitable debt outcomes.

The Student Loans scheme enables access to tertiary education for all New Zealanders and generates considerable private (e.g. higher lifetime earnings, stronger wellbeing outcomes) and those public benefits that result from a highly educated population. It represents an investment and can more properly be thought of as ‘good debt.’ 76 We also note that the Student Loans scheme already has several features that seek to alleviate and manage hardship (e.g., student loans for New Zealand based borrowers are interest free, repayments are income contingent and there are hardship provisions for all borrowers who cannot meet their compulsory repayment obligations). Unlike other Government debt, student loan borrowers generally have their entire working life to repay their loan. This means various aspects of the Debt to Government Framework may be more or less appropriate in the context of student loan policy. For example, writing off debt student loan may not be appropriate as it could pose a high moral hazard risk in terms of the repayment behaviour of other borrowers. Also, as the majority of overdue or outstanding debt (around 90%) is held by overseas based borrowers this would have little impact on New Zealand households.

The work’s overarching goal is to reduce hardship for families and individuals and aims to achieve a fairer and more consistent approach to debt. 1.2 The framework has been developed by Inland Revenue, the Ministry of Social Development, the Ministry of Justice, and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Background 1.3 Debt can be a standard feature of financial life for many households and can play an important role in smoothing household expenditure, acquiring necessary assets or investing in the future. Moreover, certain types of debt can act as an investment in the individual (e.g., student loans), benefiting the individual and society. Not all debt to government is problem debt — in the right circumstances it can support wellbeing outcomes, and may often be a preferable alternative to private debt. 1.4 However, debt can also become a problem when servicing it becomes an unaffordable or persistent burden. This problem debt can have a significant impact on individuals and whānau in hardship, contributing to financial hardship, stress, poor physical and mental health, stigma, and social exclusion. 1.5 There is a lack of consistency in the way debt to government is administered. Government agencies have widely differing approaches to managing debt depending on factors such as: • Legislative requirements, • Level of resources available for case management, • Access to information needed to verify an individual’s financial situation, • A variety of historical policy and pragmatic reasons which may appear unclear or inconsistent from the perspective of an individual with debts to multiple agencies. 1.6 The focus of this framework is problem debt and the lack of consistency in how government treats debt owed to it by individuals. It seeks to balance the benefit of access to credit with the prevention of problem debt. And further, to balance having a coherent system based on the policy purpose of the debt with fair consideration of the individual’s circumstances. 1.7 To achieve this, the framework explores the various types of debt owed by individuals to government, seeks to categorise these, and discusses how they might ideally be treated, taking both policy context and individual circumstances into account. 1.8 The framework is intended to be used to help agencies design, implement and evaluate policy and operational processes which relate to the creation, collection or write-off of debt. Summary of proposals 1.9 The framework consists of three parts. • Part 1: Overarching principles for creating and managing debt. Page 4 of 20 \[SENSITIVE\] • Part 2: The purpose-centred approach — this section categorises different types of debt according to their underlying policy objectives, and outlines how the debt could be appropriately managed for each category (that is, policy settings). • Part 3: The person-centred approach — this section outlines how agencies might collectively take into account an individual’s personal circumstances (including amounts owed to other government agencies) and their ability to repay the debt both when the debt arises (if appropriate) and during the life of the debt. 1.10 The objective is a framework that guides: a) how debt could be categorised according to its underlying policy objectives b) how each category of debt could be managed (note that these ideal treatments are general, and deviations could be justified) c) how agencies should consider and respond to hardship when setting their debt collection policies d) how agencies assess whether a person’s debt repayments are sustainable given their financial and personal circumstances, including whether the person is eligible for other, non-repayable income support and whether they owe debts to other government agencies e) factors to consider when a debt is created, including whether an alternative would be preferable (for example, a grant rather than a loan). Page 5 of 20 \[SENSITIVE\] The framework creates a comprehensive approach to debt policy creation and implementation Page 6 of 20 \[SENSITIVE\] CHAPTER 2 Principles for creating and managing debt Principles 2.1 These principles represent overarching values that apply generally to all categories of debt. 2.2 It is intended that the principles below would be considered at all stages of the debt policy and implementation cycle, including before a debt is created. The principles will sometimes conflict and need to be traded off against one another. Where appropriate, agencies should make these trade-offs explicit. • Minimising hardship — The creation of a debt in the first instance, as well as the terms of its repayment should not place people into hardship or exacerbate existing hardship. Agencies should administer debt in a way that is appropriate for the individual’s circumstances as a whole, including whether the longer-term consequences of taking on further debt will have a negative impact on that person or their dependants. • Fairness — The treatment of debt, including creation, settings, management and relief, should be just and impartial across individuals and agencies. Where appropriate, an individual’s relevant circumstances should be considered and accounted for. Sometimes that may mean that different approaches are needed, for example, to ensure that particular population groups receive the same access to debt relief measures as the general population. Approaches to debt should not be applied arbitrarily but should be consistent, with any different approaches justified by specific needs. • Consistency with Treaty obligations — In Article Three of the Treaty of Waitangi the Crown promises that its obligations to New Zealand citizens are owed equally to Māori. There is an implicit assurance that rights would be enjoyed equally by Māori with all New Zealanders, and this may sometimes mean that special measures are needed to attain that equal enjoyment of benefits. Agencies should consider how Māori and the Crown define and measure equitable outcomes in relation to debt management and what engagement with Māori is required. Agencies should also incorporate a tikanga values perspective in policy development, for example by using Treasury’s He Ara Waiora framework. • Accounting for behavioural responses — Where appropriate, positive behavioural outcomes should be incentivised (for example, sustained repayment is incentivised). Further, collection mechanisms, such as write- offs or policies relating to recoverable versus non-recoverable support, should not create perverse incentives (that is, they should not incentivise individuals to incur debt because they expect not to have to repay it). • Public value — The cost of administering and collecting the debt, and impact on the debtor’s wellbeing of pursuing or maintaining the debt, should be weighed against the actual revenue collected and any other public benefits. When a person is unable to repay a debt, and government resources could be better used elsewhere, it may be more efficient to provide relief, such as through write-off provisions. Agencies should also consider public value in creating a debt where collection may not be viable due to hardship. • Transparency — The administration of debt should be simple and clear (both for individuals and administering departments). Individuals should understand how the debt arose, what is driving the recovery approach, and what their options are in case of hardship. This principle should be reflected in all communication with debtors and potential debtors by using plain Page 7 of 20 \[SENSITIVE\] language and accessible communication. Throughout the whole process, options should be available to assist those who require help communicating and care should be taken to ensure that they understand how the debt has arisen, what their rights and obligations are and what options are available if they require assistance. Page 8 of 20 \[SENSITIVE\] CHAPTER 3 Purpose-centred approach The types of debt owed to government 3.1 Debt to government arises as a result of different government policies that are intended to achieve different outcomes for New Zealanders. We have organised debt into the following categories according to the underlying policy settings which give rise to the debt: a) Crown Revenue — Revenue owed to the Crown. b) Overpayments of Government Support — Debt caused by incorrect or late information about eligibility or assessment. This type of debt is unintentional but arises due to information mismatch. The information error or lag may be on the part of either the individual or the government agency. c) Loans or Repayments for Services Provided by the Crown — Loans or repayments for services provided to individuals who meet specific criteria. Repayment is expected and agreed by the recipient from the outset. d) Government-administered debt between private parties — Legal obligations between individuals that are administered by government agencies. e) Penalties or Infringements — Penalties or infringements for non- compliance with legislative rules. They are intended to produce a compliance behavioural response. f) Accrued Interest — Interest is charged as compensation for the lost time value of money on overdue payments to Government agencies, fairness to other people who pay obligations on time, and ensuring there is no behavioural incentive for delaying payment. Interest is considered a separate category because, once added to a debt, interest may be treated differently to principal. g) Intentional non-compliance — Any debt that is the result of the intentional exploitation of systems, policy and procedures to achieve a wrongful gain. This category of debt is defined by individual behaviour rather than by policy context, which means debts from other categories which are the result of this behaviour will fall into this category. Recommended arrangements for creating and managing debt 3.2 Officials have recommended treatments for each category of debt. These are intended to improve consistency across agencies. We look at four different policy factors for each category: • Interest — Is it appropriate to apply interest to this type of debt? • Rate of repayment — What is the appropriate rate of repayment for the debt, considering its intended timespan? What limits should be placed on repayment amounts? Is it appropriate to provide for repayment extensions or suspensions, and under what conditions? • Write-off — How appropriate is it to write off this category of debt, and for what reasons? If write-off is not appropriate, should the debt survive bankruptcy? • Penalties — Is it appropriate to apply non-payment penalties? Page 9 of 20 \[SENSITIVE\] Recommended treatments Recommended treatment for Crown revenue 3.3 Examples of Crown revenue are income tax liabilities, customs revenue and ACC levies. 3.4 Taxes, fees and levies are necessary to fund government services and spending. As individuals derive benefits from the state (such as those funded through taxation), they incur certain duties — including paying taxes, fees and levies. 3.5 Effectively responding to non-compliant taxpayers is important not simply to meeting government’s revenue targets, but more fundamentally to maintaining the integrity of, and public confidence in, the tax system. Interest It is appropriate to apply interest to incentivise repayment, to compensate the Crown for the time value of money and for fairness to other people who pay on time. Timespan Payment extensions can be agreed with the objective being to maximise recovery and timeliness in a way that maintains integrity. Write-off Relief should be considered when an individual faces financial hardship. This could be through extension, write-off, or a combination of both. The cost to the Crown of collecting a debt may also be a consideration. Penalties Penalties are a helpful compliance tool but should be targeted at intentional non-compliance as opposed to inability to pay. Recommended treatment for overpayments of government support 3.6 This category refers to overpayments of transfer payments from the government to individuals. Examples include overpaid Working for Families tax credits and benefit overpayments. The ideal treatment is governed by the fact that these payments are primarily intended to provide people with financial assistance when they need it. 3.7 This type of debt is unintended. It typically results from inaccurate or late information about eligibility or assessment, or delays in processing this information (this is different from instances of intentional non-compliance). Many recipients will have limited ability to make repayments at the time the debt arises or in the future. 3.8 A first priority should be to consider the risk of overpayments when designing policy and operational processes, but this may need to be balanced against the goal of providing timely assistance. More complex policy design can create a higher incidence of debt — for instance, a highly targeted payment may support other policy outcomes but will have more opportunity for debts to arise than a universal payment. This means that complexity in these policies should be weighed against the likelihood of creating debt, and the trade-off should be appropriately justified. Interest Interest should not be charged, as this is likely to undermine the income adequacy objective of the original payment. Interest should not be used to incentivise repayment, which should instead be guided by the debtor’s ability to pay. Timespan Ability to pay (whether driven by hardship or other circumstances) is the key consideration, and a longer Page 10 of 20 \[SENSITIVE\] timeframe may be appropriate provided that this does not lead to the accumulation of debt. Write-off Relief should be considered when an individual faces financial hardship. Further, a lower threshold for write-off than other categories of debt may be appropriate, especially repayment may undermine income adequacy. This needs to be balanced against the behavioural incentives to provide timely and accurate information to the government. If the overpayment is due to administrative error and received by an individual in good faith, including agency failure to act on information provided by the individual, write- off should be the default response. There should be a robust process to identify when a debt is the result of administrative error, including the ability for an individual to instigate this process. Penalties Penalties should not generally be applied. They should be reserved for intentional non-compliance. Recommended treatment for loans or repayments for services provided or funded by the Crown 3.9 This category refers to loans or repayments for services provided or funded by government to individuals who meet specific criteria. Examples include legal aid debt, and Kainga Ora rental arrears. 3.10 The government may provide, guarantee or subsidise loans to individuals or provide or fund services so that people can take up financial assistance or access services at the time they need it. This will be conditional on meeting certain eligibility criteria and assumes that the person is likely to have future ability to service the loan or pay for the service provided. The contractual nature of these agreements means that it is understood between the lender or provider and the recipient that repayment is expected. Government agencies should ensure appropriate information is available and accessible to borrowers so that they are fully informed of repayment expectations. 3.11 That said, some services which fall in this category are targeted towards low- income individuals. While repayment is still the default assumption for these types of debt, given the intended recipients, a greater degree of flexibility in the terms of repayment may be appropriate. 3.12 Repayable assistance can be a useful way to support low-income households to smooth household expenditure or acquire necessary assets. However, when repayable assistance is being considered, there should be a point in the process where the administering agency considers whether creating a new debt is in the best interests of the person. At a broader level, government should consider whether it is appropriate for certain forms of assistance to be repayable at all. Interest May be applied but is unlikely to be appropriate for financial assistance that is specifically targeted to lower-income households. Timespan It may be appropriate to extend or defer repayment in case of hardship, especially for financial assistance that has been specifically targeted to lower-income households. Write-off May be appropriate in case of hardship. The intended duration of the debt should be factored into the write-off policy. But the contractual nature of these agreements implies that the default position is that the person has an obligation to repay the debt. Page 11 of 20 \[SENSITIVE\] Penalties May be appropriate in case of non-compliance. Where hardship exists however it may be appropriate to write off penalties to facilitate repayment. Recommended treatment for Government-administered debt between private parties 3.13 This category includes legal obligations between individuals that are administered by government agencies, such as child support owed to the receiving carer. 3.14 The government might intervene to administer a debt owed between private individuals, either because it has ordered one party to pay the other or because the debt (though agreed upon independently by each party) is considered important enough that the state must ensure it is honoured. 3.15 Though the state acts to enforce these debts, the amounts are not owed to the government, and the government therefore has limited influence on the creation of this debt. Interest There is an argument to apply interest to incentivise payment and to compensate the third party for late payment, but this should take into account the risk of debt accumulation, potential behavioural impacts and increased debt collection costs. Timespan In general, debt should be collected in accordance with the third-party arrangements or as soon as reasonably possible. Hardship can be taken into account when considering delaying repayment unless inconsistent with policy intent. Write-off Because these debts are not owed to the government, they should only be written off with the permission of the individual or entity to whom the debt is owed, or in cases where the debt could not possibly be collected (for example, the debtor is deceased). Penalties It is appropriate to apply penalties to this type of debt to help enforce compliance and recover some of the cost of collection. Penalties are typically owed to the government, not the third party, so hardship may be more freely considered for delaying or cancelling the collection of penalties. Recommended treatment of interest accrued on unpaid debt 3.16 This category includes amounts charged at a particular rate for the use of money lent, or for delaying the repayment of a debt. An example is use of money interest on overdue tax. Interest is applied for three reasons: • To compensate for the lost time value of money on overdue payments to government agencies. • Fairness to other people who pay debt on time. • Ensuring there is no behavioural incentive to delay payment. Interest New interest amounts could be applied to the existing accrued interest portion of a debt; however, this should represent actual costs incurred and agencies should take into account the potential consequence of compounding debt. Timespan Interest will typically be collected with the same urgency as the original debt. Page 12 of 20 \[SENSITIVE\] Write off Relief of interest (separate from principal) may be considered where it will facilitate collection of the original debt (for example, as part of a repayment arrangement) or in case of hardship. Penalties Penalties should not be applied to late interest payments. Recommended treatment of fines and infringements 3.17 This category refers to penalties imposed in response to non-compliance with legislative rules. Examples include tax shortfall penalties, and penalties added to benefit debt arising from fraud. Penalties and infringement notices are applied for two reasons: as punishment for non-compliance, or to produce a behavioural response. In either case a penalty or infringement notice might also act to recoup some of the cost of the offence. 3.18 The ideal treatment of a fine or infringement notice depends on whether it is intended to punish or deter; if both, the relative balance between the two. 3.19 A penalty that is intended to punish implies a generally high bar for write off and a generally high urgency for collection. 3.20 A penalty that is intended to deter should not reduce people’s actual ability to comply (that is, people will not comply if they cannot) or their desire to comply (for example, if repayment seems unrealistic). This implies that write-off may be appropriate, especially in cases of hardship as may a longer timeframe to allow repayment arrangements. 3.21 Similar considerations apply when considering whether to create this debt, as well as what alternative approaches may be appropriate to have the desired punitive or incentive effects — and whether other approaches may have more significant detrimental effects than the imposition of the penalty itself. It should also be noted that separate legislative provisions may govern the amount and repayment guidelines of this type of debt, and agencies may have less discretion in way it is administered. Interest It may be appropriate to apply interest to fines and penalties where there is a valid reason. However, a key principle of the rule of law is the ability for an individual to be able to determine what they could be liable for. It is important that interest applied to a fine and/or penalty does not undermine this principle. Timespan Timely collection is important for penalties with punitive intent; but for penalties with a behavioural objective, settings should be more responsive to an individual’s financial situation. Write-off Whether it is appropriate to write off a penalty or infringement will depend partly on its purpose: there is a higher bar for writing off penalties with punitive intent as opposed to those with a behavioural objective. Where there is a behavioural objective, write-off ought to be considered against the gravity of the behaviour being disincentivised and the value of maintaining the disincentive instead of writing off debt. Relief of penalties (separate from principal) may be appropriate in some cases to facilitate collection of the original debt. Penalties N/A Page 13 of 20 \[SENSITIVE\] Ideal treatment of debt arising from intentional non-compliance 3.22 This category includes any debt that is the result of intentional non-compliance, which is the intentional and deceitful exploitation of systems, policy and procedures to achieve a wrongful gain (such as when a person has deliberately delayed providing relevant information to obtain a welfare payment they are not entitled to). This category of debt is defined by individual behaviour. That is, debts from other categories will be classified as this category of debt if they are the result of intentional non-compliance. Interest The individual should not benefit from their behaviour, so it is appropriate to apply interest to this type of debt to compensate the government for the time-value of the debt and to incentivise prompt repayment. Timespan As for the reason above, it should be collected as soon as reasonably possible. Write-off Generally, this type of debt should not be written off, except in cases where collection would be impossible (for example, the debtor is deceased). Penalties It is appropriate to apply penalties to this type of debt to ensure compliance and as a punishment for non-compliance. Page 14 of 20 \[SENSITIVE\] CHAPTER 4 Person-centred approach 4.1 This ‘person-centred’ approach places the individual and their family at the centre of decision-making when debts are created or collected. This is to ensure that their whole set of circumstances (including debts owed across Government) is considered when debts are created or collected. This approach is intended to ensure that the treatment of debt is appropriate, especially for those in hardship or at risk of hardship. 4.2 This is intended to support the general principle that creation or recovery of a debt should not place the individual and their family into hardship or exacerbate existing hardship. This principle promotes equity and efficiency: when a person is unable to repay their debt, the collection process can create and exacerbate stress for the individual at the cost of government resources (which could be invested elsewhere), outweighing the amounts recovered. This problem is multiplied if a person owes debts to several government agencies. 4.3 The policy-centred approach and the person-centred approach are intended to work together, with both having an influence over the outcome. There may be instances when the policy intent underlying the creation of a debt (e.g. the imposition of a penalty) conflicts with the obligation to ensure a person or their family are not placed into hardship. Just as policy settings for managing debt may need to have some flexibility to respond to individual circumstances, hardship provisions may also need to be applied differently depending on the purpose of the debt. In these cases, the trade-off should be explicitly considered. 4.4 In some cases, a more flexible approach to hardship may deliver worse outcomes than a uniform approach for groups who are less well equipped to advocate for themselves. Agencies must take care that taking a person centered approach does not create barriers which exclude or disadvantage some people. 4.5 In taking a ‘person-centred’ approach to debt, it is recommended that agencies: a) Consider the potential for policy alternatives to debt creation. b) Have policies in place for debt relief measures, including write offs, repayment plans or deferral. Further, agencies should consider how to support individuals who have more difficulty accessing relief. c) Make decisions about debt relief in the context of a comprehensive hardship assessment. This should include taking into account other debts that might already exist, which might require considering whether to enter into information sharing agreements with other agencies. It should also involve careful consideration of all relevant information a department holds for the individual, such as debts relating to other products or services. d) Consider how operational discretion can be supported by training and guidance to ensure consistency of treatment, and accessibility. e) Have policies in place around when to refer debtors to financial capability support services or other services (including, where relevant, advocacy and dispute resolution services or specialist services that can support safety and wellbeing for victims of abuse). f) Undertake an assessment of whether or not debtors are receiving their full and correct entitlements. 4.6 As with the purpose-centred approach, the person-centred approach is not intended to be prescriptive. Agencies should consider the recommendations in this framework, but they may need to take into account other policy or operational objectives, including any legislative constraints. Page 15 of 20 \[SENSITIVE\] Assessing Hardship 4.7 Assessing hardship is about assessing the extent to which an individual’s or household’s material living standards are below a minimum adequate level and they are going without basic necessities. Hardship operates on a continuum of severity, with more serious hardship being of greater concern. 4.8 When assessing hardship, the whole of a person’s circumstances must be considered. There are a range of factors which the assessment should consider: • Can the person afford basic living expenses for themselves and any dependants (for example, accommodation, basic household expenses, necessary asset purchases etc.)? Are dependants at risk of being placed into hardship? • Does the person have other unavoidable and necessary costs (for example, children’s education costs, medical treatment for self or dependants, necessary vehicle repairs for a vehicle used for work or to enable the care of dependents etc.)? • Has the person experienced unforeseeable costs (for example, unexpected medical costs)? • Given the private and government debt that the person owes, is their debt position sustainable or is debt growing in an unmanageable fashion? • What would be the financial impact on the household or wider whānau of any decisions made in relation to the debt owed by the person, including possible opportunity costs? • What cultural expectations are present for the individual in terms of supporting wider whānau, or contributing to religious or cultural obligations? • Is it likely that the person will experience long term necessary and unavoidable costs (for example, someone with a disability or a long-term health condition)? • Is the debt caused by a partner, ex-partner, family member or caregiver who has coercive control over the person’s finances? Is the person able to make independent and autonomous decisions about their finances? Is the debt adding to entrapment for someone experiencing family violence or abuse? 4.9 An assessment of hardship should consider the resources available to them. Consideration should include: • The person’s sources of income. • Whether income is volatile or will change over time. • What assets a person has available to help meet the debt. Taking hardship into account in decision-making When creating a debt When an agency can choose to create a debt 4.10 When an agency has discretion to create a debt (e.g., granting a loan), the agency should be satisfied that the debt can be repaid over time, without creating or exacerbating hardship (see 4.14 below), and that the debt is in the best interests of the individual. Page 16 of 20 \[SENSITIVE\] 4.11 This is especially important when loans or recoverable grants for essential expenses are offered to households already determined to be in serious hardship. In these instances, alternatives to recoverable assistance could be considered, such as providing assistance as a non-recoverable grant. 4.12 However, such alternatives may not be available or appropriate. A recoverable loan may still be in the individual’s interests if they have a need that is immediate, essential and significant. Agencies should consider whether the provision of assistance is in someone’s best interest and the trade-offs this may involve. When a n agency cannot choose whether to create a debt 4.13 Sometimes a debt will be created automatically (for example, when an overpayment is discovered or when imposing a fine for an offence). 4.14 The process for imposing infringement fees for example is typically governed by legislation or regulation, leaving agencies no discretion to consider hardship at the time the fee is imposed. In these situations, it is only likely to be practicable to consider hardship more generally when the opportunity arises to review infringement settings. 4.15 In the case of overpayments, if a person has been proactive in contacting the agency before the agency identified the debt and cooperative in providing information, a more lenient approach may be considered. When determining the rate and method of debt recovery 4.16 When determining the rate and method of any debt recovery, agencies should consider the impact of any potential recovery arrangements on an individual’s financial position, and whether and to what extent it would create hardship for them or any dependants. It should be noted that there are existing provisions for some types of debt collection which aim to protect against hardship (for example, the Summary Proceedings Act sets out a protected earnings rate to restrict deductions on income). 4.17 Where hardship may be a factor, the agency should carry out a hardship assessment. This assessment should be as comprehensive as practicable, taking into account the size and likely duration of the debt, the costs to the agency, and the costs to the individual providing the information It should account for both immediate and longer-term impacts on the debtor. It should consider: • The current financial circumstances of the person — this includes considering the individual’s income, costs, and assets, as well as their existing level of debt (from all sources, including other government agencies, any debt owed to local government and all private debt). • The effect that the rate and method of recovery will have on the ability of the person to support themself and any dependants —repayment should be sustainable and leave enough for the individual's living expenses and any other debt repayments; it should not cause undue hardship to the individual or any of their dependants (unless there are competing policy considerations that must take priority over this principle, such as a child support liability). • The likely impact on the person’s circumstances and level of hardship over the longer term — repayments should be structured in a way that means the individual can eventually pay down the debt, including any interest payments and penalties that are attached. Consideration should be given to whether repayment settings restrict their ability to improve their circumstances (for example, if settings mean that an increase in income would be offset by higher debt repayments). Page 17 of 20 \[SENSITIVE\] 4.18 Agency hardship assessment should be designed with enough time and care to enable the individual to disclose all relevant information. When considering whether to provide debt relief 4.19 Hardship as a basis for relief (that is, write-offs o r deferral of collection) — beyond any initial assessment of hardship, hardship relief should be available for consideration as people’s circumstances change. If a person is experiencing hardship, recovery of the debt could be reduced or deferred until they are in position to start repayments; or the debt could be written off (although the potential to create perverse incentives should be considered carefully). 4.20 Th e purpose-centred approach provides guidance on the appropriateness of deferral and write-off for each category of debt (refer to the write-off section of the table within each of the recommended treatments). However, it should be noted that the intended timeframe of a debt is relevant to what form of relief is appropriate: it might be more appropriate to write-off (defer collection of) of a debt that is intended to be short-term (long-term). When trying to influence behaviour 4.21 Some types of debt are imposed by government to disincentivise certain behaviours, for example, a penalty for non-compliance. In these cases, some degree of financial discomfort forms part of the policy intent in order to discourage the individual from repeating the behaviour (breaking the law, late filing of a tax return, committing fraud). 4.22 Hardship may be a side-effect of the financial penalty being imposed but is not the intention. When hardship occurs because of these policies, achieving their policy intent causes a trade-off against the objective to reduce hardship. 4.23 In these cases, options should be considered to mitigate this trade-off. For instance, the severity of any financial penalty will vary according to the financial circumstances of the individual, so it may be possible to reduce the penalty for individuals in hardship while still achieving the same level of deterrent. 4.24 Or, where an agency has discretion, non-financial penalties could be applied as an alternative; or more discretion could be allowed in terms of when hardship relief may be appropriate (for example, if that individual has children in their care who may be adversely affected by a decrease in household income). Supporting debtors in hardship 4.25 High or persistent debt can cause psychological stress. It may affect an individual’s willingness or capacity to engage with government agencies. Debt-related communications should recognise this by using plain language and keeping the communication as simple as possible. Agencies could also consider what communication channels may work best for certain customer groups. Throughout the life of the debt, individuals should be able to understand how the situation has arisen, what their obligations are, and where to go if they need help. 4.26 Agencies should also consider what other support might be needed by clients with problem debt, such as for example referring clients to services that can: • provide financial or budgeting advice • assist in restructuring private sector debt • help individuals to interact with other government agencies. Page 18 of 20 \[SENSITIVE\] Understanding the needs of groups most affected by debt 4.27 Some population groups are disproportionately represented in debt statistics, including Māori, Pasifika communities, women, disabled people and children. Māori individuals are overrepresented in almost all categories of debt to the Ministry of Social Development, Ministry of Justice, and Inland Revenue, and are overrepresented in people with debt to multiple agencies 1 and in low-income households 2 . Pasifika communities are also disproportionately represented in lower socio-economic groups, while women are more likely to be left with debt following a relationship break down. Children are also negatively affected when growing up in households where budgets are constrained by large or entrenched debts. 4.28 Consistent with the Crown’s obligations under Article Three of the Treaty, agencies should engage with Māori to understand how Māori and the Crown define and measure equitable outcomes in relation to debt management and whether special measures are needed to reach those outcomes. Agencies should incorporate a tikanga values perspective in policy development, for example by using Treasury’s He Ara Waiora framework. 4.29 Agencies should collect data to help them understand debt management outcomes both for Māori and for other affected population groups. Data can inform decisions around what measures might be needed to ensure that everyone has equitable access to debt relief. 4.30 For other ethnic communities, it is important that the whole of the debt process is understandable: from the terms under which a debt was established, right through to ensuring that financial mentoring services are accessible. Translation services and clear communication are essential. Religious affiliations and cultural beliefs may also affect various aspects of debt management and agencies should ensure clients are enabled to communicate these. 4.31 For those individuals living with a disability, there needs to be consideration of what equitable outcomes look like for this group, recognising that they may have additional costs or have difficulty improving their financial position due to factors beyond their control. Support should be accessible for these individuals in order to ensure they are able to make informed decisions around debt. 4.32 Debt may sometimes be the result of economic harm. Agencies should ensure that they: • Understand the signs of family violence and know how to support customers, including a referral system to expert support services, • Avoid requiring evidence of family violence, and avoid requiring repeat disclosure of circumstances, • Have a policy on allocation of debt in cases of family violence, and • Have effective processes in place to protect information, including between account holders if necessary. Working with financial mentors and other intermediaries 4.33 Financial mentors is a one-on -one service focused on helping people, families, and whānau with their finance. Agencies should consider when to refer clients to financial mentors. A list of useful contacts is attached as Appendix 1. 4.34 Financial support is not necessarily a solution to problem debt in itself but has the ability to provide individuals and whānau with the skills and capabilities to better 1 Māori comprise 44 percent of those with debt to all three agencies. 2 22 per cent of all Māori working-age adults are likely to be on a low income or in receipt of a main benefit. Page 19 of 20 \[SENSITIVE\] navigate future financial and debt-related decisions. Financial mentors can be helpful during a hardship assessment process to help communicate the individuals’ situation to agencies. 4.35 Government agencies should look for opportunities to work in partnership with kaupapa Māori and other culturally specific services, to reduce barriers to accessing support for those most in need, and to address the primary drivers of debt. Page 20 of 20 \[SENSITIVE\] Appendix 1 4.36 MoneyTalks is a free financial helpline that provides advice to people in difficulty and connects them with financial capability services in their community. 4.37 Although the services provided by MoneyTalks tend to be targeted towards clients who hold high interest and penalty bearing debts, such as those from short-term lenders, government agencies may find a benefit in referring clients who hold debt with them to MoneyTalks. 4.38 The MoneyTalks website provides links to the following service providers: • Financial mentor services are listed at https://www.moneytalks.co.nz/find- help-now/ • Other service provides are listed at https://www.moneytalks.co.nz/our- partners/ 1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Appendix 2: Summary of feedback from external consultation February – April 2023 1.Targeted external consultation on the draft debt to government framework ran from 28 February to 6 April 2023. 2.Officials from the debt to government working group held online or in-person meetings with: •Social Service Providers Aotearoa •The Fairer Futures Collaboration •DebtFix •The Disabled Persons Assembly •Te Tihi (a Whānau Ora group from the Manawatū) •Inland Revenue’s Māori Advisory Panel •National Building Financial Capability Charitable Trust (FinCap) •The National Beneficiaries Advocacy Consultative Group, and •The Ministry of Social Development’s Māori Reference Group and Pacific Reference Group. •Ngāpuhi representatives 3.Written submissions were received from 12 non-government organisations: •The National Beneficiaries Advocacy Consultative Group •Citizens’ Advice Bureau •SuperGrans •Methodist Alliance •National Building Financial Capability Charitable Trust (FinCap) •Financial Services Federation •Kore Hiakai Zero Hunger Collective •Good Shepherd •Dunedin Budget Advisory Service •New Zealand Council of Christian Social Services •Family and Financial Solutions Trust •Salvation Army 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Overarching themes 4.Every submitter emphasised that debt to government is an important issue. We heard that the creation and management of debt by government agencies causes significant financial and emotional hardship for lower income families. Most respondents would have liked to see more ambitious debt relief proposals (one submission called the framework “uninspiring”), but accept this framework is a first step in the right direction. At a policy level, feedback focused on overpayments, recoverable grants, and legacy debt (debt which has existed for a number of years). At an operational level, feedback focused on equitable access to services, consistency and information sharing. 5.Submitters made it clear that even within existing policy frameworks government agencies can do better. While many of the policy suggestions were outside the scope of this framework, there were many suggestions for operational improvements that may be able to be implemented at relatively modest cost. 6.Submitters also emphasised the need for stronger accountability for implementation of the framework. They wanted to see ongoing reporting on compliance with the framework and a data collection strategy that would underpin reporting on outcomes. Detailed feedback and recommendations for government Poverty 7.Some organisations advocating for poverty relief and social justice consider almost all debt to government is due to income inadequacy. For them, the existence of debt to government — in particular, debt that is owed to agencies providing social assistance — is fundamentally unjust. Suggestions to alleviate hardship: •Raise incomes for all so that families do not need to borrow for essential expenses •Simplify the benefit system – increase the use of universal benefits and/or consolidate means-tested benefits into a single package •Adjust abatement thresholds automatically in line with minimum wage and/or benefit increases •Make permanent the high-trust model that was used during COVID •Write off all beneficiary debt; or (see below) •Write off overlapping, persistent and disproportionately high whānau (individual and family) debt •Make all hardship assistance non-recoverable, and •Never charge full market rate for social housing. The impact of debt on Māori 8.We heard that debt (including intergenerational debt) is a huge problem for many Māori communities. Many of the issues raised more generally in this feedback summary are experienced disproportionately by Māori and were strongly echoed in our consultation sessions with iwi and Māori representatives. We received feedback asking that the framework explicitly reference Te Tiriti o Waitangi/The Treaty of Waitangi clauses and principles and show how these are honoured in the policy proposals. Ngāpuhi noted in addition that officials should understand the relationship it has with 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Te Tiriti and He Whakatupuranga, as it is not the same as other iwi. We also heard that engagement with Māori should occur earlier in the policy process, and engagement on the framework specifically should be an ongoing commitment. Consultation with Māori also highlighted the extent of financial obligations across extended families, and a view of debt as a collective responsibility. Suggestions to improve Māori outcomes in relation to debt to government: •Make the framework a living document, with Māori engagement part of the ongoing process of improvement, •Measure Māori outcomes in relation to debt, and hold decision-makers accountable for improving those outcomes, •Support iwi and Whānau Ora providers that wish to pilot innovative solutions to provide debt relief or debt resolution, •Collect and provide data by ethnicity/region to iwi and hapū so that they can use this to best assist their own people, •Consider the impact of rural communities’ isolation on low-income households, particularly the compounding effect of lack of access to public services, higher incidence of digital exclusion and difficulty meeting government requirements. For example, some rural addresses do not ‘exist’ on the NZ Postcode database which has a flow-on effect for proof of identity/address. This can prevent access to banking and other services. •If government agencies create the debt, they should be part of an investment in a solution to build financial resilience, for example: –An incentives and monitoring trial involving writing off a percentage of debt per month if a certain milestone has been achieved. This may also involve setting up a whānau fund that whānau members need to invest in at regular intervals. –Funding for hapū and iwi-led financial education programmes or wānanga, leading to likely increased participation and success. –Providing whānau access to an online budgeting service (for example, ClearDebt, Total Money Management) that is transparent and simple to use. Balancing income adequacy and debt 9.Some social support agencies took a more equivocal position in relation to debt. They felt that debt sometimes served an important purpose (for example, by allowing low- income households access to credit). We received a lot of feedback around recoverable hardship grants, with many respondents feeling that these have become too biased in favour of recoverable assistance, leading poorer families into debt traps. Respondents felt that a more lenient approach to enforcement was needed to help low-income households manage their finances. Suggestions to improve the balance between income adequacy and debt: •Introduce a standard four-week grace period to provide change of circumstance information for all benefits, •Ensure that hardship grants for essential ongoing expenses are not made recoverable, 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] •Protect main benefit income against automatic debt repayments (i.e., no MSD debt repayment deductions from benefits), and •Prevent courts from agreeing attachment orders on benefit income requested by third parties, and improve processes around attachment orders to ensure relevant information is put before the courts. Legacy debt 10. A number of submissions wanted to see better solutions for resolving legacy (aged) debt, including when the debt has arisen as a result of fraud (i.e., in cases where standard write-off policies may not apply). They felt that the proposed treatment of fraudulent debt in the framework is too severe. They commented that people sometimes need to be able to make a fresh start, and legacy debt can hinder the return to work (debt repayments can result in very high effective marginal tax rates), as well as being a psychological burden. Suggestions for dealing with legacy debt: •Relax write-off provisions for legacy debt; introduce waivers for debt once it reaches a certain age and is unlikely to be repaid •Include the possibility of write-off for legacy debt in the fraudulent debt category, and •Establish a “review panel” including government agency and financial mentor service representatives, to consider and resolve difficult cases of legacy debt. Transparency 11. Agencies have made a lot of effort in recent years to improve the accessibility and quality of information on their websites. However, the system of government services is complex and many households still struggle to understand their entitlements and obligations. The digital divide is an issue for people with disabilities, non-English speakers, and young people. 12. Plain language information on debt is very important, including ensuring informed consent at the point the debt is being created (where the debt is a repayable payment for goods or services). We heard several times that some people receiving recoverable hardship grants do not understand that they are loans, and that legal aid loans were also sometimes understood to be grants. Literacy (including financial literacy) can be a barrier to navigating government services and debt policies and procedures. Submitters considered that government agencies should have the same disclosure requirements as private lenders under the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003 (CCCFA) — including information around how to apply for hardship relief, and how to access non-financial alternatives to repayment, if these should be available. Suggestions for improving transparency: •Plain language requirement for all debt-related communications, •Communication with anyone should be possible through a channel that works for them, •Ensure informed consent where people are agreeing to take on loans, •Ensure clients correctly understand their obligations around advising of change of circumstance when they start receiving welfare entitlements, 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] •The term “recoverable grant” should not be used because it can sound to recipients as though the money is a “grant” and does not need to be repaid, and •Information disclosures to mirror requirements of the CCCFA (including disclosure of repayment terms and conditions and what happens in case of default, how to apply for hardship assistance, and access to dispute resolution processes). Operational guidelines for hardship assessments 13. Most submitters accepted that hardship assessments are a necessary step in granting hardship relief. They noted, however, that these assessments can be traumatic for applicants, and that they often have to provide the same information over and again to different agencies with different rules and requirements. We heard that outcomes can be very different within the same agency, depending on “who you get on the phone”. We also heard that some groups typically struggle to get good outcomes from these processes, just as they are likely to struggle to get full and correct welfare entitlements in the first place. Those most impacted include people with disabilities, young people, people with English as a second language, people with mental health issues, and anyone who cannot afford to spend hours at a time on hold to a call centre. Submitters generally supported the idea of a “person-centred framework” but noted that increasing discretion around hardship relief may actually lead to relatively worse outcomes for more vulnerable groups, as they tend to be less well equipped to advocate for their own interests. Suggestions for improving the hardship assessment process: •Implement a common format across departments for the information required for hardship assessments (consistent with CCCFA regulations, and with Building Financial Capability budgeting advice), •Review training for call centre staff who make hardship assessments with a view to ensuring more consistent outcomes, including for vulnerable population groups, •Discretion should be supported by clear guidance, and agencies should collect information that will show them whether some groups are getting better treatment than others, •Identify which groups are at risk of poor outcomes, and put in place referral systems to financial mentors or other appropriate support services, •Consider information sharing between departments for hardship information, and •Require departments to record on client files when a full and correct entitlement assessment has been carried out, and do these assessments from the first point of contact with a client needing assistance Family violence 14. Many submitters pointed out that the framework did not consider how to treat debt arising from family violence. Suggestions for guidance on dealing with debt caused by family violence: •Ensure staff are informed about the complexities and signs of family violence and know how to support their customers, 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] •Avoid requiring evidence of family violence, so that responses are timely and prioritise the safety of the survivor, •Avoid requiring repeat disclosure of circumstances. This can be traumatising and potentially creates a barrier to further support being sought. Some examples of solutions for this are referral arrangements and a dedicated phone line to flag the situation. Implement systems for smooth referrals to expert support services, •Have policies on how to separate debt between the perpetrator and survivor, including policies for waiving debt for people affected by family violence, and •Have effective processes for safety and protection of information, including keeping information confidential between account holders if requested. Feedback on the treatment of different kinds of debt 15. Submitters agreed that write-off should be the default setting for debt incurred as a result of administrative error. However, they pointed out that in practice this can be difficult to determine, and similarly that it can be very difficult to determine whether debt is a result of intentional fraud. Wider circumstances often need to be taken into account. Suggestions for changes to the treatment of different categories of debt: •Develop clear guidance for determining when debt has been occurred through administrative error or fraud, and •Implement a voluntary disclosure regime that facilitates write-offs for overpayments that are picked up and reported by the client rather than the agency. Working with financial mentors 16. We were told that people in debt commonly get far better outcomes from agencies when supported by financial mentors. Ideally, this would not be the case, but in the real world, financial mentors fill an important gap, particularly for people who struggle to engage effectively with government agencies. By acting as intermediaries, they can help take pressure off agency staff. Submitters pointed out that many financial mentor services receive government funding, and it would make sense for government agencies to think about how to make this relationship as effective as possible. Suggestions for working with financial mentors: •Agencies should formalise referral policies to financial mentor services, •Increase funding for financial mentors, •Introduce dedicated phone lines for mentors, •Introduce a common format for hardship assessment designed in conjunction with the Building Financial Capability (BFC) budgeting process, and •Agencies should consider how they might use BFC information and training services — for example, consider establishing joint training of mentors and call centre staff. 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Agency collaboration and information sharing 17. Many submitters felt that a proposal for a single debt collection agency should be put back onto the table, as it would be a much more efficient way for people in debt to transact with the government. They saw the main advantage as being all information could be held in one place. Submitters told us that clients sometimes have difficulty even understanding their debt situation across multiple government agencies, let alone being able to effectively negotiate affordable repayment arrangements. 18. Submitters felt that the government is too concerned with protecting client privacy, and that this can come at great cost to the client if it prevents effective information sharing. Many clients believe that all government information is already shared; others do not understand which agency holds what information. This can make it difficult for them to understand who needs to be informed of what, and this can be a driver of overpayment debt. Suggestions for improving agency collaboration: •As mentioned in the section on legacy debt, establish review panels for problem debt, comprising representatives from both financial mentor services and all relevant government agencies2, •Regional pop-up sessions where government agency representatives could talk to clients as a group and design a coordinated debt relief plan, and •Create information portals where multiple agencies could upload client information and clients can access a full picture. Other issues 19. In this summary document we have not been able to include a discussion of every suggestion we received. A number of other suggestions across various topics are noted below. Other suggestions: •Consider how the transfer system might be transformed into a savings scheme approach, as opposed to an overpayment or deficit approach •Consider how this framework might be extended to local government debt •Clarify that the framework only applies to personal debt, not commercial debt •Review the way government debt is included in insolvency procedures •Consider whether information on debt to government should be provided to credit reporting agencies, and •Prevent the use of unregulated private debt collection agencies.

This final report will provide you with an overview and summary of the near final numbers for the Cost of Living Payment Scheme. Inland Revenue has provided regular updates on the recipients of the Cost of Living payment, which were subject to change as tax returns were filed and processed. In order to have their eligibility assessed for the Cost of Living Payment, customers were required to file their income tax returns for the 2021-22 tax year by 31 May 2023. As this date has passed, the data outlined in this report is more stable, and not expected to change significantly. 2. This report will also provide you with a comparison between the original estimates for the potential eligible population and the near final eli gible population \[IR2022/147 refers\]. Background 3. The Cost of Living Payment Scheme aimed to provide short term financial support to individuals who were disproportionately impacted by spikes in inflation. The total value of the payment is $350, made up of three-monthly instalments occurring from August to October 2022. Individuals whose eligibility was confirmed after this period received lump sums. 4. Eligibility for the payments was based on income from the 2021-22 tax year. To be considered for eligibility individuals had to have filed their returns for the 2021-22 tax year before 31 May 2023 1 . The end of the filing period for the 2021-22 tax year means no new individuals can be considered for eligibility. 5. Eligible customers who have not provided Inland Revenue with bank account information, and therefore have not received payment, have until 31 March 2024 to do so. 6. A high trust ‘push model’ was utilised to distribute payments. This model utilised the best information and data Inland Revenue had available at the time to determine if individuals met the eligibility criteria agreed upon by Cabinet \[refer CAB-22-MIN-0130\]. Individuals did not need to apply to receive the payment. The high trust push model was also preferred because it was more cost-effective than an application-based model. 7. Following the first payment, some individuals who Inland Revenue believed were eligible, indicated they were overseas. Several changes were implemented before payment two \[IR2022/403 refers\], and again before payment three \[IR2022/452 refers\]. 1 This date was aligned to the deferred date for policing individual tax returns for the 2021-22 income tax year, which was moved from 31 March 2023 to 31 May 2023 due to the North Island flooding events.

Of all payments, 0.3% (12,699) were made to ineligible recipients in error by Inland Revenue and 2.0% (99,385) were made to customers potentially overseas. This number has and will continue to reduce as customers continue to make voluntary repayments and those who were identified as potentially overseas continue to confirm their presence in New Zealand. To date, 3,350 people who have met the screening criteria for being potentially overseas have confirmed their presence in New Zealand and received at least one payment. Result of implementing screening checks 12. As a result of the screening checks implemented after payment one, 416,846 payments to the value of $48,632,022.51 were excluded from being automatically released. 13. A total of 10,220 payments were subsequently able to be released to the value of $1,324,163.85, after customers confirmed their presence in New Zealand. Repayments and compliance approach 14. As at 3 July 2023, 13,271 customers have made repayments, including voluntary action, to the value of $1,611,063. 15. Inland Revenue’s compliance approach consisted of sending letters asking for repayments to those who received one, or more, payments but who were later identified as potentially ineligible. Inland Revenue sent 86,551 of these letters. 16. Of those who received letters, 9,860 repaid the payment (or payments) they had received, to the total value of $1,199,311. 17. Cabinet agreed that payments made to ineligible customers would not be recovered unless Inland Revenue determined that information provided was fraudulent \[CAB- 22-MIN-0130 refers\]. Consistent with the intent of the Cost of Living payment scheme, the Commissioner used his discretion under section 6A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to only use his collection powers where there was suspected fraudulent activity. 18. The criteria and parameters of the Cost of Living Payment Scheme means the risk of wide-scale Cost of Living payment fraud is reduced. Inland Revenue monitors compliance risk, such as identify theft as part of its regular compliance activities, which includes the Cost of Living payment. 19. As of 18 July 2023, there are 840 customers who have filed income tax returns and are potentially eligible for the Cost of Living payment. However, processing of these returns cannot be completed as further information is needed. Number of customers who opted out of receiving payments 20.

Some eligible customers have not yet received the Cost of Living payment as they have not provided Inland Revenue with bank account information. Customers will have until 31 March 2024 to provide this information. 23. As of 3 July 2023, there are 67,000 individuals waiting to be made to customers who have not provided Inland Revenue with bank account information to the value of $23,644,217. Original estimated eligible population compared to final eligible population 24. Based on Inland Revenue administrative data (adjusted for labour force participation increase) from the 2019-20 tax year, it was estimated that up to 2.1 million individuals could be eligible for the Cost of Living payment \[IR2022/163 refers\]. 25. Based on data as of 3 July 2023, 1.70 million individuals have received one, or more, of the Cost of Living payments. 26. There are a number of factors that can explain the difference between these two numbers. Mainly, after the initial payment was made, screening checks were introduced to provide additional confidence that those receiving the payment were eligible. This means that the parameters used for the original estimate in the initial policy advice are different to those that were applied to the payment scheme in practice. 27. Original estimates were developed based on administrative income data from the 2019-20 tax year. Since then, incomes have increased due to wage inflation, and this may have resulted in a smaller number of individuals having an income under the $70,000 threshold. Customer sentiment 28. Throughout the Cost of Living payment process, Inland Revenue received positive feedback from recipients on the impact the scheme had in their lives. 29. Recipients expressed gratitude for the payment, with some acknowledging the payment made a “very big difference” or helped them to pay for necessities such as groceries. Next steps 30. The end of the filing period for the 2021-22 tax year means no new individuals can be considered for eligibility. 31. The Cost of Living Payment Scheme closes on 31 March 2024. 32. The next steps in the administration of the Cost of Living payment are: 32.1 Continue to process remaining returns to determine if further individuals are eligible to receive the payment. 32.2 Make payments to eligible customers who have not received their payment until the 31 March 2024 end date. 32.3 Utilise normal channels to collect bank account information from eligible customers who have not yet supplied Inland Revenue with this information. Bank account details must be supplied to Inland Revenue before the 31 March 2024 end date.
