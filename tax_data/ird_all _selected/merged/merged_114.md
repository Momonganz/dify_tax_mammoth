We hel p p eople kn ow and understand their rights and responsibilities, to take steps to act on these, and to connect with additional community services they may need. Our service is delivered from over 80 locations around Aotearoa by over 2,000 trained CAB volunteers . 3. In the past financial year, amidst the ongoing challenges presented by COVID-19, our CAB volunteers assisted with over 250,000 client interactions across the range of issues that affect people in their daily lives. Each time a person seeks help from our service, we record anonymised details of their enquiry into a national database. This gives us unique information about the issues affecting people in communities nationwide. When we see that policies or laws are not working well for people, we act as a voice for positive social change. 4.F or this submission, we have chosen to focus mainly on debt to the Ministry of Social Development (MSD), though some of our observations and recommendations also apply to debt to other government agencies. Principle s for creating and managing debt The principles of fairness, and of minimising hardship 5. Given that most benefits – even with recent increases – do no t meet the basic cost of living 1 , by definition, individuals and households dependent on benefits as their main so urce of income are in hardship. We ask; is it fair for people in hardship who need further financial assistance for covering necessities e.g. bond, power, white ware etc. to 1 Fairer Future, ‘What are Liveable Incomes in 2022: Discussion Paper and Methodology’, 2022. 1. 2 have to take out loans from MSD for these things? Clearly, this exacerbates people’s financial distress. We believe that a principle within our social welfare system should be that assistance for people on benefits and low incomes for covering the costs of necessities should not place recipients into (or further into) debt. 6. We also believe that the principle of hardship should have the goal of helping to prevent - rather than minimise - hardship. This should be a goal of government and of our welfare system, and fundamental to the approach to debt to government for those on income support and low incomes. 7. We therefore recommend the following wording change for the hardship principle: Preventing hardship - The creation of a debt in the first instance, as well as the terms of its repayment should not place people into hardship or exacerbate existing hardship. Agencies should administer financial assistance and debt in a way that is appropriate for the individual’s circumstances as a whole. This means not seeking to recover grants for necessities which cannot be afforded out of the recipient’s income, and considering whether taking on further debt for other costs will have a negative impact on that person or their dependants. The principle of behavioural responses 8. The context for this framework is that people on income support and low incomes are struggling because their income does not cover all basic expenses and so often their only option is to incur debt to allow them to cover these needs. Or people may find themselves in debt from overpayments due to the complexity of the system and their difficulty in understanding and navigating it, poor communication by the government agency on individuals’ obligations, time delays in processing client information, and administrative errors. In our experience, the vast majority of people are not incurring debt to government “because they expect not to have to repay it” but because they had no choice of avoiding the debt. While we agree that the system should not lead people towards taking on unsustainable debt or running up debt inappropriately, our view is that applying the aim to “incentivise positive behaviours” within this principle is not necessary or appropriate for most debtors. 9. The key issue we see through our work with clients is not a need for incentivising certain financial behaviours of individuals and whānau, but rather addressing the government policy an d practice which leads low income people into debt and financial distress in the first place - in particular, in relation to insufficient income support levels, the use of recoverable support (loans) - as opposed to non-recoverable grants - for necessary expenses that cannot be covered by existing income, and unfairly placing the costs of 3 system issues (such as those described above) onto individuals and whānau - who are least equipped to shoulder that burden. 10. To avoid the potential risks alluded to under this principle in terms of people running up debt inappropriately, we believe that the hardship principle in fact already addresses this in relation to the provision of financial assistance e.g. in requiring that the administration of debt is done “in a way that is appropriate for the individual’s circumstances as a whole, including whether taking on further debt will have a negative impact on that person or their dependants.” 11. Therefore, we ask that income support is not highlighted in this principle, the example of write-offs or policies relating to recoverable versus non-recoverable support is removed, and the principle is balanced by including the need to consider wellbeing. Purpose-centred approach The types of debt owed to government Intentional non-compliance - 12. While we understand that intentional non-compliance can occur, we also know that the proportion of debt to government which is incurred in an intentionally dishonest way is extremely low. We are concerned that there is an outsized focus on this issue in New Zealand politics (and therefore in the media and public discourse) - a focus we believe to be driven by political expediency and which plays into ignorance and prejudice. These attitudes should not be allowed to drive government policy, especially within this context where the majority of those affected are people living in hardship. 13. With regards to “non-compliance” what we most commonly see within our service is overpayments that have occurred when overly complex and poorly explained government processes and systems interact with changing circumstances eg changes in employment, accommodation, and child support, leading to the creation of hidden debts that are then clawed back much later. In our view, this is a key area where progress could be made by government ie through clearer and more coordinated cross- government processes and systems that avoid overpayments of benefits and tax. We see that there is far more to be gained by focusing on these matters than there is by focusing on individual behaviour for the purposes of addressing intentional non- compliance. We would therefore counsel that caution should be applied to implementation of the debt framework, to ensure that it does not reflect an outsized focus on intentional non-compliance. Recommended arrangements for creating and managing debt 4 Other policy factors to consider - Creation of debt 14. It is our view that additional financial assistance for people in hardship - those on income support and on low incomes that do not meet basic expenses - not take the form of recoverable grants (loans) . The current system of recoverable grants for such expenditure is placing people who are already in hardship deeper into poverty and a cycle of debt from which it is difficult to escape. If there is no change to the approach to grants within the welfare system, (or to ensuring sufficient levels of income support in the first place), this will limit the effectiveness of other measures within this proposed framework as means for providing relief for people and helping them to move forward in life. 15. We therefore recommend as an addition to the policy factors listed in the proposed framework the inclusion of: Creation of debt - What government financial assistance should take the form of recoverable versus non- recoverable grants? Is it appropriate for government to claw back grants for necessary expenditure from people on incomes that do not cover all basic costs? Communication to individuals and whānau 16. We see the impacts on families of the debt incurred from over payments for Income Support and Working for Families. Typically, the clients we see who have been overpaid did not realise this was happening nor do they understand why it has happened, and the notification comes as a shock. Most of these families are only just getting by and an unforeseen debt like this – which for many of these clients runs into the multiple thousands of dollars – brings with it the prospect of ongoing financial stress. 17. For example, we see clients on Working for Families Tax Credits who thought that Inland Revenue automatically knows when they have a change in income because they are paying tax on their income and IR has all of their wage and salary information. They have therefore not understood IR must be notified of a change in their family income. This means some families are overpaid for substantial periods of time, resulting in large debts when the overpayments are finally discovered. 18. Our experience with clients suggests that information about obligations to inform agencies when circumstances change is not always getting through and that (i) more could be done to ensure people are aware of and understand their obligations, including through multiple channels that include person-to-person and face-to-face 5 communication, and (ii) treatment of debt must include consideration of whether obligations have been communicated effectively. We note that para 4.20 in the proposed framework alludes to the communication problems that exist within current systems. 19. We therefore recommend as an addition to the policy factors listed in the proposed framework the inclusion of: Communication - How well are agencies communicating with individuals and whānau about their obligations to notify agencies of changes in their circumstances which may impact their entitlements? Are agencies taking a proactive, multi-channel, plain language approach to communication to ensure people are aware of and understand their obligations? Recommended treatments Recommended treatments for overpayments of government support - 20. We agree that a lower threshold for write-offs is appropriate, especially where repayments will undermine income adequacy. We agree that write-off should be the default response if over-payment is due to administrative error - but would add it should also be the default response if (i) recipients’ obligations were not communicated sufficiently to ensure their awareness and understanding of their obligations ie not communicated proactively and directly to the recipient, in a timely way, via multiple channels using plain language, or (ii) the individual receives income support or is on a low income that does not cover basic expenses. 21. For overpayments that are not written off, we agree that interest should not be charged, ability to pay is the key consideration for the timespan of the repayment, and penalties should not generally be applied. Recommended treatment for loans or repayments for services provided or funded by the Crown - 22. We r efer to points made previously in this paper regarding the appropriateness of providing additional financial assistance as recoverable grants (loans) for people on income support or on low incomes that do not cover basic expenses. These are people who are in hardship. It is our view that it is not ethical for additional financial assistance that is compensating for lack of adequate main income to be made in the form of recoverable grants (loans). 23. For other additional financial assistance, we agree that charging interest is inappropriate 6 for lower income households, and we believe that timespan for repayment should be extended or deferred if to do otherwise would cause or exacerbate hardship, that write- offs are appropriate in cases of hardship, and we agree that where hardship exists it may be app ropriate to write off penalties. Person-centred approach Assessing hardship 24. In terms of establishing methods for assessing financial circumstances and ability to meet repayments, the work of the Fairer Future collaboration will be of use here. 2 In 2022, Fairer Future released its analysis of income support rates against the cost of living, using the Beneficiary Household Living Cost Price Index . The data showed that, even after increases to income support in April 2022, 12 of the 13 households modelled would receive less income than they needed to cover their basic costs. 3 If even low repayments of debt are factored in, none of the 13 households would be able to meet their costs. 4 For some households, the average weekly deficit was in excess of $300. 5 25. We expect that with the inflationary and cost of living increases that have occurred since that time - even factoring in the further increases that have been made to state financial assistance over the period - the deficits are likely to be greater (and to continue to grow). The data suggests to us that it should be taken as read that if a household’s main source of income is income support, the household is in hardship. Other measures Wiping debt to the Ministry of Social Development 26. The questions this consultation addresses highlight the unfairness and inequities of the welfare system - the way that debt is created and treated within this system by the state, and the impacts on people’s lives of the debts people are currently carrying. It is our position that the debt framework should be implemented hand-in-hand with the wiping of debt owed to MSD. This would reduce hardship , provide some justice for the many whose debts have arisen from inadequate support and system failings, and it would maximise the impact this framework can have. 27. Debt to the Ministry of Social Development is a particularly heavy burden for the populat ion, with around 461,000 people - or almost 1 in 10 of the population - owing 2 Fairer Future is a network of community organisations advocating for liveable incomes for all, and CABNZ is a member of the network. 3 Fairer Future, Liveable incomes in 2022, 2022, p.1 4 Ibid 5 Fairer Future, Liveable incomes in 2022, 2022, p.9 7 debt to MSD as of 2020, with an average debt per household of over $3,500 (and these figures are likely to now be higher). 6 Behind these figures are real people whose lives and f utures are being impacted negatively by the debt and who are feeling, as the Fairer Future 2023 report on debt observes, “the shame, the stress, the pain of not being able to provide for loved ones, the feeling of being weighed down.” 7 28. As pointed to earlier in this paper, much of that debt has been unfairly placed on people, through overpayments that have occurred as a result of unclear communication from the government agency, delays in processing client updates when circumstances have changed, or administrative error, and through recoverable grants (loans) that are made as a result of people’s incomes being insufficient to cover basic costs. However, as the Fairer Future report on debt observes, apportioning responsibility for the creation of debt \[particularly in relation to overpayments\] is a complex exercise. 8 As the report recommends, “it would be administratively simpler, and beneficial for all involved, for the government to wipe all debt owed to MSD, acknowledging the hardship faced and enabling a fresh start for those dealing with overpayments or attempting to repay recoverable financial support.” 9 In terms of how this can be done, we point you to the Fairer Future debt report for further detail. 10 Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the proposed framework for debt to government.

We support this because the whānau we work with regularly face challenges with inconsistent process for the creation and collection of debt to government; they are often already in financial hardship; and the lending processes often sit outside what is deemed responsible lending under the CCCFA. We see huge cost to our clients, both monetary and emotional from debt to government where there is power imbalance, no ability to communicate / negotiate a debt and sometimes a lack of understanding from the operators about what the debt is for. A particular example from our service is where a prisoner was considering Bankruptcy, but we needed to find out what their MSD debt was (how much and what type). The information provided by their local W&I branch advised the debt was over $70 000 but could not verify if it would be included in Bankruptcy. Upon checking with a contact through the Insolvency & Trustee Service (ITS) we were able to establish that the debt was just over $13 000, and all included in Bankruptcy. This raises alarm bells at the level of understanding of the internal reporting tools, but also a concern that prisoners must pay old government debt after serving a lengthy sentence. Other concerns are when dealing with IRD – there is no real way for Financial Mentors / Budget Advisors to assist clients. A recent client has submitted an appeal against her outstanding income tax (she had incorrectly declared income that was actually her own money coming from an investment in South Africa) with our assistance, and including me becoming an agent, yet she still received an overdue payment reminder while she was in hospital post knee surgery. With other creditors we would be contacting the Commerce Commission to complain about the length of time to respond and the harassment while under review. Finally, being under financial hardship costs our community. When parents are spending their money paying W&I back for essentials, it means their children miss out on other opportunities. Most people are trying to do their best, and when we operate under a punitive model, there seems little point in trying. Just like when you only punish a child, they are unlikely to excel, we need to find a carrot approach to resolve government debt for our people. Ngā mihi Heather Lange Manager and Financial Mentor / Budget Advisor . 6 April 2023 Debt to Government consultation Inland Revenue Department By email: debttogovernment@ird.govt.nz The Financial Services Federation (FSF) is grateful to the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) for providing us with the opportunity to reply to the consultation paper: A proposed framework for debt to government. We note that the consultation paper was released in February, however, we have only become aware of its existence since 3 April and consultation closes on 6 April. This consequently allows a very tight timeframe for developing our response to the consultation and, as a result, less opportunity to obtain feedback from our members than would be ideal for a matter as important as this one. We also note that the consultation paper requests feedback from agencies and community groups. Given that the consultation paper seems to refer to “agencies” as being those government agencies that provide debt, and community groups are presumably those who assist individuals to manage their debt and their relationship with creditors, it appears to the FSF that an important sector whose perspective on the consultation might be pertinent and of interest to officials, has been omitted. By way of background, the FSF is the industry body representing responsible and ethical non-bank lenders operating in New Zealand and these include providers of finance to consumers and businesses, fleet and asset leasing providers, and credit-related insurance providers. We have over 90 members and affiliates providing these products to more than 1.7 million New Zealand consumers and businesses. Our affiliate members include internationally recognised legal and consulting partners. A list of our members is attached as Appendix A. Data relating to the extent to which FSF members (excluding Affiliate members) contribute to New Zealand consumers, society, and business is attached as Appendix B. You will see from Appendix A that the FSF also has among its membership a number of debt collection agencies, some of whom are already contracted to government agencies from time to time to assist them in recovering debt. Prior to answering the questions posed in the consultation paper, the FSF would like to start by saying that our members take their obligations to responsibly provide access to credit to consumers very seriously. As you will be aware the legislation that governs the way in which 3. consumer credit is provided in New Zealand – the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003 (CCCFA) – underwent a significant overhaul which resulted in substantial changes to the Act itself, new regulations governing such areas as the way in which assessment of loan suitability and affordability is carried out, and an updated Responsible Lending Code to give guidance to lenders as to how they meet their added responsibilities under this legislation – all of which came into force with effect from 1 December 2021. The amended legislation also provides for very significant penalties to be applied to the senior managers and directors of lenders who are found to be in breach of their obligations under the CCCFA. These cannot be insured against or indemnified in any way and this is further strong incentive – apart from the need to ensure that consumers are not provided with unaffordable debt (which, apart from being unethical, is unsustainable from a business perspective) or debt which might place the borrower into substantial hardship – for lenders to ensure that they make the best possible decisions with respect to approving or declining loan applications. The regulations specifying the way in which lenders are required to assess that the loan will be affordable to the borrower without them suffering substantial hardship are particularly prescriptive and onerous on the lender. Lenders will therefore do everything they can to understand the borrower’s individual situation including the consideration of all existing debt commitments the borrower already has. Lenders will complete credit checks through one or other of the three credit reporting agencies operating in New Zealand: Equifax, Illion and Centrix – all of whom are also Affiliate members of the FSF. However, these credit checks cannot provide a complete picture of the indebtedness of all borrowers because debt to government is not reported to the credit reporting agencies. Therefore, lenders are not able to take into account all the debt a large number of borrowers might already have if debt to government is not proactively disclosed. The FSF therefore strongly believes that debt to government should be being reported to a credit reporting agency in order that all lenders (including the banks) can make fully informed decisions as to the affordability of a loan to a particular borrower as they are in possession of the full facts of individual borrowers’ indebtedness. This would alleviate the possibility of lenders providing credit to borrowers when not in possession of the full facts relating to their indebtedness that, if approved, could place the borrower in a position of substantial hardship. Further, the FSF applauds government for considering appropriate ethical principles for the responsible collection of debt to government, the framework suggested in the paper is not sufficiently specific or clear as to exactly it is proposed that the framework will work in practice. A lot of work is required to correctly match data and categorise a debtor as to whether they have the ability to repay debt, or not, or whether they are just not willing to repay it. Time and experience in the science of debt collection is required to determine what category a debtor falls into and consequently how the individual debtor needs to be treated. To this point, the FSF is surprised that the principles for managing debt do not create an explicit expectation that debt owed to the Crown is paid. There should be a clear expectation for those that can meet their commitments to government do so. The consultation paper includes appropriate detail on how those who cannot pay their debt should be treated under hardship, but is light on detail as to the expectations of those who can pay their debt but do not actually do so. The FSF notes that there is an overall lack of detail in the consultation paper with respect to how the framework is actually proposed to work. For example it does not specify that the granting and taking on of debt should be a contractual arrangement between the government and the debtor. It would seem to the FSF that this should be made clear and that contractual terms should be applied consistently across all types of government debt. The FSF will now turn our attention to the matters raised in the consultation paper itself. The FSF notes at para 1.8 of the consultation paper that one of the suggestions of the Tax Working Group was to establish ‘a single centralised Crown debt collection agency’ as a possible solution to the lack of clarity or inconsistency from the perspective of an individual with debts to multiple agencies. The FSF can certainly see benefits to such individuals in a consistent approach being applied with respect to debt across multiple government agencies, but the FSF questions whether in fact the government should be in the business of debt collection at all. It would seem to the FSF that the government should be in the business of providing services to New Zealanders and therefore serious consideration should be given to outsourcing the debt collection activities of all government agencies to specialist debt collection agencies who could have a picture of all the debt to government of each individual and apply a consistent approach to the collection of such debt. This would ensure the implementation of the framework proposed in the summary of proposals in paras 1.11 and 1.12. The FSF strongly advocates to government that the outsourcing of debt collection activities with respect to government debt be seriously considered to achieve consistency in the handling of debt to government. This approach would save the government from having to replicate the expertise and systems that already exist in the private sector but which does not currently exist within government agencies. Specialist debt collection agencies have trained staff; systems and technology; the ability to recognise, understand and manage situations where debtors may be in hardship; expertise in drawing up contracts to ensure appropriate disclosure to debtors; and many other areas of expertise that does not naturally sit within government agencies at present. With respect to the questions posed in the consultation paper, the FSF offers the following answers. • Do you have any comments on the principles as outlined? The FSF believes that the principles outlined in para 2.3 of the consultation paper seem reasonable but agrees with the assertion that they may sometimes conflict and might need to be traded off against one another. However, the FSF is concerned that the principle of minimising hardship may not be achievable. Whilst we would agree that, as far as possible, the creation of a debt in the first instance as well as the terms of its repayment should not place people into hardship or exacerbate existing hardship, is certainly a laudable principle, it could practically be very hard to achieve with respect to debt to government. As an example, debt provided by the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) by way of emergency support would only be provided in circumstances where the individual was already in financial hardship and therefore it could be said that, from the outset, it would exacerbate existing hardship. Given that, in such circumstances and others that are similar, it would be impossible to avoid hardship, it might be better in the FSF’s view to delete the principle with respect to minimising hardship. A better way to include such a principle could be to require government agencies to have regard to minimising hardship wherever possible. The FSF agrees with the remaining principles as outlined in the consultation paper but refers to the comments made above with respect to the fact that the FSF does not believe that government agencies should have as part of their core business the business of debt collection and that this should be outsourced to agencies who are experts in the field. This would ensure that the principles of public value and transparency in particular are achievable. • Do you agree with the concept of principles? The FSF agrees with the concept of principles as representing overarching values that apply generally to all categories of debt. • Have we described the principles accurately in your view? If not, how would you reframe them? Please refer to the answer provided to the first question above. • Do you have any comments on the different kinds of debt, their different purposes, and different treatments? The FSF questions why MSD debt provided through Work and Income NZ (WINZ) in the form of recoverable assistance or benefit advances is not included in the categories of debt that can be owed to government. Without having access to relevant figures, it would be safe to assume that the amount owed by way of such assistance or advance is significant. It would be particularly helpful to lenders to be able to access information about the level of a person’s indebtedness under this type of debt in the same way as lenders are able to do with outstanding penalties or infringement information through the Ministry of Justice (MoJ). As mentioned previously, this could be achieved by way of a requirement that government debt be reported to the three credit reporting agencies in the same way as other consumer debt is currently. This would allow all lenders access to the full picture of a person’s indebtedness at the time of applying for further credit and lead to more informed lending decisions and consequently less potential harm to consumers, particularly those in more vulnerable circumstances. • Are the right categories identified? Please see the answer to the previous question. • Are there other policy factors that should be considered? The FSF commends the work by officials in considering the recommended treatments for each category of debt in para 3.2 of the consultation paper, however, believes that there should be clear guidance as to the adding of costs to the debts, when default listings should occur, when and what legal action should be taken for each category of debt, what further support should be provided to debtors, when additional rights the government may have are to be utilised etc. The government has extra powers afforded in some legislation that are not afforded to the private sector, for example. These include a right to an attachment order without a Court judgment, tax offsets and travel restrictions as examples. Those rights should also be considered within the policy factors for each debt category, particularly when considering the action to be taken in the case of debtors who can pay but who will not. • Do you have any feedback on the recommended treatments? Again, the FSF believes that the recommended treatments for each type of debt have been well considered by officials (notwithstanding the fact that the FSF also believes that MSD recoverable assistance or benefit advances should be included as a debt class of its own as previously stated). However, the FSF has one question with respect to when or if interest should continue to be charged in the event that the individual is in hardship or is unable to meet the agreed repayment schedule. Compounding interest can lead to a person already in hardship being put in a worse position that becomes very hard for the individual to get out of and consideration should be given to at what point the government would be comfortable with ceasing the charging of interest on a compounding basis for each class of debt outlined in the consultation paper. The CCCFA requires that lenders cannot continue to charge interest and fees once recovery action has been commenced to avoid the compounding of interest and it seems to the FSF that consideration should be given to applying similar boundaries here to avoid worsening an existing hardship situation. • Is it easy for debtors to understand what they owe, and to who? The FSF agrees with the ‘person-centred’ approach proposed in the consultation paper that places the individual and their whanau at the centre of decision-making when debts are created or collected. This would obviously require that debtors clearly understand what they owe and to whom. The consultation paper does not touch on the disclosure requirements with respect to the key information that should be provided to debtors when they incur government debt and suggests that officials look to the disclosure requirements of the CCCFA as a model for the way in which disclosure of important information such as how much is owed, to whom, the applicable rate of interest, term of the loan, repayment amount etc, should be made. Further, the FSF reiterates our earlier point that we believe that debt to government should be reported via credit reporting agencies. This would appear to be exactly in line with a ‘person-centred’ approach which places the individual and their whanau at the centre of decision-making. This is because without understanding the debtor’s entire financial position, no-one (including government) can make an informed decision relating to an individual’s financial position. The FSF believes that both the government and private sector lenders should have access to information about a person’s full indebtedness in order to make the best possible lending decisions. Not doing so can lead to debtors obtaining credit they are unable to manage impacting their ability to repay and placing them in hardship from the outset. The FSF understands that government quite rightly could have some privacy concerns with respect to reporting government debt via a credit reporting agency but one way to appease these would be for total crown debt to be reported in a single figure (or even two consolidated figures – government debt being paid and government debt not being paid). A further consideration with respect to the reporting of government debt to credit reporting agencies is that the Credit Reporting Privacy Code overseen and enforced by the Office of the Privacy Commission governs the way in which credit reporting agencies operate in New Zealand. It allows for both the reporting of negative credit information about a person (arrears, defaults, judgments, etc.) and the reporting of positive credit information about a person’s repayment history etc. Positive credit reporting (or comprehensive credit reporting) information can significantly enhance a person’s credit score if they are meeting their commitments to creditors and therefore a person’s positive repayment record with respect to government debt should allow them to take advantage of this. • Are minimum debt repayment amounts typically set at manageable levels? Given the proposed ‘person-centric’ approach, it would be hoped that debt repayment levels would be set at manageable levels taking into consideration the individual’s circumstances including their existing fixed expenses and commitments including rent, food, power, phone, other existing debt commitments etc. Again, the FSF refers officials to the requirements of the CCCFA with respect to the assessment of affordability as a means to ensure that debt repayment amounts are set at manageable levels for the individual concerned. • How easy is it for debtors to negotiate for hardship relief? In the FSF’s experience, it is often not an easy process for debtors to negotiate for hardship relief on their own behalf. There are often feelings of shame with respect to the debt itself or the need to request hardship relief. There may be a lack of awareness that a hardship process exists, or it may be that some people choose to ignore their debt until it becomes unmanageable. In any event, the process to apply for hardship relief should be made as easy as possible. Again, the FSF stresses the need for people experienced in managing debt and assessing hardship requests to be involved in this process or even to run the process on behalf of government. Once again, the FSF submits that this is not core government expertise and reiterates the view that the framework should be being managed by specialist debt collection agencies whose staff are trained and expert in recognising signs of hardship and sensitively managing it on an individual basis. Outsourcing agreements could include an appropriate remuneration structure that incentivises the identification of hardship and adherence to the principles of the framework with the ability for the government to change the debt collection contractor if this is not found to be the case. The FSF sees the Tax Working Group’s suggestion outlined in para 1.8 of the consultation paper to establish ‘a single centralised Crown debt collection agency’ as being the next best possible way to ensure a consistent and empathetic approach to people with debt to government if the suggestion that recovery of government debt be outsourced to specialist debt collection agencies is not taken up. The FSF believes that an All of Government approach to debt collection should be the goal to ensure consistency of approach towards debtors. This does require specialist advice and continuously improved tools to get it right. To ensure that debt collection methods remain socially responsible, the government needs to consider processes and tools such as robotic process automation, machine learning, artificial intelligence, psychology and data security and frankly, the FSF does not believe the government is an expert in these fields, so it is imperative that government takes advice from experts skilled in the use of such technologies. The FSF notes under para 4.4(d) the fact that consideration should be given to when it might be appropriate to refer debtors to financial capability support services or other services that might support households in hardship or at risk of hardship. The FSF has had a Memorandum of Understanding in place with FinCap, the national umbrella group for financial mentors in New Zealand and the lead agency for the MoneyTalks support service, for a number of years. Through this MoU, and now as a requirement in the CCCFA, FSF members have proactively referred their customers to the support provided by FinCap mentors and the MoneyTalks helpline service whenever a borrower is exhibiting signs of repayment difficulties. The earlier in the process the referral is made the better the outcome for both borrower and lender and the FSF fully supports the provision of such support for individuals with debt to government. The FSF believes that either outsourcing the recovery of debt to government to suitably trained and experienced agencies or setting up a single centralised Crown debt collection agency staffed with people who have expertise and experience in the sensitive handling of people with problem debt together with an existing close working relationship with the FinCap financial mentor network and the MoneyTalks helpline is the best way to ensure the goal of a ‘person-centred’ approach is achieved. The FSF sees a real risk that the time it would take for government to internally develop the systems and capability and resources required to manage debt to government will cause short to medium term deterioration in the outcomes for those people the framework is designed to help. • What kinds of supports are most effective for people with persistent debt? The key to ensuring that people are not put in a position where they have persistent debt that can rapidly become unmanageable would be to apply a CCCFA lens to the affordability of the debt in the first place. This should take into consideration all existing financial commitments and outgoings including existing debt that will not be repaid by the provision of government debt or advances. Apart from the CCCFA providing a framework for the way in which debt affordability assessments should be carried out, it also seems to the FSF that in the interests of meeting the underlying principle of fairness for the overall debt to government programme, the Crown’s approach to providing debt should meet the same obligations as are imposed on the public sector. The FSF also believes that in the spirit of fairness, private sector lenders should be given access to information about the government debt a person is liable for through a credit check with a credit reporting agency so that they also have a full picture of a prospective borrower’s full indebtedness in order to be able to make a more informed lending decision. Once a loan has been provided, however, it is not uncommon for a person’s circumstances to change due to relationship breakdown, loss of work or hours or work, illness, homelessness or a number of other factors. This is why there needs to be a robust hardship process for the management of government debt that is run by people experienced in managing these customer relationships and a process in place for people with persistent debt to be able to access appropriate financial mentoring assistance as previously mentioned. • What changes would you like to see to the way that the government manages debts, particularly debt owed by low-income households? The FSF considers that this is dependent on the type of debt owed and the circumstances of the individual debtor. Arguably people accessing debt through MSD’s recoverable assistance or benefit advances are more likely to be people from low-income households who access this type of assistance often as a last resort because they are ineligible to access credit from other sources, particularly since the tightening up of the CCCFA regime in December 2021. Serious consideration needs to be given to how or even if these debts are likely to be repaid when they are being applied for and a very sympathetic approach needs to be applied to people in this situation. Different circumstances and processes might apply for people with government debt in other scenarios who may not be people from low-income households such as those who have government debt by way of fines or penalties or tax arrears for example. Certainly the FSF believes that, if people have the ability to repay debt, the government should vigorously ensure that they meet their commitments. • Should there be non-monetary options for paying down fines or debt? How could this work? What potential benefits or risks do you see with this idea? The FSF notes that para 4.19 of the consultation paper suggests that non-financial penalties could be applied where an agency has the discretion to do so but it is not clear as to what these non-financial penalties might look like. It is therefore difficult to consider non- monetary options when none have been provided. The FSF promotes a responsible and sympathetic approach to the management of debt particularly when a borrower is experiencing hardship or vulnerability. However, the FSF cautions that there are always people who try to exploit this sympathetic approach to avoid the repayment of debt they owe and could reasonably be expected to repay. There is a high level of skill built from years of experience in judging circumstances where the borrower is genuine and others where the person is trying to avoid their responsibilities. This is why the FSF is particularly keen to see that any government debt recovery operation is run by people with the necessary skills and experience to make such judgement calls. Impact of the framework on affected population groups: The FSF understands that some population groups are significantly impacted by debt including the groups outlined in para 5.1 of the consultation paper. The FSF also agrees that any framework for the recovery of debt to government should be appropriately sensitive to the way in which it interacts with these diverse population groups. Next steps: The FSF notes once again that we have come to this consultation very late in the piece and apologises for the somewhat rushed submission that has resulted from this. The very tight timeframe has allowed us to have very limited consultation with our members although we have targeted specific groups of the membership for feedback such as debt collection agencies and credit reporting agencies who we believe would be most interested in being part of this consultation process. The FSF believes that more work needs to be done on the detail of the framework and how it will actually work in practice before it is adopted by Cabinet as a policy tool. The FSF would be interested in providing further assistance by being part of that development work. Thank you again for the opportunity for the FSF to submit on this consultation. Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can provide any further information or input. Lyn McMorran EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR Appendix A Appendix B 5 April 2023 Submitted via: debttogovernment@ird.govt.nz A proposed framework for debt to government Inland Revenue, Te Tari Taake Wellington RE: A proposed framework for debt to government No child should have to go without essentials because government departments are creating and collecting debt that was always going to be unaffordable. Debt to government is creating distrust and harm for whānau that are trying to engage with the systems that are meant to support them. FinCap welcomes this work on the proposed framework for debt to government (Proposed Framework). Issues with debt to government are regularly raised by financial mentors. Inconsistencies and errors within the current system need urgent attention as they are currently causing, and have caused for decades, harm to whānau across Aotearoa. We strongly recommend that clear policy and legislative changes be urgently implemented in line with this framework to address the issues that are causing the most harm. Future work that complies with this framework must prevent money continuously being taken from the pockets of whānau, especially during this time of added cost-of-living pressure. About FinCap FinCap (the National Building Financial Capability Charitable Trust) is a registered charity and the umbrella organisation supporting the 190 local, free financial mentoring services across Aotearoa. These services support more than 70,000 people in financial hardship annually. We lead the sector in the training and development of financial mentors, the collection and analysis of client data and encourage collaboration between services. We advocate on issues affecting whānau to influence system-level change to reduce the causes of financial hardship. General comments Debt to government is causing harm to many whānau across Aotearoa. According to several reports and Insight Briefs by the Social Wellbeing Agency (SWA) debt to government is impacting women 1 , Māori 2 , and children especially. Of the people that owe debt to government 62% are parents or share an address with a child. This debt to government work is therefore clearly crucial for addressing child poverty. 3 1 See https://swa.govt.nz/assets/The-persistence-of-debt-to-government-research-report.pdf 2 See https://www.dpmc.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2022-02/proactive-release-reducing-impact-of-debt-to-government- 3feb22.pdf 3 See https://swa.govt.nz/assets/Children-and-debt-Insights-report.pdf 4. 2 The amount of debt that whānau have to government departments is exacerbating harm. According to one of the reports by the SWA the median debt to the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) is around $1,000 per person. 4 Although the majority of debts owed to government are less than $5,000, we have heard from financial mentors that some of their clients have debt to MSD of up to $80,000. We have been able to gain insights about debt to government through Client Voices, the financial mentor data base. Those that are presenting to financial mentors are almost always already in, or facing, potential hardship and are seeking support. The below figures are based on cases closed between 1 January and 31 December 2022. All Clearly noting debt to government Clearly noting debt to MSD Clearly noting debt to MOJ Clearly noting debt to Kainga Ora Number of client cases in sample 18,119 6,878 5,334 2,211 286 Percentage cases with last budget in deficit 52.39% 55.4% 56.06% 57.09% 63.74% Number of cases that have started an insolvency procedure 228 135 70 47 4 From this data we can see that people with debt to government were more likely to close with a deficit budget. We can also see that a significant proportion of whānau working with financial mentors and going through insolvency have debt to government where insolvency indicates that paying debt would cause substantial hardship. Children in Aotearoa need to be able to thrive, play, learn and explore, and the wellbeing of their whānau is often the key determinant of this. Through the insights of financial mentors, Client Voices data and research, FinCap has found debt to government to be a key barrier to the wellbeing of children and the prosperity of whānau in Aotearoa. Chapter 2 - Principles for creating and managing debt: Q1. Do you have any comments on the principles as outlined? Q2. Do you agree with the concept of principles? If so, are these the correct principles? What have we omitted? Q3. Have we described the principles accurately in your view? If not, how would you reframe them? Responses to the proposed principles We support the principle of fairness, and later sections of this submission highlight current issues that show why a focus on fairness is needed. We strongly recommend that the principle of fairness should include obligations to treat debt from legacy policy with fairness and in line with changes that are made to the treatment of current debt. 4 See https://swa.govt.nz/assets/Publications/reports/Understanding-debt-and-debtors-to-government.pdf 3 For example, the 70a sanction that punished parents for not naming the other parent of their child caused immense harm. 5 When this policy changed, there were wait times for refunds and harm remained for many. Hardship compounds due to debt caused as a consequence of the sanctions, and refunds are not always sufficient to cover issues caused by compounding hardship. This harm can stay with whānau for years and cause ongoing challenges and barriers. It is crucial that changes to harmful policies include appropriate support and robust processes for providing swift refunds for all those that were impacted. We strongly support the inclusion of minimising hardship as a principle in the Proposed Framework. However, we strongly recommend that it is adjusted to specifically define hardship in line with capabilities for assessing affordability. Hardship should be seen as a situation where whānau are unable to meet non-discretionary expenses. We recommend the below definition for non- discretionary expenses: Expenses that the borrower does not have complete agency to cease without significant detriment, meaning the expense interacts with: a) Rules, whether contractual, social, cultural, or moral obligations b) The physical or mental health, and wellbeing of the borrower c) The wellbeing of that borrower’s whānau, dependents and pets d) Social and cultural connectedness. We also recommend that the principle of minimising hardship should be the dominant principle, in combination with fairness, when there is a possible trade-off. The principle of minimising hardship should outweigh other considerations, such as behavioural responses, when considering the outcome for whānau. We recommend that the principle of behavioural responses be readdressed to promote higher trust. This principle should always be the lesser considered principle compared to minimising hardship. Our recommendations throughout this submission about implementing affordability assessments provide a practical method for prioritising the principle of minimising hardship. We strongly support the mention in the principle of public value that write-off options provide efficient relief. We recommend that there be further emphasis on the harm caused to whānau by chasing debt in this principle. Debt can create unnecessary stress for whānau, especially when it is debt that was always going to unaffordable to repay. These factors should be core considerations in this principle. Transparency is a crucial principle and should be implemented to lower the barriers to understanding the creation and collection of debt. We also recommend that this principle directs government departments to consider power imbalances and to implement processes for ensuring that whānau have informed consent wherever a debt is created. This recommendation aligns strongly too, with the principle of fairness. We recommend that the principles be enforced consistently and with robust requirements and processes across all government departments in their daily operations. There should be a specific regular public report on alignment and re-alignment once the framework is implemented. These principles and the responding approaches and actions should be universal across all departments. 5 See https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/checkpoint/audio/2018802991/woman-sanctioned-by-msd-over-fear- of-naming-child-s-father-owed-thousands 4 Chapter 3 – purpose-centred approach Q4. Do you have any comments on the different kinds of debt, their different purposes, and different treatments? Q5. Are the right categories identified? We support the categories of debt for consideration and appreciate that this Proposed Framework is focused on central government. However, financial mentors often also report concerns with the rigid way in which many councils create and collect debt and how this can compound the hardship the whānau they work with are already facing. We therefore recommend that it is considered as an additional category or type of debt. We recommend that the Proposed Framework should apply more widely to local government and include requirements for universal hardship policies at councils. Whānau that are having payment difficulty should be able to have a breathing space. Hardship policies outline expectations on councils to consider applications on grounds of hardship, to make changes to payment timeframes or amounts to suit a whānau are having payment difficulty. Fees should also be waived where there’s no net benefit in pursuing them. We have heard that debt collection by councils is often far from best practice, and the Proposed Framework should cover councils as well as central government. Libraries have led the way and ceased with giving out fines 6 , and councils have in place a rates rebate scheme for those on low incomes. 7 If the rates rebate scheme can be implemented for homeowners, then there should be support across councils that provides relief for all, whether homeowners or renters. We respond in more detail below, under questions 6 and 7 in particular, to the specific consideration and treatments of different categories of debt to government. Recommendation: Apply the Proposed Framework to councils and ensure that there are better practice hardship policies at all councils. Q6. Are there other policy factors that should be considered? We support the policy factors that have been considered. However, we also make the below recommendations to strengthen the Proposed Framework and promote further consistency across government departments and their treatment of debt. The sections below under this question address consistency across all government departments. This proposed framework is a great step towards addressing consistency and we support that compliance with this framework will direct any decisions on issues of debt to government. However, we recommend that this framework sets concrete and consistent expectations across departments that the creation and collection of debt must be focused on wellbeing. The recommendations that we make below are focused on achieving this consistently. One core entity We understand from the Proposed Framework document that the previously recommended approach of one core Crown debt collection agency is not being considered further. However, we recommend that consideration of some form of core operations entity be made. There are many issues with the sharing of information and privacy across departments. However, these are key 6 See https://www.horowhenua.govt.nz/News-Events/News/Horowhenua-libraries-to-remove-overdue-fines 7 See https://www.govt.nz/browse/housing-and-property/getting-help-with-housing/getting-a-rates-rebate/what-is-a- rates-rebate/ 5 considerations for financial mentors and the whānau they work with. The lack of transparency is causing higher repayment rates than is affordable, overpayment debt and the need for repeat disclosure which can be re-traumatising and harmful. We recommend that IR be considered a central point for ensuring that people's information is correct consistently. There should also be a flagging process for changes to circumstances as well as updating affordability assessments and ensuring that the combined debt between departments is not exceeding the client's affordability threshold. The recommendations given throughout this submission could apply to either one collection entity, or else to all departments to process consistently in a manner as if they are one entity. Recommendation: Consider IR as a central point for core operations of debt to government. Protected income Currently, those on benefits are receiving very low incomes that do not meet the costs of living. 8 Debt to government being taken from benefits significantly increases hardship. We strongly recommend that a protected income approach be established and that debt repayments to government are not taken from benefits or equally low incomes. This recommendation is in-line with calls made by Child Poverty Action Group to cease the collection of debts from beneficiaries in order to prevent further exacerbation of child poverty in Aotearoa. Additionally, the incomes of those on equally low incomes should also be protected. For those that have debt to government but are receiving higher incomes, repayments should not exceed 4% of their budgeted surplus and affordability assessments for repayments should be completed for each and every case (discussed further below). The protected income approach also aligns with our recommendations relating to attachment orders, which can be found under question 7. Recommendation: Implement a protected income approach so that debt repayments to government are not taken from beneficiaries or those on equally low incomes. Waiving unaffordable debt Long-term problem debt becomes an unnecessary and harmful burden for whānau. It creates stress and a feeling of little control over the financial capability of a whānau. Research by the Social Wellbeing Agency shows that those that do not become debt free within two years have a greater than 65 percent chance of remaining in debt for at least the next three years. 9 We recommend that debt held for over two years with little likelihood of prompt repayment is written off. The two-year timeframe that we are recommending could be used as a structured timeline for readdressing the ability of the debtor to repay their debt. This approach would be a backstop to the protected income approach (recommended above under this same question), for those that have changes in circumstances and move above the protected income threshold. Robust affordability assessments throughout the process would help to prevent issues with behavioural responses where people might be disincentivised to repay their loans. Affordability assessments should be completed at the start of any debt being created, as well as continuously throughout the life of a debt. If at two years there is little likelihood of prompt repayment and the debt is only causing harm to a whānau that has no ability to repay, it should be written-off. We comment further on affordability assessments below. 8 See https://fairerfuture.org.nz/liveable-incomes-2022 9 See https://www.taxpolicy.IR.govt.nz/publications/2022/ 6 There are legislative changes needed to ensure that all government departments have consistent and fair capabilities to waive debt or fees where there is risk of hardship. Currently, IR has legislative powers to write-off penalties and interest related to tax debt. 10 MSD has very limited powers for writing off debt. This inconsistency should be addressed so that all government departments have the power to write off principal debt, fees, and penalties where there is the prospect or reality of hardship. Recommendation: Waive debt that is held for two years with little prospect of prompt repayment. Affordability assessments This section responds to Chapter 4 of the Proposed Framework as well as to this question 6. FinCap welcomes the comments particularly in 4.14, that hardship should be the basis for relief. We therefore provide this section to support this and recommend an approach for assessing affordability. We support the focus on hardship throughout the Proposed Framework and the efforts in ensuring that there are robust processes for assessing and responding to hardship, to promote financial wellbeing. We recommend that affordability assessments be consistently implemented for all repayments of debt to government departments, in-line with the Responsible Lending Code. 11 It's important that we clarify that affordability assessments should not ever prevent whānau from accessing essentials (see our recommendation below under question 7). However, it should mean that any repayments whānau have to make now, and in the future, do not push them into hardship. Affordability assessments need to thoroughly consider the real life expenses that are necessary for whānau to live their lives without hardship. We therefore recommend the following definition of discretionary expenses when assessing for affordability: Expenses that the borrower does not have complete agency to cease without significant detriment, meaning the expense that interacts with: a) Rules, whether contractual, social, cultural, or moral obligations b) The physical or mental health, and wellbeing of the borrower c) The wellbeing of that borrowers whānau, dependents and pets d) Social and cultural connectedness. Affordability assessments should be a key practice across all government departments to ensure that repayments are affordable, and to create a threshold for waiving debt. Affordability assessments should be implemented for all debt categories, whether it’s for repayments for loans, overpayment debt, fines, or debt occurring from non-compliance. They should also be applied to all repayments, whether these are being made by beneficiaries or those on wages or salary incomes. Under question 9 of this submission, we address the issues that are occurring with repayment amounts being set at unaffordable levels. Current practice for assessing affordability and lowering repayment amounts appears to be inconsistent, which leaves room for unfair consequences to arise. Stable processes for assessing affordability across all departments for all repayments will increase fairness and ensure that even when other errors may have occurred whānau will always be making repayments that are affordable. For some, affordability assessments will show that they cannot 10 See footnote 12, page 14 https://swa.govt.nz/assets/Publications/reports/Understanding-debt-and-debtors-to- government.pdf 11 See https://www.mbie.govt.nz/assets/responsible-lending-code.pdf 7 make any repayment. For these situations, we refer to our above recommendation of the protected income approach and our recommendation about waiving unaffordable debt. Recommendation: Implement affordability assessments across all government departments for all repayments. Priority phone lines In conjunction with commitment 3 of New Zealand’s Fourth National Action Plan to establish a multi- channelled approach to accessing public services and support, we recommend that direct phone lines for financial mentors to MSD and IR are established. A direct phone line for financial mentors is of net benefit as financial mentoring sessions are Government funded. Rather than spending up to several hours waiting on hold, the financial mentor and whānau they are working with could use the session more effectively and reach support directly. Financial mentors have repeatedly mentioned that the extensive wait time on the phone to Inland Revenue (IR) and Work and Income (W&I) is disruptive to the support they are providing to whānau. Self-service phone line options have become available for accessing certain IR tools. However, the self-service options are limited and do not provide access to important tools, such as the ability to change income details. W&I have a similar self-service option; however, this offers fewer options for clients calling for support. This highlights the inconsistencies between government departments which are often used simultaneously by whānau accessing welfare support. Furthermore, although the self-service system may be beneficial to many, it should not be solely relied upon to fill the communication gap. Financial mentors have mentioned that whānau often want to speak to a ‘real’ person on the phone. This preference is more probable when a whānau has had negative experiences in the past, such as having to pay back overpayment debt to government due to a misunderstanding of complex expectations and rules. 12 There should also be the option for anyone to request an outbound call. The onus should be on the government department to call them back and talk them through any issue. A direct phone line to MSD and IR for financial mentors would help to ease these challenges for whānau and financial mentors. This would create a more efficient and effective system, that allows financial mentors to help solve issues that are time pressured and ensure that the wellbeing of the whānau they work with is not jeopardised. This also enables whānau agency, as they can be on the phone together with the financial mentor. An additional issue with the access to services over the phone, is the application of fees when paying a late payment fee via the phone with IR. This fee seems counterproductive considering the likelihood that these payments are already unaffordable if they have already been paid late. Recommendation: Implement a priority phone line for financial mentors to MSD/W&I and IR. Case manager training Case managers at all government departments and agencies make a huge difference in the outcomes for whānau. Currently, there are massive inconsistencies across case managers and their knowledge, care, and ability to support whānau. Financial mentors have raised that some case managers have difficulty understanding the standard budget that financial mentors complete with 12 See http://www.weag.govt.nz/assets/documents/WEAG-report/aed960c3ce/WEAG-Report.pdf 8 their mutual clients. This is a particular issue when together they are assessing the client’s level of hardship and ability to repay. As mentioned at point 4.21 of the Proposed Framework, agencies should consider what other support might be available to whānau. It is important the case managers understand the role of financial mentors so that they can refer on appropriately. It should be compulsory that case managers complete training on the Building Financial Capability (BFC) strategy and on the ground supports to strengthen understanding and create consistency. If all case managers understand what financial mentors do, how to work with them for better outcomes and what the impacts of hardship are for whānau then the work of both will together achieve better outcomes. Recommendation: improve training for case managers so that there’s consistency across the country and for all whānau seeking support. Sustainable funding Financial mentors across Aotearoa are supporting whānau with the challenges tied to the increasing cost of living. Over this same period, financial mentoring services have begun to feel the same pressure of the cost-of-living increase as other sectors, particularly in terms of office space, utilities and wages. Additional to these direct cost pressures, services are reporting a general decline in available volunteer resources as the sector ages and as volunteers have to decrease their unpaid hours. Where possible these volunteer hours will be filled by paid staff. The sector is delivering clear and measurable financial benefits to whānau and communities - particularly the most vulnerable in Aotearoa. Many of these benefits will be mitigating cost in other sectors of the Government’s social spend, and all of these benefits are improving the quality of life of whānau in the face of intense cost of living pressure. Given the measurable benefits provided by financial mentoring services, the increased financial pressures being faced by an increasing number of whānau, it is clear that the additional funding requested represents extremely high value spend. Financial mentors provide crucial support to whānau in navigating their benefit entitlements and overcoming barriers for their clients when engaging with government departments. At 4.4d of the Proposed Framework there is consideration of agencies including “an assessment of whether or not debtors are receiving their full and correct entitlements from government agencies.” Financial mentors are currently filling this gap and supporting whānau to check they are receiving all that they are eligible for. Although this should be a given step at all agencies, where there are hiccups, financial mentors are best placed to help. The Proposed Framework is a huge step in the right direction, but there will always be ‘hiccups’ in systems that need addressing. As highlighted throughout this submission, financial mentors have specialist expertise and can limit and prevent harm caused by debt to government. Financial mentors are key in addressing debt to government issues and should have sustainable funding in order to continue their important work. Recommendation: Increase funding to reach all 190 financial mentoring services to meet the growing demand. For current levels of service, the recommended total per annum is $51.6m, and total over a four-year period of $206.4m. 9 Q7. Do you have any feedback on the recommended treatments? Overpayment of government support Response to the Proposed Framework Issues with overpayment debt are constantly raised by financial mentors. Many financial mentors have mentioned that their clients try hard not to incur overpayment debt and are updating their details regularly, however, they still end up with overpayment debt. This is especially difficult for those working on casual contracts where their work hours can change drastically each week. We generally support the recommended treatment of overpayment debt. We agree that there should be no interest or penalties applied to this category of debt. However, we recommend that the timeframe and write-off threshold treatments be re-written to more clearly require consideration of these options where hardship is a potential. Grace periods and abatement rates A grace period is the additional time given to a person to notify departments about changes in circumstances without incurring fees or debt. Time-limited grace periods across the social security system to smooth the times where changes occur would provide a breathing space for whānau. The Welfare Expert Advisory Group in 2019 recommended improvements to the relationship rules system. An element of this recommendation was the establishment of grace periods for discussing the nature of their relationship with MSD to limit the stress of changes in income. This is an example of how the grace period concept can support whānau by giving more time to changes without adding the likelihood of debt being created. In 2021 grace periods were introduced to be applied to the Family Tax Credit for the In-Work Tax Credit where they continue to receive the payments for up to two weeks when taking an unpaid break from work. 13 This is another example of where the grace period concept has been implemented to support whānau during especially stressful times. We recommend the implementation of a four-week grace period across all entitlement when there are changes in circumstances, such as income. This is often where overpayment debt is created and through giving a grace period, whānau would have more time to organise and adapt to their changing circumstances without the pressure of possible debt. Financial mentors have also noted that the grace period would be useful for those that are receiving fortnightly income to limit the additional confusion that often occurs. Grace periods can be easily implemented across government departments. When a person notifies the government department that their circumstances have changed, they can identify when these changes began and how many weeks have passed. It would be straightforward to ensure that they are within the four-week timeframe. This would be simplified further if the approach of creating a core entity is followed. This way the core entity would be a one stop shop for reporting relevant information and having it flagged across all departments. We also recommend that debt collection should be paused while a client is waiting for an appointment. Where there are long wait times to get an appointment, and whānau are trying to sort difficult issues with any department, then debt collection should be paused. This aligns with the principles of minimising hardship as well as fairness. Collecting debts create additional stress 13 See https://www.taxpolicy.IR.govt.nz/news/2020/2020-05-29-work-tax-credit-grace-period 10 emotionally and financially to whānau, especially when they are simultaneously trying to determine a solution to an issue that may be connected to hardship in the first place. Alongside the implementation of grace periods abatement thresholds should be raised at the same rate as minimum wage. 14 The Labour Party’s 2020 manifesto committed to progressively increasing the abatement threshold in line with minimum wage increases. 15 This is an important commitment that should be continued. Recommendation: Implement four-week grace periods across all benefits to prevent overpayment debt. Information sharing and privacy While grace periods will support the limitation of overpayment debt being created and lessen stress, it does not address the entire issue. Information sharing across government departments is also crucial. With the review of child support in 2022, changes to the Approved Information Sharing Agreement 16 were consulted on, with the objective of IR and MSD sharing up to date information. This approach should be repeated across government departments to ensure that it is clear how much is being deducted already by other departments from a client’s income. This will help to ensure that the combined amount from departments is meeting affordability assessment requirements and does not breach their protected income. Excerpt of a financial mentor’s email: Also, the departments need to talk to each other. I have a client who did a DRO, including substantial W&I debt. They continue to lend to her! Alongside this recommendation, we note that financial mentors are regularly encountering barriers to supporting their clients because IR will not accept their privacy waivers. Instead, financial mentors are at times having to complete forms that place them in an unideal situation to continue supporting their clients. We recommend that IR accepts the privacy waivers of financial mentors or works closely with financial mentors to find a suitable alternative that makes the communications clear and efficient. Recommendation: Improve information sharing between and within government departments. This issue of information sharing would also be improved with our recommendation of IR as the core entity. Government department caused debt MSD is under duty to take all reasonably practicable steps to recover sums that are specified as debts due to the Crown (overpayments or penalties). However, W&I cannot recover a debt that was caused by a mistake on its part, and wasn’t contributed to by the client, and where the client received the payment in good faith and changed their position, it would be unfair to recover it. 17 14 See https://www.msd.govt.nz/documents/about-msd-and-our-work/ 15 See https://www.taxpolicy.IR.govt.nz/publications/2021/2021 16 See https://www.privacy.org.nz/privacy-act-2020/information-sharing/approved-information-sharing-agreements/ 17 See https://communitylaw.org.nz/community-law-manual/chapter-23-dealing-with-work-and-income/trouble-with- work-and-income-penalties-investigations-and-overpayments/overpayments-when-youre-paid-too-much-by-mistake/ 11 Financial mentors have raised that the processes for identifying and waiving debt that is caused by a departments error are inconsistent. Financial mentors often go through the review of decision process with the whānau they work with to get overpayment debts waived where it’s the fault of the department. However, outcomes regularly differ. In addition, financial mentors find that many whānau are reluctant to go to review of decision because of fear of repercussions whether real or perceived. This highlights the presence of power imbalances and issues of unfairness. All government departments should be proactively identifying and waiving debt that they have caused, instead of the burden being placed on whānau and financial mentors to overturn debt that was not legally recoverable in the first place. This should be the case where debt has been partially caused by government departments too, especially considering the principle of fairness as well as the power imbalance issues previously discussed. Debt caused wholly or in part by government departments is completely unfair and there are still many whānau repaying these debts. This needs urgent and immediate attention and reversal. Debts that are caused wholly or in part by government departments need to be identified, waived or reimbursed if they have already been repaid. These are not legally recoverable debts and so should never be repaid. Where the systems of government departments are unable to effectively identify debts that have been caused by its error, they should waive and reimburse all overpayment debts in order to fulfil the principle of fairness, as well as minimising hardship. Recommendation: Proactively waive and reimburse any debt that is caused wholly or in part by government departments. Debt occurring from loans or repayments for services Response to the Proposed Framework (question 7 continued) There should never be penalties or interest applied to loans or repayments for services. These are essential expenses that whānau need for their wellbeing and should never have additional costs applied to these. We recommend that the language used here is stronger, and in line with our previous recommendation that hardship should be the dominant principle. We recommend that where the word ‘may’ be used it is replaced with ‘will.’ Consistent non-recoverable grants for essentials In the Proposed Framework, section 3.12 notes that “government should consider whether it is appropriate for certain forms of assistance to be repayable at all.” No whānau should be pushed into unaffordable debt in order to obtain the most basic essentials. The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet’s work looking at children’s wellbeing in the first 1000 days highlights the importance of all children having the essentials so that they can have the best start possible. Therefore, non- recoverable grants should be available for essentials. At the same time, affordability assessments to determine the recoverability of additional supports should implemented. Currently benefit advances can be accessed as interest-free loans taken out by beneficiaries to pay for essential or emergency costs such as bonds/rent, car repairs, or school costs. These should be available through non-recoverable grants at W&I. Loans for whānau to afford essentials such as school costs should not be creating debt spirals and taking from the next weeks food budget. To implement a clear and consistent process for non-recoverable grants for essentials, there needs to be an understanding of ‘essential expenses’ that supports financial wellbeing, rather than the 12 bare minimum requirements for survival. For example, the ministerial direction for redirections defines essential costs in relation to a person, as electricity, gas, and water. Meanwhile, on the W&I website living expenses include food, accommodation costs and school costs. 18 Although these resources serve very different purposes, it emphasizes how the understandings and definitions of essential costs or expenses is unclear for whānau trying to get access to essentials. We recommend that essential expenses are defined in line with the definition given under questions 1-3 and under question 6, ‘affordability assessments’, for defining discretionary expenses. We also recommend that the DEP-17 questions in the Stats NZ ‘Measuring child poverty: material hardship’ should be used as guidance for what are considered essential expenses. For example, the Stats NZ questions highlight that there are more considerations to a child’s wellbeing than just whether they have food, but whether that food has nutritional value. It also references whether the whānau can afford to purchase gifts for birthdays and Christmas. This is an important expense that contributes to the social wellbeing and inclusion of a whānau and can at times be underrated as an essential expense. Essential expenses should be clearly listed consistently across government websites and communications. The availability of these essentials through non-recoverable grants should also be made obvious. There will likely be considerations necessary for the number of times that certain items can be accessed through non-recoverable grants. Affordability assessments would be a helpful tool for assessing eligibility for non-recoverable grants, and for repeat access. Recommendation: Make all essential expenses available through non-recoverable grants. Use the affordability assessment approach to determine when support for expenses outside of the definition are recoverable or not. Quality of essential services It seems that often the easiest and cheapest options for essential services and products are provided for whānau when they request support. Financial mentors have noted that time is wasted through faulty products that do not suit the purpose for whānau. For example, financial mentors have mentioned that it’s common for clients to receive support for repeat fixes to cars, but a longer-term approach for that client might mean a new car rather than repeatedly fixing a broken one. For many, public transport is not a reliable option, especially for those with children or those in smaller towns. It is therefore important to understand that a car is the most practical transportation option for many, and there should be suitable support available. These needs will clearly differ between clients, but all staff should be well trained to identify suitable solutions for whānau rather than band aids that will only extend hardship. Here is a case study that exemplifies the challenges for whānau when items are not up to standard and become more of a challenge rather than being helpful. Case study: A client was granted a fridge-freezer through work and income through the Fisher and Paykel whiteware relationship in March 2021. On April 2 nd the fridge-freezer started playing up. A technician visited and said that a part was required but will not be available until June. The client was not sure whether it was an electrical fault or not. If it was an electrical fault, it may have been harmful to their family and possibly cause a fire. 18 See https://www.workandincome.govt.nz/eligibility/living-expenses/index.html 13 The client is now paying off a faulty fridge-freezer to W&I. This appliance should have been replaced as it was less than 30 days old. The financial mentor sent an email to the regional W&I contact but also spent 38 minutes on hold and then was hung up on by Fisher and Paykel. The client was told not to contact W&I but has still not had any success with Fisher and Paykel. It is important that the circumstances and needs of each whānau are carefully assessed, and the appropriate and most helpful services and products are provided. As shown in the above case study, faulty products create additional stress. All whānau should have options for items and services that suit them best. We also note that recent draft recommendations from the Energy Hardship panel propose several strategies related to MSD and government support. 19 One proposal is that MSD programmes for purchasing energy-related household appliances offer energy efficient choices. Another recommendation is to establish clear and direct lines of communications between MSD and customers in energy hardship. Additionally, they propose that extra Government financial support is provided to those in energy hardship and better targeting of the Winter Energy Payment (WEP). We recognise here too that benefits and income should be increased in the first place, so that whānau can afford these essential expenses. Increasing benefits would save time and stress and would pair well with the below recommendation about a savings scheme approach to strengthen financial capability. We comment further on benefit increases under question 11. Recommendation: Ensure that products quality is up to standard and train all staff to assess the needs of each whānau appropriately so that whānau have a choice in options. Recommendation: Implement the proposed strategies of the Energy Hardship Panel to provide energy efficient choices through W&I. Savings As a back-drop, we recommend that MSD creates a savings system rather than debt system for whānau. This would both support building financial capability and follow a strengths-based rather than deficit-based approach. This would sit alongside work to make essentials available through grants, so that any additional items or where any limits are met for repeat access whānau could use savings that have been built on their accounts. Alongside this, the Community Services card should also be used to support whānau with the essentials. The income threshold for eligibility for the cards should be lifted and indexed if not already. The services that are available through these cards should be increased to meet the needs of whānau. Recommendation: Create a savings scheme approach instead of a deficit-based approach to accessing support from government departments. 19 See https://www.mbie.govt.nz/assets/energy-hardship-the-challenges-and-a-way-forward-energy-hardship-expert- panel-discussion-paper.pdf 14 Private debt administered by a government department Attachment orders To our understanding of the definition provided, attachment orders would fall into the category of Government-administered debt between private parties. Attachment orders tell an employer or W&I to take money directly from a debtors benefit or wages to repay a creditor. 20 Financial mentors regularly see situations where Attachment Orders from the courts are causing hardship through taking up to 40 per cent of a person’s benefit wages. There has also been evidence to show that lenders have targeted women and beneficiaries using attachment orders. 21 This particular case study is a quote from a lender, stating that they find “going for women is best because they are more likely to be beneficiaries.” This is referring to attaching This appalling behaviour demonstrates that attachment orders are being used as punitive tools that can be taken advantage of by irresponsible and oppressive lenders. FinCap has identified private creditors who appear to be exploiting the attachment order system. These businesses are all receiving over a million dollars in payments each year despite the original debts often dating back to questionable lending over a decade ago. The current system results in MSD having no option but to pay creditors whose conduct has been questionable through court ordered redirections. We strongly recommend the implementation of a judgement proof debtor policy for private debt. 22 In the state of Victoria in Australia the Judgement Debt Recovery Act was implemented in 1984. 23 This Act stipulates that instalment orders cannot be applied to incomes that are derived solely from a pension or benefit. For this to be replicated in Aotearoa, the District Court Act 2016 needs amending to protect W&I incomes and prevent continued hardship. Section 157 (4) should be deleted, and section 155 should be amended with the addition of the following signal to relevant requirements in other legislation: “(5) This section is subject to s 417 of the Social Security Act 2018.” We also recommend that this category be separated further so that child support and attachment orders are considered and treated separately. Attachment orders are an outdated punitive debt collection tool, while child support is a necessary support for children and whānau in single parent households. Recommendation: Implement a Judgement Proof Debtor policy to protect benefit incomes from attachment orders. Chapter 4 – person-centred approach Q8. Is it easy for debtors to understand what they owe, and to who? The ‘cheap as’ data approach which allows access to MSD online and website services for free is a step towards increasing access and understanding. 24 From feedback from financial mentors the websites and online services, for example MyIR and MyMSD are useful tools once they know how to navigate them. However, they are not very user friendly or clear, and take time to understand. Mentors have noted that whānau can find it difficult to see clearly how much debt they are in and what this is for when using these services. 20 See https://www.justice.govt.nz/fines/about-civil-debt/collect- 21 See https://www.nzpif.org.nz/news/view/53815 22 See Judgement Proof Debtor Policy 23 See http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol\_act/jdra1984237/ 24 See Work and Income cheap as data 15 There are also issues with the language that is used, which is often inconsistent, confusing, and technical at times. We welcome the recognition of this at 4.20 of the Proposed Framework. For many, the language that is used by government departments that are placing them into debt is unclear. Plain language should be used across all government departments as a step towards increasing true accessibility. It is often not obvious that support from MSD is a loan, rather than a grant. This means that whānau are not able to give informed consent at these times. This again highlights the need for more process for assessing affordability and ensuring that non-recoverable grants are given for essentials, and that debt be wiped. Lenders in Aotearoa must act in line with the responsible lending principles in the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act (CCCFA). One requirement is that lenders must help whānau to understand what is being signed before it is signed while applying for lending. This same requirement should be implemented at all government departments when they are creating any kind of debt. Under the CCCFA, lender’s behaviour must be fair and oppressive behaviour is illegal. One example of oppressive behaviour is pressuring people to sign contracts with no time to consider or get advice. Although loans given by government departments can differ to those that are provided through consumer credit contracts, the same principles and requirements should apply. There are still processes here and informing people properly about what they are signing and why they are in debt is crucial. This also connects to the principle of transparency and highlights the importance of making processes clear and using plain language. This is important both on the online access as well as in- person or on the phone. Staff at W&I need to have correct and up to date knowledge and consistent processes in place to ensure that potential confusion is avoided at each step. Recommendation: Ensure that plain language is used consistently across government departments and in particular where there is the potential for debt being created. Q9. Are minimum debt repayment amounts typically set at manageable levels? We have heard repeatedly from financial mentors that repayment amounts are set at unaffordable levels, without any proper process for assessing affordability. Financial mentors have also raised issues with inconsistency between case managers and their ability or willingness to lower repayment rates to an affordable level. Case study: A client is in Work and Income had an income from W&I of $521. They were living in W&I accredited accommodation and charged $420 a week for rent, for a single room, and then their internet was $45 a week, electricity $21. Their repayments to W&I were automatically set at $30.50 as well as a $5 weekly repayment to MOJ. There was no affordability assessment and until the financial mentor was able to step-in, the client was in an impossible situation with a budget in deficit. Through insights from Client Voices we can see that the median weekly repayment rate per case for all debts is $68.95. There’s a jump for median repayments per case when government debt repayments are included. The median weekly repayment per case including debt to government is $92.51. Broken down by department, where a debt is owed to MSD the median weekly repayment is $85.95. The same for MOJ is $109.86 and $169.24 for Kāinga Ora. At the same time, 55.23% of 16 clients with debt to MSD are earning income from a government entitlement. This shows that many are repaying large amounts of debt each week, while many are also on benefits. Previous guidance for MSD includes a recommended maximum recovery rate for current clients. This recommended maximum rate is $40 a week, unless it is volunteered by a client to pay more. 25 The Ministry’s policy also stipulates that repayment rates need to be realistic and not cause hardship. Considering that these requirements and recommendations are in place already, and that the insights from financial mentors show that recovery rates are not being set in line with these, there needs to be stronger requirements and enforcement of policies for ensuring affordable recovery rates at Ministry’s. Comments from a financial mentor: "The repayments are one of the first things I look at when doing a budget. One of my clients was paying $45 a week while on a benefit. Government departments need to discuss with clients about repayment affordability first, instead of automatically deducting from their income, sometimes being the cause of financial hardship". Comments from a financial mentor: "My thoughts are for MSD debt only; I think they should not put clients into substantial debt. Some people owe several thousand dollars e.g 20 K or more; there should be a cap of, say, 10K Also repayments should be capped at a certain level e.g. $20 weekly max. with typical repayments of, say, $5 or $10 weekly. The total debt owed to MSD is currently enormous and increasing continually; the government should write off all the debts and then start a new more conservative system." Recommendation: We reiterate the recommendations above. Firstly, that affordability assessments be implemented for all repayments. We also repeat the recommendation that debt be waived after two years where there is little likelihood of prompt repayment, and that a protected income approach be implemented for those on benefits or low income. Q10. How easy is it for debtors to negotiate for hardship relief? Financial mentors are often able to support their clients with negotiating hardship relief. However, there are barriers because of power imbalances that mean for many clients they have had trouble going through this process before they began seeing a financial mentor. There are also issues with past negative experiences causing harm to whānau and preventing them from seeking engagement with W&I even when they are in hardship. We also recommend here that debt collection should be paused while a client is waiting for an appointment. A financial mentor mentioned that their client waited five weeks for an appointment to work out issues with their rent payments, during this time their debt grew rapidly. Recommendation: pause debt collection while a client is waiting for an appointment. Q11. What kinds of supports are most effective for people with persistent debt? An important factor here is that for many incomes are too low to afford essentials, let alone repayments for debts. We again point to the importance of children having essentials, especially 25 Controller and Auditor-General - Part 3: How MSD manages debt 17 during the first 1000 days. All benefits should also be raised so that all whānau can afford the essentials. We also support the recommendation made by Child Poverty Action Group for the extension of the In-Work Tax Credit (IWTC) to all children in low-income households, regardless of the paid work status of their parent(s) or caregiver(s). 26 Please refer to above recommendations under questions 4-7 about access, overpayment, non- recoverable grants, and consistency. Q12. What changes would you like to see to the way that the government manages debts, particularly debt owed by low-income households? Please refer to above recommendations under questions 4-7 about access, overpayment, non- recoverable grants, and consistency. Q13. Should there be non-monetary options for paying down fines or debt? How could this work? What potential benefits or risks do you see with this idea? We have no comments to make here. Chapter 5 – Impact of the framework on affected population groups Q14. Do you agree that the framework should require culturally appropriate communications with debtors? What would this look like for Māori, Pasifika and other affected groups? Yes, we encourage further targeted consultation if not already under way with Māori and Pasifika experts. Q15. Are extended families and larger households affected differently by government debt? How could this be addressed in the framework? Whānau with more children are more affected by government debt. An Official Information Act (OIA) request about debt to government in Taitoko, Levin found that whānau there with five children have a greater debt burden compared to whānau without children or with less children. The graph below shows these insights for in Levin. 26 See https://www.cpag.org.nz/statistics/working-for-families Figure 1 - MSD debt Taitoko by number of children 18 We refer here to the recommendation that was made above, that debt held for over two years be waived where there is little prospect of prompt repayment. This would provide relief regardless of the makeup of the whānau as it is a proportionate response to affordability. Q16. Should the framework reference a specific role for whānau, hapū or iwi or other community groups in the resolution of problem debt? What would this look like? Please refer to our response under question 14. Q17. What issues are of most concern to the group that you represent? Please refer to the recommendations made under questions 4-7 about access, overpayment, non- recoverable grants, and consistency. Q18. Are they addressed by the proposed framework? It is important that the recommendations made under questions 4-7 about access, overpayment, non-recoverable grants, and consistency are implemented to address the most pressing issues with debt to government. Q19. Do you have comments on the ways to improve the accessibility of communications about debt for different population groups (for example, young people or disabled people?) Sustainable funding for all financial mentors in Aotearoa is necessary as a backstop for improving access to key information about debt to government. We also refer here to our recommendations under question 8. Q20. What improvements would you suggest? Please refer to our response under question 19. Chapter 6 – Next steps Q21. Do you have any comments on the proposed implementation of the framework, as outlined in Chapter One at 1.13 – 1.15 above? Issues with debt to government are urgent and causing harm to whānau in Aotearoa. The key recommendations given is this submission should be implemented at the earliest possible stage to limit continued harm. There needs to be robust review of policies and processes at all departments immediately once this framework is in place. We refer here again to the recommendation made under questions 1-3 that there be specific regular public report on alignment and re-alignment once the framework is implemented. Q22. Do you have any other feedback not covered by previous questions which you would like to provide? Social housing Several financial mentors and a social housing worker have raised serious concern over current processes for clients living in public (social) housing. Below is a case study that highlights the issue and how unfair this is for many clients as a way of debt being created. Case study: A client had to complete their tenancy review with MSD and give information about their situation and housing needs. As part of this process the client had to provide 52 weeks of income details, in order for MSD to assess the correct amount to charge. However, this client had language and mental health barriers to filling out the required 19 paperwork. Due to these barriers, the client could not full out the paperwork within the determined timeframe. When they missed the deadline, they began to be charged market rate rent, rather than the typical 25% of income rate for social housing. This meant that their rent went from $78 to $450 a week. The client found the process and paperwork difficult to understand but did manage to complete the paperwork and they found that the circumstances were the same and the rent price went back to 25%. The client ended up with $5500 of debt during the time that the paperwork was overdue. This debt was not waived despite it being evident by the time that it was completed that the client qualified for social housing. Financial mentors noted that for the clients in this situation, there are often language or mental health barriers to them filling out the paperwork. This is an unfair issue that should not be occuring. Where paperwork is not filled out in time, the whānau should be worked with to determine a solution rather than being pushed into debt. Charging market rate only causes harm and creates debt that will likely be unaffordable. Recommendation: Ensure that full market rate is never charged for social housing, and refund all those that have had a debt created because of this issue. Family violence policies Aotearoa is ranked as the worst developed country in the OECD for family violence. 27 Recent research shows that women who are exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) have an increased likelihood of reporting adverse health outcomes. 28 Financial mentors have raised issues with debt to government and family violence. Case study: A client was in a domestic violence situation and their abuser was using their money. The client applied for sole parent support because they wanted to be separated from their partner. However, the partner remained at the client’s address, despite this being unwanted. MSD created a debt with the client for seeking the “wrong” benefit type because the partner was still living in their home. This highlights the need for more secure systems to identify and support those experiencing family violence. It is crucial that essential service providers and government departments have robust family violence policies in place to help prevent and support after family violence. These policies should be included in the debt to government Proposed Framework, to create consistency across government departments to avoid creating and collecting debt in a harmful way where family violence occurs. 29 The Proposed framework should require all government departments implement clear and consistent policies that ensure they: • Are informed about the complexities and signs of family violence and seek advice to tailor their approach to best support their customers. • Avoid requiring evidence of family violence, so that responses are timely and prioritise the safety of the survivor-victim. 27 See https://goodshepherd.org.nz/economic-harm/ 28 See https://jamanetwork.com/journals 29 Genesis Energy forgives debts of women abused by partners through their “fresh start’ program. See more here https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/ 20 • Avoid repeat disclosure of circumstances. This can be traumatising and potentially creates a barrier to further support being sought. Some examples of solutions for this are referral arrangements and a dedicated phone line to flag the situation. • Implement systems for smooth referrals to expert support services. • Safely separate debt between the perpetrator and victim-survivor and implement processes for waiving debt for people affected by family violence. • Have effective processes for safety and protection of victim-survivors information. Ensure that information is kept confidential between account holders when it is requested. We recommend that the above policies, or similar, are implemented at all government departments so that family violence is consistently identified and addressed. Affordability assessments would be a helpful tool to provide the time and chance to probe into the financial situation of a whānau and instances of economic harm or family violence may be more visible through this process. 30 We refer again to the recommendation to implement affordability assessments across all government departments for all repayments. Recommendation: Implement family violence policies across all government departments. Debt to government and insolvency We are pleased to see the focus on clarifying categories of debt types to government departments. As well as the clarity for treatment of each category of debt, there are carry on benefits for insolvency processes. There have been issues raised by financial mentors where confused categories of debt create difficulty for clear insolvency procedures. While fraudulent debt is excluded from insolvency, overpayment debt is not listed as excluded. Financial mentors have raised cases where fraud debt is not correctly separated from overpayment debt, leading to overpayment debt not being wiped through insolvency procedures. 31 Fraudulent debt is defined as being incurred by fraud, for example if a person claimed a benefit from W&I that they knew they were not entitled to. 32 33 In the Proposed Framework the treatment of debt due to intentional non-compliance is severe. We recommend that in-line with the principle of minimising hardship, and with our recommendation of minimising hardship being the dominant principle, there should be options for write-offs and extending timeframes. Affordability assessments should also be implemented for repayments on these debts, in-line with our recommendation that they are applied to all repayments. We have heard repeatedly from financial mentors of the harm that is caused to whānau through generations with fraud debt sticking, and no way to remove it when it’s unaffordable. Under questions 1-3 we recommended a higher trust approach be implemented. Many whānau have experienced harm from debt to government departments, and a warmer approach to support wellbeing would minimise hardship, harm, and stress for many whānau. Recommendation: In order to fulfil the principle of minimising hardship, as well as our recommendation for a higher trust model, implement options for waiving fraud debt where there is hardship. 30 See https://www.informa.com.au/insight/financial-abuse-enablement-an-insidious-side-effect- 31 See https://www.insolvency.govt.nz/personal-debt/personal-insolvency-options/bankruptcy/ 32 See https://www.insolvency.govt.nz/support/glossary/#fraudulent-debt 33 Fraud debt must be proven and evidenced by MSD that a debt is a fraud debt and not overpayment or an error. 21 Debt collection practices Debt collection agencies used by government departments should be included under widespread regulation of debt collection. Research from Victoria University shows that inconsistencies exist between government departments and their use of Debt Collection Agencies (DCA’s). Affordability assessments are again an important tool for avoiding engagement with a DCA, as well as wider regulation to the entire debt collection industry which is overdue in Aotearoa. Recommendation: Create consistency as to when external debt collection agencies are engaged if at all and what standards they must meet. Ngā mihi, pp: Moana Andrew Kaihautu - Deputy CEO The Methodist Alliance/Ngā Purapura Weteriana P O Box 5416, Papanui, Christchurch Tel 03 375 0512 Feedback on the Proposed Framework for Debt to Government 6 April 2023 This submission is from: The Methodist Alliance P O Box 5416 Papanui Christchurch 8542 5. 2 1. Ko wai tātou | Who we are The Methodist Alliance is a formal alliance of Methodist Missions, parishes and community based social services and trusts, including cooperating ventures. This grouping constitutes a major provider of a range of services for tamariki/children, rangatahi/young people, and their families/whānau. The Methodist Alliance brings together a number of large and medium social service providers such as Lifewise in Auckland, Methodist City Action in Hamilton, Palmerston North Methodist Social Services, Wesley Community Action in Wellington, Christchurch Methodist Mission, Methodist Mission Southern in Dunedin, as well as local community services provided by individual parishes. It includes new social service organisations, such as Siaola Vahefonua Tongan Methodist Mission; Puna’Oa - the Samoan Methodist Mission that operates within the Samoan Synod of the Methodist Church; and Te Taha Māori. Ka whakahōnore mātou i tō mātou whakahoatanga Tiriti – we honour our Tiriti partnership. Te Tiriti o Waitangi is the covenant establishing our nation on the basis of a power-sharing relationship. It is the foundation for social, economic and political equality in Aotearoa New Zealand. The Methodist Alliance is grounded in our commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the bi- cultural journey of the Methodist Church of New Zealand - Te Hāhi Weteriana o Aotearoa, where Te Taha Māori and Tauiwi work in partnership. We claim the right bestowed by Article Four of Te Tiriti o Waitangi: “E mea ana te Kawana ko ngā whakapono katoa o Ingarangi, o ngā Weteriana, o Roma, me te ritenga Māori hoki e tiakina ngatahitia e ia.” “The Governor says the several faiths of England, of the Wesleyans, of Rome, and also the Māori custom shall alike be protected by him.” The Methodist Alliance and our member organisations work collaboratively to achieve our vision of a just and inclusive society in which all people flourish, through our commitment to our faith and Te Tiriti o Waitangi. 2. Tirohanga Whānau | Overview 2.1 We commend the work on a proposed framework to manage and prevent debt owed to government. The overarching goal of the proposed framework aligns with the Methodist Alliance’s vision for a just society in which all people flourish. 2.2 We note that there are many hidden benefits that would result from a fairer and consistent approach to debt. Sylvie said: 3 “Writing off debt would make a huge difference, emotionally and psychologically, and to your wellbeing. And we need less shame. My son has lived with the shame of his mum living on a benefit. I don’t socialise in person – living like this affects every part of your life. I just feel like I don’t have any power, including over my rent.” 1 “Wiping debt to MSD would have made a huge difference for everyone on the benefit, and I think about how if those in power covered everyone’s basics, we’d be an awesome country. We could do the things we really want to do - live, laugh and love!” 2 2.3 We acknowledge that every day of every week, staff in government agencies, just like staff in our member agencies, work with some of the most vulnerable and challenged individuals and whānau in our communities, and they do this because they care. 3. Tautoko mo te pire | Support for the Proposed Framework 3.1. The Methodist Alliance supports the following parts of the proposed framework for preventing and managing debt to government: 3.2. We support the overarching goal to: “reduce hardship for families and individuals and aims to achieve a fairer and more consistent approach to debt. This will contribute to the Government’s priority of improving child wellbeing through the reduction of child poverty.” 3 3.3. We agree with the summary of the issue being: “...debt can also become a problem when servicing it becomes an unaffordable or persistent burden. This problem debt can have a significant impact on individuals and whānau in hardship, contributing to financial hardship, stress, poor physical and mental health, stigma, and social exclusion.” 4 3.4. We also agree there is a lack of cohesion and consistency to the way debt to government is administered. 5 3.5. We agree that highly targeted support payments creates more opportunity for debts to arise than universal payments. 6 1 Fairer Futures, “Lifting the Weight Report” 2023, p6.

We support the recommended default write-off of debt that is an overpayment of government support arising from an administrative error. In these circumstances the debt has arisen due to the failure of the government agency to act on information provided, or another administrative error, and is no fault of the individual. Therefore the individual should not be held accountable for this error, as any “overpayment” was beyond their control. We agree that in these circumstances: “many recipients will have limited ability to make repayments at the time the debt arises or in the future.” 7 3.7. We agree that penalties should not be applied to overpayments of government support. 8 3.8. We support the person-centred approach to debt prevention and management. Placing individuals and whānau at the centre of decision-making when debt is both created and/or collected will ensure a holistic view and reduce risk of hardship or exacerbating hardship. 9 3.9. We support the person-centred approach that includes a comprehensive hardship assessment. 10 We note that if a single centralised Crown debt agency was established there would not be the need for information sharing agreements with other agencies. 3.10. We agree that consideration should be given to referring people to financial capability support services, 11 however Methodist organisations that provide strengths based financial support and mentoring services report that a common issue for many individuals and whānau they see is insufficient income to meet their needs. Most often people in receipt of a benefit are very good at stretching their very limited income to meet their needs as far as it can. “The money Igor owes MSD stems from several things. A few fines, loans to help him get by, loans for surprise bills, and then there’s the loans he’s taken out for dental work. With no interest and no new debt, it will take him around 390 weeks or seven and a half years to be debt free. 7 3.7 in the IRD Consultation Document, February 2023 8 3.8 in the IRD Consultation Document, February 2023 9 4.1 - 4.3 in the IRD Consultation Document, February 2023 10 4.4 c) in the IRD Consultation Document, February 2023 11 4.4 d), 4.21, & 4.22 in the IRD Consultation Document, February 2023 5 Igor says that he doesn’t mind paying the money back. What bothers him is that whenever benefits go up, he gets less in the hand. “My benefit went up, my rent went up, and the amount I had to repay went up. I wasn’t even much better off. I can never win,” he says. He says he doesn’t live day to day, dollar to dollar anymore, but the money he receives is barely enough.” 12 3.11. We support the person-centred approach that includes “an assessment of whether or not debtors are receiving their full and correct entitlements from government agencies.” 13 In our experience, people are not always aware of what supports they are eligible for and many struggle to negotiate the complexity of the support system. This complexity often leads to people not receiving all the help they need and that could make a significant difference in their lives. 3.12. We agree with the range of factors the assessment should consider as set out in 4.6 of the consultation document and have suggested some refinements in our recommendations. 3.13. We agree that any loan should not create or exacerbate hardship 14 and that alternatives such as non-recoverable grants be considered. 15 4. Taunakitanga | Recommendations 4.1. The Methodist Alliance supports the Tax Working Group’s recommendation to establish a single centralised Crown debt agency with consistent rules for treatment of debtors. We concur with the Tax Working Group that this would achieve economies of scale and more equitable outcomes across all Crown debtors. We believe that this would provide a holistic view that is needed when considering debt owed to government. 4.2. We note that the Welfare Expert Advisory Group (WEAG) also recommended a cross-government approach to managing debt to government agencies. 16 4.3. By rejecting the WEAG and Tax Advisory Group recommendations to establish a single cross-government debt collection agency, the proposed framework risks perpetuating the current siloed and agency-centric approach, rather than a holistic person-centred approach. Even small repayments from multiple agencies often 12 Fairer Futures, “Lifting the Weight Report” 2023, p13. Please note names have been changed to protect identity. 13 Ibid 14 4.9 in the IRD Consultation Document, February 2023 15 4.10 in the IRD Consultation Document, February 2023 16 Welfare Expert Advisory Group Report, “Whakamana Tāngata, Restoring the Dignity to Social Security in New Zealand,” February 2019, Recommendation 16, p22 6 add up to an unsustainable repayment regime for people living in material hardship. Unless a robust mechanism is established that considers total debt owed to all departments as a single liability it will not be possible to develop a fair and sustainable repayment process. This is because experience shows us that individual departmental drivers always trump joined up cross-government agreements. 4.4. We recommend that a single centralised Crown debt agency is established to have a holistic view of debt and to apply consistent treatment of debt. 4.5. A single centralised Crown debt agency would prevent inconsistencies that would probably arise if individual agencies were tasked with establishing methods to assess someone’s financial circumstances, their ability to meet repayment, and clear guidance around what constitutes hardship, as suggested in 4.8 of the consultation document. 4.6. We agree with the concept of the principles however, the right for the individual to be heard is missing. This is an essential principle of natural justice. We strongly recommend that the principles are expanded to include the debtor’s right to provide their view on the debt owed, how it arose, what they can afford to repay, and what they believe is fair in all their surrounding circumstances. 4.7. In addition, we recommend including a principle specifically relating to Te Tiriti o Waitangi as Māori comprise 44% of those with debt to all three agencies. 17 4.8. We note that the types of debt defined in the document is limited to that owed to central government and does not include debt owed to local government. It is not uncommon for people to owe debt to central, and local government, as well as many other agencies. 18 We recommend that a wider view of debt is taken when considering the ability of the individual to repay debt to ensure their income is sufficient to meet their needs and does not create further hardship. 4.9. Different government agencies have different legislative powers to forgive debt, or to take all practical steps to recover debt. 19 Payments under the Social Security Act 1964 are debts due to the Crown. 20 We recommend a more consistent approach to debt across government agencies. 17 Chapter 5 of the IRD Consultation Document, February 2023, p19 18 This includes payday loans, third tier lenders, mortgage, personal loans, etc. 19 MSD has limited powers to forgive debt and has a legislative duty under the Social Security Act 1964 to take all practical steps to recover debt and has only limited exceptions to forgive debt set out in s86(9A) and 9(B), and S132G. 20 S85A Social Security Act 1964 7 4.10. Further consideration needs to be given to how debt is formed. It is not fair or reasonable for an individual to incur debt if the government agency has failed to act when notified within time about a change in circumstances. We recommend that the first line of inquiry should be how the debt was formed. 4.11. We recommend that when “debt” arises due to an “overpayment of Government Support” which is wholly or in part the result of a government agency failing to act, or an administrative error, this debt should always be written off. 4.12. Working for Families, and other targeted support payments are very complex and difficult to understand and navigate, and we recommend there is further consideration of universal payments to simplify the welfare system and promote transparency and clarity for both people accessing support and those administering them. 4.13. We recommend and support the person-centred approach to debt prevention and management. 4.14. We recommend a grace period is provided for debt to be repaid before interest is incurred. 4.15. People are often eligible for additional support, but don’t receive this for a variety of reasons including trying to navigate the complexity of social support systems. We recommend that a reporting system is established to provide feedback to departments where debt has been incurred, so remedial action can be taken to address and close the gaps between eligibility and the support people actually receive. 4.16. We recommend this reporting includes the number of incidents where it is found that people were not in receipt of their full entitlement, and the quantum of the difference between what the person received and their full entitlement. 4.17. We recommend Work & Income includes a procedural step where staff confirm in writing that the person is receiving all the supports they are entitled to. This would provide reciprocity, as the recipients of support have to confirm that all the information they have provided to Work & Income is true and correct. It would also build up trust and confidence in the process of accessing social support services. 4.18. We understand that Work & Income look at the gross amount when assessing income. We recommend that this is changed to considering the net amount, as 8 this is the actual amount of money in the hand that people in receipt of a benefit have as income. 4.19. We recommend that the assessment of hardship 21 should include the whānau in the assessment. In particular, this is necessary when there are tamariki and rangatahi in the whānau, to ensure the government’s goals to reduce child poverty are met. 4.20. Where dependent tamariki are present in the whānau, we strongly recommend the needs of the tamariki are taken into account. Often tamariki will not attend school if they do not have the correct uniform, books etc. This is often viewed as truancy, when in reality it is a poverty issue. While it is possible to get funding from Work and Income for school costs, this is a debt that needs to be repaid. The assumption is that there is an adequate income to repay debt, when often the income derived from social security support is not enough to live on and cover all the needs of the whānau. 4.21. We recommend the assessment of financial hardship should also include consideration of whether the person’s income is secure or “casual” - where the income varies week to week. Insufficient and insecure income is a cause of high stress and a frequent cause of hardship and debt. This is especially so in relation to the benefit abatement system. If a person receives income that is higher than normal, and their benefit is abated, there are often delays in their benefit being restored to the normal level, which may result in the person and their whānau in situation where they do not have enough income to cover rent, power and kai, and also can create a new debt. 4.22. We recommend investment in kaupapa Māori and Pasifika financial wellbeing services to ensure culturally safe and supportive services for whānau and fono that promotes independence, and resilience. We further recommend that government agencies work in close partnership with kaupapa Māori and other culturally specific services, to reduce barriers to accessing support for those most in need, and to address the primary drivers of debt. 4.23. Kathleen Tuai-Taufo’ou, CEO of Siaola, Vahefonua Tonga Methodist Mission, summarises the financial wellbeing service this Pasifika organisation provides as: “Siaola offers Pacific families a strength-based, holistic financial wellbeing service (GREI) that results in debt elimination and wealth creation through home ownership. Through debt consolidation to banks, employment services to increase income in the household and services to support the children’s 21 4.5 in the IRD Consultation Document, February 2023 9 education, we not only see the decrease in debt to government, but we empower the whole family to live successful thriving lives. These alternative models of care allow for government clients to be referred to financial wellbeing services that suit each client's need.” 4.24. We recommend a direct phone line for financial wellbeing mentors to access the single centralised Crown debt agency. 4.25. We seek further clarification of what “competing policy considerations that must take priority over this principle” 22 might be that would override the effect the repayment rate would have on the ability of the person to support themselves and any dependents. 4.26. We recommend that debt related communications are written in plain language - rather than plain English, as these communications will need to be available in a variety of languages to ensure understanding by the debtors. Having information provided in the appropriate language is part of a person-centred approach and would ensure people have a better understanding of how the debt was caused, the repayment obligations, and their rights. 4.27. It may be useful to collect statistics which provide clarity on the numbers of individuals that owe debt to government for whom English is a second language. This would give clarity to the need for information in other languages. 4.28. The ability to repay debt assumes that the individual is receiving a liveable income. People in receipt of welfare support find that the level of financial support is insufficient to meet their needs. We recommend that core benefit levels are increased to the standard of liveable incomes and to overhaul relationship rules. “The rules on relationships in the welfare system need to be updated. You should be allowed to co-parent, or live with whānau, without being treated as being in a relationship in the nature of marriage. The processes are too slow and there is no accountability for decisions that can drive already vulnerable people into deeper suffering and hardship. ... Transforming our welfare system would be just a start towards addressing these broader problems.” 23 22 4.13 second bullet point in the IRD Consultation Document, February 2023 23 Fairer Futures, “Lifting the Weight Report” 2023, p20 10 4.29. We recommend non-monetary repayment options to repay debt and fines could include the option for people to work within accredited community development and/or iwi organisations to ‘work off’ their debt. This would provide a supported work experience environment that would have potential benefits not only for the individual, but also their local community. These benefits include increased social connectedness and cohesion, skill development and valuable work in local communities. It would also help people to clear debts in ways that would be mana enhancing and be seen to be fair for all citizens. There are non-government agencies that have existing programmes that would be suitable for this type of arrangement. 4.30. We recommend the inclusion of the Fonofale Pasifika wellbeing framework as Pasifika communities are disproportionately represented in lower socio-economic groups and the latest child poverty statistics show an increase in the percentage of Pasifika children living in a household with a low income, and 25.6% living in households in material hardship. 24 4.31. We understand the percentage of disabled children living in a household with a low income has increased. 25 In addition, the percentage of children living in a disabled household with a low income has also increased and is significantly higher than children in non-disabled households. 26 A number of families/whānau are unable to arrange safe, accessible and affordable childcare. In addition, families/whānau are continuing to care for family members when it is beyond their resources. We recommend further consultation with the disability sector to ensure that any debt framework does not further disadvantage those living with a disability and those caring for those with a disability. 4.32. We recommend strong links between this high level framework and policies and procedures for Crown agencies to follow. This would ensure that the principles are embedded into practice. 3. Whakarāpopototanga | Summary The Methodist Alliance supports the intention of the proposed framework to manage and prevent debt owed to Government. We commend the Government for consulting with social services and to ensure that valuable input is available to refine the proposed framework to address inequalities created by the current policies and practices. We are willing to meet to further discuss this, if you consider this would be of assistance. 24 https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/child-poverty-statistics-year-ended-june-2022/ 25 Ibid 26 Ibid 11 Carol Barron Kairuruku | National Coordinator Ngā Purapura Weteriana | The Methodist Alliance Carol@MethodistAlliance.org.nz NCIWR’s submission on the draft framework for debt to government. 1.Introduction The National Collective of Independent Women’s Refuges (NCIWR) is a non-governmental organisation that had been delivering services to women, children, and whānau affected by family violence in Aotearoa for 50 years. In 2021/22, our network of 42 affiliated refuges supported 52,000 referrals, and 59,000 safe nights in safe houses. Children made up 50% of clients who accessed safehouses across the country. NCIWR were unable to attend the SSPA and IRD consultation meeting on the draft framework. As such we appreciate the opportunity to submit in writing to Cabinet’s Social Wellbeing Committee, especially given the draft framework’s focus on “how agencies might collectively take into account an individual’s personal circumstances”. The population group that we represent are victims of family violence, specifically women and children, who are the primary groups subjected to and impacted by family violence. In Aotearoa, one in three women who have ever partnered with a man report experiencing family violence. 1 The rates of violence are significantly more pronounced for wāhine Māori 2 (as outlined further in this submission). For many women (especially mothers), state debt and financial hardship are both consequences of family violence and a debilitating barrier to future safety prospects. As is underlined throughout this submission, family violence frequently involves some form of economic abuse, and financial stability is inextricably linked to risk or safety from family violence. Economic abuse (sometimes called financial abuse) is one of the most common means through which perpetrators of intimate partner violence assume control and exercise power over their victims. 3 The omission of family violence, and of economic abuse specifically, from the draft framework is concerning and we urge the committee to urgently address this oversight. 2.Overview of submission The submission begins with defining economic abuse and its relationship to coercive control and giving an indication of the prevalence and scale of economic abuse in the lives of family violence victims. It then explains why economic abuse perpetrated as part of family violence should be considered as a standalone issue (and grounds for exemption and/or additional support) in relation to hardship. Next, it provides a case study that highlights how one IRD debtor experienced first economic abuse and then organisational collusion with her perpetrator, which reinforced her hardship. The submission then responds to each section of the draft framework and the consultation questions and relates these to victims of family violence, and identifies the importance of proposed changes using an IRD response 1 Fanslow.

It then concludes with a list of recommendations relating to the overall draft framework. 3. NCIWR’s position NCIWR is a central part of New Zealand’s national strategy to eliminate family violence. We are the only national specialist service for family violence victims, contribute to the advancement of research, knowledge, and practice in the family violence field, and give expert input into the development and design of policy and legislation to equip organisations to fulfil their unique roles in responding to and combating family violence. Every organisation has a vital role in eliminating family violence in all of its forms. Our overarching response to the draft framework is that this role in ending family violence needs to be embedded into the framework, since family violence is a financial issue, a hardship issue, and a debt issue, and opportunities to combat violence are not maximised within the current draft. 4. Defining economic abuse Economic abuse is a pervasive issue in Aotearoa, yet its manifestations and impacts are not well understood, and largely unaddressed. 4 Economic abuse is classified as a subtype of family violence under The Family Violence Act 2018. It is rarely a standalone strategy of violence, but rather is one manifestation of a family violence perpetrator’s broader pattern of coercive and controlling behaviour. Analyses of family violence homicides show coercive control is one of the principal predictors of lethality. Examples of coercive control include a perpetrator controlling, forcing, or manipulating a victim’s access to money or finances, the services they can access, and their access to work or study. Perpetrators often use third parties, systems, and services (such as welfare agencies) to control their victims, 5 such as by forestalling any financial or practical prospects for them outside of the relationship with that perpetrator. Family violence is almost always predicated on the perpetrator’s use of power to control and subordinate. This creates a power imbalance within relationships, that can lead to coerced financial decision-making. 6 When a perpetrator uses violence against their victim, and commands authority over that victim’s household, the victim has few viable ways to prevent the perpetrator from misusing their financial resources. 7 Typically, once the perpetrator has forcibly assumed control over day-to-day household functioning, including the victim’s finances, they exert this control in ways that reinforce women’s entrapment in the family violence setting. 8 4 Milne, S., Maury, S., Gulliver, P., & Eccleton, N.

Aotearoa New Zealand Social Work, 29(2), 69-82. 5. Economic abuse research and data In 2017, Women’s Refuge carried out research into economic abuse in the context of family violence, using the experiences of 445 participants who had been subjected to economic abuse by a partner. The study highlighted themes in perpetrators’ use of victims’ income, benefits, assets, and employment as weapons to advance their systematic violence over those victims. 9 Themes included: • Binding victims to the relationship by forcing them to take out loans or incur debt; • Forcing victims to be accountable for fraudulent behaviour that could be reported if they attempted to separate; • Forcibly taking victims’ money; • Engineering a division of financial duties to create inequitable spending power for themselves while positioning household bills, rent, and financial accountability with victims; and • Sabotaging victims’ employment or employment prospects. These research findings are corroborated by NCIWR’s 2023 client data on economic abuse. In an effort to understand how abuse played out in the lives of our clients, Women’s Refuge recently implemented a new and mandatory risk assessment, completed with all clients at the beginning of their engagement. It includes the range of (often invisible) risks to the viability of women’s, and their children’s, lives, and futures, including economic abuse. The new risk assessment has now been conducted with over 500 Refuge clients. The ‘First 500’ showcases how economic abuse features prominently in many women’s experiences of family violence. Risk assessment question Percentage who answered ‘Yes’ Have they\* forced or pressured you to take out debt or get money in ways you weren’t comfortable with? 39.37% Have they\* ever threatened to tell people about your income/benefits to make you do what they want? 19.2% Have they\* excluded you from decisions about shared or household money? 52.2% Have they\* stopped you from having your own money? 45.0% \* Primary perpetrator This coercive control also restricts how victims can engage with any services, 10 limiting the extent to which the destructive impacts of economic abuse can be addressed through specialist support. The damage to a victim’s reputation and credibility as a result of economic abuse is long-lasting; it impacts multiple facets of their lives, increases the stigmatisation they experience, restricts their freedom and 9 Jury, A., Thorburn, N., & Weatherall, R. (2017). Women’s experiences of economic abuse in Aotearoa New Zealand. NCIWR: New Zealand. 10 Herbert, R. and D. Mackenzie (2014) The Way Forward: an integrated system for intimate partner violence and child abuse and neglect in New Zealand, Wellington: The Impact Collective, http://www.theimpactcollective.co.nz/thewayforward\_210714.pdf their ability to participate normally in everyday life, and reinforces financial hardship, often precluding their capacity to fully recover or to provide for their children. 11 Research participants in the 2017 research explained the ongoing costs of economic abuse – long after their relationships with perpetrators had ended. The below quotes highlight how the perception of ‘poor financial decision making’ and ‘poor financial behaviour’ are (stigmatising) myths that perpetuate cycles of financial hardship for victims of violence: “It changed my life dramatically. From work, credit history, tenancy... Before I had a perfect record no debt, after I had no job, nowhere to live and nearly 20,000 in debt!” - Victim “The impact of financial abuse is massive...There is little legal comeback and scant protection. Legal action is costly and takes months. If you do it yourself it’s time consuming and while you are struggling to retrain, work and look after the kids it’s difficult to manage... Financial abuse is ongoing, insidious and destroys your life. Physical abuse is horrendous, but you can remove yourself and get a degree of protection.” - Victim The implied ‘fault’ is typically perceived to sit with the victim – as do the consequences and expectations for repayment. Yet they have little to no control over the choices of their perpetrators. Economic abuse has a cumulative impact on victims’ financial, personal, social, and material resources, and these penalties extend beyond the relationship itself and are perpetually reinforcing of the entrapment in abusive relationships. Understanding victims’ experiences of economic abuse, and its impacts over time is therefore pivotal to understanding their contexts of hardship. 12 Applying these research and practice insights relating to economic abuse to the draft framework gives the context to why it is so imperative that the framework itself and organisational policies and processes that enact it are all family violence-informed – without explicit pathways and redress for victims, the ‘neutral’ stance of agencies inadvertently collude with perpetrators’ efforts to keep victims immobilised and disadvantaged through financial means. 6. Family violence as a standalone issue of hardship As family violence specialists, NCIWR firmly believes that economic abuse in the context of family violence needs to be prioritised as a standalone issue in relation to debt and the assessment of hardship. It is encouraging to see the draft framework’s focus on a fair and consistent approach to hardship, and the open discussion about treating particular forms of debt differently. We understand that serious hardship can arise from numerous and often intersecting causes. We acknowledge that some people may feel concerned that singling out family violence creates precedent to individualise assessment for other contributing factors. However, government has frequently reiterated the need for ‘cross-sector’ and ‘whole-of-government’ approaches to ending family violence – and the efficacy of these approaches is undermined when some of the most basic tenets of safety and recovery (i.e. alleviation of economic hardship) are made inaccessible by unresponsive policy. The 11 Jury, A., Thorburn, N., & Weatherall, R. (2017). Women’s experiences of economic abuse in Aotearoa New Zealand. NCIWR: New Zealand. 12 Steinmann, K. and Jones, S., Ohio Intimate Partner Violence Collaborative: Final Evaluation Report of the Safe and Together Training Program, Columbur, National Center for Adoption Law and Policy, 2014. ethical imperative to combat family violence through the implementation of family violence-informed policies and processes differs significantly from organisational responsibility for alleviating hardship; for instance: • No other cause of hardship jeopardises an individual’s immediate and ongoing safety (including by risking both their lives and the viability of their lives) in the way that the perpetration of family violence does; • Economic abuse and the use of controlling behaviours is strongly linked to IPV homicide, physical violence, sexual violence, trauma, and other injury, in addition to the unseen but immense social and material consequences; 13 • Family violence fosters a multiplicity of hardships for children and is a core driver of child poverty. The ‘one in three’ women who are victimised by FV are almost always the primary caregivers of children. They are almost always those children’s main source of safety and protection 14 , and are almost always the ones providing the day-to-day care and provision for children, even when severely financially restricted; 15 • Economic abuse is often subtle, insidious, and invisible to anyone but the victim. It is not reported frequently, and not often defined as such by people who do not have access to services that can identify and name those behaviours; 16 and • Economic abuse reinforces power imbalance between the victim and perpetrator that gives rise to coerced financial decision-making. As such, victims’ presumed ‘decisions’ or ‘choices’ that lead to debt or financial hardship need to be viewed with a family violence-informed analysis; in the context of family violence, such choices are rarely made freely and are almost always coerced by the person with greater power. It is already evidenced that “debt to government is a stress factor affecting many families and whānau”. Family violence is a compounding factor (and driver) for both stress and hardship, and both are heightened when debt to government arises through force or coercion by someone using violence. We therefore recommend that the definition of hardship include hardship caused by economic abuse in the context of family violence. 7. Case study NCIWR were recently made aware of a case of economic abuse where our client (Sarah 17 ) had over $25,000 of debt outstanding to IRD. Her situation was as follows: Sarah’s relationship was characterised by extreme physical and sexual violence perpetrated by her partner. The Police were aware of his history of violence against Sarah, as Sarah had sought legal protection multiple times. As is the case with most instances of economic abuse, Sarah’s partner withheld access to the shared household income. She was forced to beg for hours to be given enough money to buy food 13 Family Safety Victoria. (2019).

He prevented her from disclosing their relationship status to Work and Income. He also forced her to fraudulently collect Family Tax Credits and other benefits and expressly prohibited her from cancelling these. He continually threatened to report her if she did not do exactly what he wanted at all times. Eventually, with help, Sarah was able to separate from her violent partner. A Woman’s Refuge advocate worked with Sarah for six months on the economic abuse component of her perpetrator’s violence. She knew that Sarah did not make the choice to receive more than she was entitled to. It was clear that Sarah did not have control over the money, spend the money herself, or benefit in any way from the accrual of the money. It was equally clear that Sarah made the ‘choice’ to comply with her perpetrator out of fear for her safety and the safety of her children. Unfortunately for Sarah, because there was no simple pathway for her debt to be recognised as economic abuse, she was told multiple times that she would have to pay this debt. Her employer was then notified of her large debt, which compounded the issue for Sarah, and revictimised her. She felt she was losing everything, felt ashamed and out of place at work, and lost even more control over the practical aspects of her life. She was then forced to out herself as a victim of family violence to explain the debt, and had her working integrity and reputation questioned. After trying for six months to clear Sarah’s name from this debt, including by providing evidence of Sarah’s abuse, and communicating back and forth with case managers, her advocate reached out to us to write an expert report for the IRD setting out the evidence, nature, and consequences of the family violence. It was only then that Sarah received an exemption from repayment obligations or punitive follow up action. As this case study highlights, • Debt accrued through economic abuse is not a voluntary ‘choice’, it is accrued as a consequence or force or coercion by perpetrators of violence; • Economic abuse leads to significant safety concerns for victims; • Debt can become a weapon of coercion, used by perpetrators to exploit and harm victims; • Family violence is a crime, as stated in the Family Violence Act 2018. Victims of this criminal offending must not be held liable for debt incurred as part of this offending; • Agencies are ethically obligated to address internal frameworks that reinforce family violence victimisation, and should uphold the government’s commitment to creating safety for victims; • Agencies must make explicit their understanding of family violence as a pattern of coercion that often weaponises victims’ and their financial contexts; • Agency policies and practices must not discriminate against victims; • Agency policies and practices must support a victim’s return to financial viability; • The specialist sector contributes their expertise to support family violence-informed policies and practices, and this can be instrumentalised to ensure the safety of draft frameworks and policy; • Well-intentioned policy and practice can ultimately cause harm when there is no consultation with the specialist sector; and • It is essential that all agencies and services take the opportunity to effectively contribute to the solution toward the elimination of family violence. 8. Response to the draft framework 1. The guiding principles are appropriate and can accommodate a family violence lens. 2. For the ‘purpose-centred approach’, our recommendations involve understanding economic abuse in the context of family violence in order to support a shift from ‘client as problem’, or ‘poor behaviour/poor decision-making as problem’ toward ‘agency as solution’. 3. For the ‘person-centred approach’, our recommendations involve understanding economic abuse in the context of family violence in order to proactively screen for economic abuse, and to make economic abuse explicit in the assessment of hardship. 4. Our key recommendation is the collaboration with the specialist sector to apply a family violence informed lens to all policy and practice surrounding debt to government, in order to understand and identify economic abuse, and make safety informed decisions for debtors. 8.1 The types of debt owed to government The categories of ‘types of debts owed to government’ that may apply to the victims of economic abuse include: • 3.1 b) Overpayments of Government Support • 3.1 g) Intentional non-compliance. In family violence relationships, one person uses fear and intimidation to control or exercise power over the other. Economic abuse is an issue whereby the behaviours and choices of a person external to the debtor may determine the debt. The emphasis within these categories of debt is on individual behaviour and currently does not account for the behaviour of an abusive person. Having awareness of the influence of economic abuse on debt and hardship means recognising that categories a) and g) may not be individual problems with an individually focused solution. These categories fail to allow for any interpretation of debt that is not a character, behavioural, or decision-making fault of the individual. We recommend the provision for family violence be included in the category definitions, or the creation of a new category which encompasses debt that is coerced (including in ways that are invisible or difficult to quantify) by someone external. 8.2 Recommended arrangements for creating and managing debt The four categories for creating and managing debt cover appropriate policy factors. A fifth policy factor to consider is ‘risk’: it relates to the risk to an individual versus the risk to an agency. Risk appears to be a central theme in the ‘recommended treatments’ but is not a standalone policy. As above, the risk to an individual client experiencing economic abuse is often critical and immediate. Risk to an agency includes both the costs to collect or write-off debt, and the risk of colluding with perpetrators to create financial precarity for victims. The framing of the supporting questions (3.2) for each category appears to start from the assumption that there is or has been poor behaviour or poor decision-making. We recommend the inclusion of questions that cover agency preparation to consider all forms of hardship. These may sit alongside the current ‘What is the appropriate rate, repayment, extension, suspension etc?’, and ‘How ready are we to write off the debt?’. As an example, consider ‘How have we satisfied our investigation into all client context?’, ‘Have we considered all forms of client risk/safety?’, ‘How have we determined/measured the needs of the client in their entirety?’, ‘How is all hardship considered in the decision to write off debt?’, ‘How are we supporting clients toward financially viable futures?’, and ‘Have we considered the long-lasting impact of economic abuse on victims?’. These questions support a shift from ‘client as problem’, or ‘poor behaviour/poor decision-making as problem’ toward ‘agency as solution’. This minimises the risk that agencies may unintentionally collude with perpetrators to initiate, maintain, or reinforce a victim’s situation of hardship. 8.3 Recommended treatment for overpayments of government support 8.3.a) Ideal treatment of debt arising from Overpayments of Government Support We appreciate the framing of 3.7: “This type of debt is unintended. It typically results from inaccurate or late information about eligibility or assessment, or delays in processing this information (this is different from instances of intentional non-compliance). Many recipients will have limited ability to make repayments at the time the debt arises or in the future.” We appreciate that family violence (and economic abuse specifically) could be interpreted within this scope as it is, by its nature, non-voluntary. However, unless this is specifically included, or unless agencies have family violence informed policies and practices, economic abuse will remain hidden, and clients’ safety will remain compromised – because family violence is not included as context to victims’ experiences unless policy directs that it is considered. Similar myths of origin as referenced above are discernible in section 3.8: “A lower threshold for write-off may be appropriate, especially where repayment may undermine income adequacy. This needs to be balanced against the behavioural incentives to provide timely and accurate information to the government. If the overpayment is due to administrative error, write-off should be the default response.” Again, consideration needs to be given to the assumption of ‘poor behaviour/poor decision-making as problem’. Policies need to reflect an understanding that power dynamics within violent relationships do not allow for ‘timely and accurate information to the government’. Often this information cannot be given freely, or without violent repercussions. 8.3.b) Ideal treatment of debt arising from intentional non-compliance 3.22 Applying the concept of ‘intentional non-compliance’ to victims of family violence and economic abuse is unsafe. Many of the previously explained key messages apply to this category: • Intention, behaviour, and decision-making of victims of economic abuse are all externally influenced; for instance, by fear and the need to protect themselves and their children from financial hardship, reputation sabotage, injury, or death. • For victims of economic abuse ‘intentional non-compliance’ is not an individually driven behaviour. We invite the committee to consider the following questions. 1. How does the assumption that non-compliance is driven only by “deceitful exploitation of systems” and therefore “punishable”, and only written off “in cases where collection would be impossible (for example the debtor is deceased” (3.22, pp13) further stigmatise debtors who are victims of abuse and reinforce their hardship? 2. Are there rigorous agency policies and procedures to assess for context, abuse, and hardship? 3. If so, is this done routinely, confidently, and safely? 8.4 Person-centred approach A ‘person-centred approach’ can certainly support the groups that NCIWR represent. The intent behind 4.4 c): “Make decisions about debt relief in the context of a comprehensive hardship assessment” is promising. However, for the ‘person-centred’ approach to be realised to its full potential, the onus needs to be removed from the debtor and sit with the agency instead. For example, each question posed on page 18, (we understand these questions are only to guide feedback) can be reframed slightly: ‘Is it easy for debtors to understand what they owe, and to who?’ can become: ‘How have we supported debtors to understand what they owe, and to who?’. Small changes in the intention of the draft framework can help support all debtors, especially those facing economic abuse and multiplicity of hardship. Victims already carry an untenable workload in maintaining whatever safety is possible for them. Initiatives only help if they remove this burden rather than add to it. We suggest the inclusion of a further recommendation to agencies. For example, ‘implement policy that removes barriers and proactively supports a client’s return to financial viability’: this can be applied to victims of economic abuse, and more generally as well. Again, for the purposes of supporting victims of economic abuse, the questions on page 18 ‘How easy is it for debtors to negotiate for hardship relief?’ can be reframed to ‘How are agencies being proactive so that debtors do not have to negotiate for hardship relief themselves?’ It is through this reframing that the person-centred approach can make sense of a debtor’s context. For example, often victims of violence are so enmeshed in the cycle of violence, and surviving relentless abuse, that they do not have the capacity to negotiate themselves, or with reference to our case study above (see section 7), are still unable to make headway in the negotiation process, even with the support of an advocate. 8.4 a) Assessing Hardship We recommend the inclusion of a family violence-informed understanding into the assessment of hardship. The draft framework specifically highlights that “hardship operates on a continuum of severity, with more serious hardship being of greater concern”. As stated above, family violence is the only cause of hardship that jeopardises clients’ lives because of the behaviours and choices of another person. It therefore needs explicit acknowledgement as a category and cause of hardship. In addition, the hardship assessment should seek an understanding of who controls the household finances in situations of economic abuse, as the understanding of economic abuse needs to precede the inclusive analysis of it to an individual debtor’s context. We therefore recommend proactive, safe, family violence screening to be included in hardship assessment. This should be developed and implemented in collaboration with the specialist family violence sector, and must be fit for purpose for women and children who experience abuse, disabled people abused by those who care for them, immigrant victims of abuse, and victims of elder abuse. Every agency must use the power they have to treat economic abuse in the context of family violence as a financial issue, a hardship issue, and a debt issue. 8.4 b) Taking hardship into account in decision-making In the case study above, it took over six months for a victim of economic abuse to be heard, and for her evidence of economic abuse to be understood. She was required to disclose extremely detailed personal information about physical and sexual violence which was then stored on her file for multiple people to see. If evidence of economic abuse is to be provided there needs to be a set evidential threshold. The Domestic Violence Victims’ Protection Act 2018 (DVVPA) sets out an evidence threshold for family violence: evidence can be provided by the victim, or in short form by a family violence specialist organisation, amongst other forms. 18 This threshold reduces the risk of retraumatising victims or putting their safety at further risk. We recommend utilising a similar threshold. Similarly, once evidence is provided, it needs to be given priority to avoid delays that cause additional risk to victims. 8.4 c) Supporting debtors in hardship Given the prevalence of family violence in Aotearoa, it is a safe assumption that many debtors are victims of family violence. This influences how safe they are to receive communication, especially digitally. Research highlights that victims often have their phones and other digital devices monitored by a perpetrator. 19 It is important to consider how this may impact the debtor and their perceived behaviour and decision-making. The specialist sector provides training and can support agencies and staff to create safe policies and practices for communicating with victims. 20 Simple screening questions and prompts can traverse agency engagement with a client/debtor, such as: • ‘What is your preferred way to communicate?’ • ‘We want to know which form of communication is safest and most comfortable for everyone we work with?’ • ‘Sometimes people tell us that there is someone in their home who is making them feel unsafe, does this apply to you?’ 18 Employment New Zealand.

Wāhine Māori, however, are more than twice as likely to be a victim of a violent interpersonal offence by an intimate partner 21 , and are three times as likely to be killed by a partner 22 . Wāhine Māori are also almost twice as likely to experience one or more coercive and controlling behaviours from a current partner 23 . 41% of referrals to Women’s Refuge were for Māori (women and children), with tamariki Māori comprising 39% of all tamariki 24 . Family violence increases stigmatisation for Māori and systems need to be extra vigilant to not further their vulnerability through unsafe policy and practice. Specialist input should be sought from the disability sector as disabled people, or ‘adults at risk’, experience higher reported family violence than non-disabled people. They also face multiple extra systemic barriers to support, and if policy does not consider their specific needs they face exclusion and are not afforded protection by the system. 25 9. Response to Official Information Act request regarding family violence policy In 2021, we made an OIA request to IRD to understand how IRD were making explicit family violence within their policies and practice. The information received from IRD (as below) states that there is no current policy on family violence: “Inland Revenue has no specific policy on family violence. The ground for writing off debt and the remission of interest and penalties is provided for in the Tax Administration Act as “serious hardship”. Serious hardship can arise from an open-ended category of causes, which is why there is no specific family violence category. The instruction in the table below however deals specifically with family violence.” However, the only instruction for practice around family violence was: “Procedure for managing client debt/overpayment if family violence is identified or suspected. The procedure for dealing with serious hardship is set out in Standard Practice Statement 18/04. 21 Te Puni Kōkiri. (2017).

Annual report. https://womensrefuge.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Annual-Report-2022-High-Res-1.pdf 25 Fanslow, J. L., Malihi, Z. A., Hashemi, L., Gulliver, P.J., & McIntosh, J D. (2021). Lifetime Prevalence of Intimate Partner Violence and Disability: Results from a Population-Based Study in New Zealand, American Journal of Preventive Medicine, (61)3. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2021.02.022. Take note: We must ensure that taking this action will not result in an extreme (or violent) reaction from the ex-partner. For example, if there was a history of domestic violence in the relationship.” There is no family violence informed policy, practice, or any direction to screen for family violence, even though there was acknowledgement that family violence was an issue that debtors face: “Inland Revenue’s Families people (who manage both Working for Families and Child Support) understand that our customers come from different backgrounds, and that family violence may very well be part of these”. Without a mechanism that builds capacity of services and staff to apply a family violence analysis to a situation of serious hardship, no family violence understanding – or safe response – can be reasonably expected. Our concern was corroborated by the OIA response, which stated: “There is no specific training for staff communicating with the victims of family violence”, and “There are no specific avenues of support provided by IRD for taxpayers experiencing family violence.” We then queried whether IRD had any plans to address the gap in workforce capability in terms of a family violence-informed response to taxpayer hardship and noted that the cited values of empathy and rapport-building do not equate to an adequate family violence-informed pathway. IRD replied that it: “does not consider that there is a gap in workforce capability as regards a family violence-informed response to taxpayer hardship”. They then included a list of steps they took when they suspected family violence. None appeared to be likely to be safe or helpful to victims, and IRD acknowledged the fallibility of these, commenting that “these solutions raise their own issues as they may cause additional tension within an abusive relationship, which is something we are cautious to avoid.” Understanding victims’ experiences of economic abuse, and its impacts over time, is pivotal to understanding their contexts of hardship. If there is no process through which to include family violence information, it is not possible to obtain a true picture of hardship. The inadequacy of responses to family violence are further exemplified by the below excerpt of the OIA request. “It is hard to identify situations of family violence unless customers advise us of them. Both the Privacy Act 2020 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 control the gathering of information for proper purposes, and common courtesy, limit the extent to which Inland Revenue staff can be pro-active in inquiring into situations of family violence. We cannot, for example, assume that financial hardship arises from family violence. To suggest or inquire into such possibilities may cause offence if it is not the case, and may also exacerbate any violence if, as we are aware is sometimes true, the victim is monitored by the offending partner in her contact with Inland Revenue.” The lack of a family violence framework that considers economic abuse and its far reaching, and ongoing impacts is of utmost concern. There are many examples of family violence policy and practice (including mandatory screening and workforce training to recognise and respond to family violence) being adopted in New Zealand. The health sector in Aotearoa has implemented mandatory screening. Many banks have worked with the family violence specialist sector to take proactive steps to recognise economic abuse and its impacts in order to protect their clients from financial hardship, ongoing financial instability, and the severe consequences of coercive control. Doing so can support the agency, its staff, and its clients. For all the reasons set out throughout this submission, we urge, at a minimum, IRD’s inclusion of: • Family violence informed policy to guide practice; • Safe screening that is informed by family violence specialists; • An understanding that economic abuse contributes to victims’ debt and hardship; and • Processes to proactively write-off debt for victims of economic abuse when victimisation is evidenced (with the same threshold for evidence as set out in the DVVPA). 10. Recommendations • We recommend building awareness of economic abuse and its impacts, and its links to context, hardship, and debt. • We recommend building awareness of myths that perpetuate cycles of financial hardship for victims of violence, including what choices, or decisions a victim has, and what behaviours they display. • We recommend treating economic abuse in the context of family violence as a financial issue, a hardship issue, and a debt issue. • We recommend collaborating with the specialist sector to apply a family violence-informed lens to all policy and practice surrounding debt to government, in order to understand and identify economic abuse, and make safety informed decisions for debtors. • We recommend that the definition of hardship include hardship caused by economic abuse in the context of family violence. • We recommend the inclusion of questions that cover agency preparation to consider all forms of hardship. • We recommend the inclusion of a family violence-informed understanding into the assessment of hardship. • We recommend that proactive, safe, family violence screening be included in hardship assessment. • We recommend purpose-centred and person-centred approaches that shift the onus from client to agency; • We recommend following other agency leaders to implement family violence-informed cross agency policy (e.g. banks) • We recommend that the provision for family violence be included in the category definitions ‘types of debt owed to government’, or the creation of a new category which encompasses debt that is forced by someone external. • We recommend the inclusion of ‘risk’ as a policy factor for ‘creating and managing debt’. • We recommend that a mandatorily recognised evidential threshold be established for family violence evidence, along with a policy guiding the expedient processing of it. In order to properly understand, and hence better respond to, economic abuse, there needs to be greater organisational awareness and community awareness of the issue. There also needs to be an integrated response that involves government, social service agencies, academia, communities, and businesses. We are happy to provide any further information, and we thank you for considering our submission. 1 22 May 2023 Ngāpuhi Iwi Social Services 12 Marino Place, Kaikohe 0405 Tel: 09 401 5548 Contact Person: Moana Eruera E: moana.eruera@ngapuhi.org To: Inland Revenue Level 8 Asteron Centre 55 Featherston Street Wellington 6011 New Zealand SUBMISSION TO INLAND REVENUE ON THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK FOR DEBT TO GOVERNMENT “Kia tū tika ai te whare tapu o Ngāpuhi” The sacred house of Ngāpuhi stands firm KO WAI MATOU? WHO ARE WE? 1. Ngāpuhi remain the largest iwi in Aotearoa New Zealand. In 2018, more than 165,000 people identified with Te Whare O Ngāpuhi (about 18% of the total Māori population) and 21.2% were living in the Northland region. i The Ngāpuhi Rūnanga Group is a collective of four organisations who represent the interests and aspirations of the Ngāpuhi population. Te Rūnanga-Ā- Iwi -Ō- Ngāpuhi is the parent organisation of the Group that includes Ngāpuhi Iwi Social Services, Te Hau Ora O Ngāpuhi and the Ngāpuhi Asset Holding Company. As a collective, we provide a range of support, 7. 2 advisory services and events to help progress our iwi, hapū, marae and whānau towards a vision where the sacred house of Ngāpuhi stands strong. 2. Ngāpuhi Iwi Social Services (NISS) are a social services provider based in Kaikohe. Our kaimahi support tamariki and whānau with a range of services including work with youth development, mentoring and offending; Ngāpuhi mokopuna in State care, social work in schools, whānau violence supports and others. NISS was established in 1986 to provide maatua whāngai services and was approved as an iwi social service in 1996. NISS has been a registered subsidiary of Te Rūnanga-Ā-Iwi-O-Ngāpuhi since 2006. 3. Te Whare Awhina o Ngāti Tautahi, established in 2015, are a marae-based service and hapū-led organisation dedicated to the drive and aspirations of our Hapū Ora (whānau clusters). Within the realms of Hapū Ora is our ‘Ngāti Tautahi mo Ngāti Tautahi’ holistic approach. Te Whare Awhina o Ngāti Tautahi seek to positively influence, empower and enhance the lives of our people. We believe we have an inherent responsibility to provide for whānau who whakapapa to our hapū and live within our Rohe Pōtae (territories). NGĀ AWANGAWANGA NEI MĀTOU HINENGARO THE WEIGHT OF OUR WORRIES Many of our kaimahi work alongside whānau who suffer from the burden of intergenerational, persistent and unaffordable levels of debt. This contextual section will provide statistical data combined with the voices of our kaimahi and their experiences with whānau that we work with. Poverty (a) Out of over 50,000 people living in poverty in the Northland region, about 46% live in the Far North District, which includes Kaikohe, Opononi and Kaitāia. ii In general, tamariki Māori experience material hardship rates more than double those of non- Māori children; they also face a higher risk of remaining in poverty for extended periods. iii 3 (b) One in four children aged 0 to 14 years in Northland has two or more risk factors. iv In the Far North District, this increases to almost one in three children (30%). v (c) One in four young people aged 15 to 19 years in Northland is in a target risk population. vi In the Far North District, one in five young people aged 20-24 is in a target risk population – more than twice the national average. vii (d) Housing remains a substantial issue for whānau. Only 34% of Māori in the Northland region own a home, compared with 56% of the total population. viii (e) It is well established that higher than average rates of family harm is associated with poverty. ix In 2022, NISS reported that high risk family harm is increasing in the mid- north. Material hardship, paired with homelessness and debt are pressures that overwhelm whānau. x Debt and financial literacy (a) The initial response to debt for whānau is how to face the challenge of meeting everyday expenses because of a low income. Whānau are cutting back on food so that rent and other costs are being paid to prevent power being cut off, eviction or re- possession of a vehicle. (b) Dealing with financial and familial pressures in the present is considered more pressing than planning for financial emergencies in the future, or increasing a payment to reduce an existing debt. Whānau have debts that they are either unable to pay back or are finding very hard to pay back to whānau, a number of loan agencies, community agencies, government agencies and local government. (c) Undertaking collective cultural obligations and activities such as organising and attending tangihanga can also be areas of great financial burden on whānau Māori. Families often travel great distances and at great expense to attend tangi that can take three days. Travel, food, marae koha and extended time off work to attend and support tangihanga are not planned for and arise as an emergency for whānau who have no disposable income or savings. Money therefore might be obtained from family members, fringe lenders, churches, or the superannuation of the deceased. 4 (d) The Financial Resilience Index is a major tracking survey of New Zealanders' views on five key financial resilience indicators: financial confidence, financial literacy, financial preparedness, job security and wellbeing. Financial resilience is defined as “one’s ability to withstand life events that impact your income or assets. It is the longer-term approach to one’s relationship with money. If an unexpected expense were to arise, having the financial means to deal with it means you are financially resilient.” xi (e) Whānau who seek support from NISS are not financially resilient, and already in debt. They have little or no understanding of other ways to approach their existing relationship with money or finance in the areas needed to build financial resilience, or deal with an emergency financial event. This impacts on the household or the whānau member’s finances when the need cannot be met because of the lack of disposable income or no savings to cover the unforeseen event. Barriers to accessing services (a) There is no public transport available in rural areas. Many whānau vehicles are unwarranted, unregistered and unsafe. Whānau have to travel 30 to 40 kilometers to get to a health clinic, hospital, a Work and Income (WINZ) office, the bank, shopping centres, petrol stations, the local budgeter, or to access a financial course recommended by WINZ or NISS. (b) The mid-north has no local food provider for whānau emergency support. The mid- north Budgeting Service receives donations to assist with food parcels for their registered clients only. Te Hau Ora o Ngāpuhi in Kaikohe provides emergency food for self-isolation/quarantine services as its priority. NISS is then making decisions based on MSD contract obligations to refer whānau to an outside food provider (based in Kerikeri or Kawakawa) and provide whānau with petrol vouchers to collect the food. Sometimes, the decision to provide food vouchers to shop in Kaikohe is the better option because the whānau vehicles are unwarranted and unregistered and will only add to fines debt. (c) Kaikohe only has one budgeting service that operates on donations provided to assist whānau who are registered or likely to be registered with them. The programmes that 5 are available and offered by MSD require whānau to be able to easily access those services however these are limited within the area. (d) In rural areas, and some remote isolated areas in the mid-north, whānau have returned to their whānau land (whenua Māori) because the cost of living is unaffordable. Many whānau are living off the grid with no phone lines, no internet, no rapid numbers and no postal deliveries. Some of our kaumātua and kuia are living in basic ‘off the grid’ conditions where they are in make-shift shelters, living in vehicles or living small houses on whānau land. They use generators and solar power in an attempt to reduce day-to-day charges (power, phone, internet costs). (e) Whānau are less likely to have any form of insurance. In some cases, whānau members are having to use another whānau member’s bank account because they fail to pass the key identity and address requirements needed to open a bank account. Housing (a) The 2020 social housing repairs project involving 10 homes in Waimā is still not completed. The whānau living in these homes are mainly elderly on superannuation, and living with their tamariki and mokopuna. These kaumatua and kuia survive on their own financial resilience and are dealing with aging health needs. Their home repairs have not been signed off, and for some, their repairs have not started. They have suffered with more damage from recent severe weather events, are uninsured and trying to minimise debt in their own way by going without some of the basic day- to-day needs to cut costs. (b) Some whānau find themselves in emergency accommodation that takes almost two thirds of their income. This is the same for those entering addictions programmes or emergency accommodation. Whānau members who rely on the income of a partner being displaced in-to one of those scenarios are left without that contribution to the household income, this impacts their tamariki and the whole whānau. (c) Whānau are returning to their lands, but rating, regulations and restrictions to build, utilities and housing infrastructure development is costly. Many whānau choose to 6 live off the grid as a cost saver to allow them to live within their WINZ household entitlements. (d) Due to overwhelming regulation, land ownership and the economic barriers utilising land resources for housing and; rates arrears feature lower in the whānau emergency payment priority. Rates become a financial debt. TE AROTAKENGA A CRITIQUE OF THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK This section will note some key critiques of the proposed framework we received from the voices of our kaimahi in our collective Ngāpuhi Rūnanga Group. We acknowledge that our version of the proposed framework (February 2023) will be outdated by the time this is received, but believe the following points are unique and helpful insights nonetheless. 1. He Whakaputanga o te Rangatiratanga o Nu Tireni (the Declaration of Independence of the United Tribes of New Zealand, 1835) and the principles of te Tiriti o Waitangi (1840) are missing. (a) Prior to colonisation, Ngāpuhi was a thriving political, economic and socially cohesive civilisation. Tauiwi (non-Māori) were welcomed because our tūpuna recognised that they could benefit from their knowledge, and that tauiwi could benefit from living here. He Whakaputanga was a declaration of mana (the appropriate Māori word for sovereignty) and independence. However, He Whakaputanga me te Tiriti were not recognised by the courts at that time. For over 180 years, many Ngāpuhi have fought against the imposed colonial system. (b) He Whakaputanga takes priority for our Ngāpuhi Rūnanga Group. We see He Whakaputanga as the primary living document that continues to represent Ngāpuhi’s mana and independence. In 2014, the Waitangi Tribunal concluded that the rangatira who signed He Whakaputanga declared that rangatiratanga, kingitanga, and mana in relation to their territories rested only with them on behalf of their hapū, and that no one else but them could make law within their territories, nor exercise any function of government except under their authority. xii 7 (c) As part of the Tribunal's inquiry into Te Paparahi o Te Raki, they also found that the rangatira who signed te Tiriti in the Bay of Islands and Hokianga in 1840 never ceded their sovereignty to the Crown, nor did they cede their authority to make and enforce law over their people and territories. Instead, they agreed to a relationship where they and the governor would be equals responsible for their own spheres of influence. xiii Crown counsel made submissions which agreed that rangatira did not cede their mana through Te Tiriti. xiv (d) Stage two of Te Paparahi o Te Raki, released in December 2022, found that the Crown overstepped its authority to govern for Northern Māori throughout the 19th century, which led to an erosion of rangatiratanga that is widely felt today. The Tribunal recommended that the Crown enter discussions with Māori on the constitutional makeup of the country, to give effect to "Treaty rights" in the country's constitutional processes and institutions, acknowledging that the conversations would be challenging. xv (e) While we support the goal of the framework to inform Government agencies about wiping or reducing whānau and/or individuals’ debt to Government, we expect that Crown obligations to iwi as treaty partners would ensure that Ngāpuhi Iwi participate fully in the development of this framework policy settings to reduce poverty, inequities and disparities for Ngāpuhi to achieve a reasonable standard of living. The Ngāpuhi rūnanga group also has the authority and ability to write and inform policies for the betterment of mahi of our whānau, hapū and iwi. 2. The person-centred approach to the proposed framework (a) The proposed framework is founded by a Eurocentric worldview and based on western social structures despite acknowledging that Māori will be heavily impacted by the framework. (b) There is a limited understanding of Māori social and cultural structures, and collective responsibilities. Throughout the document, the framework views ‘debtors’, including ‘Māori debtors’, as individuals, persons and as households. A whānau-centred approach that takes into account Māori collective responsibilities within the extended whānau system should be explored. As discussed on page three, there are many 8 examples where Māori use their income collectively to support whānau with emergencies, food, tangi and transportation costs, to name a few. 3. Engagement with Iwi and Māori rōpū (a) Engagement with Iwi in this context is about forming relationships and building knowledge about the framework with each other. Whānau, hapū, iwi and hāpori (communities), along with internal reference groups, should be actively involved in building a framework that they will promote or become impacted by. (b) It is noted from the list of consultation groups, that there was limited participation with external Iwi and Māori groups. Therefore, the engagement approach needs to focus on strengthening relationships and engaging in a meaningful manner by privileging te ao Māori (Māori worldviews), implementing Māori-engagement approaches (such as meeting kanohi ki te kanohi or through hui ā-kaupapa) and prioritising Māori. HE ARA HOU A PATHWAY FORWARD 1. We agree that all overlapping, persistent and disproportionately high whānau (individual and family) debt to government should be written off. 2. If government and finance agencies create the debt, we agree that they should be part of an investment in a solution to provide access to financial resilience workshops to prevent debt levels from getting out of control. 3. We believe that this can addressed in a number of ways: (a) An incentives and monitoring trial. The purpose of the trial is to build financial literacy and resilience. This may occur over a period of 24 months and involve writing off a percentage of debt per month if a certain milestone has been achieved. This may also involve setting up a whānau fund that whānau members need to invest in at regular intervals. We think that the participants should be at a 9 level of debt that isn’t too extreme so that success can be easier to see and measure. (b) Funding for hapū and iwi-led financial education programmes or wānanga, leading to likely increased participation and success. (c) Providing whānau access to an online budgeting service (for example, ClearDebt, Total Money Management) that is transparent and simple to use. This may occur as part of a financial literacy programme or for those whānau who would want to use it. 4. While we agree that debt write-off should be a consideration when applying the proposed framework, we do not believe that the framework goes far enough to ensure that debt is prevented. We agree with all other feedback that was provided regarding improvements at policy and operational levels, including but not limited to: a) Introduce a standard four-week grace period to provide change of circumstance information for all benefits b) Simplify the benefit system by increasing the use of universal benefits and/or consolidate means-tested benefits into a single package or “living benefit” (we discussed an example where sole parent support was not extended to include or recognise a whāngai situation, which turned the sole parent away from seeking assistance) c) Make all hardship assistance non-recoverable d) Implement a common format across departments for the information required for hardship assessments to prevent whānau from having to go through multiple processes to get relief from the burden of debt e) Avoid requiring evidence of family violence, so that responses are timely and prioritise the safety of the survivor 10 5. Ngāpuhi Iwi are considering a position statement on this issue. 6. It is our right to lead the development of policy settings to reduce poverty, inequities and disparities for Ngāpuhi to achieve rangatiratanga and a high standard of living.

Page 1 of 6 Consultation: A proposed framework for debt to government Inland Revenue Department (IRD) The Salvation Army New Zealand Fiji Tonga and Samoa Territory Submission – 06 April 2023 Summary: 1.Our overall sense of the IRD’s proposed framework is that it is an uninspiring framework that is not prescriptive or clear enough to address current major debt to government issues. Consequently, The Salvation Army believes that this approach does not give people (and those organisations supporting them) who owe debts to government enough clarity and effective pathways to address this debt. 2.This submission/response will firstly look at the idea of a new single crown debt collection entity that was proposed by the Tax Working Group (TWG). Following that, we give feedback on some aspects of the IRD’s proposed framework. We support submissions from FinCap as the peak body for the BFC sector, and other key actors in this space, who are offering detailed and practical solutions to the questions posed by IRD in the consultation document. Background of The Salvation Army: 3.The mission of The Salvation Army Te Ope Whakaora is to care for people, transform lives, and reform society by God's power. The Salvation Army is a Christian church and social services organisation that has worked in New Zealand for over one hundred and forty years. It provides a wide range of practical social, community, and faith-based services, particularly for those facing various forms of hardship and vulnerability. 4.The Salvation Army employs almost 2,000 people in New Zealand, and the combined services support around 150,000 people annually. In the year to June 2022, these services included providing around 83,000 food parcels to families and individuals, providing some 2,300 people with short-or long-term housing, over 4,000 families and individuals supported with social work or counselling, around 6,600 people supported to deal with alcohol, drug, or gambling addictions , around 3,500 families and individuals helped with budgeting, court and prison chaplains helped 3,300 people. 5.This submission has been prepared by the Social Policy and Parliamentary Unit (SPPU) of The Salvation Army. The SPPU works towards the eradication of poverty by advocating for policies and practices that strengthen the social framework of New Zealand. It has also been informed by the work of our national network of financial mentors or budgeters throughout the country. This submission has been approved by Commissioner Mark Campbell, Territorial Commander of The Salvation Army’s Aotearoa New Zealand Fiji Tonga, and Samoa Territory. 8. Page 2 of 6 Single centralised debt collection entity 6. We understand that a single, centralised government debt collection agency has been mooted at various points of this long process i . There are few details publicly available about what this entity could look like. Additionally, we were unable to find the original submission that proposed this innovative idea. But this idea had enough merit for the TWG to seriously consider and support this submitter’s proposal for this single entity because of the increased efficiency and more equitable outcomes that could emerge from this focussed approach. This approach had also been suggested to and considered by the Welfare Experts Advisory Group, although they were in favour for a cross government approach to debt to government ii . 7. The Salvation Army is interested in understanding and gaining more information about (a) the details for this possible new single entity and (b) what the reasons were for the IRD to ignore previous advice and positions in the TWG about exploring this alternative method. We are keen to understand these issues because focussing on this proposed framework that is essentially built around information sharing and developing a consistent approach across government department, while holding some promise, will not necessarily achieve the clear, fair, prescriptive, and targeted outcomes that both government creditors and debtors desperately need moving forward. 8. While creating yet another level and body of central government bureaucracy is not ideal, especially in this age where the public service has had significant growth under this Labour government, iii and huge national and family financial and economic pressures, we still submit it is worthwhile to explore further what this idea could look like. This approach, coupled with cleaning up the mess around private debt collection, could be effective tools to help both private and public debt holders gain clarity on their debts, repay them, and have other avenues of redress if available. 9. While this still a theory, we believe there might be real benefit to a single centralised agency that collects and works around debts to government. These benefits could include: a. Focussed and consistent approach. b. Clarity to debtors (and those supporting them) about the single agency they can work with around their debt. c. Freeing up staff and resources in IRD and other government departments heavily involved in these debt issues. d. A single location where relevant community organisations like FinCap, local financial mentoring services and Maori organisations can connect with and help debtors navigate through this new entity. This also allows for (hopefully) greater and easier access for those working with these debtors and the agency where the debt(s) is owed. e. Greater efficiencies and economies of scale could be achieved as a more streamlined system is developed. f. Development of streamlined and clear legislation, policy and procedures around debt owed to the state. g. A single entity could advocate more effectively to Ministers and to different departments about key debt issues. 10. There are some relevant examples from overseas jurisdictions that could inform a wider discussion of a single centralised entity for a New Zealand context. Page 3 of 6 a. USA – The American federal government has the Centralized Receivables Service (CRS) programme which is the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s initiative to manage non-tax accounts receivable on behalf of federal agencies. iv The CRS is focused on managing pre-delinquent debt and debt in the early stages of delinquency before it is referred to Debt Management. As depicted in Figure 1, the CRS is forming a single, streamlined debt collection and debt management system across other federal government agencies. Figure 1: CRS operating model & principles (USA federal government) b. UK – In the UK, particularly since Covid lockdowns, there has been growing concern about how public bodies were collecting and managing debts owed to them. This concern from community groups and other organisations led to the Debt Management Function (in the Cabinet Office) publishing a Call for Evidence on fairness in Government debt management in June 2020. v There has been lots of progress in this space, including proposals for a Debt Management Bill (for debt owed to government departments) and amendments to council tax and bailiff regulations related to public debt collection. vi The UK approach is similar to the proposed IRD framework here in New Zealand and has been focussed on working with government agencies and their specific debt collection service. However, some groups and researchers have in recent years explored what a single debt collection agency could look like. Responding to the proposed framework 11. This following section will offer some general comments on the IRD proposed framework. While we do not believe this proposed framework is the best approach as outlined above, we will respond to some of the key questions or issues raised. We know there will be more opportunities to engage with this policy development process in the future which we are happy to do. a. Principles – We support the principles set out in the framework. We do question whether a ranking or prioritising system is needed to help clarify a situation where principles might be in conflict with each other. This also raises the question about Page 4 of 6 whether there should be an over-arching principle that takes precedence over others in this framework. b. Robust affordability or hardship assessments – The Salvation Army contends strongly that robust and detailed affordability assessments are needed for all people owing debts to government. The community financial capability sector has advocated strongly for this around private debt and the CCCFA. We believe central to a framework (or a single crown debt collection agency) should be ensuring all debtors have an affordability assessment that governs the debt recovery, repayment, or forgiveness pathway they undertake. Assessing levels of private debt, culturally related spending, or the presence of any Buy Now Pay Later accounts are crucial in getting a complete picture of the debtor. c. Different kinds of debt – Attachment orders around civil debt has been an area that we and many other organisations have advocated for in recent years. In our Debt Collection and Repossession vii report in 2019, we highlighted these orders and also the need for effective policy solutions like a judgement proof debtor policy. In 2021, we released another paper – The Struggle is Real viii – looking at financial hardship issues post-Covid. Again, we highlighted the plague of these orders. Figure 1 shows that most attachment orders being made by Courts are on people with fixed and low incomes through government benefit payments. In 2020, only 14% of attachment orders were placed on people receiving wages, leaving a massive 86% of attachment orders being imposed on beneficiaries. This has been the pattern for attachment orders for the last three years. It is fair to assume that those receiving wages are likely to be in better positions to repay this civil debt compared with people receiving a benefit as their main source of income. In relation to debts to government, more work is needed to reduce this injustice around attachment orders around civil debt that has been created by government or judicial systems. This is why a judgement proof debtor policy (relating to all beneficiaries) is needed for New Zealand. The framework for this policy is alive and well in New Zealand with the passing of the District Court (Protection of Judgment Debtors with Disabilities) Act. Now we need to extend that protection (which will clearly minimise hardship for very vulnerable debtors) to all of those on a welfare benefit. This kind of approach for the relevant debtor/beneficiary could be identified earlier via the robust affordability assessments for all debtors. Page 5 of 6 Figure 2: Attachment orders—people receiving benefits and wages—2018–2020. d. Ethical lending – Although this is slightly peripheral to this framework, we strongly believe that the scaling up of ethical lending options like Nga Tangata Microfinance and Good Shepherd are vital to provider options of credit for people. A scaled-up ethical lending sector could help people avoid more predatory lenders (in terms of private debt creation), and also help debtors who borrow elsewhere to pay off government debt. This area requires further analysis and more data. But we have consistently advocated that a bigger ethical lending sector can provide real help and alternatives to debt creation (or accumulation) to government departments or private lenders. e. Access for support people – One area that our financial mentors struggle with is getting good, fast access to public servants regarding the debt to government for our clients. Again, the suggestion of a single centralised debt collection agency interested us for many reasons, including the potential to have a one-stop location for financial mentors, support workers and community navigators to engage with around the government debts of their client. Additionally, this could be the location for the affordability assessment. We submit that this affordability assessment should be done in conjunction with financial mentors who know the holistic situation of the client. Either way, good, timely and consistent access is needed with these various agencies (or a single agency) for our staff to effectively support these debtors. f. Debt forgiveness and write offs – We welcome this discussion in the proposed framework. Whether it is a cross government approach, or a single entity model discussed above, ensuring there are clearer guidelines relating to minimising hardship and forgiving or writing off debt is extremely helpful. We also support the ordered approach or framework within each category of government debt and when and how to consider if a write off is appropriate or not.

See attached our services Responses to the Consultation Questions Q1. Do you have any comments on the principles as outlined? Yes – all appropriate but I feel the explanation for Behavioural Responses could be expanded Q2. Do you agree with the concept of principles? If so, are these the correct principles? What have we omitted? Yes Q3. Have we described the principles accurately in your view? If not, how would you reframe them? See Q1 above re Behavioural issues Q4. Do you have any comments on the different kinds of debt, their different purposes, and different treatments? No Q5. Are the right categories identified? Yes, and perhaps defining “financial difficulty”, “hardship”, and “unintended debt” Q6. Are there other policy factors that should be considered? Age and culture are big issues when considering the handling of debt Q7. Do you have any feedback on the recommended treatments? No Q8. Is it easy for debtors to understand what they owe, and to who? Depends on their financial education and cultural background. Certainly the CCCFA has been a very important introduction to this problem. I am not that confident some IRD debt is clearly understood. Q9. Are minimum debt repayment amounts typically set at manageable levels? Yes, I think so Q10. How easy is it for debtors to negotiate for hardship relief? Not easy depending on Q8 above. Certainly some Financial Mentors have these skills and avenues to advocate on behalf of debtors which is a very big advantage 9. Q11. What kinds of supports are most effective for people with persistent debt? Having the knowledge of what services are available, e.g. FinCap, etc. Unfortunately, I have found that Work & Income do not recommend the use of external services often enough. Handing out more and more Advances to someone without someone examining alternative solutions can just make their circumstances worse. Q12. What changes would you like to see to the way that the government manages debts, particularly debt owed by low-income households? Establishing a policy around referral to external advice. Q13. Should there be non-monetary options for paying down fines or debt? How could this work? What potential benefits or risks do you see with this idea? I don’t know without examples being considered Q14. Do you agree that the framework should require culturally appropriate communications with debtors? What would this look like for Māori, Pasifika and other affected groups? Absolutely, through recognising the associated difficulties Q15. Are extended families and larger households affected differently by government debt? How could this be addressed in the framework? Perhaps. It can be an issue but my experience signals when I should include extended families, which leads me to think it is too difficult to address in the framework. Q16. Should the framework reference a specific role for whānau, hapū or iwi or other community groups in the resolution of problem debt? What would this look like? As above in Q15. Q17. What issues are of most concern to the group that you represent? − − − − Poor basic financial literacy since the introduction of electronic systems and devises. Inadequate referral system by MSD for those with persistent debt problems Greed and arrogance of some money lenders; CCCFA has certainly helped Inflexibility by the large banks Q18. Are they addressed by the proposed framework? It will help to a degree – there will be no silver bullet though Q19. Do you have comments on the ways to improve the accessibility of communications about debt for different population groups (for example, young people or disabled people?) Teaching basic financial literacy within the schools from as early as primary school Q20. What improvements would you suggest? As in Q19 Q21. Do you have any comments on the proposed implementation of the framework, as outlined in Chapter One at 1.13 – 1.15 above? No Q22. Do you have any other feedback not covered by previous questions which you would like to provide? This is my personal observations, but I also support the higher-level submission from FinCap

Doc 1 IR2022/225; Tax treatment of income insurance levies and payments Page 1 of 11 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 27 May 2022 Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue Tax treatment of income insurance levies and payments Executive Summary Purpose 1. This report seeks joint Ministers’ agreement to the proposed tax treatment of the New Zealand Income Insurance Scheme (NZIIS). Context and background 2. In April 2022, public consultation 1 closed on the income insurance scheme developed by a Tripartite Working Group (NZ Government, Council of Trade Unions and Business NZ), and led by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE). Paid for by levies, the scheme proposes to cover no fault job loss resulting from economic displacement and health conditions/disabilities. It would be administered by the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) and modelled after the current accident compensation (AC) scheme. 3. In early July, Cabinet will decide whether to proceed with the NZIIS, as well as agree to the final policy design of the scheme if the decision is made to proceed. The tax treatment of the scheme is an outstanding policy issue, and it is important that Ministers agree to a recommended approach before the Cabinet decisions must be made. Problem definition 4. Income insurance levies and payments will be subject to New Zealand’s existing tax framework set out in the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA). A key factor when considering a preferred tax treatment is maintaining consistency with the treatment of the analogous AC scheme and the overall framework of the tax system. Tax implications for which no change is recommended 5. Under current law, the employer and employee levies would be subject to goods and services tax (GST). This is consistent with employer and employee ACC levies. Employers who are registered for GST will be able to claim a GST deduction for the GST component of the employer levy. Employees will not be able to claim a GST deduction for the GST component of the employee levy. 6. Both NZIIS entitlements paid by ACC and bridging payments, which are proposed to be paid by employers, will be subject to income tax in the hands of the recipient. 1 Discussion document: A New Zealand Income Insurance Scheme (published 2 February 2022) IR2022/225; Tax treatment of income insurance levies and payments Page 2 of 11 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 7. Employers will be allowed a deduction for the cost of the employer levy and the bridging payment when calculating their taxable income. Tax implications for which legislative change is recommended 8. Earnings-related ACC payments are defined as salary and wages under the ITA. As NZIIS payments will be similar in nature, we recommend that these payments are also defined as such. This will make NZIIS payments subject to PAYE and will not leave the recipient with a large tax bill to pay at the end of the year of receipt. 9. An interpretation of current law suggests that employees may be allowed a deduction for the employee levies deducted from their income. From a policy perspective, however, we recommend that employees are not permitted this deduction. Not permitting a deduction would be consistent with both the tax treatment of the ACC Earners’ levy and the framework for the taxation of individuals in general, under which employees are not permitted deductions for expenses incurred in producing their employment income. 10. The extent to which self-employed workers are included in the scheme is yet to be determined. If they are included, it would be preferable that self-employed NZIIS levies and entitlements are treated the same way they are under ACC. Some minor legislative change may be required to achieve this. 11. In terms of other deductions that may apply to NZIIS payments under the PAYE schedule: NZIIS levies –it would not be appropriate to apply these levies to NZIIS payments, as these payments are not forms of income insured by the scheme. ACC levies – these levies apply to all PAYE income payments, and this should include NZIIS payments. KiwiSaver employee contributions – should continue to be made. Individuals would continue to have the ability to apply for a KiwiSaver savings suspension while receiving NZIIS payments. Student loan repayments – like ACC and benefit payments, repayments should apply to NZIIS payments above the repayment threshold. Child support deductions – like ACC and benefit payments, child support should be automatically deducted from NZIIS payments. 12. NZIIS levies will also form part of the existing Government guarantee on PAYE payments. 13. Some minor legislative changes may be required to achieve these outcomes. Fiscal impact 14. There is a fiscal cost of $361 million per year from employers being able to deduct the levy. If self-employed are included, this cost increases to $481.8 million per year. If the decision was taken to allow employees a deduction for the levies they pay, this would further increase the fiscal cost to $934.4 million per year. IR2022/225; Tax treatment of income insurance levies and payments Page 3 of 11 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 15. These impacts count significantly against the previously estimated positive fiscal offsets from the scheme. Advice on the overall fiscal impact of the scheme will be provided as part of advice to Cabinet in early July. 16. There is no direct fiscal impact at this time as all decisions about tax treatment are contingent on the scheme and its final design being agreed to by Cabinet. Consultation 17. MBIE, ACC, and the Treasury have been consulted on the contents of this report. Next steps 18. The tax treatment that Ministers agree to will feed into the July Cabinet paper on final NZIIS policy design decisions. Recommendations We recommend that you: agree that no change is required to the following tax implications of the NZIIS scheme: i. All employer and employee levies will be subject to GST. ii. Employers who are registered for GST can claim a deduction for the GST component of the levies they pay, and employees cannot. iii. NZIIS payments will be subject to income tax. iv. Employers will be able to claim a deduction for the cost of employer levies and bridging payments. v. If self-employed persons are included in the scheme, they will also be permitted GST and income tax deductions for levies paid. vi. ACC levies, KiwiSaver employee contributions, student loan repayments and child support deductions will apply to NZIIS payments. Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed agree that NZIIS payments be defined as “salary and wages” under the ITA and therefore subject to PAYE. Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed agree that employees cannot claim a tax deduction for the cost of the employee levy. Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed agree that NZIIS levies will not apply to NZIIS payments.

In April 2022, public consultation closed on the income insurance scheme developed by a Tripartite Working Group (NZ Government, Council of Trade Unions and Business NZ). The scheme proposes to cover no-fault job loss resulting from economic displacement and health conditions/disabilities. It will be administered by the ACC and modelled after the current AC scheme. 20. Payments would cover 80% of a worker’s pre-displacement income, up to a maximum pre-displacement income of $130,911 per annum. In cases of economic displacement, the first four weeks would be paid for by the employer as a bridging payment. After this period, the worker would be eligible to receive NZIIS entitlements for up to six months. 21. It is proposed that the scheme be funded by compulsory levies of 2.78%, which would be split equally between the employee and employer (that is, each would pay 1.39%). These levies would apply to all income insured by the scheme below the $130,911 per annum threshold. 22. In early July, Cabinet will decide whether to proceed with the scheme, as well as agree to the final policy design of the scheme if the decision is made to proceed. The tax treatment of the scheme is an outstanding policy issue, and it is important that Ministers agree to a recommended approach before the Cabinet decisions must be made. Problem definition 23. Income insurance levies and payments will be subject to New Zealand’s existing tax framework set out in the ITA. It is useful to compare the various NZIIS-related transactions with existing transactions as this provides a framework for what the tax treatment will be. 24. A key factor when considering a preferred tax treatment is making sure we are not diverging from general tax principles and frameworks and therefore maintain consistency with the treatment of the analogous AC scheme. Applying existing tax frameworks Goods and services tax (GST) 25. To ensure GST remains a simple and efficient tax, it applies equally to most goods and services supplied in New Zealand. This includes insurance cover for loss of earnings, such as ACC and private income protection insurance. 26. Consistent with the GST treatment of insurance schemes, and the existing practice for ACC, levies payable by employers and employees will be subject to GST. This is because they represent consideration for the supply of insurance. The proposed levy rate in the discussion document is already GST inclusive. 27. Employers who are registered for GST will be able to claim a deduction for the GST cost of the employer levy, which is consistent with their ability to claim a deduction for the GST on other business-related expenses. Self-employed workers, if included in the scheme, will also be able to claim a deduction for the GST on the levies that they are IR2022/225; Tax treatment of income insurance levies and payments Page 6 of 11 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] required to pay. Employees will not be able to claim a deduction for the GST cost of the employee levy. 28. The above treatment is preferable from a policy perspective. Not applying GST to the levies would undermine New Zealand’s broad-based GST system and could set a precedent for future GST concessions. Also, the ability for GST-registered businesses to claim a deduction for the GST cost of the levy ensures GST remains a cost on the end consumers of the service (the insurance) rather than businesses. 29. NZIIS entitlements and bridging payments will not be subject to GST under current legislation. This is consistent with the GST treatment of regular salary and wages, ACC payments and other income protection insurance payments. 30. The current rules for GST and income protection insurance (such as private income protection insurance and ACC) result in the premiums/levies being taxed (with GST- registered self-employed persons and employers able to recover the GST component of the premiums by claiming a GST deduction) and the compensation payments not being subject to GST on pay out. These rules have been longstanding, and for consistency, we recommend this GST treatment applies to the NZIIS. Table 1: GST treatment NZIIS payment Bridging payment Employer levy Employee levy Self- employed levies\* Is it subject to GST? No No Yes Yes Yes Can a GST deduction be claimed? n/a n/a Yes – for GST- registered employers No Yes – for GST- registered self- employed persons \*if included in the scheme Income tax 31. As NZIIS entitlements and bridging payments fall under the definition of income under ordinary concepts, they will be subject to income tax. 32. Any income earned from part-time work while receiving NZIIS entitlements will have tax withheld at the secondary employment rate. 33. Employers will be able to claim a deduction for the cost of the employer levy and bridging payment in the same manner as any other business expense. This is on the basis that the levies are related to employment of staff and therefore expenditure incurred in carrying on the employer’s income-earning activity. Defining NZIIS payments 34. Under current tax frameworks, NZIIS entitlements paid by ACC would likely be income under ordinary concepts because they would be regular and fund the person’s living expenses. They would not fall under the definition of “employment income” as they IR2022/225; Tax treatment of income insurance levies and payments Page 7 of 11 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] would be statute-based, not based on the employment relationship. The payment as a proportion of a worker’s pre-displacement income is more a method of calculation than a link to the employer. 35. However, the analogous ACC weekly compensation payments are defined as “employment income” as they fall under the definition of “salary or wages” in the ITA. Furthermore, section 99 of the Accident Compensation Act 2001 treats the first week’s payment required to be made by an employer as salary or wages for the purposes of the ITA and Tax Administration Act 1994. This treatment ensures that payments have PAYE deducted at source and are unlikely to leave the recipient with a tax bill in the income year the payment is received. 36. If NZIIS payments are not defined as employment income, there will be no obligation on ACC or the employer to withhold tax. If NZIIS payments are defined as “salary and wages” and are therefore “employment income”, PAYE will be deducted at source. This will also mean there is additional consistency with ACC regarding the treatment of employee levies for income tax purposes, as discussed below. 37. Therefore, if there were a policy intention to define NZIIS entitlements and bridging payments as “employment income” for the purposes of the ITA, an amendment could be made to include “a New Zealand Income Insurance earnings-related payment” and “an income insurance employer bridging payment” within the definition of “salary or wages”. Officials recommend this treatment. The deductibility of the employee levy for income tax purposes 38. The employee levy will be deducted from salary and wages as part of the PAYE withheld by employers. 39. Under private income protection insurance schemes, insurance premiums are generally deductible against an employee’s taxable income when the insurance receipts are taxable. Generally, insurance payments have been taxable where the payment is based on the insured’s pre-displacement income. This might suggest that employees would be able to deduct their employee levies on the basis that the NZIIS payments are both taxable and based on pre-displacement income. 40. However, the NZIIS scheme is modelled after the AC scheme, with both schemes being public goods funded through levies on salaries and wages where claimants receive taxable payments. Under the AC scheme, employees are not able to claim a deduction for the ACC Earners’ levy. This is because payments from ACC are included in the definition of “employment income”, which means any expenses incurred in deriving this income are denied under the employment limitation in the ITA. 41. The employment limitation exists to simplify employees’ interaction with the tax system. PAYE is deducted, and tax returns can be automatically calculated without the need to account for various (and often arbitrary) expenses related to an individual’s employment. 42. There is also an equity argument to be made for denying deductions for employee levies. The current proposal is that all employees will be levied at a flat rate. As the personal income tax rate is determined on a progressive schedule, allowing a deduction for NZIIS levies is regressive. This is because those on a higher income, and hence on a higher marginal tax rate, will benefit more if the NZIIS employee levies are tax deductible. IR2022/225; Tax treatment of income insurance levies and payments Page 8 of 11 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 43. To recognise the fact that NZIIS payments function differently from private insurance payouts, and to maintain consistency with the tax treatment of ACC levies, it is officials’ view that the employee levy should not be deductible by employees. 44. These issues provide further motivation for an amendment to define NZIIS payments as “salary or wages” under the ITA. By having NZIIS payments (both the bridging payment and the NZIIS entitlement) fall under the umbrella of employment income, the employment limitation will deny employees the ability to claim the cost of the employee levy. Table 2: Proposed income tax treatment NZIIS entitlement Bridging payment Employer levy Employee levy Is it taxable? Yes – withheld by ACC Yes – withheld by the employer n/a n/a Is it deductible? n/a - ACC is exempt from income tax Yes – to the employer Yes No Other PAYE deductions 45. In addition to income tax, income earned from employment is also subject to ACC levies, KiwiSaver employee contributions, student loan repayments and child support deductions. Once the scheme is in place, this income will also be subject to NZIIS levies. If income insurance payments are to be defined as employment income, it must be determined whether such payments will be subject to these deductions. 46. If PAYE deductions differ between income while employed and NZIIS payments (NZIIS entitlements and bridging payments), two considerations arise: This will increase the net replacement rate of the insurance payment. If certain PAYE deductions do not apply to insurance payments, the take-home income received from NZIIS will be greater than 80% of the take-home pay received under employment. The extent to which this will occur will depend on the number and size of deductions that are excluded from these payments. The employer will be withholding different amounts from the income they pay to their employees compared with the bridging payment they pay to ex- employees. This will impact an individual’s end-of-year square up. 47. Given these considerations, the starting point for this analysis is that all PAYE deductions (ACC levies, KiwiSaver employee contributions, student loan repayments, child support deductions and NZIIS levies) will apply to income insurance payments. However, if there is a strong policy rationale to exclude certain deductions, then these options will need to be considered. NZIIS levies 48. The discussion document stated that NZIIS levies will apply to all income that is insured by the scheme. As claimants will be entitled to 80% of their pre-displacement earnings up to a maximum of 80% of $130,911 per annum, they will be levied at a IR2022/225; Tax treatment of income insurance levies and payments Page 9 of 11 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] flat rate while employed, with maximum leviable income being capped at $130,911 per annum. 49. Arguably, NZIIS entitlements and bridging payments are not income that is being insured by the scheme. This means that these payments should not be subject to NZIIS levies, given that time on NZIIS will not count towards the contribution period for NZIIS eligibility. This will increase the net replacement rate of the payment by the size of the levy (currently estimated to be 1.39% for an employee). 50. The operational implication is that employers will be withholding differently between income while employed and the bridging payment. ACC levies 51. In the case of ACC, recipients of ACC weekly compensation continue to pay ACC levies on this income. The fact that NZIIS claimants will still be able to receive the benefits of ACC while receiving their income insurance payments suggests that claimants should continue to be liable for ACC levies. 52. Under the current legislation, ACC levies apply to all PAYE income payments, which NZIIS payments will fall within. However, there are some exceptions. For example, main MSD benefit payments are not liable for ACC levies. KiwiSaver contributions 53. KiwiSaver employee contributions are made at a rate of 3% (the compulsory rate), or 4%, 6%, 8% or 10% (if the employee elects to contribute at a higher rate). KiwiSaver contributions are deducted from ACC payments, but not MSD benefit payments. The reason for not deducting from benefit payments is due to concerns about income adequacy. KiwiSaver contributions are also not deducted from redundancy payments. 54. If KiwiSaver contributions were deducted from NZIIS payments, this might raise concerns about income adequacy of those on the lowest incomes. However, this could be mitigated if they applied for a KiwiSaver savings suspension. This option could be included as part of the NZIIS application process. 55. Consequently, officials consider that deductions for KiwiSaver employee contributions should be made from NZIIS entitlements. It is finely balanced whether bridging payments are more akin to redundancy payments. MBIE are recommending that these payments are not defined as redundancy payments, since they will be paid as regular salary and wages. Therefore, KiwiSaver employee contributions should also apply to bridging payments. 56. Under the KiwiSaver Act 2006, employer contributions are not paid on ACC payments, including the first week compensation paid by the employer. Therefore, NZIIS entitlements and bridging payments would not be subject to KiwiSaver employer contributions consistent with that approach. Student loan repayments 57. Student loan repayments should be deducted from payments under NZIIS. Student loan repayments become compulsory for earners once their income is above the student loan repayment threshold. Currently, student loan repayments are deducted at a rate of 12% on income above $21,268 per annum for New Zealand-based IR2022/225; Tax treatment of income insurance levies and payments Page 10 of 11 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] borrowers. (This threshold does not apply to income from secondary jobs, meaning that, generally, all income from such jobs is subject to student loan repayments.) 58. The amount an individual needs to repay for student loan purposes depends on salary and wage income plus any adjustable net income. ACC and MSD benefit payments count as income for the purposes of student loan repayments. However, if a person’s income is below the threshold, they do not have to make repayments. For NZIIS recipients, current rules would provide a natural buffer for those on low incomes, while still requiring those whose income is above the threshold to make repayments. 59. If NZIIS entitlements did not count as income for student loan repayment purposes, those with incomes well above the threshold would not have to make repayments, which would increase the net replacement rate significantly. This could diminish work incentives, especially in instances where the interaction with the welfare system means net replacement rates approach 100% or higher. Child support deductions 60. Child support is money paid by parents who do not live with their children or who share care with someone else. Child support is based on both parents’ income, and for parents whose income is taxed entirely at source (for example, salary and wage earners), this is their income from the last calendar year (1 January to 31 December). For others, their income from two years ago is used. 61. A liable parent pays their child support by automatic deduction from source deduction payments made by their employer. If a parent experiences a drop in income of at least 15 percent from the income they have been assessed on, they can elect to estimate their income. The ability to estimate would address situations where a person struggles to meet their child support obligation due to the drop in income caused by moving from employment to receiving NZIIS payments. 62. If child support deductions were not made automatically from NZIIS payments, the liable parent would need to pay Inland Revenue independently. This is not consistent with recent policy changes to apply automatic deductions to newly liable parents. Table 3: Proposed treatment for other PAYE deductions Will it be deducted from NZIIS entitlements and bridging payments? NZIIS levies No ACC levies Yes KiwiSaver employee contributions Yes (however employers/ACC will not have to pay KiwiSaver employer contributions) Student loan repayments Yes (on income above the repayment threshold) Child support deductions Yes IR2022/225; Tax treatment of income insurance levies and payments Page 11 of 11 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Self-employment 63. The extent to which self-employed workers are included in the scheme is yet to be determined and the conclusions below may have to be given further consideration depending on the final form of their inclusion. 64. We are assuming that, if included, self-employed persons will be liable for both the employer and employee levies, which will be invoiced by ACC. Consistent with current tax legislation, both levies will be costs incurred in carrying on a business activity. This means self-employed workers will be able to deduct these levies when deriving taxable income. They will also be able to claim a deduction for the GST component of these levies if they are registered for GST. 65. As the income generated through self-employment has no nexus to an employment relationship, any NZIIS payments received by a self-employed person would not be employment income. This means self-employed workers will be able to claim the cost of both levies when deriving their taxable income and PAYE will be deducted from any payments made under the NZIIS. 66. Officials recommend that if the self-employed are included in the scheme, any payments made under the scheme should be treated consistently with ACC payments and therefore PAYE should be applied to those payments. Fiscal impact 67. The negative fiscal impact against the scheme of employers deducting the cost of the employer levy is estimated to be $361 million per year. If self-employed are included in the scheme, this cost increases to $481.8 million per year. 68. If the decision was taken to allow employees a deduction for the levies they pay, this would further increase the fiscal cost against the scheme to $934.4 million per year. 69. These impacts count significantly against estimated fiscal offsets from the scheme (for example, from savings in welfare expenditure and income tax payable on scheme entitlements). Advice on the overall fiscal impact of the scheme will be provided as part of advice to Cabinet in early July. 70. There is no direct fiscal impact at this time as all decisions about tax treatment are contingent on the scheme and its final design being agreed to by Cabinet. \[IN CONFIDENCE\] POLICY AND REGULATORY STEWARDSHIP Tax policy report: New Zealand Income Insurance – Consequential amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 Date: 12 January 2023 Priority: Medium Security level: In Confidence Report number: IR2023/007 Action sought Action sought Deadline Minister of Finance Agree to recommendations 23 January 2023 Minister for Social Development and Employment Minister for ACC Agree to recommendations 23 January 2023 Minister of Revenue Agree to recommendations 23 January 2023 Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety Agree to recommendations 23 January 2023 Contact for telephone discussion (if required) Name Position Telephone Bary Hollow Principal Policy Advisor Hannah Fogarty Policy Advisor s 9(2)(a) Doc 2 IR2023/007: New Zealand Income Insurance – Consequential amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 Page 1 of 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 12 January 2023 Minister of Finance Minister for Social Development and Employment Minister for ACC Minister of Revenue Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety New Zealand Income Insurance – Consequential amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 Summary Purpose 1. In July 2022, Cabinet delegated authority to the Ministers of Finance, Social Development and Employment, ACC, Revenue, and Workplace Relations and Safety to make additional policy decisions and minor changes in relation to issues that arise in drafting of the New Zealand Income Insurance (NZII) Bill \[CAB-22-MIN- 0250.02 rec 84\]. 2. This report seeks agreement from delegated Ministers to further amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) that will be required as part of the NZII bill. Context and background 3. Instructed by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), the Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO) is currently drafting legislation which will introduce an income insurance scheme. This legislation is scheduled to be introduced in February 2023 and enacted before the 2023 election. 4. Due to the scheme’s interaction with the tax and transfer system, consequential amendments to the ITA and the Tax Administration Act 1994 are required. These are being drafted by Inland Revenue. 5. In this drafting process, we have found two areas which call for further amendments to the ITA. Ministers’ agreement is required for these amendments to proceed. Definition of bridging payments under the ITA 6. In May 2022, we provided advice on the tax treatment of NZII levies and payments \[IR2022/225 refers\]. We recommended that NZII payments (including the 4-week bridging payment paid by employers) would be defined as “salary and wages” under the ITA. This was to maintain consistency with the treatment of ACC earnings- related payments under the Act. 7. You agreed to this recommendation and the decision was confirmed by Cabinet in July 2022 \[CAB-22-MIN-0250.02 rec 21.1\]. 8. However, recent developments to the bridging payment requirement mean we are inclined to redefine the bridging payment as an “extra pay” under the ITA 1 . This 1 This does not affect the decision to define NZII entitlements paid by ACC as salary and wages. IR2023/007: New Zealand Income Insurance – Consequential amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 Page 2 of 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] is consistent with how redundancy and lump sum payments are defined under the ITA. 9. There are two reasons for this change. Firstly, the NZII bill is being drafted in a way which gives employers the option to pay the bridging payment either as a lump sum or as part of the regular salary and wage cycle. If employers choose to pay the bridging payment as a lump sum upon termination of employment, there is a risk that more income tax will be withheld on the payment above what is due on the payment. 10. By defining bridging payments as an extra pay, the risk of over-withholding of tax on lump sum payments is mitigated. However, it maintains the intended tax treatment that the payment is made in connection to employment and subject to income tax. 11. Furthermore, there was a recent in-principal decision to allow employers to satisfy the bridging payment requirement by paying contracted redundancy compensation \[CAB-22-MIN-0484 rec 19\]. Redundancy payments are defined as “extra pay” under the ITA, so defining bridging payments in the same manner would be consistent. Implication for KiwiSaver employee contributions 12. We had previously advised that KiwiSaver employee contributions should be deducted from bridging payments since they would be paid as regular salary and wages. However, under the KiwiSaver Act 2006, payments that are akin to a redundancy payment do not have employee contributions deducted. 13. The change in the drafting of the NZII Bill making bridging payments more akin to redundancy payments will now result in KiwiSaver employee contributions not being deducted from bridging payments. Officials recommend that the tax treatment aligns with this change and treats the bridging payments constantly with redundancy payments with no employee contributions being deducted from those amounts. 14. No change is required for KiwiSaver employer contributions as these are not payable on these payments consistent with the treatment of ACC payments, including the first week compensation paid by the employer. Tax credit eligibility for partners of NZII recipients 15. In July 2022, Cabinet decided that NZII recipients would not be eligible for the Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC), In-work Tax Credit (IWTC), and Independent Earner Tax Credit (IETC) \[CAB-22-MIN-0250.02 rec 20.2\]. They would remain eligible for the Family Tax Credit. 16. This decision was made on the basis that it would maintain consistency with the eligibility criteria for those on main benefits. 17. In drafting consequential amendments to the ITA, a question has arisen regarding the eligibility of partners of NZII recipients for the MFTC and IWTC. Under the welfare system, partners of those on main benefits are also not eligible for these tax credits. 18. To extend the intended consistency across main benefits and NZII, we are seeking Ministers’ agreement that partners of NZII recipients will also not be eligible for the MFTC and IWTC.

MBIE, ACC, and MSD a nd were consulted on the contents of this report. The Treasury were informed of this report. Fiscal Implications 20. There are no fiscal implications to the proposed changes. Next steps 21. Ministerial consultation on the NZII bill and associated Cabinet paper is scheduled for 26 th January. We therefore require decisions on the recommendations in this report by 23 rd January.

We understand the main objective is to increase the public’s understanding of the tax system and improve the quality of debate surrounding its key features. This includes distributional outcomes, particularly for very high income and wealth individuals. We also understand the Minister of Revenue wishes for a TPA to be an enduring part of New Zealand’s tax policy landscape. 2.We do not recommend enacting statements of principle within legislation by themselves (e.g., “the tax system must be progressive”). However, we think there is value in creating a reporting framework which provides a consistent source of information on the tax system, and is informed by a set of tax principles. The focus of reporting could also be guided by the Government’s annual Revenue Strategy. The resulting information could be used to inform future Governments’ priorities, the Tax and Social Policy Work Programme and future tax advice. This report seeks your agreement to the development of a legislated reporting framework based on generally accepted tax principles, within a TPA. 3.Provided you agree, the next step would be for officials to prepare a paper which seeks Cabinet’s agreement to proceed with the development of a legislated reporting framework and to consultation. Principle-based reporting 4.A principle-based reporting framework has precedent in New Zealand. Current examples include the Public Finance Act 1989 (PFA) and the Child Poverty Reduction Act 2018 (CPRA). Opportunities and benefits 5.Among other things, the reporting framework would increase the amount of readily available information about the tax system. This would help inform the public and would raise the quality of public debate. More tax relevant information would also better inform decision making. 6.A reporting framework would also complement Inland Revenue and the Treasury’s tax stewardship role and increase our understanding of how the tax system operates against tax principles. Inland Revenue and the Treasury would benefit from the development of an enduring and credible source of information. This would help inform the long-term development of the tax system. Costs and risks 7.However, as with any initiative, the framework would also carry costs and risks. These include: IR2021/407, T2021/2404; Establishing a reporting framework in a Tax Principles Act Page 2 of 15 7.1 Drafting: Care will need to be taken in drafting the legislation to ensure that the ongoing development of reporting measures and tax policy is supported, and the reporting becomes enduring and robust. We would also need to ensure the legislation cannot serve as the basis of a legal action against the Government, and will not alter the responsibilities of Agencies under other pieces of legislation. 7.2 Resourcing: The framework is likely to require dedicated resourcing to ensure the necessary data collection and information reporting occurs. We also expect that it will take time to fully realise the reporting framework’s benefits. We will assess if this would require a change in baseline funding as the work progresses. Choice of approach to the reporting framework 8.While the PFA and the CPRA both require the Government and officials to report on specific issues within a legislative framework, the approaches which they take differ. Where the PFA requires the Government to prepare financial information according to widely accepted accounting measures (which adapt over time), the CPRA’s reporting measures are closely prescribed within the legislation itself. Reporting options 9.In our view, a TPA could take either of the two following forms: Option 1: High level principles with flexible reporting requirements. 9.1 This would set up a statement of general principles in legislation, with a legislated requirement for the government to issue a guiding statement. Officials would be required to independently report on relevant information and measures. Officials would have the flexibility to choose the most appropriate information and adapt their reporting over time. 9.2 Option 1 would follow a similar approach to the PFA. It would offer a set of tax principles and require the government to provide additional reporting guidance through a regular statement (e.g., the Revenue Strategy). This would allow the government to request information about specific issues of interest (e.g., high wealth individuals). Option 2: A set of detailed principles and defined measures in legislation with officials reporting according to those defined criteria. 9.3 Option 2 would more closely follow the format of the CPRA. The TPA could require officials to report on, for example, the progressivity of the tax system according to a series of closely defined metrics. However, as we explain within the body of this report (below), this restricts the framework’s ability to adapt as new measures are developed over time and may not be as widely accepted. It would also take longer to develop the legislation under Option 2 because the defined measures would need to be developed in advance. Officials recommend Option 1 10.Both options would achieve your objective of providing greater information on the tax system. 11.However, we believe that Option 1 is the most achievable and that it provides greater flexibility. This means it is more likely to be an enduring part of New Zealand’s tax policy landscape. Option 1 would involve building a neutral, open, IR2021/407, T2021/2404; Establishing a reporting framework in a Tax Principles Act Page 3 of 15 fact-driven approach to information collection which could be developed and improved over time. This approach would allow the Tax Principles Act to have flexibility to reflect different governments’ views on distributional outcomes and priorities. 12.It would allow officials to learn from past reporting and improve subsequent reporting without the need to amend the authorising legislation. We consider that allowing both the information produced by the TPA to reflect the views of successive governments and officials to develop their reporting measures over time will be essential ingredients in ensuring framework’s longevity and success. 13.Option 1 is also less likely to require extensive consultation than Option 2. This is as reference to generally accepted tax principles is less challenging from a design perspective than enacting detailed principles and measures. This means that Option 1 could be set-up and “underway” comparatively quickly. Option 1 would also reduce the risk of the reporting becoming a “pass/fail” assessment of the current tax system. Detailed design questions Selection of principles 14.The selection of appropriate tax principles is the most important design question. Ideally, the selected principles would complement New Zealand’s existing tax and revenue framework and draw on the work of previous tax working groups. Drawing upon the familiar and accepted principles of taxation would capitalise on existing analytical frameworks. 15.We acknowledge that the selection of principles can be challenging. There is also debate as to whether principles overlap or involve trade-offs with one another. However, both the 2009 and 2018 Tax Working Groups included the following principles in assessing the design of the tax system: 1 15.1 Efficiency: The principle of efficiency seeks to raise tax at the least cost to domestic residents. 15.2 Fairness/Equity: The principle of equity is typically divided into its horizontal and vertical components. 15.3 Revenue integrity: The Revenue system should be sustainable over time and minimise opportunities for tax avoidance. 15.4 Compliance and administration cost: The tax system should be as simple and low cost as possible for taxpayers to comply with, and for Inland Revenue to administer. 16.Reasonable arguments could also be made for the including the principles of certainty and flexibility within the reporting framework. 2 17.We will need to ensure that the selected principles in the legislation cannot form the basis of legal proceedings against the Crown, and that they do not alter the responsibilities of agencies under other pieces of legislation. 1 Both Working Groups also included the value of coherence (i.e., that individual reform options should make sense in the context of the system as a whole). 2 Discussed further, below. IR2021/407, T2021/2404; Establishing a reporting framework in a Tax Principles Act Page 4 of 15 Government statement 18.Other important design questions include: 18.1 Role of a government statement: The framework could include the ability for governments to offer non-legislative direction on the desired focus of the reporting (e.g., through the issue of a government statement). This would allow governments to commission information to support their specific priorities without compromising the independence of the reporting framework. This could be done using the existing Revenue Strategy process. A Revenue Strategy is a requirement of the PFA. Officials could explore whether the obligation to provide a Revenue Strategy could be shifted to the TPA. 3 This would ensure the obligation to issue a Revenue Strategy is sourced within the Inland Revenue Acts and aligned with tax principles. 18.2 Frequency of reporting: We recommend that any reporting has sufficient time for analysis (such as reporting on a 3-year cycle). We consider that this would enable higher quality insights and reporting. Shorter periods (e.g., annual reporting) would likely result in lower quality analysis and it is likely that each year’s information would not be significantly different. Next steps 19.Taking the project forward will require decisions on the extent and nature of consultation and the legislative timeline. More specifically: 19.1 Consultation: We recommend that there is public consultation prior to the enactment of legislation (in keeping with the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). This could occur after the preparation of a Cabinet paper (i.e., before final decisions are made and legislation is drafted). While consultation would extend the project’s timeframe, it would align with the GTPP and is likely to result in a better and more enduring product. Consultation could occur through the release of a short discussion document and targeted discussions with key stakeholders. 19.2 Timeline: Introducing legislation before year’s end will be very challenging as Inland Revenue’s resources are currently invested in other projects and are affected by the disruption of COVID-19 restrictions. We suggest introducing legislation after the enactment of the 2021 Annual Rates’ Bill. 19.3 Example TPA: We will provide an example of a TPA and the types of information that could be reported on the tax system informed by the tax principles. 20.Resourcing: We are working through the resourcing requirements of a Tax Principles Act including which agencies will be responsible for reporting. It is possible that resourcing of the initiative will require a budget bid. We will report back on potential administrative costs and whether these can be met from within baselines (taking into account wider departmental cost pressures). 3 Section 26G(1)(e) of the PFA requires the government to have regard to efficiency and fairness, including the predictability and stability of tax rates.

Noted Noted Stephen Bond Murray Shadbolt Acting Manager Principal Policy Advisor Tax Strategy Policy and Regulatory Stewardship The Treasury Inland Revenue Hon Grant Robertson Hon David Parker Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue / /2021 / /2021 s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) IR2021/407, T2021/2404; Establishing a reporting framework in a Tax Principles Act Page 7 of 15 Purpose 1.The Minister of Revenue asked officials to provide advice on developing and establishing a reporting framework informed by a set of tax principles. These principles are to be set out in a Tax Principles Act (TPA). This project has been included on the Government’s current Tax Policy Work Programme, and this report: 1.1 Outlines the benefits and risks of enacting a TPA at a high-level (page 7); 1.2 Seeks your decision on the reporting framework for a TPA (page 9); and 1.3 Seeks your decision on the principles to include in a TPA and further design and process issues (page 12). 2.Provided you agree, the next step would be for officials to prepare a Cabinet paper for you seeking Cabinet’s agreement to proceed with developing a legislated reporting framework. 3.Consultation with stakeholders could take place following Cabinet approval on a public or targeted basis and could be accompanied by the release of a short discussion document. Benefits and risks of a Tax Principles Act at a high-level Objectives 4.We understand the main objective of a Tax Principles Act is to increase the public’s understanding of the tax system and improve the quality of debate surrounding its key features. 5.To support this objective, the Minister of Revenue has proposed the enactment of a Tax Principles Act. This Act would: 5.1 contain a set of generally accepted tax principles; 5.2 create a reporting framework which would offer regular information on how New Zealand’s tax system is operating in light of these principles. 6.A key focus of this reporting framework would be on the distributional outcomes of the tax system (particularly for very high income and wealth individuals). There are related projects looking at this area and being reported separately. 7.We also understand that another objective is for a TPA to remain an enduring feature of New Zealand’s tax policy landscape. Overseas experience 8.Legislation similar to the proposed Tax Principles Act have been enacted overseas. For example, Article 53 of Italy’s Constitution explicitly requires that the Italian tax system be progressive. 4 9.However, the key insight we can draw from the constitutions of these countries is that enacting a set of abstract principles alone is unlikely to materially inform or influence tax policy. 10.This is because statements of principle on their own can be interpreted in quite different ways. Such statements require the tax system to display a particular characteristic without defining what it means or explaining how it is to be applied. 4 Similar provisions exist in the constitutions of Spain and Portugal. IR2021/407, T2021/2404; Establishing a reporting framework in a Tax Principles Act Page 8 of 15 This means that tax systems with quite different outcomes could potentially lay equal claim to bearing out the same principle in practice. 11.We do not recommend the enactment of tax principles on their own, and support having any principles supported by a reporting framework. We consider that ongoing reporting on the tax system informed by the tax principles will be crucial to delivering on your objectives. Opportunities and benefits 12.The development of a reporting framework informed by tax principles would offer a range of potential benefits. Looking at examples such as the Public Finance Act and the Child Poverty Reduction Act these include: 12.1 Improved tax-relevant information: A reporting framework informed by core tax principles would increase the amount of available information on these aspects of the tax system. This likely to improve the public’s understanding of the tax system and its role in society, and produce more informed public debate on tax, economic and social issues. The greater availability of tax information could also contribute positively to the quality of discussions among decision makers (and therefore to shorter-term policy outcomes); 5 12.2 Increased institutional value of Inland Revenue and the Treasury: A high quality, enduring reporting framework would provide an increasing body of insight within Inland Revenue and the Treasury about how the tax system operates in regard to these tax principles. This would increase agencies’ ability to provide best advice on changes to maintain and improve the integrity of the tax system, as well as the ability of the tax system to meet longer-term social, fiscal and economic objectives. It would complement work on Long-term Insight Briefings. Potential risks 13.A reporting framework informed by legislated tax principles would carry some risks and face challenges in achieving its objectives. These include the following: 13.1 Resourcing: Implementing a reporting framework would require regular data collection and analysis, often in connection with topics that are not well understood (or which remain subject to academic debate). Implementing the framework will require specialist knowledge and resourcing. 6 This may reduce tax policy resources available to deliver other government priorities. We will consider further how any reporting could be delivered and whether reporting agencies will require additional funding. 13.2 Endurance and flexibility: If the principles and reported information are too narrow or rigid they may not receive broad acceptance and therefore not be useful for informing tax policy. Expressing the principles in generally accepted terms would retain widespread support and allow the framework to adapt to developments in tax scholarship, promoting its durability. This is discussed further below. 13.3 Determining the right measures: Not all principles readily lend themselves to quantitative analysis. For example, it is unlikely that the adaptability of the tax system (i.e., its ability to respond to new developments) could be measured directly. However, officials could seek to address the issue 5 Inland Revenue would continue to report on performance measures as part of an accountability framework. In this sense, the reported information and measurement in the TPA would not be used as a means of accountability but as a way to learn about complex systems and their impact on people and entities. This would help the tax system to adapt and improve over time. 6 This could be funded from either existing baselines, or through an increase in reporting agencies’ operating baselines. IR2021/407, T2021/2404; Establishing a reporting framework in a Tax Principles Act Page 9 of 15 indirectly (e.g., by offering information about income reporting among self- employed members of the “gig” economy, or by surveying the tax community more broadly). This would allow us to provide some information on the tax system’s ability to meet new challenges. 13.4 Risk of misinterpretation: There is the risk that the data provided by the framework could be misunderstood. This risk could be addressed through the clear and concise explanation of reported information. A reporting framework for a Tax Principles Act 14.In our view, a TPA that sets out tax principles and a reporting framework could take one of two forms: 14.1 Option 1: High-level principles with flexible reporting requirements; or 14.2 Option 2: Closely defined principles and detailed reporting requirements 15.Option 1’s high-level approach is similar to the framework set out in the Public Finance Act 1989 (PFA). The more detailed character of Option 2 is closer to the approach taken by the Child Poverty Reduction Act 2018 (CPRA). Option 1: High-level principles with flexible reporting requirements 16.This would require a statement of general principles in legislation, with a legislated requirement for a government statement and officials’ reports. Officials would develop measures and independently report on relevant information. Officials would have the flexibility to choose the most appropriate information and adapt measures over time as understanding of best practice in measurement grows and more data becomes available. 17.If, for example, the principle of fair and equitable taxation were to be included, the Government’s Revenue Strategy could request the reporting framework focus on specific issues, such as horizontal equity, or the degree of progressivity in the income tax rules and indicate how the government might focus on that issue in its work programme. This approach has precedent. For example, in 2021, the Revenue Strategy referred to the introduction of the 39% top tax rate as a measure the Government used to increase the progressivity of the tax system. Officials were also resourced and directed to look specifically at the effective tax rate of high wealth individuals and the integrity of the tax system from introducing the new rate. 18.We consider that allowing officials the flexibility to develop their information and measures over time would be essential to the framework’s success. Reporting definitively on some principles will be a difficult task. However, in some cases these could be addressed indirectly. 19.For example, efficiency is typically defined by economists in terms of minimising the economic cost of the revenue raised to taxpayers. Although it would be extremely difficult to assess the overall efficiency of the system directly, we would expect efficiency to be supported by broad and neutral taxes. Officials could therefore provide information about the neutrality and breadth of the tax system and thereby offer some indirect information on the likely efficiency of the tax system overall. 20.This approach is similar to that used in the PFA, which requires the Government to issue statements and public sector entities to prepare financial information according to widely accepted and independently audited accrual accounting concepts and measures. 7 7 The Treasury, A Guide to the Public Finance Act (26 November 2019). IR2021/407, T2021/2404; Establishing a reporting framework in a Tax Principles Act Page 10 of 15 Option 2: Detailed principles and reporting 21.Requiring detailed principles and reporting would more closely follow the format of the CPRA. The CPRA requires officials to provide detailed reporting against a series of closely defined measures which are set out in the legislation. For example, the CPRA requires officials to prepare an annual report which includes the percentage of children living in households in the financial year with a given proportion of disposable household income. 8 22.While the accounting measures behind the PFA are well established, the child poverty measures are less so and were the cause of some debate. Both the academic literature and the work of the Expert Advisory Group on Solutions to Child Poverty assisted in determining the most appropriate measures. 23.Under Option 2, the TPA could require officials to report on, for example, the progressivity of the tax system according to a series of closely defined metrics. However, as we explain below in Box 1, this approach would present significant challenges for officials. Other options considered 24.We have also considered options that would create a reporting framework without the tax principles (or the requirement to report) being prescribed by legislation. This would represent a less formal approach and could include Cabinet directing officials to report against a set of government agreed principles. 25.However, within government, resourcing is regularly reprioritised to deal with fundamental concerns and emerging issues. This means that legislated obligations usually take priority over those which are non-legislated. There is the risk that a Cabinet-agreed reporting requirement would not prove enduring and any resource devoted to it would become reprioritised in time. Additionally, under a non- legislated approach, any future government would be able to stop reporting without public notice. Recommendation on reporting framework Both options would provide greater information and transparency 26.We believe both Option 1 and Option 2 could be designed to provide you with greater information about specific aspects of New Zealand’s tax system. Even with high-level principles, the use of a government statement would allow you to request information about areas of the tax system which are of particular interest to you. In each case, officials would disclose the data, assumptions and definitions underlying their measures. But they differ in their flexibility 27.You have indicated that you want the Tax Principles Act to be enduring. We believe that achieving this will require the Tax Principles Act to have flexibility to reflect different governments’ views on distributional outcomes and priorities. 28.In addition, flexibility will allow us to change our measures in response to academic developments and improved data. This will help ensure the measures are robust and remain relevant over time. Option 1 with high level principles would provide flexibility 29.We consider Option 1 will better achieve the Minister of Revenue’s objectives. It would involve a building up a neutral, fact-driven approach to information collection and analysis that can evolve over time in response to feedback. This adaptable and 8 Section 31 of the CPRA 2018. IR2021/407, T2021/2404; Establishing a reporting framework in a Tax Principles Act Page 11 of 15 apolitical approach could increase the likelihood of the framework receiving broad cross-party support and interest from stakeholders. This would support the longevity of the Tax Principles Act. 30.The information and measures reported could be revised as the body of literature produced by the reporting framework grows. This would enable officials to learn and report new and improved measures over time, including as new data becomes available, without the need to amend the legislation. 31.Allowing flexibility in the information that is reported will allow governments to emphasise (via the Revenue Strategy) different aspects of the tax principles they wish to see in the reporting requirements as the economy changes (e.g., information on the taxation of global firms or adaptation to future of work). Option 2 does not provide as much flexibility 32.In contrast, Option 2 would require detailed measures to be defined and fixed within the legislation itself. This would likely make cross-party support more challenging. 33.Although the use of fixed measures would produce a consistent information stream whose results could be easily compared across the years, the quality of the information itself may not be as useful for tax policy development over time. This is because the measurement of tax principles (e.g., progressivity) is not an established science and would require many assumptions to be made by officials. Under Option 2, these assumptions would be more inherent in the legislation (although could also be highlighted in the reporting itself). 34.If these assumptions are built into the measure which is required to be reported, it would allow critics to challenge the TPA and its reporting if the assumptions do not withstand sustained scrutiny or have become outdated by subsequent scholarship. This could result in the framework producing data that is difficult to interpret or is even misleading. This would undermine the integrity of the reporting framework (Box 1 below outlines some of the issues with taking detailed measures and the difficulties that legislating detailed principles would create). Pass/fail assessment 35.Option 2 would also risk a “pass/fail” judgment being inferred of the New Zealand tax system’s consistency with various tax principles. Owing to the uncertainty associated with such an assessment of these principles and the undesirability of officials inserting themselves on arguably political questions, we do not think this “pass/fail” assessment would be desirable. Timeframes to implement 36.The Minister of Revenue has indicated that he wishes to introduce legislation for a Tax Principles Act as a priority. 37.The enactment of detailed principles and measures under Option 2 is likely to require greater consultation on what those measures should be than the enactment of more general principles with a flexible reporting framework under Option 1. This would require us to reassess the next steps and timeframes which we have suggested below. IR2021/407, T2021/2404; Establishing a reporting framework in a Tax Principles Act Page 12 of 15 Detailed design of a Tax Principles Act 38.This report seeks Ministers’ preferences at this stage to the key features of the design. What principles to include? 39.The key question is the selection of an appropriate set of principles. While we believe the same set of principles could be included under either Option 1 or Option 2, there would be a tighter definition in legislation under Option 2, which could limit what is reported. 40.We recommend the selected principles draw on existing analytical frameworks. This would capitalise upon the existing body of literature and the consensus among stakeholders as to the principles which underlie an effective tax system. 41.For example, the 2018 Tax Working Group referred to the established principles of “efficiency and growth, equity and fairness, revenue integrity, fiscal cost, compliance and administrative costs, and coherence” when assessing individual proposals for tax reform. In doing so, the 2018 Tax Working Group drew upon the “Principles of a Good Taxation System” set out in the 2009 Victoria University Tax Working Group. 9 Consistent with the findings of these working groups, the principles which could be incorporated within the TPA include: 10 41.1 Efficiency: The principle of efficiency seeks to raise tax at the least cost to domestic residents. 11 41.2 Fairness/Equity: The principle of equity is typically divided into its horizontal and vertical components. Horizontal equity requires that taxpayers in similar situations should be treated similarly in taxation while vertical equity 9 Victoria University Tax Working Group, 2010, p15 10 OECD, Addressing the challenges of the digital economy, Chapter 2 (2014) 11 Noting that we would expect an efficient tax system to be broad and neutral. Box 1: Fairness and Progressivity The principle that the tax system must be fair and equitable is often expressed in terms of how progressive a tax system is. For an income tax to be progressive, the percentage of income paid in tax rises with the amount of income earned over a given period. However, determining the progressivity of a tax system requires the consideration of a range of factors, including the: Definition of income: Defining the income which is received by the taxpayer is a necessary pre-requisite to determining the proportion of tax which is paid on that income. Questions related to the definition of income include whether it should be assessed in economic terms (i.e., Haig-Simons), inflation adjusted or nominal, and whether to include a range of government paid taxable assistance (such as paid parental leave). Economic incidence of taxation: To determine the amount of tax paid by a given taxpayer, it is important to understand where the economic (rather than legal) incidence of the taxation falls. For example, while the legal liability for returning GST in New Zealand rests with those in trade, some portion of the economic burden of the GST is borne by consumers of the goods sold by those in trade. Unfortunately, however, economists are generally uncertain about the exact economic incidence of taxation. Metric: A key issue is whether the assessment of progressivity should include income subject to tax from individuals only, or be extended to include the non-taxable transfer payments and government spending from which taxpayers benefit. Another question is whether it should be measured on an individual or on a household basis. Selection of a time period: As income is typically assessed annually, progressivity could be assessed on an annual basis. However, measuring progressivity on an annual basis is arbitrary and can overlook variations in the amount of tax paid by taxpayers over the course of their lifetime. This can skew the assessment of the progressivity of a tax system. IR2021/407, T2021/2404; Establishing a reporting framework in a Tax Principles Act Page 13 of 15 requires those with higher income or ability to pay to pay a greater proportion of their income in tax. 41.3 Revenue integrity: The revenue system should be sustainable over time and minimise opportunities for taxpayers to engage in tax avoidance. 41.4 Compliance and administration costs: The tax system should be as simple and low cost as possible for taxpayers to comply with (and for Inland Revenue to administer). 42.Two additional principles which you may wish to consider including are: 42.1 Certainty and predictability: The 2018 Tax Working Group (TWG) also included the principles of predictability and certainty in addition to the principles noted above. These principles require taxpayers to be able to understand clearly what their obligations are before those obligations are due. The 2014 OECD Report Addressing the Challenges of the Digital Economy (OECD Report) 12 also referred separately to the value of certainty, and argued that clear and simple tax rules reduced opportunities for aggressive tax planning (i.e., tax avoidance). 13 42.2 Flexibility/Adaptability: The OECD Report also referred to the principle of flexibility, which requires that tax systems remain dynamic and able to keep pace with technological and commercial developments (e.g., cryptoassets). Although flexibility is a more recent addition to tax literature, the current pace of technological change makes it relevant to policy makers in the present era. 43.There may be some overlap with the principles in terms of the information reported and measures used. For example, compliance costs are a measure of the certainty and simplicity of the tax system and an efficient tax system may also result in lower compliance and administrative costs. Likewise, tax policy may reflect a trade-off between tax principles and this would be reflected in the information reported. 44.We will need to ensure that the selected principles cannot form the basis of legal proceedings against the government. We will also need to ensure that the TPA does not alter the responsibilities of Agencies under other pieces of legislation. Government statement 45.Part of the reporting framework could include the ability for governments to offer non-legislative direction on the desired focus of reporting (e.g., through the issue of a Government statement or similar). This would allow governments to seek information which supports their specific policy aims and priorities while maintaining the independence and integrity of the reporting framework itself. 14 46.This non-legislative direction could be integrated within the Revenue Strategy, which is currently a component of the Government’s Fiscal Strategy. 15 47.For example, a government seeking information on the equity of the tax system, could issue a statement requiring officials to have regard to specific indicators in their reporting (e.g., economic income or wealth). In this context, a Government statement could act as a “brief of instructions” to focus officials’ reporting on areas of interest. This would not affect the wider role of the Revenue Strategy, which would continue to set out the government’s vision for a tax system and inform the Tax Policy Work Programme. 12 At p30. 13 The value of certainty has an established pedigree in tax literature, having been listed among the Four Canons of Taxation established by Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations (1776). 14 This is similar to the approach toward the Revenue Strategy. 15 PFA s 26L(d) requires the government to produce a Revenue Strategy. IR2021/407, T2021/2404; Establishing a reporting framework in a Tax Principles Act Page 14 of 15 48.However, for the framework to remain a neutral source of tax information and build up a longitudinal data series, it will need to retain a degree of independence from the government of the day. We would therefore suggest that the reporting maintain a consistent focus on the legislated principles in addition to the area(s) of interest to the instructing government. This will ensure that a consistent stream of information is produced (and available to decision makers) irrespective of the specific interests of the incumbent government. This would help to make the framework a permanent feature of the information landscape. 49.Incidentally, the Revenue Strategy is currently included as a requirement in the PFA. Officials could investigate the option to shift the requirement to produce a Revenue Strategy into the TPA. At this stage we consider the Tax Administration Act and its principles of integrity and fairness of process would remain separate. Frequency of reporting 50.A further design question concerns the frequency of reporting. We are aware of existing reporting frameworks which require the relevant authority to report every three to four years. 16 51.We recommend a similar three-year reporting period. This would provide sufficient time to prepare higher quality analysis. Shorter periods, such as annual or 18 monthly reporting, are unlikely to provide as much value as less frequent reporting on the basis that the findings of one year are unlikely to differ materially from the year immediately before or after it. 52.Another option could be to require reporting every three years by default, with the ability for Ministers to request more frequent reporting where required. Next Steps 53.Taking the project forward will require several decisions. Consultation 54.We recommend that there is consultation prior to the enactment of legislation (in keeping with the GTPP). We seek your preference as to whether you wish officials to undertake public consultation following the preparation of a Cabinet paper (e.g., through a short discussion document). 55.While consultation during the project would extend its timeline before Bill introduction by several months, it would align with the GTPP and is likely to produce a better end product. Increased collaboration with stakeholders is also likely to result in greater overall support for the initiative which will support the longevity of the Tax Principles Act. 56.Already, we are aware that the private sector has expressed interest in the tax principles project. We think the proposal for a high-level reporting framework would be positively received by the private sector and believe our current work would benefit from the ability to discuss the project, in general terms, with stakeholders before the drafting of legislation begins. 57.Consultation through the release of a short discussion document would allow the project to benefit from the insights of a variety of stakeholders and, more importantly, would allow stakeholders to understand the intention of the initiative (thereby improving the calibre of submissions). Alternatively, consultation could 16 For example, the Retirement Commissioner is required to publish a review of retirement income policies every three years. The LTIB is required every three years. IR2021/407, T2021/2404; Establishing a reporting framework in a Tax Principles Act Page 15 of 15 occur on an informal basis (i.e., without a discussion document) with key tax policy stakeholders. Timeline 58.The introduction of legislation before year’s end will be challenging. A significant portion of Inland Revenue’s resources are currently devoted to the housing reforms and to other policy changes which are to be enacted in the 2021 Annual Rates Bill. 59.Stakeholders’ resources will be devoted to submitting on the housing reforms, the Social Unemployment Insurance discussion document, and responding to Covid impacts. This means stakeholders’ capacity for engagement on the TPA will be limited. 60.We are provisionally aiming to introduce legislation after the enactment of the 2021 Annual Rates’ Bill. This would allow additional time for stakeholders to engage with the proposals at Select Committee. An indicative timeline is set out below: Example legislation and information for reporting 61.Officials will consider what information could be reported on the tax system, informed by the principles in this report, and what a TPA could look like and report further. Financial implications 62.We are working through the resourcing implications of this proposal, including agency reporting requirements. 63.It is possible that the ongoing resourcing of the initiative will require a budget bid (that is, if the project cannot be resourced from existing baselines). We will continue to investigate potential administrative costs and report back later on whether a Budget bid would be required. 64.If new funding is required, a budget bid will need to be invited and submitted by November 2021 in order to be considered in early 2022.

Background 2.Late last year, we provided the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue with advice (“Initial Advice”) on developing and establishing a new Tax Principles Act (“TPA”) \[IR2021/407, T2021/2404\]. 3.The intention of the TPA is to provide a reporting framework informed by a set of tax principles. The report proposed a set of general principles (listed in column one in the table below) and offered design choices on related matters (e.g. the frequency of reporting and the level of detail in legislation). 4.You have since asked officials to carry out further work on the presentation of the principles, with a view to expressing them in a way that is more likely to engage stakeholders and the wider public. 5.You have expressed concern that the enactment of a bare set of principles, without further context, may be a hurdle to public and stakeholder engagement with the legislation and reporting framework. 6.In our view, this issue could be addressed by presenting the principles in descriptive terms. For example, rather than referring to the principle of certainty alone and in the abstract, the legislation might say, “People should be able to clearly determine their tax obligations before they are due”. Other principles could be expressed in a similarly descriptive way. This would help stakeholders to grasp the content and intention of the tax principles, which information would be reported against, more easily and pose fewer barriers to engagement in public debate. Selection of principles 7.We would not recommend the enactment of maxims or prescriptive statements which deviate significantly from commonly accepted tax policy principles. More IR2022/099: Further Advice: Establishing a reporting framework in a Tax Principles Act Page 2 of 10 novel formulations could deter stakeholders from engaging with the policy process, or affect, long term, the willingness of future governments to continue commissioning reporting through the framework. Much of the framework’s value will arise from the body of work created by continued reporting and the regular public debate it generates over time. Locating the TPA within traditional tax policy frameworks would improve the chances of achieving enduring bipartisan support for the initiative and growing a body of literature over the coming years. Using the TPA to support government policy initiatives 8.We should note, however, that using traditional tax policy frameworks and principles would still allow governments to pursue or seek specific information to support their own policy objectives. 9.Governments could use the Revenue Strategy to instruct officials when reporting to have regard to specific areas of the tax system which are of interest to them (e.g. wealth or income distribution). The Revenue Strategy could also be used to expand on a government’s view of how the tax principles should be pursued relative to each other and the trade-offs that would be made for specific tax policies. For example, a government may wish to improve revenue integrity at the trade-off of higher compliance costs. 10.The TPA could also allow governments to provide a response to the reports produced under its jurisdiction. This approach has precedent, and would allow governments to offer their reflections on the reports (thereby closing the policy “loop”). Next steps 11.We expect to complete several key milestones in the project this year. These will include finalising the Budget bid and providing you with a draft Cabinet paper and discussion document. We will also need to confirm the detailed design decisions for draft legislation. 12.Provided you agree, the next step would be for officials to prepare a discussion document and draft Cabinet paper seeking Cabinet’s agreement to proceed with consultation on the development of the TPA. The discussion document would seek feedback on the final wording of the tax principles to be included in legislation and their descriptions, as well as detailed design questions such as frequency of reporting.

The initial advice was discussed at a meeting with officials on 21 October 2021. 2.The Minister of Revenue has since asked officials to carry out further work on the principles to be included within a new Tax Principles Act (“TPA”). This report: 2.1 Presents further advice on expressing the principles in a way which is more likely to be readily understood by, and engage, the public than in the Initial Advice. 2.2 Offers further advice on the framework’s possible design features and interaction with existing documents. 2.3 Seeks your agreement to prepare a short discussion document on the content and design of the proposed Tax Principles Act and associated consultation. 3.Provided you agree, the next step would be for officials to prepare a discussion document and draft Cabinet paper for you seeking Cabinet’s approval to the release of a discussion document. Further advice on description of tax principles Introduction 4.The intention of the TPA is to provide a reporting framework informed by a set of tax principles. Our Initial Advice proposed a set of general principles (listed in column one in the table below) and offered design options on matters such as frequency of reporting and the level of detail in legislation. 5.We understand you prefer formal reporting to occur once every three years, with the option for interim annual reporting. 6.We understand the main objectives of the framework are to increase the public’s understanding of the tax system and improve the quality of debate surrounding its key features. This includes distributional outcomes, particularly for very high wealth individuals where information is currently sparse. 7.You have since asked officials to carry out further work on the presentation of the principles, with a view to expressing them in a way that is more likely to engage stakeholders and the public. Discussion Descriptive presentation of tax principles 8.You have expressed concern that the enactment of a bare set of principles, without further description, may be a hurdle to public and stakeholder engagement with the legislation and reporting framework. Some stakeholders and members of the public will not be familiar with conventional tax policy principles (e.g. equity, IR2022/099: Further Advice: Establishing a reporting framework in a Tax Principles Act Page 5 of 10 efficiency, etc). Accordingly, we have given thought to how the framework might better engage a wider audience while still being enduring and feasible to report on. 9.In our view, this could be achieved by presenting the principles in descriptive, rather than general, terms. For example, rather than referring to the principle of certainty alone and in the abstract, the legislation might say, “People should be able to clearly determine their tax obligations before they are due.” 10.Enacting the principles in this way would make it clearer for the public and improve engagement, while still including the generally accepted principles of tax policy. Those familiar with the principles would recognise them immediately, while those who are not acquainted with them would grasp their meaning. 11.This approach does not presuppose the relative priority of the principles and associated trade-offs, which we anticipate would continue in the public debate informed by the reporting (for example, some stakeholders might be willing to trade-off efficiency to achieve greater vertical equity, etc). 12.The government of the day could then further expand on the principles and descriptions in the annual Revenue Strategy, including how tax policy may change to meet a particular focus the government has for the development or maintenance of the tax system. These proposed changes could be set out in the Tax and Social Policy Work Programme. 13.Although we recommend consulting on their formulation, a preliminary example of how the general principles which we suggested in our Initial Advice could be expressed is set out in the table below: Principle Description Efficiency Tax revenue should be raised at the least possible cost to society, including by minimising impediments to economic growth and avoiding unwanted distortions to the use of resources. Equity (horizontal) People with similar levels of income should pay similar amounts of tax. Equity (vertical) The tax system should be progressive. An income tax is progressive if people with higher levels of income pay a higher proportion of that income in tax. Having a progressive tax system does not mean that every tax should be progressive. Revenue integrity The revenue system should be sustainable over time and minimise opportunities for tax avoidance. Compliance and administrative costs Compliance and administrative costs should be minimised as much as possible. Certainty and predictability People should be able to clearly determine their tax obligations before they are due. Flexibility and adaptability The tax system should keep pace with changes in society, in particular with technological and commercial developments. Selection of principles in the legislation 14.We have not been too specific in the descriptions to provide some flexibility in reporting against these principles and avoid creating a pass/fail assessment of the current tax system. For example, we have not specified a time period over which the revenue system should be sustainable. IR2022/099: Further Advice: Establishing a reporting framework in a Tax Principles Act Page 6 of 10 15.We believe a significant part of the framework’s value will arise from it becoming an enduring, institutional feature of the tax policy landscape. Ensuring the framework remains in place over the long term will allow it to produce a body of literature and measures from which observations and trends can be drawn. This can inform the public debate and support evidence-based policy changes. However, to achieve this, we believe the framework will need to attract and retain support from as many sectors of society as possible, and be set up to encourage debate from that broadly accepted position. 16.Accordingly, we would not recommend the enactment of maxims, preferred outcome or prescriptive statements which deviate significantly from the principles described above. In our view, setting out other statements or maxims about the tax system in the legislation would put both the integrity and longevity of the framework at risk. 17.Value-based prescriptions could deter stakeholders who hold different views from constructively engaging with the framework during consultation and would allow them to more easily dismiss the framework’s findings if they do not agree with them. This could ultimately affect the willingness of future governments to continue commissioning reporting under the framework. This could lead to ongoing amendments to the set of principles and negatively impact the extent to which the reporting can provide information on trends over time. 18.For example, the statement “the pursuit of administrative efficiency should not produce unfairness between taxpayers or income types” might not be best suited to a reporting framework. This is because a statement like this goes beyond requesting information be reported about two important principles (administrative efficiency and fairness), to a statement about which is more important. This is difficult to report against. We expect particular principles can sometimes be in conflict and the trade-off between them is a judgement for each government and may change over time. 19.One option would use non-legislative government documents to indicate the particular view a government takes on the tax principles, and the trade-offs between the different principles. Taking the above example of administrative efficiency and fairness, such a statement might be better suited in the Revenue Strategy, informed by information from the TPA reporting framework that (hypothetically) shows the government and the public the current measures on administrative efficiency and fairness. The Revenue Strategy could indicate if the Government considered the balance is inappropriately set, leading to specific reforms. 20.As another example, a government may decide that the system should quickly adapt to technological change (such as digital services and cryptocurrency) in a way that will significantly increase administration and compliance costs but improve the revenue integrity of the system. This could be signalled in the Revenue Strategy and work programme with further detail outlined in Ministerial speeches and Cabinet papers. The framework would then report on how the tax system has changed in terms of revenue integrity, compliance, administration costs, adaptability etc. IR2022/099: Further Advice: Establishing a reporting framework in a Tax Principles Act Page 7 of 10 Issues with using unfamiliar principles 21.We note the issues that could arise with the use of less familiar principles using three examples, below. Statements about the desired effect of taxation 22.The tax principles would include that the tax system should be progressive (e.g. that people on higher levels of income should pay a higher proportion of that income in tax). However, we do not recommend including in the legislation any principle that sets out how much more tax should be paid, as this would reflect a value judgment about the desired degree of progressivity (rather than progressivity itself). Statements which define a specific taxpayer attribute 23.Another statement of the sort we would not recommend including within the TPA is the following: “Those with wealth of $3M should not pay less tax than middle income earners”. 24.Any reference to a specific level of income or wealth would present a challenge for the framework. Critics would argue the legislation of a specific value is arbitrary, and does not account for liquidity, inflation or the value of a taxpayer’s liabilities. It would also date over time and require regular amendment. Statements which offer conclusions about the effect of taxes 25.We would also not recommend including statements which offer judgments about the effect of taxes on the tax system. An example of such a statement is the following: Lower taxes are less distortionary than higher taxes 26.A statement such as this could be overtaken by new insights in economic research. For example, while it is generally true that lower taxes on a broader range of capital and labour income are less likely to create economic distortions, there is currently considerable debate over whether it is more efficient to tax capital income at a lower rate than labour income. 27.The displacement of a legislated principle by developments in academic research would allow critics of the framework to more readily dismiss the framework as mistaken and the findings as outdated. Entrenching a position on such issues could ultimately put the longevity of the framework at risk. Reporting challenges 28.Reporting conclusive information on principles will be challenging for several reasons. Determining where the actual incidence (or burden) of taxation lies is a difficult, if not impossible task. Although we could offer a view on the amount of tax paid by taxpayers according to their marginal or effective tax rates, any attempt to, for example, measure the progressivity of the tax system as a whole is likely to be partial at best. The number of assumptions and caveats required could make the reporting less useful for public debate. This means our reporting will tend to be informative rather than conclusive. IR2022/099: Further Advice: Establishing a reporting framework in a Tax Principles Act Page 8 of 10 29.For example, the taxation of taxpayers can look very different comparing a single period to if it is assessed over the taxpayer’s lifetime. Example 1: Two taxpayers Consider two taxpayers, Ben and Kelvin, who live and work in an economy with a 10% interest rate and a 20% tax on consumption. Both taxpayers earn and spend across two periods. Ben earns a salary of $50 in the first period, and a salary of $55 in the second period. Ben spends as much as he earns in each period: Ben’s consumption over two periods Income Tax Net consumption Saving Tax as % of income Period 1 $50 $10 $40 $0 20% Period 2 $55 $11 $44 $0 20% Kelvin, by contrast, earns $100 in the first period, and nothing in the second period. He spends $50 in the first period and saves the remaining $50. He earns $5 in interest in the second period and spends this, plus the $50 which he saved from the first period: Kelvin’s consumption over two periods Income Tax Net consumption Saving Tax as % of income Period 1 $100 $10 $40 $50 10% Period 2 $ 5 $11 $44 -$50 220% Although both Ben and Kelvin have the same lifetime consumption possibilities and spend the same amounts in each period, their taxation as a percentage of income can only be described differently. The taxation of Ben will appear proportional as he pays exactly 20% of his income in each period. However, the taxation of Kelvin will look regressive because his tax rate is much higher when his income is low in the second period, than when it was higher in the first period. 1 Support for government policy initiatives Use of Revenue Strategy to provide specific information 30.We expect and appreciate that governments will seek additional information from the reporting framework to support their policy priorities. This aligns well with the aim of contributing to data-led policy development. These need not be set out in the TPA legislation and could be set out in non-legislative government documents. 31.In our view, this could be achieved through the government’s annual Revenue Strategy (which is currently part of the Government’s fiscal strategy) and in setting the Tax and Social Policy work programme. For example, a government which wished to learn more about wealth or income distribution could use the Revenue Strategy to instruct officials to have specific regard to that area of the tax system in their reporting. 32.This would allow governments to obtain (in addition to the regular stream of tax system information associated with the principles themselves) information which is of specific interest to them without compromising the independence or integrity of the reporting framework itself. This would contribute to the body of literature produced by the framework. 1 This example has been calculated on a tax inclusive basis. For example, in Ben’s case $10 of tax has been determined as 20% of his consumption of $50 which includes the tax itself, rather than as 20% of the cost of his consumption excluding tax of $40. IR2022/099: Further Advice: Establishing a reporting framework in a Tax Principles Act Page 9 of 10 33.We would recommend including discussion of this approach in the upcoming discussion document. Government response to reporting 34.Finally, as a further measure, the TPA could allow governments to provide a periodic response to the information in the reporting framework. 2 This approach has precedent and would allow governments to offer their reflections on the report (thereby closing the policy “loop”). This would also allow governments to signal the items which will be incorporated into the next iteration of the Tax and Social Policy Work Programme. Consultation 35.The Treasury has been consulted on this report and agrees with the recommendations. Next steps 36.We expect to complete several key milestones in the policy process this year. These will include providing you with a draft Cabinet paper and discussion document, finalising the Budget bid, and providing you with further reporting to confirm the detailed design decisions. Consultation 37.We understand you intend to make a short speech about the project early this year. This would assist in making the public aware of the intention of the legislation and address some questions that have been raised since the project was included on the Tax and Social Policy Work Programme. 38.We believe that wider consultation with stakeholders through the release of a short discussion document would also be useful. Consultation with a broad audience is likely to result in more informed discussion amongst stakeholders (who continue to express interest in the project) and a better overall product. In particular, feedback would be useful on the descriptions of the tax principles and what principles submitters consider would be widely accepted and enduring. We recommend this occur through the release of a short discussion document in the second quarter of 2022. 39.Provided you agree, the next step would be for officials to prepare a discussion document and accompanying Cabinet paper which seeks Cabinet’s agreement to proceed with consultation on the development of the TPA. Budget and bill bids 40.We have completed a budget bid for the resourcing of the TPA reporting framework. This is being considered as part of the regular budget process. 2 For example, the incumbent government typically responds to the findings of the Retirement Commissioner’s Review of Retirement Income Policies, although we do not envisage the TPA framework will be offering recommendations for reform. IR2022/099: Further Advice: Establishing a reporting framework in a Tax Principles Act Page 10 of 10 41.A revised Bill bid for the TPA was submitted earlier this year. A summary of the proposed timeline is as follows: Milestone Date anticipated by Release of consultation document 30 May 2022 Final policy approval 30 September 2022 Introduction 18 October 2022 Report back from Select Committee 31 July 2023 Enactment 30 September 2023 42.We should note this timeline is tighter than it would first appear. We understand you wish us to deliver the first iteration of the reporting framework before the House rises in 2023. It will be necessary to begin the preparatory work associated with reporting in the second quarter of 2022. 43.A significant part of this work will be reaching out to a range of subject matter experts to understand the possibilities for legislative design, Treaty implications, data acquisition and analysis. Depending on whether the marginal or full benefit product is chosen in the budget process, it will also be necessary to engage with web developers on possibilities for presenting the information interactively, online.

This will require the Cabinet paper to be lodged by 10:00 a.m. Thursday, 16 June 2022. Background 3.Following our advice of 24 September 2021 and 22 March 2022 on options for developing a statutory reporting framework based on tax principles, you directed officials to begin preparing a draft Cabinet paper and consultation document (Discussion Document) for your consideration. 4.Accordingly, please find enclosed a draft Cabinet paper and a draft Discussion Document for Ministerial consultation and lodgement at the Cabinet Economic Development Committee (CAB DEV). This draft Cabinet paper provides a brief summary of the proposal and its objectives. It additionally asks CAB DEV to: 4.1 Note that the Government’s tax policy work programme currently includes an item on the development of a statutory reporting framework informed by tax principles. 4.2 Approve the release of the Discussion Document for consultation; 4.3 Authorise you to make further changes to the discussion document that are of a minor, editorial or technical nature before it is released; and 4.4 Invite you to report back to the Committee with final proposals following the conclusion of consultation. 5.The draft Cabinet paper proposes the release of the Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers within 30 working days of the release of the Discussion Document. Regulatory Impact Analysis 6.The Discussion Document is intended to function as an interim Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA). It has been reviewed as part of Inland Revenue's usual Impact Assessment quality assurance process (and as required by Treasury guidance on discussion documents and the Regulatory Impact Assessment process). 7.The review process has determined that the Discussion Document meets the relevant interim RIA requirements. However, the review panel has recommended some small changes to the discussion document to improve readability. We will review these suggested amendments, along with any feedback from Ministerial consultation, and provide an updated Discussion Document prior to its lodgement IR2022/295: Cabinet paper and Discussion Document – Establishing a reporting framework in a Tax Principles Act Page 2 of 3 with the Cabinet paper. This means the version of the Discussion Document which is lodged with the Cabinet Paper is likely to have minor differences from the version enclosed. However, we will draw any differences to your attention prior to lodgement. 8.Once the Discussion Document is released and consultation process is complete, a full Impact Assessment will be required. This will need to provide a comprehensive analysis of the reporting framework’s impact and is likely to draw on the advice provided in our earlier two reports. Consultation 9.The Treasury and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet were consulted on the content of the Discussion Document. Next steps 10.The next steps are for you to: 10.1 Review the enclosed draft Discussion Document and CAB DEV paper; 10.2 Consult with your Ministerial colleagues; and 10.3 Provided you agree with the content, sign and lodge the Cabinet paper and Discussion Document by 10:00 a.m. Thursday 16 June 2022 for consideration at the CAB DEV meeting on 22 June 2022.

Referred Murray Shadbolt Principal Policy Advisor Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Hon. David Parker Minister of Revenue / /2022 s 9(2)(a) 1 In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Economic Development Committee ESTABLISHING A REPORTING FRAMEWORK IN A TAX PRINCIPLES ACT Proposal 1.This paper seeks the Cabinet Economic Development Committee’s approval in principle to the release of the discussion document A Tax Principles Act: A reporting framework informed by tax principles. Relation to Government Priorities 2.The Government’s current tax and social policy work programme has an item on the development of a statutory reporting framework informed by tax principles (TPA). The discussion document: A Tax Principles Act: a reporting framework informed by tax principles 3.The TPA would establish a reporting framework informed by a set of tax principles. The intention of the framework is to provide a source of regular information about New Zealand’s tax system (rather than about its administration). Specifically, the proposal aims to: 3.1 Improve the public’s understanding of New Zealand’s tax system; 3.2 Inform discussions on tax, fiscal and economic issues among stakeholders, policy makers and the wider public; and 3.3 Contribute to the achievement of wider long-term social, fiscal and economic objectives through data driven reporting. 4.Achieving these objectives will require the TPA framework to become an enduring and permanent part of New Zealand’s tax information landscape. To achieve its goals, the framework will need to have two specific qualities: 4.1 Independence: to achieve stakeholder and cross-party support, the framework will need to be neutral and independent of the government of the day; and 4.2 Flexibility: the framework will need to be capable of responding to new insights and developments in economic and tax literature. To do so, officials will need to be able to revise and adapt their measures as new insights become available. 77a3n3k20l 2023-06-07 10:57:55 2 Proposed Design Features Selected principles 5.As proposed, the reporting framework would be informed by a high-level set of accepted tax principles which capitalise on existing frameworks, drawing from the work of previous tax working groups and the OECD. The principles which I propose be include within the discussion document on the TPA are: No. Principle Description 1. Horizonal Equity People with similar levels of income should pay similar amounts of tax. The time value of money matters when considering horizontal equity. The tax system should generally recognise the economic effect of income, not its name, while acknowledging there are important areas where exemptions to taxing economic income are justified in the pursuit of wider societal outcomes (e.g. not taxing the imputed rent on an owner occupied home). 2. Vertical Equity The tax system should be progressive. Tax is progressive if people with higher levels of economic income pay a higher proportion of that income in tax. A progressive tax system does not mean that every tax should be progressive (e.g. GST is regressive) but the overall system ought to be. In practice, wealthy people should at the very least pay no lower a rate of tax on their economic income as middle income New Zealanders already do. 3. Efficiency Tax revenue should be raised in ways which minimise distortions to the economy and the use of resources. 4. Compliance and administrative costs Compliance and administrative costs for taxpayers and the Government should be reasonable but this is not justification for substantial unfairness in the tax system. 5. Revenue integrity The revenue system should be sustainable over time and minimise opportunities for tax avoidance. 6. Certainty and predictability People should be able to determine their tax obligations before they are due. 7. Flexibility and adaptability The tax system should keep pace with changes in society, in particular technological and commercial developments, and changes in inequality. 6.The information obtained from the framework will help to educate and inform the public about the role and operation of New Zealand’s tax system. 77a3n3k20l 2023-06-07 10:57:55 3 Development of measures and reporting 7.Allowing officials the flexibility to develop and refine the measures in the report over time could help the framework retain its relevance and reflect developments in best practice. This could be more challenging if the measures were closely prescribed within the legislation itself. 8.I propose full reporting take place every three years. A short reporting period (such as annually or once every 18 months) is unlikely to offer as much value to governments, given the resources required, as the findings of one year across a number of indicators are unlikely to vary significantly from the year immediately before or after it. Similarly, reporting once every four or five years could result in significant insights and developments in New Zealand’s tax system going uncaptured or being overlooked. However, there may be some information that could be reported annually as an interim report (as we do currently with the Tax Expenditure Statement). Ability of governments to seek specific information through the R evenue Strategy 9.Additionally, I propose that the TPA include the ability for governments to seek information on specific areas of interest through the Revenue Strategy. This would be in addition to the standard reporting produced under the TPA and would allow governments to obtain information to support their policy and legislative priorities without compromising the integrity or independence of the reporting framework. 10.The information provided by the reporting framework could be used to inform the Government’s Tax Policy Work Programme, which determines Inland Revenue’s priorities for a term of 18 months. 11.This approach has precedent. For example, in 2021, the Revenue Strategy referred to the introduction of the 39% top tax rate as a measure the Government used to increase the progressivity of the tax system. Officials were also resourced and directed to look specifically at the effective tax rate of high wealth individuals and the integrity of the tax system after introduction of the tax rate. Locating the obligation to issue a revenue strategy within the TPA 12.The TPA also provides the opportunity to consider bringing the obligation to issue a Revenue Strategy under an Inland Revenue Act. Currently, the requirement to provide a Revenue Strategy is located within the Public Finance Act 1989, which is administered by the Treasury. Bringing this requirement within the TPA could be a natural fit for a revenue function which could be used to offer additional direction to reporting provided under the TPA. I have asked officials to consider this further as part of the advice to be provided with feedback from the targeted consultation. Consultation 13.Conducting targeted consultation on the TPA would align with the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP) which has been an important part of New Zealand’s tax policy process for almost 30 years. 77a3n3k20l 2023-06-07 10:57:55 4 14.I believe that consultation will help stakeholders understand the proposal and contribute positively to the design of the TPA. I therefore propose to release the Discussion Document shortly after Cabinet approval. Financial Implications 15.There are currently no financial implications associated with releasing this discussion document. 16.The options included in the discussion document will have financial implications if implemented. These will be reported to Cabinet at the time final policy approvals are sought. Legislative Implications 17.There are no legislative implications associated with releasing this discussion document. However, implementing the proposal will require the enactment of new legislation. I note that a Bill bid was provided to the Cabinet Office on 21 January 2022. 18.Subject to consultation, I propose introducing this legislation in either late 2022 or early 2023, with enactment to occur in 2023. Impact analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 19.The Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that A Tax Principles Act: A reporting framework informed by tax principles is exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS). The exemption is based on advice that the discussion document includes the key features of an interim RIS. 20.T he Regulatory Impact Analysis panel at Inland Revenue has reviewed the discussion document and confirmed that it meets these requirements. A full RIS will be completed at a later date to inform Cabinet's final decisions on this proposal once it returns from targeted consultation. Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 21.The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) team has been consulted and confirms that the CIPA requirements do not apply to these proposals as the threshold for significance is not met. Population Implications 22.Releasing the discussion document does not have any population implications. Any population implications resulting from the proposals will be included in final policy advice to Cabinet following targeted consultation. Human Rights 23.The proposals discussed in the consultation document are not inconsistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 or the Human Rights Act 1993. 77a3n3k20l 2023-06-07 10:57:55 5 Consultation 24.Inland Revenue officials consulted with the Treasury and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet in developing the proposals included in this discussion document. Communications 25.The discussion document would be released on Inland Revenue’s tax policy website. Proactive Release 26.I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers within 30 working days of the release of the discussion document. Recommendations 27.The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Committee: 1.Note that the Government’s tax policy work programme currently includes an item on the development of a statutory reporting framework informed by tax principles. 2.Approve the release of the attached discussion document, A Tax Principles Act: A reporting framework informed by tax principles. 3.Authorise the Minister of Revenue to make further changes to the discussion document that are of a minor, editorial or technical nature before it is released. 4.Invite the Minister to report back to the Committee with final proposals following the conclusion of targeted consultation.

In a modern nation, taxes pay for services which make society more prosperous, fairer and peaceful. A good tax system provides revenue for health, education, justice and other important social and civic needs, including the maintenance of the rule of law. In New Zealand we look to the tax system to enhance social cohesion through supporting strong, balanced, sustainable economic growth and promoting fairness through the use of transfer payments. It is important that the way we collect taxes is fair and is seen to be fair. New Zealand’s tax system 1.2 To be constructive, a debate about the tax system and its fairness must be based on facts. For example, as set out in the table below, New Zealand is around the middle of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries in its tax–to–GDP ratio (that is, tax revenue as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product). New Zealand’s tax-to-GDP ratio has remained close to the OECD average, in recent years. 1 Table 1 : Tax as a share of GDP in OECD countries in 2018 2 1 Revenue Statistics 2021 – New Zealand, Tax-to-GDP ratio over time (OECD). 2 “ Property taxes” include local government rates as per OECD definitions. New Zealand’s tax- to-GDP ratio looks artificially high relative to its international peers using the OECD’s standard methodology as, unlike other OECD countries, GST is charged on public services in New Zealand. GST on public services does not generate net revenue but does increase measured GST receipts. The ”New Zealand (adjusted)” entry adjusts for this. 6 1.3 OECD data on New Zealand’s tax structure shows a significant proportion of its tax revenue comes from two sources. The first is tax from personal income, profits and gains. In 2019, receipts from this source amounted to 40% of New Zealand’s tax take, compared with the OECD average of 23% from personal income profits and gains, and 26% from social security contributions. 3 The second is tax revenue from Goods and Services Tax (GST), which comprised 30% of New Zealand’s revenue receipts, compared with the OECD average of 20%. Together, revenue from these two taxes made up 70% of New Zealand’s total tax receipts. Table 2: Tax structure compared to the OECD average, 2019 D ata gaps 1.4 Although this information is useful to understanding the shape of the tax system, the Government is aware that there are areas of the tax system where information is lacking, could be improved or made more widely available to the public. Examples of data gaps include: •Timeframe of analysis: As data is often gathered on an annual basis, it can be difficult to develop an understanding of how taxation affects individuals over a lifetime rather than at a specific point in time. For example, while GST is levied at a flat rate of 15% on the sale of goods and services, the amount of GST paid as a proportion of current income declines as income increases. This means that GST represents a smaller share of the current income of high-income earners. On this measure, GST is regressive. This is in part because higher income individuals have higher savings rates. However, an individual’s saving or dissaving rate will vary over a lifetime, meaning that the individual’s payment of GST on consumption as a proportion of income may also vary. •Economic incidence of taxation: Economists unfortunately know little about where the ultimate cost (or “incidence”) of many taxes lie and it may not be possible to determine this conclusively. What is known is the true cost of taxes may not be borne by those who legally pay them. An example is GST, which is legally paid by businesses, but whose cost is borne by consumers through higher prices. Developing greater insight into the difference between legal and economic incidence could improve the Government’s understanding of the impact of taxes on differen t g roups. 3 Where some countries collect social security contributions as a separate levy, New Zealand fin ances its welfare system from general taxation. 7 1.5 It will be difficult for New Zealanders to understand the current state of the tax system and the direction in which it is travelling when key information about its features is unknown. Even the data that is available may not be well known by the public. Although the operation of the tax system is a specialist subject, the ways in which it impacts and contributes to society means every New Zealander has an interest in ensuring the tax system operates effectively and is well placed to respond to current and future challenges. Accordingly, the Government believes that more should be done to improve the public’s understanding of the tax system and to encourage more informed debate on its key features. 1.6 To address this, the Government is proposing the enactment of a statutory reporting framework informed by a set of tax principles. Enacting a reporting framework with tax principles at its centre will support the analysis and reporting of relevant information which can then be used to educate the public about the tax system and inform the direction of future tax policy. The role of tax principles 1.7 The use of principles in a tax policy context has historical precedent. In the almost 250 years which have passed since the publication of Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations, discussions of tax policy have generally included reference to a set of familiar principles for designing the policy settings of a tax collection system. 1.8 Although the range of issues to consider has increased in recent times, the role of tax principles in formulating and evaluating tax policy has remained. As the 2018 Tax Working Group noted, past tax reviews, both in New Zealand and overseas, have used a relatively consistent set of principles to assist them in evaluating their tax systems. 4 These principles include efficiency, equity and fairness, revenue integrity, compliance and administration costs, and coherence. Tax officials around the world regularly draw upon the same principles when advising governments. Tax principles have much in common with the Government’s expectations for good regulatory practice. 5 1.9 In the New Zealand context, these principles often contribute to, and work with, existing policy frameworks. This includes the Treasury’s Living Standards Framework (LSF) and He Ara Waiora, which allows for the incorporation of insights from Tikanga Māori as part of the Crown-Māori relationship under Te Tiriti o Waitangi/The Treaty of Waitangi. 1.10 The influence of tax principles can extend beyond the immediate tax collection system. Governments have come to use and rely on the tax system to assist social and environmental objectives or to honour commitments under domestic and international treaties. This has meant tax principles have come to play a role in the promotion of wider welfare and wellbeing in the community. In doing so, there is often a trade-off that is required to be made between the different tax principles. At times, a policy may be an exception to the application of tax principles as the policy is intended to meet wider objectives. 1.11 Despite the indispensable role principles play in the creation and development of tax policy, it is likely that they remain unfamiliar to many people. This is also true of the shape and effectiveness of the current tax system, the design of which is not well understood beyond a relatively small group of tax professionals 4 Future of Tax: Interim Report (Cullen et al, 2018) p13. See also Tax Review 2001: Final Report (McLeod et al, 2001) Chapter Two, p19 and Australia’s future tax system: Report to the Treasurer - Part One (Henry et al, December 2009), Chapter Two. 5 Government Expectations for Good Regulatory Practice (treasury.govt.nz) 8 and experts. Placing tax principles at the centre of the reporting framework would help make the public more aware of the tax system’s foundational principles and how they play out in key aspects of the tax system. The reporting framework also would help governments better understand how the tax system affects cohorts of New Zealanders, thereby informing future policy development. Collection, analysis and reporting of relevant information 1.12 As noted above, the Government is also concerned that there is limited data available on several areas of the tax system. This makes having an informed debate and providing advice on these areas of the tax system more difficult. For example, little is publicly known about the compliance costs faced by the self-employed. Other examples of areas in which information is limited include how the tax system affects people’s decisions to enter the labour market, or start a business. 1.13 Limited information impedes the development of a more effective tax system. A reporting framework informed by tax principles could help the public and governments find information which assists them in debating and navigating emerging policy issues. It would also highlight the areas where key information is missing or incomplete. 1.14 A reporting framework for the tax system would join the existing reporting frameworks providing information to the Government and the public. For example, in the interests of increased transparency, New Zealand’s fiscal responsibility and reporting framework is contained within the Public Finance Act (PFA), which requires the Government to set out its annual fiscal objectives and report on them annually and pursue its policy objectives in accordance with principles of responsible fiscal management. Other frameworks which impose reporting requirements include those relating to child poverty and climate change. These frameworks inform the Government and help people to understand the direction New Zealand is taking and to make informed judgements about progress on stated objectives. 1.15 Similar reporting on the tax system would be invaluable given the important role of the tax system in society. Accordingly, the Government aims to develop a statutory reporting framework informed by a set of tax principles. These reports would be produced regularly (for example, once every three years), and would be made available to the public. The reports could be used to educate the public, encourage public debate and inform future Governments’ revenue strategies and tax policy work programmes. 1.16 This consultation document seeks feedback from the public on the design of the proposed reporting framework, including the description of the tax principles and options for reporting findings. As the Government intends the framework to play an enduring role in informing people about the tax system, it believes that consultation on the framework’s design will help in the final design receiving broad support and for it to become a permanent, institutional feature of New Zealand’s information landscape.

Questions for submitters •How well do you think New Zealand’s tax system is understood by the public? •Do you think it is the role of the Government to increase public understanding and engagement with New Zealand’s tax system? •What benefits do you see arising from an increased public understanding of tax policy issues? •Would regular reporting of information on the tax system, based around core tax principles, improve the quality of the debate on tax policy and inform the development of advice or positions on tax policy changes? •What form of reporting would be most useful? 10 CHAPTER 2 Background 2.1 A government’s ability to maintain and adapt the country’s tax system relies on the support of the community. It is important to ensure the public has a good understanding of how the tax system works so that new challenges can be debated and addressed. 2.2 Current pressures on tax systems around the globe are clear. Governments are facing similar challenges in the form of rising inflation and supply chain shortages due to increased geopolitical instability and the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. These build on longer term challenges such as climate change and an aging population. These issues emphasise the need for governments to have a robust and responsive tax system as part of their wider fiscal responsibilities. 2.3 Although the tax systems of many countries have played a crucial role in the domestic response to these issues, there is the need for ongoing work to ensure tax systems remain fit for purpose. 2.4 For example, median age increases in the populations of developed countries are likely to impact on tax revenue from labour income and place increased demands on healthcare. Governments will need to adapt their revenue strategies in response to these issues if they are to maintain existing social service delivery in changing conditions. The objectives - new insights and informed debate 2.5 The Government has identified two challenges to effectively navigating current and future issues such as those noted above. These are: •New Zealand’s tax system is not well understood: Responding to future tax challenges will require informed debate about the tax system, its goals, priorities and impacts. However, despite being important to all New Zealanders, more could be done to improve the public’s understanding of the tax system and current tax issues. This would help facilitate informe d p ublic debate on tax policy issues. •Information deficits: There are areas of the tax system on which there is little information available. Examples include the effect of the tax syste m o n labour force participation and the level of certainty within the tax system and its impact on business decisions. Having more information available about these and other issues could offer valuable insights which contribute to evidence–led policy debate and development. Options 2.6 The problems identified above essentially both arise from a deficit of widely available and understood information about the tax system. However, the Government regards the development of effective tax policy as a priority. In considering its response to the problems identified above, the Government has several options available. These include: •Retaining the status quo: The Government could choose to retain the status quo and take no active steps to address the existing information and engagement deficits. Existing levels of reporting through Annual 11 Reports and Budget documents, as required in more general-purpose public sector and financial reporting frameworks, would remain. However, while taking no additional action would mean resources continue to be applied as they are now, it would not address the social and economic impacts which flow from a lack of information and engagement on key aspects of the tax system. Barriers to meaningful public participation in informed discussions of tax policy and the negative consequences of information deficits when developing tax policy would remain. •Increased reporting on selected issues: Governments could decide t o c ommission additional advice on specific areas of interest as they arise, to address future challenges. While this option would help Governments in developing evidence–led policy, it presents three shortcomings, namely that: –Over the long term, the issues on which advice is commissioned are likely to vary from one Parliamentary term to the next in accordanc e with the commissioning Government’s policy priorities. While commissioning specific policy advice on issues is an entirely appropriate use of existing or additionally funded resources, the variation in topics would not assist in developing the continuity of data which would allow for conclusions to be drawn from the observation of variations and trends over time. –Commissioning specific advice is unlikely to improve the public’s understanding of the tax system. Although official advice is generally publicly released once it is no longer under active consideration, it typically is provided with Ministers as the intended audience and may assume prior subject knowledge. –Priorities may change unexpectedly, especially in response to urgent situations as has been evidenced recently with the response to the impact of COVID-19. Resources focused on collecting and preparing information for the public may be diverted to ensure functions critical to meeting legislative obligations can continue to be met. •Developing a specific reporting framework: The Government could develop a principled reporting framework specifically focused on the operation of the tax system, with reporting requirements set out in legislation. Although this would require sufficient resourcing, it has several advantages over the options noted above: –A dedicated reporting framework would specifically address the data deficit identified above by increasing the amount of publicly available information about the operation of the tax system. Thi s c ould be used for both educating the public about New Zealand’s tax system and encouraging informed debate on its operation. –A reporting framework with regular reporting required by legislation could produce a consistent data series which would allow for the observation of trends. This would help Governments to understand how the tax system is performing over time. –A reporting framework’s findings could also influence the content of a Government’s tax policy work programme and support further research on issues that relate to core tax principles. 12 Consultation on a reporting framework 2.7 The Government believes the case for a statutory reporting framework is sufficiently strong to include it on the current tax work programme and consult with the public on its desirability and features. Developing such a framework will require a range of decisions to be made on its design, including its guiding principles and measures. Question for submitters •Which option above do you consider would best address the current problems with a lack of information and limited public engagement with the operation of the tax system? 13 CHAPTER 3 Principles 3.1 Since Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations was first published in 1776, discussions of tax policy have generally included reference to a familiar set of design principles. 3.2 Although the range of principles has since expanded beyond Smith’s original four maxims, the essential role of tax principles in informing and evaluating tax policy has remained. 3.3 For Smith, the basic maxims of tax policy were equity, certainty, convenience and efficiency. While these remain within the current set of generally accepted tax principles, the extraordinary technological changes which have occurred over the last 250 years have required policy makers to supplement these principles with new tools for designing effective tax policy. This is particularly so with the arrival of the digital economy. 3.4 Tax reviews, both in New Zealand and overseas, have looked beyond Smith’s four maxims to additional considerations such as the overall coherence of the system, revenue integrity, fiscal adequacy and flexibility. Applying tax principles helps governments design their tax systems so that they perform the essential role of raising sufficient revenue to meet their expenditure in the most appropriate way. While the application of the principles and the relative weight attached to different priorities can be debated politically, the principles themselves are well settled. The principles would form the basis for officials to collect and report information on the tax system. 3.5 The principles which the Government proposes be included within the reporting framework are set out in the table, below. The Government believes this combination of familiar tax policy prescriptions reflects the traditional aspects of a tax system as well as addressing current considerations. 3.6 Each proposed principle is accompanied by a brief explanation to help the public understand its meaning and highlight contemporary issues within the scope of each principle. It is hoped that including a description alongside each principle will assist with public engagement with both the framework and its reporting. 3.7 It is intended that these principles are those which people see value in retaining and protecting and would want to see information on them regularly reported. They need to be clear enough to avoid ambiguity without prescribing outcomes or tax policy settings. Table 3: Tax principles No. Principle Description 1. Horizonal Equity People with similar levels of income should pay similar amounts of tax. The time value of money matters when considering horizontal equity. The tax system should generally recognise the economic effect of income, not its name, while acknowledging there are important areas where exemptions to taxing economic income are justified in the pursuit of wider societal outcomes (for example, not taxing the imputed rent on an owner-occupied home). 2. Vertical Equity The tax system should be progressive. Tax is progressive if people with higher levels of economic 14 No. Principle Description income pay a higher proportion of that income in tax. A progressive tax system does not mean that every tax should be progressive (for example, GST is regressive) but the overall system ought to be. In practice, wealthy people should at the very least pay no lower a rate of tax on their economic income as middle-income New Zealanders already do. 3. Efficiency Tax revenue should be raised in ways which minimise distortions to the economy and the use of resources. 4. Compliance and administrative costs Compliance and administrative costs for taxpayers and the Government should be reasonable but this is not justification for substantial unfairness in the tax system. 5. Revenue integrity The revenue system should be sustainable over time and minimise opportunities for tax avoidance. 6. Certainty and predictability People should be able to determine their tax obligations before they are due. 7. Flexibility and adaptability The tax system should keep pace with changes in society, in particular technological and commercial developments, and changes in inequality. 3.8 The Government is aware that people will have strong views on what tax policy should seek to uphold or achieve. Those views will not always be aligned. The Government believes that informed debate on tax policy settings is a sign of a healthy democracy. 3.9 Part of that debate is understanding where it is appropriate and fair to depart from these principles in order to achieve other objectives outside of the tax system (for example, not taxing the imputed rent on an owner-occupied home in recognition of the wider social benefits that come from homeownership). 3.10 The Government also recognises that there will often be a trade-off between the different principles in many tax policy proposals. An example is the natural tension between the principles of certainty and adaptability. While a tax system should provide enough certainty to allow people to plan and make investment decisions, the tax system also needs to be able to adapt to changes in the way people do business. Examples include the growth of the digital economy and emerging technologies such as blockchain and digital currency. A tax system also needs to be capable of responding rapidly to current and emerging integrity risks, including through the use of retrospective legislation. 3.11 Accordingly, any tax policy proposal is unlikely to satisfy all the principles. An objective of the reporting framework is to promote a shared understanding of the principles so that effective debate on tax policy, and the trade-offs involved, can occur. It is intended that the information reported will indicate how the combination of tax policy changes over time are impacting the tax system in relation to the different tax principles, for example, whether compliance costs are increasing or decreasing, and the degree to which those increased or decreased costs are contributing to, say, horizontal equity. 3.12 In considering what tax principles to include as the basis for the reporting framework, consideration was given to whether to include tax principles relevant to the administrative operation of the tax system. Examples of such principles include natural justice in ensuring procedural fairness, maintaining the perceptions of integrity in the consistent and correct operation of the tax system (so that some taxpayers are not favoured over others), preserving confidentiality of taxpayer information, and ensuring open and transparent 15 consultation on any changes to the tax system (as currently set out in the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP)). However, as many of these considerations (as well as principles relating to obligations of taxpayers) are already set out in the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA 1994), there is an argument for them to remain in that Act. 3.13 There are examples of overseas systems where tax principles operate more along the lines of a series of taxpayer rights. These again have features more closely related to the practical administration of the tax system rather than the settings that determine the design of tax policy settings. Inland Revenue already has a Charter setting out how it will administer the tax system, which includes that its actions are consistent with the spirit of the Treaty of Waitangi. 6 The Charter reflects the principles set out in the TAA 1994 and Public Service Act 2020 (PSA 2020). 3.14 There was also consideration given to whether principles outside of the traditional tax settings should be included, such as specific environmental or social welfare principles. However, the focus of this proposal is on the role and operation of the tax system as it relates to raising revenue rather than its possible role in achieving wider government objectives. That said, some of the information reported on the tax system may have wider uses. Role of the Treaty of Waitangi and other policy frameworks 3.15 Modern legislation may sometimes refer to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi. These principles have been developed by the Courts and the Waitangi Tribunal as a means of applying the intention of the parties to the Treaty to contemporary circumstances. Treaty principles identified by the Courts and the Waitangi Tribunal include partnership, mutual benefit and a duty to act in good faith. These appear similar to the principles which govern the administrative operation of the tax system and wider public service. These principles are reflected in the Inland Revenue Charter and PSA 2020. 3.16 A well-functioning tax system that reflects the tax principles in the table above will support the collective wellbeing of New Zealanders. This is captured by the whakataukī (proverb) “nāu te rourou, nāku te rourou, ka ora ai te iwi: with your food basket and my food basket the people with thrive”. The information which the reporting framework gathers could help decision makers seeking to advise on tax policies when using frameworks such as the Treasury’s Living Standards Framework (LSF) (a wellbeing framework developed by the Treasury to consider the broader impacts of policy advice) and He Ara Waiora (a wellbeing framework built on Te Ao Māori knowledge and perspectives of wellbeing). Wellbeing frameworks and tax 3.17 The LSF and He Ara Waiora are two frameworks that can be used to consider the trade-offs between different policy options. Given the significant impact that tax has on the incomes of New Zealanders (as well as the distributional impact it has across different levels of income and wealth, demographic groups, and generations), it is important to consider the impact that tax has on our collective wellbeing as a country. A discussion of the way in which the tax system affects New Zealand’s wellbeing can be found in Box 8 of He Tirohanga Mokopuna 2021 (The Treasury’s combined Statement on the Long-term Fiscal Position and Long-term Insights Briefing). 7 6 https://www.ird.govt.nz/about-us/charter 7 https://www.treasury.govt.nz/system/files/2021-09/ltfs-2 021.pdf 16 3.18 The LSF and He Ara Waiora are two ways in which New Zealand can develop its understanding of how the tax system impacts broader wellbeing. The 2018 Tax Working Group considered both the Living Standards Framework and He Ara Waiora when reviewing the tax system in its final report Future of Tax 8 (in addition to utilising the established principles of tax policy design set out earlier in this chapter). The Tax Working Group considered that these principles complemented the broader wellbeing perspective offered by the LSF and He Ara Waiora, and that those frameworks would help policymakers apply these principles in the future. 3.19 The information obtained by a tax principles based reporting framework could be used to inform policy work which also draws upon the LSF and He Ara Waiora frameworks. For example, when applying the He Ara Waiora framework, information gathered under the tax principles based framework about the distribution of income could inform advice that advances manaakitanga (support, hospitality, generosity) by identifying existing inequities. 3.20 As some of this work is ongoing, the Government is wanting to hear from submitters how the tax principles based framework’s findings could be used to contribute to analysis undertaken under frameworks such as the Treasury’s LSF and He Ara Waiora, and support the Crown’s relations with Māori. Questions for submitters •What do you think of the principles and descriptions provided above? Are they clear and easily understood? Do they reflect your views of core principles that are used to develop tax systems? •How would you describe the principles or word the descriptions in a way that is engaging for the general public? •Are there other principles that should also be included to inform the reporting framework? •Should the framework include a specific reference to the Treaty of Waitangi? If so, how? •How could the reporting framework support the Crown-Māori relationship under the Treaty of Waitangi? •How could the framework contribute to the wider consideration of well-being under such frameworks as He Ara Waiora and the Treasury’s Living Standards Framework? 8 https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2019-03/twg-final-report-voli-feb19-v1.pdf 17 CHAPTER 4 Legislative design Role of principles in legislation 4.1 Reference to principles within legislation has precedent in New Zealand. The use of legislated principles offers advantages in many contexts, particularly in changing and dynamic environments. The use of principles in these settings provides decision makers with the ability to apply their professional judgement in conditions which cannot be readily foreseen or easily described in legislation. 4.2 For example, section 6 of the TAA 1994 requires Ministers and officials to use their best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system. Considerations relevant to the tax system’s integrity include the public’s perception of that integrity, principles relating to preservation of confidentiality, as well as the rights of persons to have their liability determined fairly, impartially and according to the law. 4.3 Section 6A of the TAA 1994 also refers to principles. This section requires the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to “collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law.” This duty is subject to factors such as resource availability, promoting voluntary compliance with the Inland Revenue Acts, and consideration of compliance costs incurred by persons (that is, taxpayers). This principled framework allows the Commissioner to use their discretion to ensure Crown resources are used efficiently in administering the tax system and in practice to bolster the obligations mentioned concerning the integrity of the tax system. 4.4 Another legislative framework which incorporates principles is the Public Finance Act 1989 (PFA 1989). Part 2 of the PFA 1989 requires the Government to pursue its policy objectives in accordance with the principles of “responsible fiscal management.” These principles include “reducing debt to prudent levels,” “managing prudently the fiscal risks facing the Government,” and “ensuring the Crown’s resources are managed effectively and efficiently.” The PFA 1989 framework even allows governments to temporarily depart from the principles of responsible management provided certain conditions are met. This provides governments with the flexibility to respond to current events. 4.5 The Child Poverty Reduction Act 2018 (CPRA 2018) creates a reporting framework for measuring child poverty in New Zealand. While the CPRA 2018’s primary measures include specific metrics for determining “low income”, they also refer to concepts which are not defined within the legislation itself. For example, the definitions of primary measures such as “material hardship” and “persistent poverty” have been delegated to the Government Statistician to determine. This allows those tasked with reporting on child poverty to adapt their measures in response to changing social and economic conditions. This helps to ensure that the CPRA 2018’s measures avoid becoming outdated. 4.6 The role of the legislated principles within the proposed Tax Principles Act (TPA) would be to guide reporting about the tax system. It is not intended that the principles be used in assessing, interpreting, or amending existing revenue legislation, or in directing tax officials in the application of the revenue legislation to individual taxpayers or generally. The sole intention of the TPA legislation is to direct officials in reporting on measures and indicators related to the tax principles. 18 4.7 The Government believes that including principles and associated indicators within the TPA would provide the reporting framework with a base while ensuring that it retains the necessary flexibility to grow and improve its output over time. Developing measures 4.8 The Government believes that information reported should be relevant and accurate. The authors of reports produced under the reporting framework should be able to use the widest possible range of analytical tools and methods to ensure the framework keeps pace with developments in economic literature and research on best practice standards. 4.9 Accordingly, prescribing the use of specific methodologies for reporting on the various principles within the TPA would limit the reporting framework’s methods to those currently known and available. This would undermine the inherent flexibility provided by a principled reporting framework and prevent the framework’s analysis from progressing alongside Inland Revenue’s technical capabilities and insights. 4.10 Moreover, mandating specific methods for inquiring into the principles informing the reporting framework may not provide accurate information. For example, having a progressive tax system to meet the principle of vertical equity means (if progressivity is to be measured relative to income) that people with higher levels of income should pay a higher proportion of that income in tax. 4.11 However, assessing whether this is true of the tax system overall would require knowledge of where the economic burden (or incidence) of every tax levied by Parliament lies. As the issue of tax incidence continues to attract debate among economists, along with methods used to determine it, attempting to directly measure the overall progressivity of New Zealand’s tax system is likely to prove challenging. This is also likely to be true of attempts to report directly on other principles, particularly where the availability of data is currently limited. The reporting on some aspects of the tax system may be more qualitative than quantifiable. Principle indicators 4.12 Therefore, rather than prescribing methods for reporting on each principle, the framework could incorporate, or refer to specific categories of information (or “principle indicators”) which are relevant to each of the principles. These principle indicators could be used to allow governments to draw inferences about the presence of the framework’s principles in New Zealand’s tax system. 4.13 For example, the level of certainty in the tax system could be evaluated with reference to the level of confidence taxpayers have in determining their tax obligations. As this would involve a qualitative analysis, relevant information could include the results of taxpayer surveys or focus groups. 4.14 Other information, such as the number of retrospective legislative amendments made within that year, may also be helpful in evaluating certainty. However, as with many indicators, context will be an important ingredient in attempting to draw conclusions from the indicators. This is because there are times in which retrospective legislation can be used to improve the level of certainty in tax law. This could occur, for example, where an amendment confirms that the intended meaning of tax legislation aligns with its generally understood interpretation by taxpayers. 19 4.15 The use of principle indicators in the legislation would also avoid limiting the Commissioner’s reporting to specific methods of analysis, allowing the Commissioner to use professional judgement in selecting the most appropriate analytical techniques. This would also help future proof the framework by allowing the report’s authors to take advantage of new developments and best practice in economic research and data analysis as they become available. 4.16 Possible principle indicators and examples of the specific information (that is, information which is currently available or data gaps) that could be relevant to each indicator are set out in the table below: Table 4: Possible principle indicators Principle Indicator Examples of relevant information Equity Whether those in similar situations pay similar amounts of tax. The amount of income tax paid by taxpayers in similar positions. The i ncome distribution of individuals. The number of individuals within each band of taxable income, and the effective rate of tax paid at each band. Taxable income as a proportion of economic income. GST paid by individuals as a proportion of their income. Efficiency Neutrality. The extent to which the tax system affects taxpayer decision-making (for example, the supply of labour, savings and investment decisions). Revenue integrity The ease with which taxpayers are able to circumvent tax rules. How often anti-avoidance rules are applied by Inland Revenue. Public trust in the tax system. Taxpayer perceptions of the tax system. Amount (and responsiveness) of remedial revenue legislation. The extent to which budgeted revenues are collected. Net Present Value (NPV) of tax payments delayed. The number of exemptions, allowances or preferential rates which reduce a tax obligation. Certainty and predictability The confidence of taxpayers in determining their liabilities. Taxpayer perceptions of tax certainty. The quantity of retrospective revenue legislation. Compliance and administrative costs The cost to taxpayers in meeting their tax liabilities Amounts spent by taxpayers on seeking professional advice and completing tax returns . The cost to the government of administering the tax system. Amounts spent by the Government in maintaining the infrastructure of the tax system, developing and publishing information, and reviewing compliance. 20 Options for legislating indicators 4.17 If principle indicators are to become a feature of the framework, an important legislative design question will be whether such indicators should be enacted within the legislation itself, or should rather be determined at the beginning of each reporting cycle. 4.18 Both options have advantages. A set of legislated principle indicators would help illuminate the principles themselves, as well as allow the framework to maintain continuity and consistency across reporting cycles (allowing for ready comparisons between years). However, permitting the indicators to be determined with each reporting cycle would ensure the information included keeps pace with best practice in measuring the effects of the tax system. 4.19 A hybrid approach could involve including some indicators within the legislation itself, while allowing the Commissioner the discretion to add to these as the reporting framework develops. 4.20 If the TPA were to permit the Commissioner to determine some or all of the principle indicators for a reporting cycle, a related question is whether the government of the day should be able to have a say over the indicators which are to be included, or whether the selection of indicators should be left to the Commissioner. 4.21 While preventing the government of the day from influencing the framework’s indicators could be seen to preserve its full independence, this would also stop governments from using the framework to inform evidence-based policy making. From a policy perspective, the availability of relevant information is desirable. P reventing governments from having influence over the framework’s indicators could result in the framework going underutilised. 4.22 A possible option could be to allow the government of the day to suggest principle indicators relevant to its policy priorities, while leaving the ultimate decisions on what is reported to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. This would encourage the Commissioner and the Minister of Revenue to discuss the government’s requirements and decide whether the use of the framework is likely to be an appropriate vehicle for the analysis sought after. However, the government would always be able to seek advice on topics of interest directly and separately from the reporting framework (as it does currently). Other design decisions 4.23 Legislation which is administered by Inland Revenue is listed in schedule 1 of the TAA 1994. The Acts currently listed in schedule 1 include, amongst others, the Goods and Services Act 1985, the Income Tax Act 2007 and the KiwiSaver Act 2006. As the TPA will offer information about the tax system and be administered by Inland Revenue, and as doing so may require access to other information collected by Inland Revenue, it would seem natural that the TPA similarly be listed in schedule 1. 4.24 The TPA reporting framework is, above all, intended to provide information and promote debate about the future of the tax system. The Government does not intend that the principles expressed within the TPA would affect the tax rights or obligations of taxpayers, or the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. It is not anticipated that any additional information gathering powers would be required, for instance. However, it may be appropriate to make the strictly informative and analytical character of the TPA explicit in the legislation itself to assure stakeholders that the TPA will not have legal consequences for their positions under other legislation. 21 4.25 Finally, although the TPA will provide information about the tax system, it is intended that the framework will adhere to relevant privacy principles, alongside the general concepts of confidentiality already contained in the TAA 1994. Any data relating to taxpayers would be aggregated and anonymised to avoid identifying individuals when reporting. However, it may be appropriate to make this explicit within the TPA so that taxpayers can be confident their privacy will not be affected by the framework’s reporting. The intention is that Inland Revenue officers would prepare the reports. As revenue officers they are subject to section 18 of the TAA which relates to the confidentiality requirements of sensitive revenue information. Questions for submitters •What principle indicators should the framework use to draw inferences about New Zealand’s tax system? What specific information could be relevant to those indicators? •Should principle indicators be included within the legislation, or determined by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue with each reporting cycle? Or, should the Act contain some specific principle indicators and allow these to be supplemented as new methods and techniques become available? •Should Governments be able to suggest indicators to obtain evidence to support their policy priorities? •Should the TPA include express provisions in relation to its status as a reporting framework, and taxpayer privacy? If so, what additional protections should be enacted? •Should the Commissioner of Inland Revenue consult on the indicators and format of the reporting? 22 CHAPTER 5 Operation of the reporting framework Examples of other reporting frameworks 5.1 Each financial year, the Minister of Finance is required by PFA 1989 to present the Government’s Fiscal Strategy to Parliament. The Fiscal Strategy must contain the Government’s long-term objectives for fiscal policy as well as a range of specific financial information. 5.2 The PFA 1989 requires the fiscal strategy to also include a Revenue Strategy. 9 This sets out the Government’s objectives for the tax system and for tax policy over the coming year. The regularity of the Revenue Strategy could allow it to play a key role in the operation of the TPA reporting framework. 10 5.3 For example, in addition to performing its usual Budget function, the Government’s revenue strategy could be used to offer non-legislative direction on the specific issues to be canvassed under the TPA reporting framework. This approach would mirror the statutory framework for the Retirement Commissioner’s Review of Retirement Income Policies. 5.4 Under the New Zealand Superannuation and Retirement Income Act 2001 (NZSRIA 2001), the Retirement Commissioner is required to review the retirement income policies being implemented by the Government and report to the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs at three yearly intervals. 11 Under the NZSRAI 2001, the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs is required to consult with and then advise the Retirement Commissioner of the issues which the Retirement Commissioner should address, 12 months in advance of their report. 12 That advice must be presented to Parliament. 5.5 The NZSRIA 2001 also requires the Minister Commerce and Consumer Affairs to present a copy of the Retirement Commissioner’s completed report to Parliament. Governments may then provide a response to the Retirement Commissioner’s recommendations. How the TPA reporting framework could operate 5.6 Governments could use the Revenue Strategy to direct officials to include the consideration of specific features of the tax system within their reporting to help inform the policy priorities the Government has set out in the Revenue Strategy. This would be in addition to any indicators set out in the TPA or determined by the Commissioner as relevant for reporting in relation to the tax principles. 5.7 Once the report was complete, a Government could choose whether it wished to provide a response to the report and could use its findings to inform the direction of its tax policy work programmes. For example, if the report indicated a decline in revenue integrity, a Government could add specific items to the work programme it believes would improve revenue integrity in line with its revenue strategy. This approach would represent a “closed policy loop,” in 9 Section 26L(d) Public Finance Act 1989. 10 The requirement to issue a revenue strategy could itself even be incorporated into the TPA. 11 Section 83 New Zealand Superannuation and Retirement Income Act 2001. 12 Section 84 New Zealand Superannuation and Retirement Income Act 2001. 23 which Governments’ policy interests are articulated, relevant information is reported on, and incorporated into their tax policy work programmes. 5.8 Alternatively, the framework could be more self-contained, with its reporting focus proscribed by the TPA through the use of indicators (Chapter 5). For instance, the Commissioner could be required to consult on and select additional indicators for the principles (unless formally directed by the Governor-General under section 6B TAA). This would underline the relative statutory independence of the Commissioner and lend additional objectivity to the process and support public engagement. Another model is that found in the CPRA 2018, under which the Government Statistician has sole power to define relevant concepts (which may incorporate parts of relevant professional standards or practices). 13 How often should the report be produced? 5.9 A further design question is how often the report should be produced. A number of reports are currently produced annually, such as the Budget documents and Annual Reports. The same applies to the Tax Expenditure Statement. The reporting framework could follow this model. However, some indicators may not change year by year, limiting the benefit of annual reporting while imposing a level of cost. Another option could be to report every three years on the indicators. 5.10 A third option would be a combination of the two approaches, such that a “fuller” report could be prepared every three years, with interim reporting provided on an annual basis. This interim report could reflect items more likely to change, such as tax expenditures or income distributions, as well as any specific information requested by a Government through the revenue strategy. Monitoring 5.11 Part of the framework’s design could include a monitoring function, whereby the effectiveness of the framework in educating the public and increasing the quality of information available to policy makers were considered periodically. This could occur on a three yearly basis and coincide with public consultation on appropriate principle indicators. 13 Section 83 New Zealand Superannuation and Retirement Income Act 2001. 24 25 CHAPTER 6 Options for reporting 6.1 While reporting frameworks traditionally present their findings in a written or online document, there is the opportunity to supplement this document with other informative measures such as an in-person seminar, and/or an interactive web platform. These measures are not mutually exclusive and could help the public better engage with the content of the report. Option one: Seminar(s) 6.2 The publication of the report could be followed by a presentation or seminar which articulates the report’s content. This would help the public to understand and engage with the report’s findings. 6.3 This could take placed at a fixed location, or virtually using video streaming technology. A virtual question and answer session would further assist those interested in gaining insight into the report’s findings. Option two: Interactive web platform 6.4 The information obtained through the reporting framework could be presented online. However, as tax policy data tends to attract a specific audience, a key challenge in making the information available would be in presenting it in a way which captures and engages the public’s attention. This objective is unlikely to be achieved by making, for example, a series of data rich spreadsheets available online. This is as the provision of raw data alone, and without context, is likely to be confronting for a general audience and even may give rise to misunderstandings among those unfamiliar with technical analysis. 6.5 One way of engaging the public could be by making the information available online through an interactive web platform. Depending on its design, this could include the use of interactive graphics to present the data in a readily intelligible format. 6.6 Interactive graphics could be used to show a range of information, such as the distribution of income among New Zealanders, tax expenditure by category, or the proportion of tax paid by income decile. These metrics could be extended to allow comparisons between New Zealand and other countries with which we compare ourselves (for example, those within the OECD). Comparisons between years would become possible as the body of information produced by the reporting framework grows over time. Opportunities 6.7 Depending on its design, an interactive platform would allow for the simple presentation of sophisticated data analysis. 6.8 Subject to resourcing, the content offered by the platform could be expanded to present information captured by existing cross-government reporting streams. Although the expansion of the platform would likely require dedicated resourcing, the use of existing information would increase the platform’s value without incurring the cost of additional data collection. 6.9 In the longer term, the platform could expand its content offerings beyond tax policy and offer information about the operation of a range of related services 26 and products across government (for example, Working for Families, KiwiSaver, etc). Challenges 6.10 A challenge arising from the use of a public focused interactive platform would lie in striking an appropriate balance between access and accuracy, or in other words, presenting the information simply enough to be understood by the layperson without oversimplifying its content. As this will in many cases be a matter of judgment, it will be essential to ensure that the relevant expertise is available to inform these decisions. Questions for submitters •How could the reporting produced by the framework be presented effectively? •Would a web platform, in addition to a regular report, engage stakeholders?

It also seeks your views on whether public consultation should occur prior to Cabinet, or instead as part of the Parliamentary process. 2.Enclosed with this report are: 2.1 A draft Cabinet paper which seeks final decisions on the design of the Tax Principles reporting framework; and 2.2 A copy of draft legislation as an example of how the TPA could look, which could be updated and introduced into the House (subject to final decisions and Cabinet approval). 3.The Regulatory Impact Analysis is currently being prepared by Inland Revenue. 4.We understand you wish to present the Cabinet paper to Cabinet Economic Development Committee (CAB DEV) soon. Depending on your feedback and including time for Ministerial consultation, and NZBORA legislative review, the Cabinet paper could be lodged in April 2023. Legislation could be introduced soon after. Background 5.We have been discussing the development of a reporting framework based on core tax principles. Cabinet has previously considered a list of tax principles and potential design options, and officials have had conversations with some stakeholders on possible tax principles to use. Stakeholders are supportive of the proposal in general, with different groups interested in different possible additional principles. Some stakeholders are concerned about the possible compliance costs of providing new data while others are interested in using the new information and data to support local communities. 6.In November 2022, you asked us to prepare draft legislation, a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) and draft Cabinet paper seeking Cabinet’s agreement to key design decisions and introduction of legislation. You also asked for further advice on the operational details of the reporting framework. 7.You have indicated you would like to introduce legislation before the end of the Parliamentary term. A Bill bid was submitted for the 2023 Legislation Programme for the Tax Principles Bill, with a proposed priority of Category 4 (i.e. to be referred to select committee before the 2023 general election). IR2023/070; Draft Cabinet paper – Establishing a reporting framework in a Tax Principles Act Page 2 of 12 Next steps 8.Provided you agree with the proposals, the next steps would be to: 8.1 Consult with your Ministerial colleagues (including on when public consultation should occur); and 8.2 Lodge the enclosed Cabinet paper seeking Cabinet’s approval of design decisions and the introduction of the Tax Principles Bill into the House. Recommendations 1.We recommend that you: Nature of reporting framework 1.1 Indicate whether you wish the tax principles reporting framework to be authorised by: 1.1.1 Non-statutory means (for example, a Cabinet directive); or Yes / No 1.1.2 Primary legislation (i.e. a Tax Principles Act) (Recommended). Yes / No Design decisions 1.2 Confirm you wish to include the principles in Appendix I to this report within the proposed reporting framework. Agreed/Not agreed 1.3 Agree to include within the reporting framework principle indicators to describe the categories of information relevant to the principles that would be reported on. Agreed/Not agreed 1.4 Agree to include a regulation making power within the legislation to allow additional principle indicators to be included (or existing indicators to be updated). Agreed/Not agreed 1.5 Agree the reporting produced by the Act be published by Inland Revenue and tabled in Parliament upon completion. Agreed/Not agreed Reporting frequency 1.6 Indicate which reporting frequency option you prefer (noting that full reporting has a higher administrative cost): 1.6.1 Full reporting annually; Yes / No IR2023/070; Draft Cabinet paper – Establishing a reporting framework in a Tax Principles Act Page 3 of 12 1.6.2 Full reporting every three years, with an abridged version available annually (Recommended); or Yes / No 1.6.3 Full reporting every three years. Yes / No Reporting deadline 1.7 Agree that the report be prepared by the end of the calendar year (annually or every three years) using the information available from the latest available tax year for which enough data exists (which may be from the prior tax year given some taxpayers have up to a year to file tax returns). Agreed/Not agreed 1.8 Agree that if there is a full report every three years, the report should be prepared by the end of the second calendar year of a Parliamentary term (which would be 2025 and every three years afterwards). Agreed/Not agreed Public Finance Act: Revenue Strategy 1.9 Note we considered whether to relocate the requirement to issue a Revenue Strategy from the Public Finance Act 1989 to within the Tax Principles Reporting framework (while retaining the requirement to state the Government’s objectives for total operating revenues within the overall fiscal strategy report within the Public Finance Act 1989). Noted 1.10 Note that Ministers could use the Revenue Strategy to instruct officials to (in addition to baseline reporting content) additionally include specific areas of interest related to the tax system within regular reporting. Note 1.11 Agree to introduce the TPA without reference to the Revenue Strategy and postpone decisions about shifting the Revenue Strategy until further consultation with Treasury has occurred. Agreed/Not agreed 1.12 Note that if the Revenue Strategy was to be part of the TPA it could be prepared and published: 1.12.1 at the same time as the fiscal strategy and Budget documents (as now); or 1.12.2 alongside the Budget Policy Statement (around December each year); or 1.12.3 by the end of June each year (after the Budget) (Recommended).

Referred Murray Shadbolt Principal Policy Advisor Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Inland Revenue Hon David Parker Minister of Revenue / /2022 s 9(2)(a) IR2023/070; Draft Cabinet paper – Establishing a reporting framework in a Tax Principles Act Page 5 of 12 Purpose 9.In November 2022, you asked us to prepare a report, RIA and draft Cabinet paper seeking Cabinet’s agreement to key design decisions. 10.Accordingly, this report seeks your agreement on matters related to the design and operational of the Tax Principles reporting framework. A draft Cabinet paper is attached, which can be updated based on your decisions. We have also included an example of a draft Bill. The Cabinet paper could seek agreement to the policy settings and to the introduction of the Bill at the same meeting. Discussion Nature of framework 11.We understand the key purpose in developing the Tax Principles reporting framework is to improve the public’s understanding of New Zealand’s tax system and promote informed debate on tax policy. This would be achieved by increasing the amount of available information about the operation of the tax system. The focus will be on the features of good tax policy rather than the administration of the tax system by Inland Revenue. The latter is covered in Annual Reports and other related material required under the Public Finance Act 1989. 12.As we understand your preference is for a specific framework, we have discussed options for establishing such a framework with the Legislation Design Authority Committee (LDAC). There are, broadly speaking, two ways in which this could be installed and operated. These are through: Option one: Non-legislative framework (e.g. regular reporting through a Cabinet commissioning) 12.1 Officials could be instructed via a Cabinet directive to provide regular reporting on the operation of New Zealand’s tax system and its key features against a set of tax principles. 12.2 While this would avoid the costs associated with the enactment of primary legislation, it could prove less enduring if successive governments do not wish reporting under the framework to continue. Because the value of the framework is likely to grow as data is gathered and analysed, there is the risk that the operation of a non-legislative framework could be interrupted, thereby preventing it from realising its full value. Option two: Primary legislation 12.3 Alternatively, the framework could be installed in primary legislation. This would require the introduction of a specific Bill which contains the framework’s guiding principles and operational matters. While this is likely to be more enduring and carry greater priority than a non-legislative framework, it would also incur the costs associated with the enactment of primary legislation (including Parliamentary time). 12.4 However, having the Bill undergo the Parliamentary process would align with the framework’s intention of contributing to a debate about the design and direction of New Zealand’s tax system. As New Zealand’s tax system represents essential national infrastructure, debating the framework through the Parliamentary process would seem most appropriate. This would include public submissions through the Select Committee process. 13.LDAC considers that there should be a high bar for new legislation, and non- statutory solutions should be pursued where feasible. There is currently significant IR2023/070; Draft Cabinet paper – Establishing a reporting framework in a Tax Principles Act Page 6 of 12 pressure across government to deliver multiple initiatives and we expect this to continue, particularly as the effect of rising interest rates is felt upon the economy and the effort in responding to weather events. Accordingly, there is the reasonable risk that non-statutory reporting obligations could be de-prioritised. Overall, we recommend the use of primary legislation. 14.We note that a non-legislated reporting framework (e.g. one required by Cabinet) would not undergo consultation via Select Committee. Accordingly, if your preference is for a non-legislated reporting framework, you may wish to consider seeking public input through the release of a discussion document prior to proceeding to Cabinet for final decisions on a non-legislated reporting framework. 15.However, we have presumed, for the purposes of the enclosed draft Cabinet paper, your preference for the use of primary legislation. We have additionally enclosed with this report a copy of draft legislation to offer you an indication of the form such legislation could take. Principles 16.We understand that you wish to integrate the principles and accompanying explanations in Appendix I within the reporting framework. The principles are not intended to take on constitutional status and either influence the interpretation of tax legislation in the courts, or restrict any Parliamentary changes to tax law. 17.Rather, the principles are intended to guide public debate and form the basis on which information will be reported and presented. The tax principles chosen reflect well established principles recognised by tax experts and practitioners. You have included descriptors alongside each principle to support the debate as to what the principles mean in a tax policy context. Principle indicators 18.Due to the challenges associated with assessing each principle directly, we would advise against attempting to prescribe specific methods for assessing each principle within the legislation itself. 19.Instead, we recommend the framework focus on the categories of information (or “principle indicators”) which are relevant to each principle. Under this approach, the legislation would describe the information which is most relevant to each principle, leaving Inland Revenue the ability to select the most appropriate methodologies for collecting and evaluating that information. The indicators would not be restrictive or exhaustive, Inland Revenue could report on other indicators in relation to the tax principles where they are relevant. The indicators would be a guide what should be reported at a minimum, and the types of information to be reported in relation to each tax principle. 20.By not being prescriptive, this approach would help future proof the framework. It would ensure it is able to the take advantage of latest advances in the tax and economic literature and account for the quality or availability of different data sets. For example, an enquiry into the principle of certainty could include analysis of the confidence taxpayers have in determining their tax obligations. This could be accomplished through surveys, focus groups or interviews with taxpayers and their agents. Other relevant information could include the number of remedial or retrospective amendments passed during that year, the availability of technical interpretation guides or number of disputes a year. 21.However, it will be important to place information collected by the framework in its proper context and outline any limitations. For example, continuing with the theme of certainty, the fact that remedials have been passed into law does not automatically mean the tax environment is uncertain, as some remedials can IR2023/070; Draft Cabinet paper – Establishing a reporting framework in a Tax Principles Act Page 7 of 12 perform a clarificatory role (which increases the level of certainty within the tax system). 22.Other possible principle indicators are set out in Appendix II of this report. We recommend that these be capable of revision by regulation, 1 so that they can be updated as necessary. Regular engagement with stakeholders (e.g. every three years) would help to ensure that the indicators within the framework remain relevant and meet social expectations. Incorporating environmental and Treaty of Waitangi considerations 23.Stakeholders generally agree with core principles, noting they are well-established and have been used in several working groups and international research. Some stakeholders have suggested including additional principles related to the environment or to the Treaty of Waitangi as well as Human Rights and wider well- being considerations. These are more general principles that apply across the wider public sector and society, and in some cases are captured and applied in other legislation, such as the Public Service Act 1989, or directly such as the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. 24.Our view of these suggestions is as follows: Environment 24.1 Including environmental factors among the principles is likely to duplicate existing environmental reporting which occurs as part of that produced by Statistics New Zealand and the Ministry for the Environment. 24.2 Imposing or not imposing tax based on meeting environmental outcomes could be reported under efficiency (especially in relation to neutrality of tax) and horizontal equity principles. 24.3 We would therefore not recommend including a specific environmental principle within the framework. Treaty of Waitangi 24.4 It is not uncommon for modern legislation to refer to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi. Treaty principles identified by the Courts and the Waitangi Tribunal include partnership, mutual benefit and a duty to act in good faith. These appear similar to the principles which govern the administrative operation of the tax system and wider public service. These are reflected in the Inland Revenue Charter and Public Service Act 2020. 24.5 As the role of tax in the Māori/Crown relationship is the focus of ongoing work, the implications of including a specific set of principles related to the Treaty within the reporting framework are currently unclear. Therefore, we would advise against incorporating explicit reference to the Treaty of Waitangi within the framework itself. 24.6 The information produced by the reporting framework could contribute to understanding how the tax system affects Māori. For example, as part of its reporting on neutrality, the framework could offer insight into how the tax system treats Māori collective asset ownership (e.g. Māori land), and recipients of Māori Authority distributions in comparison to other forms of ownership and income. 24.7 Information sourced through the framework could also support the He Ara Waiora framework. For example, insights about the distribution of income could inform advice that advances manaakitanga (support, hospitality, 1 This would require the legislation to contain a regulation making power. IR2023/070; Draft Cabinet paper – Establishing a reporting framework in a Tax Principles Act Page 8 of 12 generosity) by identifying existing inequities and opportunities for improvement. Human Rights and wellbeing 24.8 Human Rights are set out within the Human Rights Act 1993 and are considered regularly by the Human Rights Commission. The Treasury is required to report on the state of Wellbeing in New Zealand once every four years. However, it is possible that the information obtained through the tax principles reporting framework could support and compliment these existing initiatives. Reporting Frequency of reporting 25.Another important design question concerns the frequency of reporting. In our view, the cost of producing comprehensive annual reporting is unlikely to outweigh the benefits. We say this on the basis that, generally speaking, the results of one year are unlikely to differ materially from the year immediately before. We think that a longer period (e.g. three years) would be more appropriate and allow for trends in the data to be more easily observed. 26.However, greater flexibility in reporting frequency would be required if the government of the day were to seek additional reporting through a mechanism such as the annual Revenue Strategy. We do provide some information on an annual basis such as the annual Tax Expenditure statement and distribution of taxpayers. 27.We therefore suggest a compromise between reporting annually and once every three years. This would involve a hybrid reporting model which would provide full, comprehensive reporting every three years, and an abbreviated form of reporting annually. 28.The annual version of the report could include the current Tax Expenditure material (which is already required to be annually prepared) along with basic facts about matters such as income tax distributions, progressivity measures, administration costs and the number of remedial and policy changes made throughout the year. 2 29.The framework could then offer a more comprehensive report every three years. Content in this more comprehensive report could include surveys on compliance costs as well as information about the efficiency and fairness of the tax system. This could align with the long-term insights briefing required under the Public Service Act 2020, which has a focus on medium to long-term trends. 30.We also recommend that the report be tabled in Parliament, and that it be published by Inland Revenue on one of its websites. We will continue to consider the best ways to make the information public and engaging, which could include dashboards, online graphs as well as data tables. 31.If there is a full report every three years, we recommend the report should be prepared by the end of the second calendar year of a Parliamentary term (which would be 2025 and every three years afterwards). This would ensure the data produced represents the tax system at the commencement of the current Parliamentary term and would avoid publication in the lead up to an election period. Content and timing of reporting 32.The data in the report is unlikely to be drawn from the most recent tax year. This is largely due to the additional time which tax agents have to file their returns. 2 As these would impact on factors such as flexibility and certainty. IR2023/070; Draft Cabinet paper – Establishing a reporting framework in a Tax Principles Act Page 9 of 12 33.Although most wage and salary information is filed shortly after the end of the tax year, many self-employed and business filers use agents which can take longer to provide Inland Revenue with their data. This in turn affects the point at which this information becomes available for publication. For example, the information which Inland Revenue published in December 2022 reflected the tax year ended 31 March 2021. 34.As higher income filers are disproportionately represented among filers who use tax agents, excluding these filers would skew the reported distribution of income tax paid by individuals by value. Some businesses can also have an alternative balance date for their accounting years that does not align with the standard tax year and this will need to be factored into the reporting. 35.We recommend the report be prepared by the end of the calendar year (i.e. annually or every three years) using the information available from the latest available tax year for which enough data exists (which may be from the prior tax year given some taxpayers have up to a year to file tax returns). Relocating the Revenue Strategy to the Tax Principles Act and other matters 36.The Government’s annual Revenue Strategy is currently part of the Fiscal Strategy report which is required under the Public Finance Act 1989 (PFA) 3 . In previous advice, we have suggested that the Revenue Strategy could also be used as a “brief of instructions” which would allow the Government to seek specific information on areas of the tax system which are of particular interest to the Government. 37.Relocating the requirement to produce a Revenue Strategy within the TPA would consolidate these functions within the same legislation. The PFA could retain references to setting out objectives for total operating revenue focussed more on wider fiscal strategy and make cross reference to the Government’s revenue strategy required under the TPA. 38.However, as the PFA has semi-constitutional status, the Treasury has suggested further time should be taken to consult and work through the implications of this proposal, particularly the ongoing interaction between the PFA and the TPA. 39.Therefore, an alternative is to proceed to introduction for the main reporting framework of the TPA and postpone shifting the Revenue Strategy into the TPA until these issues have received further consideration. We agree with this approach. Reporting deadline 40.If the decision is made in the future to shift the Revenue Strategy into the TPA, it would provide an opportunity to produce the Revenue Strategy separately from the wider Budget documents, allowing the government to give the Revenue Strategy greater prominence and set out the government’s vision for the tax system in regards to the tax principles. Under this approach the Revenue Strategy could be produced and published at the same time as the Budget Policy Statement (as part of setting out the Government’s objectives and budget priorities), alongside the Budget as currently, or after the Budget such as end of June. 41.If released in June, it could incorporate decisions made and announced in Budget. Issuing the Revenue Strategy in December or alongside budget could risk it being overlooked among other documents. 3 Section 26L(1)(d) sets out the requirement to include details of the Government’s revenue strategy in the fiscal strategy report. This must include the Government’s objectives for the tax system and tax policy. Section 26G sets out the principles that apply to responsible fiscal management which includes in section 1(e) “when formulating revenue strategy, having regard to efficiency and fairness, including the predictability and stability of tax rates”. Section 26J requires a fiscal strategy report to state the Government’s long-term objectives for fiscal policy and, in particular, for total operating revenue. The fiscal strategy report must explain how those long- term objectives accord with the principles of responsible fiscal management. IR2023/070; Draft Cabinet paper – Establishing a reporting framework in a Tax Principles Act Page 10 of 12 42.The regularly produced Tax Expenditure statement (currently produced as part of Budget documents) could also be incorporated into the framework’s regular reporting cycle in relation to the efficiency and equity of the tax system. 43.The PFA requires the Government to publish a list of tax changes that have occurred in the last year 4 in the economic and fiscal update. We recommend that this provision remains in the PFA, as the focus is on material changes to tax revenue forecasts. 44.The reporting indicators will also summarise key tax changes that have occurred in the year as part of reporting on the principles of flexibility and adaptability of the tax system but will focus on changes that impact the tax principles rather than changes that impact revenue forecasts. 45.Insights which emerge from the reporting framework could inform the content of the Government’s tax and social policy work programme, thereby closing the tax policy “loop”. We have considered whether publication of the tax and social policy work programme should be included in the TPA as a legislative requirement but do not see what additional benefits would be gained from doing so. As the tax programme could be updated at any time, there are some advantages to having flexibility in when and how much is publicly reported. 46.Given the TPA is intended to play a key role in the tax system, we recommend including it amongst the Acts which Inland Revenue is responsible for administering (for example, the Income Tax Act 2007). This would be achieved by listing the TPA in Schedule 1 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Legislative process 47.We understand you wish to introduce a Bill in the current year. Due to time constraints (and also as the Bill is likely to be only a few pages in length) we have inserted a provision in the enclosed Cabinet paper that would allow the Bill to be Introduced without Cabinet Legislation (LEG) Committee approval. However, the Bill will need to undergo the usual NZBORA vetting process through the Ministry of Justice. 48.The introduction of the Bill could occur following Cabinet’s approval of the paper’s consideration of Cabinet Economic Development Committee. The Bill would, however, be subject to the usual Select Committee consideration following First reading and referral to Select Committee. Consultation 49.The Treasury and DPMC were informed of the contents of this report. As indicated above, Treasury consider additional time should be taken on any changes to the Public Finance Act. Next steps 50.Taking the project forward will require the following next steps: 50.1 Ministerial consultation on the attached Cabinet paper (to be updated as required following your decisions on this report) including whether to seek public consultation on the proposals before submitting to Cabinet. 4 Section 26R. IR2023/070; Draft Cabinet paper – Establishing a reporting framework in a Tax Principles Act Page 11 of 12 Appendix I No. Principle Description 1. Horizonal Equity People with similar levels of income should pay similar amounts of tax. The time value of money matters when considering horizontal equity. The tax system should generally recognise the economic effect of income, not its name, while acknowledging there are important areas where exemptions to taxing economic income are justified in the pursuit of wider societal outcomes (for example, not taxing the imputed rent on an owner-occupied home). 2. Vertical Equity The tax system should be progressive. Tax is progressive if people with higher levels of economic income pay a higher proportion of that income in tax. A progressive tax system does not mean that every tax should be progressive (for example, GST is regressive) but the overall system ought to be. In practice, wealthy people should at the very least pay no lower a rate of tax on their economic income as middle income New Zealanders already do. 3. Efficiency Tax revenue should be raised in ways which minimise distortions to the economy and the use of resources. 4. Compliance and administrative costs Compliance and administrative costs for taxpayers and the Government should be reasonable but this is not justification for substantial unfairness in the tax system. 5. Revenue integrity The revenue system should be sustainable over time and minimise opportunities for tax avoidance. 6. Certainty and predictability People should be able to determine their tax obligations before they are due. 7. Flexibility and adaptability The tax system should keep pace with changes in society, in particular technological and commercial developments, and changes in inequality.

In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Economic Development Committee ESTABLISHING A REPORTING FRAMEWORK IN A TAX PRINCIPLES ACT Proposal 1This paper seeks approval to the design of a tax principles-based reporting framework. Relation to Government Priorities 2The Government’s current tax and social policy work programme has an item on the development of a statutory reporting framework informed by tax principles, the Tax Principles Act (TPA). Intention of a Tax Principles Act 3The TPA would establish a reporting framework informed by a set of tax principles. The intention of the framework is to provide a source of regular information about New Zealand’s tax system (rather than about its administration). Specifically, the proposal would aim to: 3.1 Improve the public’s understanding of New Zealand’s tax system; 3.2 Inform discussions on tax, fiscal and economic issues among stakeholders, policy makers and the wider public; and 3.3 Contribute to the achievement of wider long-term social, fiscal and economic objectives through data driven reporting. 4Achieving these objectives will require the TPA framework to become an enduring and permanent part of New Zealand’s tax information landscape. To achieve its goals, the framework will need to have two specific qualities: 4.1Independence: to achieve stakeholder and cross-party support, the framework will need to be neutral and independent of the government of the day; and 4.2Flexibility: the framework will need to be capable of responding to new insights and developments in economic and tax literature. Inland Revenue officials will need to be able to revise and adapt the measures as new insights or new data become available. 1 77a3n3k20l 2023-06-13 18:16:01 Item 4.1 Proposed Design Features Selected principles 5As proposed, the reporting framework would be informed by a high-level set of accepted tax principles which capitalise on existing tax policy frameworks, drawing from the work of previous tax working groups and the OECD. The legislation would set out the high-level principles and a description of what each principle means. 6There is no intention that the principles would be used to constrain future tax legislation or as an interpretive basis for the court system. Rather, the principles are to guide the future reporting established under this proposed legislation and encourage informed public debate. 7The principles which I propose be included within the TPA are: No. PrincipleDescription 1.Horizonal Equity People with similar levels of income should pay similar amounts of tax. The time value of money matters when considering horizontal equity. The tax system should generally recognise the economic effect of income, not its name, while acknowledging there are important areas where exemptions to taxing economic income are justified in the pursuit of wider societal outcomes (for example, not taxing the imputed rent on an owner occupied home). 2.Vertical Equity The tax system should be progressive. Tax is progressive if people with higher levels of economic income pay a higher proportion of that income in tax. A progressive tax system does not mean that every tax should be progressive (for example, GST is regressive) but the overall system ought to be. In practice, wealthy people should at the very least pay no lower a rate of tax on their economic income as middle-income New Zealanders already do. 3.Efficiency Tax revenue should be raised in ways which minimise distortions to the economy and the use of resources. 4.Compliance and administrative costs Compliance and administrative costs for taxpayers and the Government should be reasonable but this is not justification for substantial unfairness in the tax system. 5.Revenue integrityThe revenue system should be sustainable over time and minimise opportunities for tax avoidance. 6.Certainty and People should be able to determine their tax 2 77a3n3k20l 2023-06-13 18:16:01 predictabilityobligations before they are due. 7.Flexibility and adaptability The tax system should keep pace with changes in society, in particular technological and commercial developments, and changes in inequality. 8The information obtained from the framework would be organised around these principles and will help to educate and inform the public about the role and operation of New Zealand’s tax system. The reporting would be the responsibility of Inland Revenue to prepare. I therefore propose the TPA be included within the Revenue Acts listed in Schedule 1 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 9Alongside the tax principles, I propose that the TPA set out a list of “principle indicators” that Inland Revenue would be required to report on. This list sets out the types of information that must be reported in relation to the tax principles. Inland Revenue may report on additional measures subject to data and resource availability but should at a minimum be reporting on the principle indictors set out in the TPA. PrincipleIndicatorExamples of relevant information EquityWhether those in similar situations pay similar amounts of tax. The amount of income tax paid by taxpayers in similar positions. Income distribution of individuals. The number of individuals within each band of taxable income, and the effective rate of tax paid at each band. Taxable income as a proportion of economic income.

Taxpayer perceptions of tax certainty. The quantity of retrospective revenue legislation. Compliance and administrativ e costs Amounts spent by taxpayers in meeting their tax liabilities (for example, preparation of accounts). The cost to the government in administering the tax system. 10As data and methodologies change over time, I intend that Inland Revenue would consult the public at least once every three years on whether the categories of information being reported are useful to the public. The list of indicators in the legislation may need to be updated following such consultation. In terms of additional measures Inland Revenue may include in the report that are not listed in the legislation, I intend that the public be made aware of the proposed measures in advance through a public notification process to help with increased transparency. Development of measures and frequency of reporting 11Another important design question concerns the frequency of reporting. Some information is readily available and produced annually but for a number of areas relating to the tax principles, the findings of one year are unlikely to differ significantly from the year immediately before or after. The cost of producing comprehensive annual reporting may not outweigh the benefits. 12I therefore propose a compromise between reporting annually and once every three years. This would involve a flexible, hybrid reporting model which would provide full, comprehensive reporting every three years, and a shorter interim form of reporting issued each other year. The reports would be required to be completed by the end of the calendar year using the information available from the latest available tax year for which sufficient data exists. 1 The reports are important to the public debate so I propose the legislation would require the shorter reports to at least be published on 1 As some taxpayers have extensions of time before their information is reported, sufficent data may not exist for some measures, such as distribution of income of taxpayers, until over a year after the end of a tax year. 4 77a3n3k20l 2023-06-13 18:16:01 an Inland Revenue website, and the three yearly comprehensive report be tabled in Parliament. 13The three-yearly reports should be completed by the end of the second year of a parliamentary term.

I have considered whether the requirement for a Revenue Strategy would sit better within the TPA. However, making changes to the Public Finance Act 1989 should be done carefully. I believe further time is required to consider how these two pieces of legislation would work together. I will direct officials to continue working on how the two pieces of legislation would operate together, including where to locate the Revenue Strategy requirement. 15In the meantime, the Revenue Strategy could be used to signal any additional areas we want officials to include in reporting under the TPA. We could also highlight where we have used information from previous reports to update the Revenue Strategy and Tax and Social Policy Work Programme. Next steps 16I propose that Cabinet authorises me to make detailed legislative design decisions. I intend to seek approval for the introduction of the Bill at the LEG Committee of 11 May. Public Consultation 17Some discussions have been held with key stakeholders who have indicated support for the general proposal. Some concerns were raised about the potential compliance 5 77a3n3k20l 2023-06-13 18:16:01 cost of the reporting framework if additional information is required to be generated and supplied by private entities and individuals. I propose that detailed consultation on the proposed legislative design occur through Select Committee as part of the Bill process. Financial Implications 18There are no fiscal implications associated with the reporting framework, as the initial reporting will be funded from existing baselines. Legislative Implications 19Implementing the proposal will require the enactment of new legislation. I note that a Bill bid was provided to the Cabinet Office in October 2022 and updated in April 2023. The Bill is relatively short in length. 20I propose introducing this legislation in May 2023, with referral to Select Committee and enactment to also occur in 2023 before the general election. Impact analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 21 A Regulatory Impact Statement has been completed and is attached in the appendix. 22The Quality Assurance Panel with representatives from Inland Revenue has reviewed the “A reporting framework informed by tax principles” prepared by Inland Revenue and considers the information and analysis partially meets the quality assurance criteria. The argument for a framework as proposed is reasonably convincing. However, public consultation on the proposals has been limited to discussions with relatively few stakeholders, which may have limited the depth of the analysis. Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 23The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) team has been consulted and confirms that the CIPA requirements do not apply to these proposals as the threshold for significance is not met. Population Implications 24There are no direct population implications from the reporting framework. The information collected and reported may improve the level of information available on the impact of the tax system on different population groups. Human Rights 25The proposals are not inconsistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 or the Human Rights Act 1993. Consultation 6 77a3n3k20l 2023-06-13 18:16:01 26Inland Revenue officials consulted with the Treasury and the Ministry of Justice in developing the proposals. The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet was informed. Communications 27I intend to announce the proposals through a press release. Proactive Release 28I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers within 30 working days. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Committee: 1Note that the Government’s tax policy work programme currently includes an item on the development of a statutory reporting framework informed by tax principles. 2Note the purpose of the Tax Principles Act is to improve the: 2.1Amount of information available on the tax system; and 2.2Public debate on the tax system. 3Note the use of the Revenue Strategy and the information gained through the framework will help support and inform the contents of the Tax and Social Policy Work Programme.

Public Finance Act: Revenue Strategy 11Note that officials will continue to consider whether the Revenue Strategy should be included in the Tax Principles legislation in the future and how the Tax Principles legislation would work alongside the Public Finance Act 1989. 12Note that Ministers can use the Revenue Strategy to direct officials to consider (in addition to baseline reporting content) additional governmental areas of interest as part of the framework’s regular reporting and in future signal how the reports have impacted the Revenue Strategy and work programme. Revenue Act 13Agree the Tax Principles Act should be included among the Inland Revenue Acts in Schedule 1 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Additional advice Report timetable 2.In our last report (IR2023/070 refers) you agreed to a hybrid reporting model, whereby a full report would be prepared once every three years, with an abbreviated or shorter form of the report published each other year. You agreed the first full report should be available by the end of the second calendar year of a Parliamentary term (which is expected to be the end of 2025). 3.An outstanding issue is the date for publication of the first shorter form of the report. 4.We had envisaged that the shorter reports would be required by legislation to be published by the end of a calendar year. This would mean the first shorter report would be due by the end of December in the year in which the Bill receives Royal assent. 5.We understand you are seeking to have the Bill enacted before the House rises for the 2023 general election. This would require the first report to be completed this year. 6.Although the shorter form of the report is intended to draw largely from existing data sources and will be comparatively lower cost in its preparation, we think the very first report will require extra time to prepare, go through a quality assurance process and publish. 7.It will also coincide with the initial post-election period, which is traditionally a busy period for the officials preparing the reports. As the reporting framework is to be resourced from existing baselines, there is the risk that issuing the first report this year could require trade-offs between the quality of the first report and meeting other core organisational reporting. 8.We would therefore recommend the first iteration of the report be prepared and published by December 2024. This could be achieved by setting a commencement date for legislation as 1 July 2024. IR2023/136; Tax Principles Bill: additional advice Page 2 of 3 Regulation making power 9.Following further discussions with our drafting colleagues in refining the first draft of the Bill, we have come to the view that the regulation making power earlier recommended for updating the principle indicators may not result in the time and cost savings we had initially anticipated. The principle indicators are the measures that must be reported at a minimum and are set out in the legislation. The Commissioner can report on additional where relevant and data is available. 10.Although the use of regulations typically represents a low-cost method for departments to update existing legislation, Inland Revenue is in the fortunate position of having allocated House time for passing at least one piece of primary legislation each year. This allows Inland Revenue a greater ability to amend primary legislation as part of its regular Annual Rates Bills. Also, on reflection, changes to the principal indicators are not time sensitive and a slower legislative process would still be suitable. 11.While a regulation making mechanism would still be a valid approach for amending the principle indicators within the reporting framework, it comes with additional requirements to test, maintain and review regulation. By contrast, the costs of progressing changes to the principle indicators through primary legislation would be marginal as part of the existing process for the passage of an Annual Rates Bill. 12.On balance, we think the use of primary legislation to amend principle indicators would be more expeditious than the use of regulations, and no longer recommend a regulation making power be included in the Bill. 13.We also recommend, to assist with increasing transparency, the Commissioner be required to publish what measures they will use in the reports in advance of the report being prepared, such as in the Tax Information Bulletin. This would give an opportunity for people to provide feedback on the proposed measures. Regulatory Impact Statement 14.As part of its preparation for the lodgement of the Cabinet paper, Inland Revenue has prepared a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) on the reporting framework. This will be attached to the Cabinet paper and released as part of the documents accompanying the Bill’s introduction. The RIA is still being reviewed by the internal panel and may receive a “partial meets” as the proposal has not been through the usual public consultation process. 15.A copy of the draft RIA is enclosed for your information. Cabinet Committee process 16.If you agree to the recommendation in this report, we have provided an updated draft DEV paper for your consideration. We understand you wish to consider the paper at DEV on 3 May. You would need to sign and lodge the Cabinet paper by 10:00 a.m., Thursday 27 April 2023. 17.We will provide you with a draft LEG paper and copy of the Bill shortly, for consideration at the 11 May 2023 LEG Committee. IR2023/136; Tax Principles Bill: additional advice Page 3 of 3 Recommendations 1.We recommend that you: 1.1 Agree the first shorter iteration of the report be produced by December 2024, with the Act to commence from 1 July 2024; Agree/Not agreed 1.2 Agree not to include a regulation making power within the legislation (to add additional principle indicators), and note these can be updated through the Annual Rates Bill instead, if required; Agreed/Not Agreed 1.3 Agree that the Commissioner publish in advance the measures they will include in the report; Agreed/Not Agreed 1.4 Sign and lodge the Cabinet paper by 10:00 a.m., Thursday 27 April 2023 for consideration at the CAB DEV meeting on 3 May 2023; and Agreed/Not Agreed 1.5 Refer a copy of this report to the Minister of Finance.

The Bill will create a new Revenue Act called the Taxation Principles Reporting Act 2023. Policy 2 In creating a Taxation Principles Reporting Act 2023, the Bill will establish a statutory reporting framework \[DEV-23-MIN-0067 refers\]. The framework will be informed by the following set of tax principles: 2.1 Horizontal equity; 2.2 Vertical equity; 2.3 Efficiency; 2.4 Revenue integrity; 2.5 Compliance and administration costs; 2.6 Certainty and predictability; and 2.7 Flexibility and adaptability. 3 The Commissioner of Inland Revenue will be required to report to the Minister of Revenue on measures of current tax settings relating to the above principles using approved indicators (such as income distribution and tax paid distribution by individuals). 4 A full, comprehensive report will be provided every three years, with a shorter form of reporting issued in other years. The reports will be required to be completed by the end of the calendar year, using the information available from the latest available tax year for which sufficient data exists. 77a3n3k20l 2023-06-13 18:21:53 Item 6.1 2 Impact analysis 5 A regulatory impact assessment was prepared for this policy. This w as submitted at the time that Cabinet Committee approval for the policy was sought. Compliance 6 The Bill complies with: 6.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 6.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 6.3 the disclosure statement requirements (the draft disclosure statement is attached); 6.4 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 2020; 6.5 relevant international standards and obligations; and 6.6 the Legislation Guidelines ( 2021 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. Consultation Relevant Government Departments or Other Public Bodies 7 The Treasury and the Ministry of Justice were consulted on the proposals set out in the Bill. The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet were informed. Relevant Private Sector Organisations and Public Consultation Processes 8 Some discussions have been held with key stakeholders who have indicated support for the general proposal. Some concerns were raised about the potential compliance cost of the reporting framework where additional information required to be generated and supplied by private entities and individuals. I propose that detailed consultation on the proposed design occur through Select Committee as part of the Bill process. Binding on the Crown 9 The Taxation Principles Reporting Act 2023 will be binding on the Crown. 10 The legislation will not create a new agency. 11 The legislation will not amend the existing coverage of the Ombudsman Act 1975, the Official Information Act 1982, or the Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act 1987. Allocation of Decision-Making Powers 12 The draft legislation does not involve the allocation of decision-making powers between the executive, the courts, and tribunals. 77a3n3k20l 2023-06-13 18:21:53 3 Definition of Minister/Department 13 The Bill defines Minister as the Minister of Revenue, or, if there is no Minister of Revenue, the Minister responsible for the Inland Revenue Department. The Commissioner is defined as the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Commencement of Legislation 14 The Taxation Principles Reporting Act 2023 comes into force at Royal assent. Parliamentary Stages 15 The Bill should be introduced on 18 May 2023, referred to the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee and reported back to the House in August 2023. Communications 16 I have signalled the intended introduction of this Bill in a speech on 26 April 2023. I will make a further announcement about the proposals in the Bill when it is introduced. A commentary on the Bill will also be released at this time. Inland Revenue will include details of the new legislation in a Tax Information Bulletin after the Bill is enacted. Proactive Release 17 I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers with appropriate redactions within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. 77a3n3k20l 2023-06-13 18:21:53 4 Recommendations I r ecommend that the Committee: 1 Note that the Bill will create a new Revenue Act (the Taxation Principles Reporting Act 2023); 2 Approve the Taxation Principles Reporting Bill for introduction, subject to the final approval of the government caucus and sufficient support in the House of Representatives; 3 Agree that the Bill be introduced on 18 May 2023; 4 Agree that the government propose that the Bill be: 4.1 Referred to the Finance and Expenditure Committee for consideration; 4.2 Reported back to the House in August 2023; 4.3 Enacted before the end of the current Parliamentary term.

The Bill received 33 written submissions. The initial briefing from officials and the oral hearings of evidence were heard on 15 June. Almost all submitters were supportive of the intent behind the Bill and the reporting of information on the tax system. 3.Most of the recommendations in this report are in response to issues raised by submitters. Subject to your approval, we will include these recommendations in the officials’ report. 4.The major issues raised by submitters related to: •the consultation process and timing of the Bill (with a desire to delay enactment or delay reporting); •whether additional principles should be added to the Bill (including coherence, simplicity and consultation); •that the wording of the descriptors of the principles should be changed (to remove some words and phrases or to use alternative wording the submitters consider to be more appropriate); •the compliance costs imposed on taxpayers if new information is requested by the Commissioner to fulfil the reporting obligation. 5.A number of more minor issues were raised by submitters across almost all of the 15 clauses in the Bill. Most relate to clarifying the intent of the draft legislation. Submissions were also received on topics outside of the wording of the Bill, such as whether Inland Revenue is resourced to carry out the reporting function, or whether an alternative agency should be responsible for reporting. 6.In addition to the specific policy changes outlined in this report, we seek your approval to recommended improvements or clarifications to the drafting of certain clauses in the Bill. This is in response to feedback received from the Parliamentary Counsel Office on drafting style, as well as submissions from the NZ Law Society, the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee, and other submitters. These relate to where the drafting potentially overreaches or has unintended consequences. 7.None of these proposed amendments has a fiscal cost, and they do not give rise to any new material compliance or administration costs, or any significant systems or technology implications. 8.Treasury has been informed about this report.

While the proposals could amend the wording of the descriptors agreed by Cabinet, we do not consider this is a significant change to the reporting framework agreed by Cabinet. Cabinet also agreed to the date of the first report which is also an issue raised in submissions. Next steps 10.Subject to your agreement, recommendations outlined in this report will be drafted for inclusion in the officials’ report. The finalised officials’ report is due to the FEC no later than 23 June 2023. We will report to you with a draft version of the officials’ report for noting as soon as possible. The independent advisor will also be reporting to FEC about this time. 11.FEC will consider the report at its meeting on 28 June. Subject to the FEC’s agreement, these changes would be included in the revision-tracked version of the Bill to be reported back to the House by 27 July 2023.

Agreed/ Not agreed s 9(2)(a) IR2023/195: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation Principles Reporting Bill Page 5 of 10 Background 12.The Taxation Principles Reporting Bill is currently being considered by the Finance and Expenditure Committee (“FEC”). The officials’ report on submissions is due to the FEC no later than 23 June 2023 to enable the Committee to report back to the House by 27 July 2023. 13.Written submissions on the Bill closed on 9 June 2023, after being open for 3 weeks. This is shorter than the usual period for submissions and was noted in most submissions received. The briefing from officials and the hearing of oral evidence were both held on 15 June 2023. 14.There were 33 written submissions received. Most of the submissions were from the tax community (e.g. law and accounting firms). Submissions were also received from non-governmental organisations and interest groups such as Tax Justice Aotearoa, Federated Farmers and NZ Christian Council of Social Services. Submissions were detailed and commented on almost all 15 clauses in the Bill. 15.This report sets out recommended changes that could be included in the officials’ report to the FEC. General themes in submissions 16.The major themes in most of the submissions cover: •The lack of consultation leading up to the introduction of the Bill and the shortened timeframe for consideration at this Select Committee stage; •The wording for the descriptors of the principles, specifically support for neutral descriptions as some submitters considered the descriptions to contain political language and may not be enduring; •Whether additional principles should be added to the Bill (particularly coherence and simplicity); •The compliance cost imposed on taxpayers if new information is requested to enable the Commissioner to report on measures, and whether Inland Revenue has the capability to do the reporting. Some submitters also suggested a separate agency should be responsible for reporting. 17.Other more minor issues were raised by submitters across almost all of the 15 clauses in the Bill. Most relate to clarifying the intent of the legislation. These included the need to clarify: •the link between the duty to report and the approved measures and the tax principles. Currently, the principles located in Schedule 1 are not explicitly tied to the approved principles measurements. This could be accomplished by changes to the wording on the Duty to Report (clause 11); •the definition of Commissioner’s report (to make it clearer what is being reported); •that the exclusion of the ability of the courts to consider the tax principles does not exclude the courts from a judicial review of the Commissioner in carrying out their duty under the Taxation Principles Reporting legislation. Also, that the exclusion from reporting when determining a matter of law does not exclude media or the public from writing articles on the measures; •that the reports will use the best information available up to the tax year for the relevant reports, rather than information for that tax year only (which will allow for lagged data and late filing information to be reported appropriately); IR2023/195: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation Principles Reporting Bill Page 6 of 10 •that the ability of the Commissioner to remove a measure from a future report would also have a 2 month notification period, and would only apply to measures the Commissioner included and not to measures explicitly enacted in the legislation (removing the “Henry VIII” power); 18.Submissions were also received on topics outside of the wording of the Bill such as whether Inland Revenue is resourced to carry out the function, or whether an alternative agency should be responsible for reporting. Consultation process and timing of first reports 19.Most submitters commented on the timing around the Bill and lack of consultation in the lead up to the introduction, with reference to the Generic Tax Policy Process (“GTPP). 20.The GTTP process is an important part of sustainable and workable tax policy and legislation in New Zealand, especially where it relates to technical tax policy that impact on how taxpayers determine their tax liabilities. The GTPP is not always followed, for example in relation to Budget sensitive changes. 21.This Bill does not directly impact on taxpayers and does not change any tax obligations or liabilities, unlike other bills and proposals. 22.Submissions have requested that the Bill be withdrawn and undertake full consultation, or that the date for the first report under the Bill be delayed until 1 July 2024 or 2025. 23.This would provide Inland Revenue with more time to prepare measures to include in the reports and consult with interested parties on what measures to include and the methodology used in preparing data. We would continue to publish some data regardless of the date of the first report. 24.Some submissions noted the commencement date is set for 1 July 2023, which is before the Bill becomes law and would technically be retrospective. While having no practical impact, the commencement date could be changed to remove the retrospective aspect with no impact on the timing of reports. Proposed changes 25.Based on submissions, we recommend the commencement date of the Bill be changed to the day after the date on which it receives the Royal assent so it is not retrospective. We are also seeking your preference for when the first interim report would be due, either December 2023 as current or a latter year as recommended by submissions. We would prefer to report in December 2024. 26.Inland Revenue would continue to publish the distribution of taxable income of individuals by December 2023 and update the list of tax expenditures with Treasury in May 2024. We are in the process of considering the information to include in the Annual Report on the administration of the tax system, to be published this year. Wording of the descriptors and principles 27.Based on submissions, the wording of the descriptors for the tax principles could be changed. 28.There were a range of different suggestions raised by submitters on the wording of the descriptors. This includes that the descriptors be removed completely and the Bill rely on the list of tax principles and the ordinary meaning without further description. Most, however, suggested changes to the wording. We attach in the IR2023/195: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation Principles Reporting Bill Page 7 of 10 appendix a copy of the wording suggested by the Corporate Taxpayer Group (CTG) which reflects most of the submissions’ suggestions. 29.We do prefer the current wording of Efficiency rather than the CTG suggestion. While deadweight costs are a consideration in the efficiency of a tax system, they are very difficult to measure. We wish to retain the focus on minimising distortions (or minimising economic costs), which is currently sought by minimising the impact of tax on decision making by having a neutral approach to how tax is collected from similar activities. 30.Some submitters suggested that fairness should be included, or that the two Equity principles should be combined and labelled as Fairness and Equity. Other submitters did not agree as they considered fairness to be entirely subjective and a value judgement for each individual. On balance, we recommend that the principles remain Horizontal Equity and Vertical Equity. Proposed changes 31.Based on submissions, we recommend you discuss with officials the wording of the descriptors to be included in the officials’ report to FEC. Submissions to be declined 32.Some submitters proposed wording changes to the descriptors that would seek to indicate preferred tax policy choices or changes that are not consistent with the usual understanding of the principles. We recommend these submissions be declined. Additional principles 33.A number of submitters suggested adding additional principles to the bill, these principles are as follows: •Coherence, as a tax principle, is of particular interest when looking at significant reform of the tax system (e.g. removing or adding an exemption or a tax base). We consider if the reform makes in the context of the entire tax system. A coherent tax system contributes to the sustainability and integrity of a tax system by minimising opportunities for arbitrage as well as improving administration and compliance costs. •Simplicity as a tax principle is sound as a guide for tax policy design in that a tax system should aim for simplicity where possible and not be unnecessarily complicated. A simple system will help people to understand better their tax obligations and make it easier to get right and harder to get wrong. This is part of a tax system that provides certainty and predictability. •Consultation or the GTPP have also been suggested as a principle to include. While GTPP and consultation is an important feature of the tax policy design process and helps to design better tax policy and improve understanding of the provisions, we see this as more of an administrative principle than a tax design principle. However, it does assist with ensuring people are better able to understand and meet their tax obligations and is relevant to the principle of certainty and predictability. 34.Rather than adding coherence, simplicity and consultation as separate principles, coherence could be mentioned in the descriptor for Revenue Integrity and simplicity and consultation could be mentioned in the principles of Certainty and Predictability. IR2023/195: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation Principles Reporting Bill Page 8 of 10 Proposed changes 35.We recommend that you discuss with officials the wording of the descriptors and how they can reflect the ideas of coherence, simplicity and consultation, particularly in relation to the tax principles of Revenue Integrity and Certainty and Predictability. Submissions to be declined 36.Some submitters also recommended adding in principles on: •Competitiveness •Honouring the Treaty •Social equity •Environmental impact •Effect on negative externalities •Transparency. 37.One submitter thought the principles and the measures should be linked to the Treasury’s wellbeing framework as well as demonstrating how they would honour the Treaty of Waitangi. In reporting on the tax system, we expect to be mindful of other reporting frameworks and how they compare or are linked. We recommend these submissions be declined. Consultation 38.Treasury have been informed of this report. Next steps 39.We are meeting with you on Tuesday 20 June to discuss the content of this report. 40.The finalised officials’ report is due to the FEC no later than 23 June 2023. We will provide a draft version of the officials’ report for noting as soon as possible. The independent advisor will also be reporting to FEC about this time. IR2023/195: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation Principles Reporting Bill Page 9 of 10 Appendix – Alternative Descriptors 41.The table below sets out the current and CTG suggested descriptors of the tax principles. A number of submitters proposed similar amendments. Principle Description Horizonal Equity Current People with similar levels of income should pay similar amounts of tax. The time value of money matters when considering horizontal equity. The tax system should generally recognise the economic effect of income, not its name, while acknowledging there are important areas where exemptions to taxing economic income are justified in the pursuit of wider societal outcomes (e.g. not taxing the imputed rent or gains on an owner-occupied home). Suggested The extent that taxpayers with similar levels of income should pay similar amounts of tax. Efficiency Current Tax revenue should be raised in ways that minimise distortions to the economy and the use of resources. Suggested The extent that deadweight costs occur from the tax system. Vertical Equity Current The tax system should be progressive. Tax is progressive if people with higher levels of economic income pay a higher proportion of that income in tax. A progressive tax system does not mean that every tax should be progressive (e.g. GST is regressive) but the overall system ought to be. In practice, wealthy people should at the very least pay no lower a rate of tax on their economic income than middle income New Zealanders already do. Suggested The extent that the tax system should be progressive. Tax is progressive if taxpayers with higher levels of income pay a higher proportion of tax. Revenue integrity Current The revenue system should be sustainable over time and minimise opportunities for tax avoidance and tax evasion. Suggested The extent of which the revenue system is sustainable over time and minimises opportunities for tax avoidance and tax evasion. IR2023/195: Summary of submissions and recommended changes for the officials’ report for the Taxation Principles Reporting Bill Page 10 of 10 Compliance and administrative costs Current Compliance and administrative costs for taxpayers and the Government should be reasonable, but this is not justification for substantial unfairness in the tax system. Suggested The extent to which compliance and administrative costs for taxpayers and the Government are reasonable. Certainty and predictability Current People should be able to determine their tax obligations before they are due. Suggested The extent to which taxpayers are able to determine their tax obligations when they undertake economic activity. Flexibility and adaptability Current The tax system should keep pace with changes in society, in particular technological and commercial developments, and changes in inequality. Suggested The extent to which the tax system keeps pace with changes in society, in particular technological and commercial developments, and changes in inequality. \[Note some submitters suggested adding in reference to demographic changes. There were mixed views on the inclusion to the reference to inequality\].

Authorised for lodgement Hon David Parker Minister of Revenue Not in scope 1 In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Cabinet Legislation Committee Tax Principles Bill: Request for Priority in the 2023 Legislation Programme Summary information 1 Key summary information: 1.1 Portfolio of sponsoring Minister: Revenue 1.2 Department responsible: Inland Revenue Departmental Contact: Peter Frawley Policy Lead 1.3 Title of the proposed Bill: Tax Principles Bill 1.4 Proposed ranking of Bill: Priority 4 of 4 1.5 Estimated size and complexity: Small Bill of medium complexity 1.6 Proposed priority: Category 4 (to be referred to a select committee before the 2023 general election). 1.7 Explanation for proposed priority: A category 4 priority is sought due to Ministerial priorities. Policy 2 I propose to develop and establish a new Tax Principles Act (TPA) which would provide a reporting framework informed by a set of tax principles. These principles could include aspects of: 2.1 efficiency (how broad the tax base is, degree of neutrality on decisions) 2.2 fairness (the degree of progressivity of the tax and transfer system) 2.3 revenue integrity (how sustainable the tax system is, whether those expected to contribute are doing so or are avoiding taxes); and 2.4 compliance and administration costs (how easy it is to comply with and administer the tax system). s 9(2)(a) 2 3 The framework could include an ability for governments to offer non-legislative direction on the desired focus of the reporting (e.g. through the issue of a government statement). This would provide more detailed information of the specific topic of interest. 4 Cabinet agreement to consult has been obtained, with legislation expected to be introduced in the second quarter of 2023. Need for legislation 5 Legislation is necessary to provide a statutory background for the tax principles reporting framework to operate within. 6 A category 4 priority (to be referred to a select committee before the 2023 general election) is proposed for this Bill. Compliance 7 The Bill will comply with: 7.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 7.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 7.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 2020 7.4 the relevant international standards and obligations; and 7.5 the Legislation Guidelines (2021 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. Binding on the Crown 8 Cabinet will determine whether the TPA will be binding on the Crown as part of the policy decisions made prior to the introduction of the Bill. Consultation 9 Consultation on the design of the reporting framework will take place with stakeholders in the first quarter of 2023. 10 This is expected to include a wide range of stakeholders in both the private and public sectors. Stakeholders I expect officials to consult with include Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, the Corporate Taxpayers’ Group, the Treasury, Inland Revenue’s Māori Advisory Board, Oxfam, the Tax Justice Network and the Salvation Army’s Social Policy and Parliamentary Unit. I expect consultation to be completed within the second quarter of 2023. 11 Officials have consulted the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee during the development of the Bill. Consultation will additionally be required within caucus. Associated regulations 12 No regulations are required to bring the proposed Bill into operation. 3 Timeline 13 TPA is expected to be introduced and referred to a select committee before the 2023 general election. Step Proposed date Consistency assurance Date on which final policy approvals will be obtained from Cabinet. Quarter 1 2023 Officials provided the Minister with initial advice in mid-2021 on options for developing the reporting framework and prepared a discussion document for consultation. Officials expect to receive Ministerial decisions in late 2022/early 2023. While a Bill bid was submitted for 2022, achieving other Ministerial priorities meant that the introduction of legislation in 2022 was not possible. However, introducing legislation in 2023 appears possible at this stage. Date by which the Bill will be provided to the Ministry of Justice (or the Crown Law Office if applicable) for an assessment of consistency with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Quarter 2 2023 Dates on which the Bill will be before LEG and Cabinet for approval for introduction. Quarter 2 2023 Date requested for introduction of the Bill. Quarter 2 2023 Date of report back from select committee. Post-2023 general election Date of enactment. Post-2023 general election Date of commencement. Post-2023 general election 4 Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Committee: 14 note that the Tax Principles Bill will introduce a statutory reporting framework which provides information about the tax system; 15 note that the Tax Principles Bill ranks 4 out of 4 within the bids from my Revenue portfolio; 16 approve the inclusion of the Tax Principles Bill in the 2023 Legislation Programme, with a Category 4 priority (to be referred to a select committee before the 2023 general election); 17 note that drafting instructions will be provided to Inland Revenue’s Tax Law Drafting Unit by Quarter 1, 2023; 18 note that the Bill should be introduced no later than Quarter 2, 2023.

CONTENTS Overview ...................................................................................................................................................... 4 Suspension of benefits ............................................................................................................................ 5 Issue one: Clarifying the scope of the suspension amendment ...................................... 5 Issue two: Beginning an income charge when child support is received during a benefit suspension or expiry .................................................................................................... 6 OVERVIEW In reviewing the drafting of the proposed amendments following the departmental report, two further issues relating to the suspension of benefits have been identified. These issues are outlined in this addendum to the departmental report. SUSPENSION OF BENEFITS Issue one: Clarifying the scope of the suspension amendment Submission (Matter raised by officials) That the draft Bill is amended to ensure that a client’s ‘information share child support payment’ can be charged as income against benefit or other assistance for any reason if the temporary break in assistance is within the same period their ‘information share child support payment’ is charged as income. Comment Officials previously suggested in the departmental report that an information share child support payment would continue to be charged as income for a client’s benefit or other assistance if it suspends and resumes within the payment’s income charging period (generally four or five weeks). This policy ensures information share child support payments are not unintentionally exempt from being income due to a temporary break in a beneficiary’s assistance where the assistance becomes payable; that is, a client has entitlement again, within the income charging period. Earlier advice outlined that this policy would only apply if a client’s assistance was suspended due to a temporary change in circumstances and the same assistance resumed within the same period an information share child support payment is charged as income. However, there are instances where a client also has a temporary break in their assistance due to another process, such as where the assistance is cancelled, and the same or new assistance is regranted within the same period the client’s information share child support payment is charged as income. This could be because, for example, a client advised they were entering permanent employment, however their employment turned out to be temporary and ended after one week. In these situations, the client’s benefit or other assistance is cancelled on the basis of their full-time employment, rather than suspended. If the employment ended unexpectedly, the same benefit or different assistance may be granted one week later, after the client tells the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) that the employment has ended. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue two: Beginning an income charge when child support is received during a benefit suspension or expiry Submission (Matter raised by officials) That the draft Bill is amended to provide authority for MSD to begin to charge an ‘information share child support payment’ as income when a client’s benefit or other assistance has been suspended or expired and charge this income against any benefit or other assistance that becomes payable within the same income charging period. Comment Inland Revenue will share child support payment information with MSD. MSD will match the child support information against all clients: ▪ who are currently receiving income-tested financial assistance, or ▪ whose assistance is suspended due to a temporary change in circumstances, or ▪ whose assistance has expired, for example, because they have not provided MSD with information required to complete their assessment for assistance. The use of suspended and expired benefit statuses is intended to be in circumstances where a client’s assistance is likely to resume. For example, once the temporary change in circumstances has passed (for example, returned from overseas) or once a client provides information necessary for their assessment of entitlement to be completed. A client with benefits in either of these statuses would not have their income charge apply until this assistance becomes payable within the same charging period. This ensures that these clients can continue to have their child support payments matched and charged as income against their assistance if it becomes payable, despite not being paid a benefit or other assistance at the time MSD is notified of the payment. For clients whose assistance has been cancelled, MSD will not match their child support information because they no longer have an active record with MSD. Issue two is distinct from issue one as it relates to beginning a child support income charge while a client’s assistance is suspended or expired. Issue one relates to resuming a child support income charge after a client has a temporary break in their assistance (for example, when their benefit suspends and resumes). A person could receive a child support payment while their benefit is suspended or expired. If a client’s benefit status is suspended or expired in MSD’s system at the time of the match, MSD will match and begin to charge the information share child support payment as income forward, over a four- or five-week charging period. This child support income will only be applied and used to determine the rate of the client’s financial assistance if their assistance becomes payable within the same income charging period. Being able to charge the child support as income while the client’s benefit status is suspended or expired ensures that MSD can continue to charge the child support against any assistance that becomes payable within the same income charging period. Example Tama receives Jobseeker Support. On Thursday 5 October, Tama temporarily leaves New Zealand and MSD suspends his benefit as it is unclear whether he is eligible to continue to receive the benefit. Tama receives an information share child support payment on Wednesday 11 October, while his benefit is suspended. Inland Revenue shares this information with MSD who subsequently matches this against Tama’s suspended benefit record. Tama returns to New Zealand on Tuesday 17 October and provides MSD with evidence of this. MSD subsequently resumes his Jobseeker Support from this date. In line with the proposed policy, MSD would charge Tama’s child support income charge over four or five weeks from when the information was matched against his suspended benefit record. This means that when Tama’s benefit resumes on 17 October, MSD can continue to charge the remaining child support as income against his benefit as it is withing the same child support income charging period. As currently drafted, the Bill does not provide authority for MSD to begin an information share child support payment income charge in this manner when a client has a suspended or expired record. Recommendation That the submission be accepted.

The Committee is due to report the Bill back to the House by 24 May 2023. This departmental report summarises submissions made on the Bill, alongside responses and further recommendations from officials. Thirteen submissions were received on the Bill from a range of organisations and individuals. There was broad support for the intent of the changes. Some concerns were raised about what the changes would mean for clients. These particularly focused on how Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) are preparing for implementation (such as staff training, communication to clients and stakeholder organisations). Concerns were also raised on treating child support payments as income for benefit purposes, and not passing on child support to recipients of the Unsupported Child’s Benefit (UCB). No policy changes are being recommended as a result of the submissions. However, as a result of additional work, officials have identified the following issues that require legislative changes to address: ▪ resuming an income charge for an ‘information share child support payment’ after a benefit or other assistance has suspended and resumed in the same income-charging period to ensure income once the benefit has resumed can be charged ▪ clarifying a person’s obligation to advise of a change in circumstances for public housing ▪ excluding specific child support payments from being charged as income for a benefit or other assistance, and ▪ clarifying that the deprivation of income provisions continue to apply for UCB beneficiaries. Officials have recommended changes to the Bill for approval by the Committee, to address these issues. These changes are contained in Appendix 2. The Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO) will also implement minor drafting changes and improvements to the Bill, in line with the policy intent. These changes do not need to be approved by the Committee. Appendices 3 and 4 collate responses to inputs to the Committee from the Regulations Review Committee, and questions arising from the Memorandum on Legislative Scrutiny from the Clerk of the Committee. Some material contained in this report was previously supplied to the Committee on 24 April 2023 but has been included for completeness. 6 INTRODUCTION Currently, people who receive a sole parent rate of main benefit are required to apply for child support to be arranged and collected by Inland Revenue. The government retains the child support payments collected by Inland Revenue on behalf of these sole parent beneficiaries to offset the cost of their benefits. Once the cost of their benefit has been offset, any excess amount is paid to the beneficiary. However, other beneficiaries (such as re-partnered beneficiaries) have their child support passed on in full. This creates an inequity and inconsistency in how sole parents are treated in the benefit system. The Bill proposes several policy changes to correct this inequity and inconsistency. The key policies are: ▪ to pass on any child support payments paid through Inland Revenue to beneficiaries receiving a sole parent rate of main benefit ▪ to remove the obligation for clients on a sole parent rate of main benefit to apply to have child support assessed and paid through Inland Revenue, and ▪ to treat the child support passed on as income when determining entitlement to a benefit or other assistance, in line with other child support. The proposals are estimated to have a positive impact on approximately 41,550 sole parent families. On average, these families would gain overall by an average of $47 per week, and a median of $20 per week, after abatement of benefits. 1 This is estimated to reduce child poverty by around 6,000 (+/- 3,000) children on the fixed-line after-housing cost (AHC50) measure 2 , and by around 10,000 (+/- 4,000) children on the moving-line before-housing cost (BHC50) measure 3 in the 2023/24 financial year. This initiative aligns well with the government’s ten-year longer-term child poverty reduction target to reduce material hardship from 13.3 percent of children to six percent. The Bill also proposes to treat formula-assessed child support liabilities as an allowable cost for Temporary Additional Support and Special Benefit. Numerous other amendments to support the key policies outlined above are proposed. One of these supporting policies is to automate the treatment of most types of child support 1 Based on data as at September 2021. 2 AHC50 measures the number of children in households with incomes much lower than a typical 2018 household, after they pay for housing costs, and is measured by the threshold line set at 50 percent of the median income in 2017/2018 (base financial year), after housing costs are removed. 3 BHC50 is a moving-line income measure, with the poverty threshold taken the year the data is gathered (low income before housing costs – moving-line measure). BHC50 measures the number of children in households with much lower incomes than a typical household, and is measured by the threshold line set at 50 percent of the median household income in the year measured. 7 payments as income for financial assistance purposes. This is underpinned by an information- sharing agreement between Inland Revenue and MSD. The Bill is an omnibus Bill which amends the following legislation: ▪ Child Support Act 1991 ▪ Child Support Rules 1992 ▪ Family Court Rules 2002 ▪ Social Security Act 2018 ▪ Social Security Regulations 2018 ▪ Public and Community Housing Management Act 1992, and ▪ Public and Community Housing Management (Prescribed Elements of Calculation Mechanism) Regulations 2018. 8 OVERVIEW OF SUBMISSIONS There were 13 submissions received. Five were from individuals and eight were from organisations. Four oral submissions were heard on 19 April 2023, with a further two oral submissions heard on 26 April 2023. The submissions were generally supportive of the proposals, although a few areas of concern were noted. One submission was not in support of the proposal to pass on child support due to the effect the abatement of benefit and other assistance may have on the receiving carer’s income certainty. Key areas of concerns outlined in the submissions included that: ▪ communications to clients are adequate and accessible, ▪ staff are adequately trained to handle the proposed changes, ▪ no benefit debt arises as a result of implementing the proposed changes, ▪ child support passed on is not treated as income for benefit purposes, and ▪ Unsupported Child’s Benefit is included in the changes proposed. No policy changes are being recommended as a result of the submissions received. 9 SUBMISSIONS SUPPORTING THE BILL Submissions (Association of Blind Citizens of New Zealand Inc, Child Poverty Action Group, Community Law Centres o Aotearoa, FinCap, Gaynor Fiske, Methodist Alliance, Natasha Fordyce, New Zealand Council of Christian Social Services, Racheal Pearce, Salvation Army Te Ope Whakaora, Save the Children) Supports the Bill in principle, recognising that this is intended to lift incomes of parents and carers on sole parent rate of main benefit. (Association of Blind Citizens of New Zealand Inc) Fully supports the intention of the amendment to pass on the full child support to the adult carer. This was recommended by the Welfare Expert Advisory Group. (Child Poverty Action Group) Generally supports the objectives of the Bill. The proposed change will generally mean more consistency and better outcomes for beneficiaries and their children. (Community Law Centres o Aotearoa) Strongly supports the changes to the child support system that will see child support going directly to the parent on a sole parent benefit. Also strongly supports that changes ensure liable parents can have their child support considered for Temporary Additional Support and Special Benefit purposes. Welcomes consideration of debt risks being mitigated. Support waiving the notice period so that child support can be treated as income at the closest time possible to the change as this appears to eliminate chances of overpayment debt occurring. (FinCap) Child support should be paid in full to the custodial parent (receiving carer). (Gaynor Fiske) Requiring the paying parent (liable parent) to pay for the other parent’s benefit is adversely affecting families. (Natasha Fordyce) Supports intention of this Bill to lift children/tamariki and their families/whānau out of poverty. However, concerned that some sole parent families will be worse off as a result of the Bill. (Methodist Alliance) Supports the intent of the Bill but questions the ability for the proposals to be enacted as intended. (New Zealand Council of Christian Social Services) The Bill provides support with the cost of living and supports struggling families. (Racheal Pearce) Strongly supports the intention of the Bill to ensure a fair pass on of child support payments to carers of children who are receiving the sole parent rate for a range of welfare income support payments. For those paying child support, greater opportunity is being offered to access welfare support which is a welcome change. Our financial mentors see the difficulties people 10 on low incomes have with managing obligations to pay child support. Making these allowable expenses will help ease this financial pressure for people who are already struggling. (Salvation Army Te Ope Whakaora) Broadly supports the proposed changes to the way child support payments are collected and then passed on to support sole parent families and lift 6,000 - 10,000 children out of poverty. (Save the Children) Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 11 SUBMISSIONS NOT SUPPORTING THE BILL Submission (Dr Linda Hill and Kath Boswell) We do not support the proposals in the Bill, because they will increase the precariousness of income available to sole parents to care for their children and pay household bills. Comment Child support passed on will be considered on a forward-looking basis. Only the amount of child support received in the hand (the cash amount) will be considered, not the entitlement assessed. If the liable parent does not pay, despite the receiving carer having an entitlement to child support 4 it would not be considered income for the receiving carer. This approach would treat child support as income for the periods it is intended to support the child. Most sole parent beneficiaries will be better off under the proposal. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 4 An interest in child support 12 SUBMISSION THEME: CLIENT IMPACTS Clause 55 and 56 Issue: Debt Submissions (New Zealand Council of Christian Social Services, Salvation Army Te Ope Whakaora) Request provision be made to ensure that when debt inadvertently occurs because of this specific process, a mechanism exists to write it off. Debt generation due to increasing complexity (over which the receiving parent has very little control) needs to be the responsibility of the system rather than the individual. Concern that the modelling cannot determine the impact of child support payment on client benefit debt. (New Zealand Council of Christian Social Services) Appears to be a very real risk of overpayments occurring, which would result in further debt because of irregular flows of child support payments to carers. (Salvation Army Te Ope Whakaora) Comment The forward-looking nature of the income charge attempts to mitigate the creation of benefit debt. Under this system, child support payments are split and charged against financial assistance over the weeks that the payment is intended to support the child (over four or five weeks). 5 This is done before the receiving carer’s financial assistance is paid, reducing the occurrence of overpayments. This method of income charging is proposed for most child support payments, and this will therefore apply to other forms of financial assistance they are receiving as well. When debt arises from an error with the income-charging process, including the automation, the Bill proposes that the debt is non-recoverable and is written off. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 5 Regular child support payments are paid monthly 13 Issue: Loss of financial assistance Submissions (Methodist Alliance, New Zealand Council of Christian Social Services, Save the Children) A mechanism should be included in the Bill to ensure that no sole parent family will receive less income because of these changes. If this is not addressed, the impact on the small number of families/whānau negatively affected by this policy change will mean they are deeper in poverty and suffer material hardship. (Methodist Alliance) There should be a commitment to ensuring every family retains certainty of overall income, irrespective of the makeup of that income. Fifty families should not be worse off because of this proposal. We recommend mitigation of the impacts where changes will result in an overall reduction of payment to the receiving parent. (New Zealand Council of Christian Social Services) We acknowledge the intention that the changes to how child support payments are passed on will lift the incomes of sole parent families. However, the Government should ensure no families should be financially worse off because of these changes. (Save the Children) Comment The Social Security Act 2018 contains a very broad definition of income designed to capture most of the resources available to a person. This helps to ensure that government support is tightly targeted to those with the greatest need. The broad definition of income aligns with the purpose of the Social Security Act 2018 – that people should look to their own resources before seeking financial support under the Social Security Act 2018. Treating child support as income, alongside other forms of income a person or their spouse or partner may have, is consistent and aligns with the purpose of the Social Security Act 2018. This means there is potential for a person’s financial assistance to reduce as their income from child support and/or other sources goes up. The intention is that entitlement to benefits and other assistance is assessed based on the current financial resources available to the receiving carer. For the 50 families that would be worse off, if they were to receive the equivalent amount of money from another income source, it would in nearly all cases be treated the same and result in the same outcome. 6 6 Around 25 of these families are expected to be worse off financially due to the child support payments abating their main benefit completely, therefore losing the Winter Energy Payment (WEP). Of the other 25 families, they are expected to lose due to a combination of reductions in their Temporary Additional Support, Special Benefit, Income-related Rent Subsidy and Childcare Assistance, with most losing less than $10. 14 Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Income security Submissions (Child Poverty Action Group, Dr Linda Hill and Kath Boswell, Salvation Army Te Ope Whakaora) Defining the child support passed on as income will mean that some sole parent beneficiaries and those responsible for the custodial care of children will find their benefit assistance reduced, meaning the full value of child support payments will be diminished. If the child support payments are received erratically, beneficiaries will often find themselves in potentially confusing and complicated payment arrangements that may lead to beneficiaries facing debt repayments because of their variable financial circumstances (Child Poverty Action Group) The proposal to pass on contributing parent payments in full and count them against the carer’s benefit eligibility will mean that the (total) income received by the carer and children will be more insecure and harder to predict. (Dr Linda Hill and Kath Boswell) The proposal has the potential for a lack of surety of consistent payment amounts to receiving parents. (New Zealand Council of Christian Social Services) Child support payments are often irregular and may come as lump sum payments. It is crucial that the new systems improve the way such irregular income is managed and leads to better outcomes for people receiving sole parent support. There is a real risk of overpayments occurring resulting in further debt or of underpayment of much needed income because of irregular flows of child support income to carers. The spreading-forward principle being applied where payments are spread over the next four or five weeks for the purpose of assessing income is a reasonable attempt to reduce the impact of this. (Salvation Army Te Ope Whakaora) Comment Income security concerns are mitigated by the proposal to charge the payment on a forward- looking basis at the point it is paid and spread over the month (charged over four or five weeks). This means that each week the client’s total income must be above the income abatement threshold before it starts to affect their benefit. Large arrears will continue to be a problem where liable parents do not pay their child support liability on time. However, this problem is expected to reduce over time as newly liable parents have been required to pay child support via automatic deductions from their salaries or wages since October 2021. 15 Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Impact on income related rent subsidy Submission (Community Law Centres o Aotearoa) Concerns that those on income related rent subsidies could face a decrease in their subsidy because of the change. Any decrease in such a subsidy could place families under significant financial strain, particularly given the increasing costs most households are facing, and it could also negate the beneficial impacts of these changes. Comment Child support pass-on will be treated as income, and consequently this may impact how much public housing tenants pay in Income Related Rent (IRR). Sole parents with increased incomes from child support pass-on may see an increase in the IRR they pay for their public housing. Despite increases to their IRR, MSD estimates these households will benefit overall from child support pass-on as the overall average increase to their incomes will be greater than the estimated average increase to their IRR. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Benefits of proposal are modest Submission (Save the Children) Every child in Aotearoa New Zealand has the right to a decent standard of living and having an adequate income is directly related to this right. However, we are cautious given the small lifts in income predicted to be a median gain of $20 per week which are likely to be offset by the rising costs of living. 16 Comment The amount passed on reflects how much child support liable parents are assessed to pay under the current formula. This is a function of several factors, including the amount of income earned by each parent and the amount of care they provide to the child. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 17 SUBMISSION THEME: INCOME TREATMENT Issue: Income of child or no impact on benefit Submissions (Association of Blind Citizens of New Zealand Inc, Sam Brynand, Child Poverty Action Group, Community Law Centres o Aotearoa, Dr Linda Hill and Kath Boswell) In our view, neither the current legislation or proposed amendments address the importance of ensuring child support payments benefit the child. Child support payments could be treated as non-taxable income for the child and be paid into an account in their name. While it is stated that following abatement of income-tested financial assistance families will gain overall, in our view this equates to children of higher-earning parents not benefiting in full. The proposed amendments do not appear to distinguish implications that might arise for disabled parents and disabled carers who receive a sole parent rate of main benefit. In the event the Bill diminishes the ability of a disabled parent or disabled caregiver receiving a sole parent rate of main benefit to have their disability costs met, this is an equity issue. That is to say that the costs of disability of the parent or caregiver will fall on the child. In such a situation, the cost of disability will not be reduced for the household. This in turn introduces an unintended consequence of leaving that household at risk of falling below the poverty line. (Association of Blind Citizens of New Zealand Inc) Child support should not be treated as income. The full child support payment should be given to parents and should not be counted as income – it is to help children (Sam Brynand) Defining child support payments as income will potentially affect levels of core benefit payment and supplementary payments such as accommodation supplement, Temporary Additional Support and hardship grants, as well as eligibility for support through Working for Families tax credits. It is not clear from the legislation how income would be applied to eligibility for core first tier benefits and associated support such as accommodation supplement and Temporary Additional Support. Clarity is urgently needed. The effects of effective marginal tax rates on the range of assistance are well documented – child support pass-on makes a comprehensive review of the effects of the interaction of abatements across the income support system increasingly urgent. Until that review is completed and implemented, child support payment should not be treated as income. (Child Poverty Action Group) Child support should be considered as payment made for the care of a child rather than as income for an adult caregiver. The focus should be on who the payment is for rather than who the payment is made to. We would like to see child support passed on to those on sole parent benefits without any consequential reduction in benefit entitlements. (Community Law Centres o Aotearoa) 18 Child support passed on must not affect the eligibility for or reliability of the base income support amount received by the carer and children. Instability of the liable parent’s payments will impact the overall income of the receiving carer and their financial stability. (Dr Linda Hill and Kath Boswell) Comment Child support payments received by other beneficiaries (such as those on a couple rate of benefit and who have children in their care from a previous relationship) are currently treated as income when calculating what support they receive. Therefore, the proposal to treat child support passed on as income for benefits and other assistance is consistent with current practice. This proposal is also consistent with the purpose of the Social Security Act 2018 that people are expected to use the resources available to them before receiving assistance. Not treating these payments as income could also raise equity concerns, as people who receive large sums of child support could still be eligible for a benefit. The Welfare Expert Advisory Group also recommended treating child support payments passed on to receiving carers as income for benefit abatement, in the same way as wages. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Repayment of debt from future child support Clause 37 Submission (Methodist Alliance) We seek clarification regarding the effect of the proposed insertion of the following definition in schedule 2 of the Social Security Act 2018 (see clause 37 of the Bill): child support debt recovery by reduced further payments of child support, for a person who owes an amount of child support as a debt due to the Crown, means any recovery of the amount of the debt due to the Crown (a) under the Child Support Act 1991; and (b) by reduced further payments of child support that the person is entitled to receive (for example, under section 151(3) or 151AA(8) of that Act) Child support payments should be used to support the child’s/tamariki’s material needs, and not be diverted to repay debt to Government that has previously been incurred by a parent. 19 Comment This proposed insertion describes a situation where a receiving carer is repaying previously overpaid child support by using a portion of their future child support received. 7 This is an existing practice but is generally only used upon the receiving carer’s request. Within the context of this Bill, it is proposed that the amount of child support used to repay previously overpaid child support is not treated as income for benefit purposes. This means that only the net amount of child support less any net repayments for previously overpaid child support is treated as income to determine the amount of financial assistance payable. This is a feature of the proposed forward-looking approach and that only the cash amount of child support is charged, rather than on the entitlement basis. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 7 Inland Revenue may re-assess a client’s child support entitlement for a past period and determine the client was entitled to less child support for this period. If this occurs, clients may be liable to repay the overpaid child support entitlement. 20 SUBMISSION THEME: COMMUNICATION TO CLIENTS Submissions (FinCap, New Zealand Council of Christian Social Services, Salvation Army Te Ope Whakaora, Save the Children) There should be clear and transparent sharing of information so that those who are impacted by these changes understand what they mean. Clause 30 of the Bill proposes amendments to section 113 of the Social Security Act 2018 and sets out obligations for communications where circumstances are changing for both a whānau and MSD. In the examples, it notes that MSD are to notify a beneficiary that their child support payments will be treated as income and also of any change in amounts or timing. Plain language and clear communication are crucial here. It is important that any amount to be paid or not is clear. Adding stress for whānau already juggling many unpredictable financial pressures should be avoided. (FinCap) Recommend working closely with the community, providers, advisors, etc across the sector to develop a range of resources to support communication and understanding. (New Zealand Council of Christian Social Services) Communication with people receiving income support is crucial. The automation of income requires proactive and effective communication to carers whose incomes is affected. Not clear what the requirement will be for timely notification to MSD clients. Waiving the 10-day adverse action notice period means that clients may not find out about changes to their income support payments until the money has been paid into their account. MSD and Inland Revenue should engage promptly with financial mentors and welfare advocates as well as people in receipt of sole parent benefits, to ensure the roll out of the changes is prepared well. (Salvation Army Te Ope Whakaora) Ensure clear and easy to understand information is proactively shared with whānau that will be impacted by this change. (Save the Children) Comment A summary of the activities each agency is planning in order to communicate the changes to clients and external stakeholders is set out below. Inland Revenue Inland Revenue will provide internal communication and training to staff, and external communication to clients, outlining the changes to the Child Support Act 1991. That is: ▪ that child support payments will be passed on to sole parent beneficiaries 21 ▪ these beneficiaries are no longer required to apply for a formula assessment of child support ▪ these child support changes do not apply to Unsupported Child’s Benefit beneficiaries, and ▪ Inland Revenue will send their first mailout in mid-June to confirm clients’ bank account details, and a second mailout in mid-August on the same topic. Questions in relation to how child support will be treated for benefit purposes will be directed to MSD. Inland Revenue’s communications channels are direct marketing (letters - via post and myIR), and targeted social media. The social media will be static material (that is, not videos) and will provide the key messages and direct customers to other information – for example, Inland Revenue’s website. Customers will also be able to ask questions through social media channels, which our social media team will respond to. MSD Communicating to clients Clients will get a number of direct letters over the next few months: ▪ MSD will send the first general letter covering the child support pass-on changes for all clients potentially affected by the change, at the end of May. ▪ In July 2023 MSD will send a letter to all clients receiving Temporary Additional Support or Special Benefit letting them know that child support can be included as an allowable cost for Temporary Additional Support/Special Benefit. MSD will also send a letter to clients who pay child support but do not currently receive Temporary Additional Support/Special Benefit. ▪ From 22 August 2023, MSD will send a letter to clients when MSD receives child support information from Inland Revenue. This letter advises clients the amount of child support and any changes to their payments. High level information is currently on both Inland Revenue and MSD websites. These will be updated regularly as information is sent to clients. ▪ MSD will publish social media posts to support and promote the information on our websites. ▪ MSD will create short-form video content with MSD staff explaining the changes in plain English. ▪ MSD will provide translated material for clients, including Easy Read and large print formats and material for speakers of other languages. 22 Communicating to external stakeholders Between May and June 2023, MSD will use a variety of methods to share and socialise child support pass-on across a wide range of external stakeholders. The stakeholders have been grouped into those who deal directly with our clients, those who have a general interest in the changes, and government agencies. For all stakeholders, an information pack will be sent out in mid-May 2023, including a presentation, one-page summary of key information, and links to further details and support. Client-facing stakeholders will be invited to attend a webinar in late May 2023 where MSD will share key messages and take questions. Stakeholders who deal directly with our clients ▪ Disabled People’s Organisations Coalition ▪ NZ Council of Christian Social Services ▪ Māori Women’s Welfare League ▪ FinCap ▪ Fairer Futures ▪ Community Law ▪ National Beneficiary Advocacy Consultative Group ▪ Birthright ▪ Salvation Army ▪ Barnados ▪ Citizens Advice Bureau ▪ Advocate Community Connectors ▪ Auckland Action Against Poverty ▪ E Tū Whānau ▪ Muaūpoko Trust Other stakeholders who have a general interest ▪ Community Housing Aotearoa ▪ Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ▪ NZ Law Society ▪ Privacy Foundation of NZ ▪ National Council of Women ▪ NZ Disability Trust ▪ Child Poverty Action Group ▪ Action Station ▪ Institute of Community Psychology Aotearoa ▪ Save the Children Government Agencies ▪ Kāinga Ora (KO) ▪ Whaikaha ▪ Oranga Tamariki ▪ Ministry of Education ▪ Department of Corrections ▪ Ministry for Women ▪ Te Puni Kōkiri (Ministry of Māori Development) ▪ Ministry for Pacific Peoples ▪ Ministry of Youth Development ▪ Ministry for Ethnic Communities ▪ Ministry for Housing and Urban Development (HUD) ▪ Te Arawhiti - the Office for Māori/Crown Relations 23 Communicating to MSD staff MSD is communicating with our staff in several ways. To ‘warm up’ trainers and Service Centre Managers, MSD is including information on child support pass-on in a series of our regular fortnightly change calls. In these sessions MSD explain what’s changing and take questions. MSD will hold briefings in May for all senior frontline and housing managers across MSD. MSD will publish regular updates and reminders in the staff newsletters ‘In the Loop’, ‘On the Radar’ and ‘Mahi and Manaaki’. These channels cover all staff including managers. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 24 SUBMISSION THEME: BILL SHOULD BE IN PLAIN ENGLISH Submission (Dr Linda Hill and Kath Boswell) The legislation should be in plain English. Even if the legislation and income support systems are complex, we recommend the legislation is written in the everyday language of the people it affects. Comment The Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO) applies a plain language standard to their work, including legislative drafting. Legislative drafting includes this Bill, and the plain English statement and supporting resources can be found on the PCO website. The Bill has accordingly been drafted applying the PCO’s plain language standard. The following factors are relevant: ▪ The Bill’s subject-matter is very complex. ▪ The Bill amends many different provisions of multiple items of legislation. ▪ The Bill must fit within the precise structure and terminology of the legislation amended. ▪ In amending legislation, like this Bill, amendments are not set out in their relevant context (as occurs when they are consolidated into the legislation amended). ▪ The Bill has been reviewed by IRD, MSD, PCO editors, and PCO drafters to help to make the Bill accessible. ▪ Those reviews included the application of the plain language standard. ▪ PCO is open to making identified demonstrable plain language drafting improvements that are consistent with the Bill’s policy and technical parameters. ▪ The Bill will also be accompanied by appropriate general and specific communications to people affected. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 25 SUBMISSION THEME: IMPLEMENTATION Issue: Training Submissions (New Zealand Council of Christian Social Services, Salvation Army Te Ope Whakaora, Save the Children) Strongly advocate for robust internal practices to ensure a deep understanding of the changes – otherwise there is potential for confusion. A confident, aligned and well-informed Inland Revenue and MSD workforce will be crucial to mitigate unnecessary anxiety in this group of parents. (New Zealand Council of Christian Social Services) The Bill adds complexity to an already confusing welfare system. People needing support struggle to understand the complex requirements for information on their income and personal circumstances under current welfare legislation. We are concerned about the short period to prepare systems and train staff as well as in support agencies like ours. (Salvation Army Te Ope Whakaora) Important that front line staff dealing with these changes are well trained and resourced to provide support to families that may need it as these changes take place. (Save the Children) Comment Training for MSD staff has been split into four tranches, running from mid-May 2023 until mid-August 2023 (before the first information share). Learning is a mix of online and face to face, with each tranche including a recap of the changes: ▪ Tranche one – Overview of child support pass-on changes, ▪ Tranche two – Removal of obligation to apply for child support, child support as an allowable cost for Temporary Additional Support and Special Benefit, declaring child support as income, impacts on Housing and Students, and changes to Childcare Assistance, ▪ Tranche three – Getting ready for the first information share, ▪ Tranche four – More detailed information on the child support information share, matching and automated charging income. Training for Inland Revenue staff runs from 1 June to 30 June 2023. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 26 Issue: Grace period Submissions (Salvation Army Te Ope Whakaora, Save the Children) During the implementation of the proposals, we recommend a grace period where debt arising from the changes to rules is not actively pursued. (Salvation Army Te Ope Whakaora) We recommend a grace period when families will not incur debt to MSD and/or Inland Revenue if mistakes are made in determining the new payment levels. (Save the Children) Comment The approach taken to the automated charging of child support payments supports a high level of accuracy and consistency of charging for both staff and clients. In the unlikely event that an error occurs, the Bill proposes that benefit debt arising from the treatment of child support payments as income, including the automation of this process, is not recoverable and is to be written off. It is therefore not anticipated that a grace period for debts arising from the proposed changes is necessary. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 27 SUBMISSION THEME: EVALUATION Submission (Save the Children) We recommend a review period is established to ensure the system is reviewed after a determined period, possibly one year after the changes officially start. This would enable officials to determine whether the system is working as intended and whether that sole parent families are financially better off due to the changes. Comment The Budget funding includes $0.45 million in the two years following implementation for evaluation of the proposals in the Bill. The evaluation will be undertaken by MSD and use a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods to examine the impact of the changes, including how clients and staff are experiencing the changes. Child support pass-on is a major financial initiative that has significant impacts for sole parent beneficiaries and their children. MSD has current evaluation and reporting underway to assess the impacts of the welfare overhaul work programme, including the Families Package and subsequent changes. This includes annual reporting tracking trends in relevant payments, as well as additional research on the quantitative impacts of these payments, and qualitative and quantitative studies to gain insights into client experience. Inland Revenue will also undertake a process evaluation to measure the effectiveness of the initiative. This is considered appropriate for identifying any problems that may arise during implementation. It will also monitor key metrics relating to this initiative, including changes to the number of child support applications, the amount of child support received, and the amount of child support arrears (excluding penalties). In addition, MSD has secured further funding to include: ▪ additional monitoring, and impact evaluation if feasible, of private agreements, formula assessments, the proportion of liable parents making payments, and levels and frequency of payments, and ▪ an in-depth qualitative study of people’s experiences of the changes, with a focus on sole parent beneficiaries’ experiences of having to budget with fluctuating incomes (for example, where their liable parent is unreliable at making regular payments), clients’ experience of child support payments automatically being charged forward over four or five-weeks, and sole parents’, liable parents’ and their children’s wellbeing,perceptions of the quality of their relationships, and changes they see in the short-term. Child support pass-on is being implemented in two phases. This Bill implements the first phase, that is, child support is passed on and most child support would be treated as income. The second phase would implement rules for how child support payments are treated as income in rarer cases and may come into effect in mid-2025 at the earliest. Any 28 issues identified with the implementation of the proposals can be addressed in the second phase. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 29 SUBMISSION THEME: CHANGES SHOULD APPLY TO UCB BENEFICIARIES Submissions (Child Poverty Action Group, Community Law Centres o Aotearoa, Methodist Alliance, Salvation Army Te Ope Whakaora) The effects of counting child support pass on payments as income are also highly significant for those in receipt of an Unsupported Child’s Benefit (UCB). Effectively, for example, this means that a grandparent providing custodial care for grandchildren could find that the level of the UCB would be reduced because of the passing on of child support. As with those receiving benefit assistance, the positive effects of additional income are reduced. (Child Poverty Action Group) We are disappointed that carers receiving the UCB are excluded from these changes on the basis that further work is being done by Oranga Tamariki. Our preference is for UCB beneficiaries to be included in these changes. (Community Law Centres o Aotearoa) We are disappointed that the Bill does not apply to UCB beneficiaries as recommended by the Welfare Expert Advisory Group and recommend that the legislation is changed to include them. The families/whānau who are receiving the UCB are some of Aotearoa’s most vulnerable whānau and together with their children/tamariki are living in poverty. (Methodist Alliance) Excluding the UCB beneficiaries from these changes is disappointing and continues existing unfairness for children in those households. It leaves a disadvantaged group of children and their carers without much-needed additional support. (Salvation Army Te Ope Whakaora) Comment Child support pass-on for caregivers receiving the UCB is being considered as part of the long-term work to reform the system of financial assistance and support for caregivers. These reforms also involve the Foster Care Allowance, which Inland Revenue does not retain child support for (as child support is retained by the Government to offset the cost of financial assistance). The reforms intend to transform the caregiver financial assistance system so that it: ▪ supports tamariki to thrive under the protection of their family, whānau, hapū or iwi ▪ prevents the need for tamariki to enter or re-enter State care ▪ is more equitable for caregivers outside of the State care system, and ▪ addresses care, protection and wellbeing needs of children. Cabinet agreed in December 2019 that there should be no disparity between the standardised payment rate provided to support a child in the State care system, and that 30 provided to support a child living with a caregiver outside the State care system whose parents are unable to care for them. Child Support pass on will be considered in the context of the new model. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 31 SUBMISSIONS OUT OF SCOPE Submissions (Association of Blind Citizens of New Zealand Inc, Dr Linda Hill and Kath Boswell, FinCap, Methodist Alliance, New Zealand Council of Christian Social Services, Salvation Army Te Ope Whakaora) In our view, there may be better ways to support families and whānau with disabled parents, disabled caregivers, and/or disabled children. For example, there are shortcomings in relation to the Disability Allowance that could be addressed. We express disappointment that more impactful changes that would support disabled people receiving Income Support have not been proposed. (Association of Blind Citizens of New Zealand Inc) Benefits are set too low and should be increased. (Dr Linda Hill and Kath Boswell) An ongoing four-week grace period should be implemented for a whānau to report a change in circumstances as well as the possible treatment of child support payments as equally split income over the future month. Such grace period would reduce the risk of overpayment debt arising and reduce stress for whānau, especially for those who often have unpredictable and irregular incomes. (FinCap) We recommend a procedural step where staff confirm in writing that a sole parent is receiving full and correct entitlement. MSD and IR should publish annual data on full and correct entitlements, take-up rates, employment outcomes, etc, as recommended by the Welfare Expert Advisory Group. Abatement thresholds should be indexed to minimum adult wage. (Methodist Alliance) We would recommend that the same care in relation to debt reduction is taken in applying this lens to other benefits, supplements, and subsidies that the receiving parent may be receiving, for example, Accommodation Supplement, childcare subsidies, and Working for Families etc which will interact with child support. (New Zealand Council of Christian Social Services) Debt to government is already a significant burden on households relying on welfare, and we have called for proactive debt relief for low-income families and a centralised approach to managing debt owed to multiple government entities. There is limited information about the phased introduction and no indication of when the phase two legislation will be actioned. (Salvation Army Te Ope Whakaora) Comment Inland Revenue and MSD consider that the matters raised in these submissions are outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill, therefore officials have not considered these further at this time. 32 Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 33 APPENDIX 1 - SUBMITTERS Association of Blind Citizens of New Zealand Inc Sam Byrnand Child Poverty Action Group Community Law Centres o Aotearoa FinCap Gaynor Fiske Natasha Fordyce Dr Linda Hill and Kath Boswell Methodist Alliance New Zealand Council of Christian Social Services Racheal Pearce Salvation Army Te Ope Whakaora Save the Children 34 APPENDIX 2 - SUMMARY OF CHANGES RECOMMENDED Resuming income charging after benefit suspended and resumed Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials recommend an amendment to ensure that MSD can continue to charge an information share child support payment as income if this assistance suspends and resumes within the payment’s income charging period. This recommendation ensures that a client’s information share child support payment is charged the same way as their other income when their financial assistance payments temporarily stop due to a suspension. This is consistent with existing policy and will reduce complexity and confusion for staff and clients. Comment Clients may experience a break in their financial assistance payments (a benefit or other assistance) due to a suspension. This can happen if a client is temporarily not eligible for their financial assistance, for example, because they are temporarily absent from New Zealand. MSD may later resume the client’s financial assistance if there is sufficient evidence, they are eligible for the assistance again. When MSD suspends and resumes a client’s financial assistance in the same period over which they have income being charged, the current policy is that this income continues to be charged when their financial assistance resumes. This only applies to benefits that have been suspended due to a temporary change in circumstances, not benefits that have been cancelled due to a permanent change in circumstances. This current policy for suspensions is intended to also apply to an income charge for an ‘information share child support payment’. This would mean that MSD continue to charge an information share child support payment as income for a client’s financial assistance if the assistance suspends and resumes within the payment’s income charging period. The client’s payment of financial assistance would then be based on the residual income charge on the days they were eligible for this assistance within the remaining income charging period. In the example below, Tama receives an information share child support payment that is charged as income over four weeks from Monday 25 September to Sunday 22 October. On Thursday 5 October, Tama’s benefit is suspended as he temporarily leaves New Zealand and MSD is not sure he is eligible for continued receipt of benefit. Tama provides evidence of his 35 return to New Zealand on 10 October and MSD resumes his benefit from this date. Please see below calendar showing this example. Mon Tues Wed Thurs Fri Sat Sun 18 Sept 19 Sept 20 Sept Benefit payment 21 Sept 22 Sept 23 Sept 24 Sept 25 Sept IR releases payment Income charge begins 26 Sept Deemed date of receipt 27 Sept Benefit payment – CS income charge 28 Sept 29 Sept 30 Sept 1 Oct 2 Oct 3 Oct 4 Oct Benefit payment – CS income charge 5 Oct MSD suspends Tama’s benefit 6 Oct 7 Oct 8 Oct 9 Oct 10 Oct MSD resumes Tama’s benefit 11 Oct Partial benefit payment for 2 – 4 October) 12 Oct Tama provides required evidence 13 Oct 14 Oct 15 Oct 16 Oct 17 Oct 18 Oct Partial benefit payment 10 – 15 October (including arrears for part of the previous week) – CS income charge 19 Oct 20 Oct 21 Oct 22 Oct Income charge ends The Bill as currently drafted would not allow for an information share child payment to continue to be charged as income in this circumstance. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 36 Clarifying a person’s duty to advise of a change of circumstances under the Public and Community Housing Management Act 1992 (PACHMA) Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials recommend amending the Public and Community Housing Management Act 1992 (PACHMA) to clarify that clients do not need to declare a change in circumstances if the responsible agency is notified of the change via the information share. This means that for most people, they will not have to tell MSD if their child support income has changed via the information share. However, there may be rare circumstances where the payment details in the information share are incorrect, and the person will need to advise MSD of the error. Therefore, we recommend including an exception in PACHMA clarifying that a client must declare a change in their circumstances if: ▪ the responsible agency is notified of the change via the information share ▪ the agency notifies the person of the information share child support payment, and ▪ the person considers the information share is incorrect and does not promptly dispute the correctness of the information. This would avoid MSD referring to an incorrect amount of child support when determining a person’s rate of income-related rent, eligibility for public housing, or their rating on the Public Housing Register. Comment Currently under section 115 of PACHMA, clients are required to promptly advise MSD of any change in household circumstances that is likely to result in: ▪ the payment of a higher income-related rent 8 ▪ no longer being in need of, or eligible for, public housing. 9 8 Income-related rent is a subsidised rent scheme for public housing tenants with low incomes. The rate of Income Related Rent is calculated based on a client's assessable income and their household type. MSD calculates the rate of income-related rent and the public housing provider charges this rate as rent to the client. 9 To qualify for public housing, a person must meet an income and asset test, and be ‘at risk’ or ‘in serious housing need’ (as assessed through the Social Allocation System). Child support payments may impact a person’s qualification. 37 This ensures a person’s income-related rent, eligibility for public housing, and priority rating on the Public Housing Register is reflective of their circumstances and current income. From 1 July 2023, MSD will be notified of a change in specified tenants’ child support payments via an Approved Information Sharing Agreement between MSD and Inland Revenue. MSD will not be relying on people to self-declare changes in information share child support payments because this will be received via the information share and recorded in their system. The information can then be used for any future assessment of income- related rent, eligibility for public housing, or Register priority rating. However, as the Bill is currently drafted, section 115 of PACHMA has not been amended, meaning that a person would still have a legal requirement to declare a change in circumstances. Officials consider it unreasonable for a tenant to have a legal requirement to declare a change in child support income if that change is already being communicated via the information share. A legislative amendment is required to avoid a person being at risk of debt if they had not self-declared their changes. It would also avoid adding an unnecessary administrative load when a person self-declares the change to MSD (such as via phone). Section 113 of the Social Security Act 2018 is undergoing a similar amendment to reflect that clients are not required to notify MSD of a change in circumstances if the change is notified via the information share. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 38 Excluding specific child support payments from being charged as income for a benefit or other assistance Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials recommend an amendment to exclude the following from being considered income, any child support payment information for periods on or after 1 July 2023 that came through the Inland Revenue / MSD transactional file but was not matched to a client because they were not receiving income-tested assistance from MSD at the time Inland Revenue made the payment to them. Comment A person’s benefit commencement date can be earlier than when they apply for assistance, for example, if the 28-day rule applies under section 316 of the Social Security Act 2018 (SSA). MSD may be advised of child support payment information that the SSA requires to be charged as income when backdating the commencement of a client’s benefit for periods after 1 July 2023. This relates to child support administered by Inland Revenue for periods on or after 1 July 2023, that came through the Inland Revenue / MSD transactional file at the time the child support payment was made to the client, but was not matched to the client as they were not receiving income-tested assistance from MSD at the time Inland Revenue made the payment to them. If a client self-declares this child support, it would need to be charged as income under MSD’s general income charging rules 10 for the client’s backdated commencement of benefit. If MSD obtains this information from Inland Revenue through the secure email channel, this child support would be income under MSD’s new prescribed income charging rules. This is because the verified payment information would meet the definition of ‘information share child support payment’. Example: Jack is the primary caregiver for his son Aaron and receives formula assessed child support from his ex-partner, via Inland Revenue. He is in a new relationship with Lucia, who is supporting him financially. On Sunday 27 August, Jack and Lucia break up. Jack decides to apply for financial assistance from MSD, but it takes him a while to make the application. He applies on Monday 18 September and the next day he is granted Sole Parent Support (SPS) with a commencement date of Monday 11 September (the day after Jack’s benefit stand down period ends). 10 This means staff apply discretion to determine the period over which to charge the child support as income for benefits or other assistance. 39 Jack self-declares his child support for the week of 11 September, along with any other income he has, so that MSD may determine the rate of his SPS for that backdated period. However, the policy intent is not to charge this type of child support as income when backdating the commencement date of a benefit or other assistance. Only the information share child support payment that Jack receives on or after Tuesday 19 September will be charged as income against his SPS. Charging child support as income in such cases would be contrary to the policy intent of phase one of child support pass-on to charge child support payments forward and only make retrospective adjustments to address specific errors. In line with this policy, child support payments, including those outlined above, will not be charged as income when backdating the commencement date of a benefit for periods post 1 July 2023 during phase one. This design feature may be revisited as part of phase two of child support pass-on. The Bill as it is currently drafted would not give effect to the policy intent of not treating these child support payments as income when backdating the commencement of a client’s benefit or other assistance. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 40 Clarifying that the deprivation of income provisions continue to apply for Unsupported Child’s Benefit beneficiaries Clauses 47, 48 and 64 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials recommend an amendment to the Bill to exclude the changes to deprivation rules from applying to Unsupported Child’s Benefit (UCB) beneficiaries. This will ensure that the status quo for UCB beneficiaries is preserved in line with the decisions taken by Cabinet on child support pass-on. Officials also recommend amending the Public and Community Housing Management Act 1992 (PACHMA) clauses of the Bill to exclude these changes from applying to UCB beneficiaries in a voluntary child support arrangement, to align with existing policy settings. Comment Alongside the decision to remove the obligation for people on a sole parent rate of main benefit to apply for a formula assessment of child support under the Child Support Act 1991, it was considered necessary to ensure the deprivation rules under PACHMA and the Social Security Act 2018 11 do not apply to decisions not to apply for or to revoke a child support arrangement of any kind, including arrangements made outside of Inland Revenue. The Bill, as introduced, excludes an applicant, or an applicant’s spouse or partner, from being considered as depriving themselves of income by not applying for a formula assessment of child support or revoking such an arrangement. This extends to voluntary agreements and private arrangements. However, as drafted, the amendments include someone applying for UCB. As the proposals for child support pass-on do not apply to UCB, it is not appropriate that these exclusions apply to UCB beneficiaries. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 11 When making decisions about a client’s entitlement to income-tested financial assistance, MSD considers whether a person has deprived themselves of income. This includes failing to access financial resources available to them, for example child support. 41 APPENDIX 3 – RESPONSE TO RECOMMENDATIONS OF REGULATIONS REVIEW COMMITTEE Recommendations The Regulations Review Committee recommends that the Social Services and Communities Committee satisfy itself that the Henry VIII powers in the Bill are appropriate and that they have appropriate constraints on the use of those powers and, if not, recommend that the Bill be amended accordingly. The Regulations Review Committee noted that it is unusual for an Act to be able to be amended by regulations that are made under a regulation-making power that is found under a different Act. It also noted that it would be clearer if each Act had its own regulation- making power in it. The Regulations Review Committee recommends the Bill is amended to provide that each Act has its own regulation-making power in respect of transitional and savings provisions. Response of officials The response below presents some of the same information provided to the Social Services and Communities Committee on 24 April 2023, in response to its question: Regulation- making powers included in the Bill, specifically the Henry VIII clause – how will they work and why are they justified? As with any legislative change, there is a risk that intended policy changes may cause unintended outcomes that treat clients differently or unfairly, or that legislative changes impair the function of other aspects of the legislation amended. It is not unusual for complex legislation to contain empowering provisions to allow regulations to be made to address issues as they are identified, during implementation. For example, such a provision was included in the Social Security Legislation Rewrite Bill. The Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO) have recommended that an empowering provision is included in the Bill with a sunset provision that any regulations made under it, cease to have effect at the start of 1 July 2026. The empowering provision limits the effect of changes to within the transitional period and only to changes related to transitional and savings provisions. PCO recommended that the provision be applicable to the Social Security Act 2018, the Child Support Act 1991, and the Public and Community Housing Management Act 1992. This is tempered by the requirement that regulations made must be agreed to by the relevant Minister(s) responsible for the legislation impacted by those changes. PCO consider it is better practice to create a single regulation-making power to apply to the three Acts because the changes proposed in this Bill reflect a single policy change that applies to the three separate, but interrelated, Acts. 42 The Legislative Design and Advisory Committee guidelines note that if it is not possible to foresee all of the potential transitional and savings issues that might arise, it may be appropriate to create a provision that empowers the Executive to make regulations dealing with transitional and savings issues. This option is not a substitute for a thorough assessment of the potential transitional and savings issues and will likely be the subject of an adverse report from the Regulations Review Committee. 12 Establishing a regulation-making power 13 would provide a way to quickly resolve issues that may develop after implementation, such as that any unintended outcomes potentially impacting clients, or the functions of other aspects of the legislation. Longer term, the primary legislation would be amended. PCO consider the empowering provision is framed in line with relevant principles, stated in reports of the Regulations Review Committee and recognised in guidelines of the Legislation Design Advisory Committee, for transitional regulations that override primary legislation. The amendments this Bill makes are very complex, and they affect thousands of people. The empowering provision helps to ensure an orderly and workable transition to those amendments being brought into operation. 12 Legislation Design and Advisory Committee.

Chapter 12 Affecting existing rights, duties, and situations and addressing past conduct, question 12.6. 13 Clause 69 of the draft Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Bill inserting clause 98 in the new Part 9 in Schedule 1 of the Social Security Act 2018, Regulations for transitional and savings purposes. 43 APPENDIX 4 – RESPONSES TO RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE MEMORANDUM ON LEGISLATIVE SCRUTINY Question Does the Ministry of Justice intend to provide further advice on the Bill’s consistency with the Bill of Rights Act 1990, on the bill as introduced to the House? Response of officials The Ministry of Justice has advised that its advice on the Bill’s consistency with the Bill of Rights Act 1990 has not changed because of the final version of the Bill prior to introduction. It has also advised that it generally does not provide further advice following the introduction of a Bill to the House. Question Can officials provide a comment on the lack of external consultation conducted on the proposals in the bill? Response of officials The response below presents the same information provided to the Social Services and Communities Committee on 24 April 2023. Though there has not been specific public consultation through this policy development process, previous consultation undertaken by the Welfare Export Advisory Group (WEAG) clearly demonstrates various stakeholders’ views. In 2018, the Minister for Social Development commissioned the WEAG to undertake a broad- ranging review of the welfare system and advise Government on the future of New Zealand’s welfare system. WEAG conducted an inclusive and consultative engagement process with opportunities for New Zealanders to provide input by survey, submissions, community forums, and hui. WEAG heard from nearly 3,000 New Zealanders from across the welfare system, including recipients of benefits, beneficiary advocates, and MSD staff. Feedback received during consultation and formulated in the WEAG’s 2019 report found that the welfare system did not treat its clients with dignity and respect, and that changes were needed to treat people with more compassion and empathy. Many respondents thought child support payments should be passed on to the receiving carer. Passing on child support was recommendation 27 of 42 made by WEAG in its 2019 report ‘Whakamana Tāngata – Restoring Dignity to Social Security in New Zealand’. WEAG recommended that the payments be passed on to receiving carers and that these payments be treated as income for benefit abatement in the same way as wages. 44 In addition to WEAG’s consultation, welfare advocacy groups, commissioned expert panels, and academics have all expressed the need for child support to be passed on. They expect it will reduce child poverty rates and prioritise the child’s wellbeing. In 2011, the Child Poverty Action Group undertook an analysis in their report ‘Left Further Behind’ and devoted a chapter to ‘Reforming Child Support’. They considered that “part or all of Child Support should be paid directly to the parent on a benefit”, and that “Child Support reform must have the child’s well-being at the centre, not the financial needs of the Government”. In 2012, the Children’s Commissioner commissioned the Expert Advisory Group on Solutions to Child Poverty. It recommended the Government pass-on child support payments to eligible sole parents who are on State-provided benefits (Recommendation 13), considering it the “practical, cost-effective and relatively inexpensive measure that will mitigate some of the worst consequences of child poverty.” In his 2017 thesis, economist Michael John Fletcher determined “that pass-on would improve outcomes following separation in terms of reducing the decline in living standards, ameliorating poverty rates, and reducing the gap between parents with care of children (mostly women) and paying parents (mostly men).”
