1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.6 (November 1993) ACC Earner and Employer Premiums Companies must deduct premiums from Shareholder-employee salaries When a company pays shareholder-employee salaries that have no PAYE deducted from them, under sections 115(1) and (19) of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act it must still deduct earner premium. This is the same obligation as any employer has to deduct earner premium from employees' salaries or wages. In the IR†4 company tax return there are spaces to calculate earner and employer premiums on salaries paid with no PAYE deductions. The company must pay these premiums to Inland Revenue by its terminal tax due date. GST input credits and income tax deductions There have been some questions about when self- employed people, employers and companies can claim GST input tax credits and income tax deductions for the ACC premiums that they pay. Self-employed people Self-employed people are liable for earner and employer premiums in their own right. (This includes people who earn partnership income that is liable for premiums.) These premiums are deductible for income tax under section 140A of the Income Tax Act. Taxpayers claim this deduction in the income year in which the premi- ums are due and payable. Self-employed people who are registered for GST can claim an input tax credit on the GST component of both earner and employer premiums. Inland Revenue's premium notices show the total of these premiums in the GST tax invoice section. Employers Employers can claim income tax deductions and GST input tax credits for the employer premiums they pay on their employees' earnings. They cannot claim deduc- tions or input tax credits for the earner premium they deduct from their employees' wages, as the individual employees bear the cost of these premiums. For employers, Inland Revenue's premium notices show only the employer premium in the GST invoice section. Companies Companies that pay shareholder-employee salaries with no PAYE deductions can claim income tax deductions and GST input tax credits for the employer premiums they pay on these salaries. They cannot claim deduc- tions or input tax credits for the earner premium they deduct, as the individual shareholder-employees bear the cost of these premiums. For companies, Inland Revenue's premium notices show only the employer premium in the GST invoice section. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue made this press release on 16†November 1993 ìCompany shareholders who try and obtain a tax deduction on mortgage interest for residential homes do so at their peril, Commissioner of Inland Revenue David Henry said today. Mr Henry said it was clear that the Income Tax Act intended to prevent tax deductibility on private loans. Section 99 allows the Department to rule against schemes which aim to avoid taxation liability. Mr Henry said an Inland Revenue Department circular which had examined the scheme was being withdrawn because it drew incorrect conclusions. The issue revolves around the purchase of residential property by a company shareholder. The shareholder Tax Avoidance - Shares Sold to Holding Company to Finance House Purchase sells shares in a company they own to a holding company. The holding company funds the share purchase with a commercial loan and claims a deduction for interest payments. The arrangement attempts to make interest on the purchase of the residential property tax deductible where it would not otherwise be. Mr Henry said the central issue in this case was the purpose of such an arrangement. If a purpose was avoidance of tax liability, the deduction would be disallowed. ìTaxpayers who enter schemes of this kind do so at substantial risk. The Inland Revenue Department is committed to ensuring that everyone pays their fair share of tax. The Department will take firm action to identify and stop tax avoidance schemes.î î 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.6 (November 1993) Frequent Flyers’ Schemes - Tax Treatment Summary This article sets out the tax implications of benefits from the membership of a Frequent Flyer Scheme (ìFFSî). Members of a FFS are granted points once they have travelled a predetermined number of kilometres or miles on an airline. Points can be exchanged for free travel, goods, or services, depending on the terms of the particular FFS. (These benefits are called ìentitlementsî in this article.) Where an employee is a member of a FFS and receives entitlements under the scheme because of that member- ship, the entitlements will not be subject to fringe benefit tax (ìFBTî). The only exception will be if the employer enters into an arrangement with the promoter of the scheme so employees can get entitlements under the scheme. If this happens the employer is deemed to provide benefits to the employees, and is liable to pay fringe benefit tax on the market value of the entitle- ments. However, the purchase of travel by an employer which gives rise to FFS entitlements to an employee does not by itself amount to an ìarrangementî. Where an employer who is a member of a FFS assigns an entitlement under the scheme to an employee, there will be a FBT liability. The employer is liable for FBT on the market value of the entitlement. Any entitlement a member receives under a scheme will not be monetary remuneration or income under general concepts. Any money a member receives for assigning entitle- ments on a regular basis could be income under general principles. Any money received for assigning an entitlement may be taxed as profit or gain from property acquired for the purpose of sale or from a profit making scheme. FBT implications An employer is liable to pay FBT on the taxable value of a fringe benefit provided or granted to an employee of the employer. ìFringe benefitî is defined in the Income Tax Act 1976 (ìthe Actî). It includes any benefit of any other kind whatever, received or enjoyed whether directly or indirectly in relation to, in the course of or by virtue of the employment of the employee and which is provided or granted by the employer of the employee (section 336N(1)). Where an employee is a member of a FFS There will be no FBT liability where an employee joins a scheme and receives entitlements under the scheme because of that membership. The promoter of the scheme (usually an airline) provides the entitlements because of its contract with the individual employee, not because of the employment contract between the indi- vidual employee and the employer. Example Employee A works for ABC Limited. In the course of her employment she undertakes frequent air travel. The employer pays for the air travel. Em- ployee A is a member of a FFS and earns sufficient points from business travel for a trip to Europe which she takes. Is the employer liable for FBT on the value of the trip? The employer is not liable for FBT as the benefit is provided because of the contract between the employee and the airline. It is not because of the contract of employment. However, there will be an FBT implication if an airline arranges with an employer to provide entitlements to the employer's employees. ìArrangementî is defined as any contract, agreement, plan, or understanding (whether enforceable or unenforceable) including all steps and transactions carry it into effect. An example of such an arrangement would be where an employer enters into an ìarrangementî with an airline that its employees will use the airline for air travel provided that the employees receive certain entitlements under the FFS. The pur- chase of travel by an employer which gives rise to FFS entitlements to an employee does not by itself amount to an ìarrangementî. The situation where an employer uses a single airline for all air travel by its employees will not amount to an arrangement unless the employer and the airline have entered into an arrangement under which the airline agrees with the employer to provide FFS entitlements to the employerís employees. Where an arrangement does exist the employer is deemed to provide the entitlements, so it is liable for FBT (section 336N(2)). The employer is liable for FBT on the market value of the entitlement. There may be apportionment if some of the ìpointsî giving rise to the entitlement arise from private travel undertaken by the employee. Where an employer is a corporate member of a FFS Employers can join some schemes as corporate mem- bers. This means that a number of unspecified employ- ees can use the membership and the points and entitle- ments accumulate to the employer. Where an employer is a member of a scheme and assigns entitlements under the scheme to employees, the employer will be liable for FBT on the market value of the entitlements. The employer is providing a benefit to the employees because of their employment. 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.6 (November 1993) Example XYZ Limited has corporate membership of a FFS. It accumulates a large number of points from the travel undertaken by various employees. The points entitle XYZ Limited to two around the world tickets. It decides to assign these tickets to two employees for their high performance within the company. Is the employer liable for FBT? The employer is liable to FBT on the market value of the tickets, as the benefit is provided to the employees because of their employment relation- ship. Where an employer pays employee's fee to join FFS If an employer pays an employeeís membership fee for an FFS this will generally be subject to FBT. This is consistent with the treatment of any fee or subscription paid by the employer for an employee. Valuing the fringe benefit Inland Revenue accepts that where section 336P(2) applies the taxable value of the fringe benefit will be nil. Section 336P(2) applies to any benefits resulting from expenditure on travel or accommodation that an em- ployer incurs for an employee's employment-related travel. It is subject to the condition that the expenditure is not incurred for any period that the employee is on leave or vacation. In addition, the expenditure must not have been increased by provision of the benefit. Specific schemes There are number of schemes operating in New Zea- land. These fall into two categories; called Category A and Category B schemes in this article. In Category A schemes: ï membership is open to individuals only; ï generally no membership fee is charged; ï the entitlements are assignable to anyone at the time of ticketing, or in some cases at any time provided the entitlements are assigned to family members who are also members of a FFS; ï members will be in breach of the membership contract if they sell their entitlements; ï generally time limits are imposed for the use of entitlements; ï the member can not take the benefits as discounts on travel. The entitlements under Category A schemes do not fall within the definition of fringe benefit. The promoter of the scheme (usually an airline) provides the entitlements because of its contract with the employee, not because of the employment contract between the individual em- ployee and the employer. If the employer enters into an arrangement with a promoter so that employees can receive entitlements then the employer is deemed to provide a benefit to the employees and is liable for FBT on the market value of those entitlements (see section†336N(3)). In Category B schemes: ï membership is open to individuals and corporations; ï no membership fee is charged; ï the entitlements are assignable to anyone at any point specified by the member; ï there is no time restriction for using the entitlements; ï members can use the points to take discounts on travel. If an employer who is a member of a Category B scheme assigns entitlements under the scheme to employees, the employer is liable to FBT on the market value of the entitlement. Employee's FSS entitlements - income tax implications Monetary remuneration Any entitlements under an FFS will not constitute monetary remuneration. Monetary remuneration is defined as certain cash payments, payments made on behalf of an employee and non-cash accommodation allowances under section 72. The entitlements under the schemes do not fall into any of these categories. Income under general concepts The entitlements under an FFS are not income under general concepts. The entitlements arise from the contracts between the promoter of the scheme and the member. This puts the member in a position to receive entitlements. There is no guarantee of receiving an entitlement because this depends on the number of points accumulated on travel. The entitlements are therefore in the nature of a windfall gain if the em- ployee achieves the requisite number of points. Further, to be income under general concepts the entitlement must be convertible by the member to money or moneyís worth (see Tennant v Smith (1982) 3 TC 158 at p†170). Under the schemes that are consid- ered in this item, the member cannot ever convert the entitlements into money. All the member receives from the entitlement is a saving of expenditure which has been held not to constitute income (see FCT v Cooke and Sherden 80 ATC 4140). If the points under an FFS are used as discounts on travel by a member there are no income tax implica- tions. As stated above a saving of expenditure is not income. Any money received by a member for the assignment of an entitlement under a FFS could be taxable if the member regularly assigned entitlements for money. It may be taxed under section 65(2)(e) as a profit or gain from property acquired for the purpose of sale or from a profit making scheme. 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.6 (November 1993) Income Tax (Deemed Rate of Return) Regulations 1993 The Income Tax (Deemed Rate of Return) Regulations 1993 were made on 20†October 1993. The regulations prescribe a deemed rate of return of 11.6% which will be used to calculate foreign investment fund (FIF) income under the deemed rate of return calculation method in the FIF regime. The rate will apply for the 1992-93 income year and the 1991-92 income year for taxpayers whose 1991-92 balance date was after 2 July 1992. Under the FIF regime, any income that a foreign entity earns on behalf of a New Zealand resident will be taxed on a current basis, as long as the New Zealand investor does not have a controlling interest in the entity. The deemed rate of return calculation method is set out in section 245RE of the Income Tax Act 1976. It is one of four methods for calculating FIF income or loss. Under the deemed rate of return method, FIF income is determined by multiplying the value of a personís FIF interest by a percentage which is prescribed by regula- tion. That percentage is the ìdeemed rate of returnî. The Income Tax (Deemed Rate Of Return) Regulations 1993 prescribe a rate of 11.6% which will apply for all types of FIF investments for which a taxpayer uses the deemed rate of return method. This includes interests in superannuation schemes and life insurance policies. The FIF regime generally applies from 1 April 1993, to all FIF interests held by New Zealand residents on that date. It also applies from the date of acquisition to FIF interests acquired after 2 July 1992 (1992 Budget Night, when the new FIF regime was announced). The prescribed rate of 11.6% will generally apply in the 1992-93 income year to FIF interests acquired between 2 July 1992 and the end of a taxpayerís 1992-93 income year. The rate will also apply in the 1992-93 income year to taxpayers with late 1992-93 balance dates who continue to hold from 1 April 1993 FIF interests that were held on 2 July 1992. The prescribed rate of 11.6% will apply in the 1991-92 income year for taxpayers with a 1991-92 balance date after 2 July 1992 (i.e., between 3 July 1992 and 30 September 1992 inclusive) who acquired a FIF interest after 2 July 1992. FIF income derived in the 1992-93 or 1991-92 income years does not need to be returned until the 1993-94 income year (section 245Y(10), Income Tax Act 1976). The deemed rate of return applying to future income years will be set annually. Depreciation Rate for Professional Loggers' Chainsaws There is a new depreciation rate for chainsaws used by professional loggers. The new rate is 100% (for both straight line and diminishing value methods), and it applies from 1†April 1993. This new rate is set by Determination DEP2: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 2, which is reproduced below. This determination inserts a new category in the ìTimber and Joinery Industriesî industry category of Determination DEP1 (see page 54 of appendix to TIB Volume Four, No.9 - April 1993). Determination DEP2: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 2 This determination may be cited as ìDetermination DEP2: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 2î. 1. Application This determination shall apply to chainsaws used by professional loggers in industry category ìTimber and Joinery Industriesî acquired on or after 1†April 1993. 2. Determination Pursuant to section 108C of the Income Tax Act 1976 I have determined the following basic eco- nomic depreciation rate: Determination DEP1 is amended by inserting in the industry category ìTimber and Joinery Industriesî an additional asset class ìChainsaws (used by professional loggers)î with the following details - Estimated useful life1 year DV banded depreciation rate (%)100% SL equivalent banded depreciation rate (%)100% 3. Interpretation In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions have the same meaning as in the Income Tax Act 1976. This determination is signed by me on the second day of November 1993.

We've published this article to remind you how that liability arises and how it can be offset under the new Underlying Foreign Tax Credit regime. FDWP will only arise on non-dividend repatriations for company taxpayers (individuals are subject to income tax). Background The new legislation subjecting all Non-Dividend Repatriations to FDWP (for companies) or income tax (for individuals) was explained on page 33 of TIB Volume Four, No.9. The new Underlying Foreign Tax Credit (UFTC) regime was explained in TIB Volume Five, No.4. Both sets of rules may affect the amount of FDWP that must be paid on 20†January 1994 (or any FDWP payment due after that date). Key Issues The Non-Dividend Repatriation regime only applies to taxpayers who have an income interest of 10 percent or greater in a controlled foreign company (CFC) for any accounting period. Only companies will be subject to FDWP; it will be charged on their attributed share of any specified repatriations of the CFC. Specified repatriations are the lesser of these amounts: ï the CFCís increase in investment in New Zealand property ï the amount of unrepatriated income of the CFC. These terms were explained in TIB Volume Four, No.9. These provisions apply to all Non-Dividend Repatriations made after 2 July 1992. However, any specified repatriation to a company is deemed to be paid six months after the later of these dates: ï the end of the accounting period of the CFC in which the specified repatriation arose ï 1 April 1993. This means the first due date for FDWP incorporating Non-Dividend Repatriations is 20†January 1994. In calculating the amount of any FDWP that would have to be paid, the UFTC regime allows a credit against any FDWP payable for underlying taxes that the foreign company has paid. This is in addition to any non- resident withholding tax paid to the foreign country. The UFTC regime applies to all dividends paid on or after 28 September 1993. As the first date on which any specified repatriations would be deemed to have been paid is 1 October 1993, the UFTC regime may apply to all Non-Dividend Repatriations. Examples of how the UFTC regime impacts on the FDWP (and Non-Dividend Repatriation) rules are set out in TIB Volume Five, No.4. Upcoming TIB Articles In the next few months we'll be releasing policy statements on these topics in the Tax Information Bulletin: ï Repairs and maintenance policy resulting from the new depreciation regime ï When Inland Revenue can grant relief from payment of tax in cases of financial hardship ï Various qualifying company statements We'll publish these statements as soon as we've finished consulting with external commentators. 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.6 (November 1993) Questions We’ve Been Asked This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that we've received. We've published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Income Tax Act 1976 Low income rebate where there is a change of balance date .............................................................. 6 Exempting a scholarship from income tax ............................................................................................ 7 Interest in a foreign unit trust .................................................................................................................. 7 Investment property sold within 10 years ............................................................................................. 8 Farmers' valuation options once Trading Stock (or Standard Value) scheme repealed ................ 8 Interest disclosures when receiving foreign income ............................................................................ 9 Family Support where child leaves school ............................................................................................ 9 Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 GST-registered tenants renting from non-registered landlords ...................................................... 10 GST incurred by overseas tourists ....................................................................................................... 10 GST payable on sale of a business asset .............................................................................................. 10 Corrections to earlier items Subdivision of an orchard ..................................................................................................................... 11 Capital cost of devising an invention .................................................................................................. 11 Income Tax Act 1976 Low Income Rebate Where There is a Change of Balance Date Section 50D - Low Income Rebate: A taxpayer who was filing a tax return for a period of less than 12 months, after a change of balance date, asked whether the low income rebate was apportioned down to reflect the period of the return (nine months in this case). The rebate must be apportioned in this situation. Section 16(5) provides that where a taxpayer is assessed for income tax on a return for a period of less than a year, income-based rebates must be calculated on 12 months’ equivalent in- come. The resulting answer is then grossed up or down depending on the pe- riod of the return filed. If the period is less than a year there will be a proportion- ate reduction in the amount of the rebate. Example Income for nine months:= $12,000 Income “grossed up” to annual equivalent:$12,000 x 12/9 = $16,000 Low income rebate calculated on $16,000:= $595 Rebate “grossed down” to period covered by return: $595 x 9/12 = $446.25 The rebate the taxpayer is entitled to claim in the tax return is $446.25. 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.6 (November 1993) Exempting a Scholarship from Income Tax Section 61(37) - Scholarship or Bursary Income: An organisation which wants to sponsor a student by way of a scholarship asked what criteria have to be met before the scholarship would be considered exempt from income tax. To qualify under section 61(37) the recipient of the scholarship would need to be attending an “educational institution”. There is no definition of this term in the Act. The character of the payment is the determining factor. This must be ascertained in relation to the recipient, rather than to the payer. The character of the pay- ment will be determined principally from the contractual documents, the terms and provisions applicable between the payer and the payee, and the surround- ing circumstances. Qualification does not depend on the level of payment. Some factors to consider are: • Is the principal purpose of the payment to secure the future services of the recipient? • Does an employment relationship between the sponsor and the student exist or continue throughout the study period? • Is the money paid out as a scholarship to be repaid at a later date? These questions are dealt with in Case G56 (1985) 7 NZTC 1,247; Reid v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,176; CIR v Drew (1988)10 NZTC 5,060; Case L30 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,181 and Case L35 (1989)11 NZTC 1,218 The existence of a bonding provision in the contract is not the sole determining factor (see the Reid case), though the scale of a pledge may be significant (see Case L30). Where the principal purpose of the payments is to secure the student’s service once the study is completed, and the student is the employee of the sponsor, the payments are likely to be assessable (Drew case). Where the principal purpose is to finance the student’s education, rather than to secure the student’s future services, the payment is less likely to be assessable (Reid case). Each case must be considered on its own merit in the light of the relevant cir- cumstances. Apply to your local Inland Revenue office if you want a decision on the tax status of a particular payment. You will need to provide full details of the schol- arship that is to be paid. Interest In a Foreign Unit Trust Section 65(2)(eb) - Assessable Income From a Foreign Investment Fund: A taxpayer was resident in New Zealand, and held an interest of less than 10 percent in an Australian unit trust. He asked about the tax consequences if the value of his interest increased. If a New Zealand resident's interest comes within the foreign investment fund (FIF) regime, any increase in value of that interest during the income year will constitute FIF income if the taxpayer has chosen the comparative value method. This increase will be taxed in terms of section 65(2)(eb). continued on page 8 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.6 (November 1993) Australia is listed in the Fifteenth Schedule (countries excluded from the FIF regime), so the taxpayer’s interest will not be an interest in a FIF (section 245RA (2)(b)). This means an increase in the value of the interest which is not distrib- uted will not be assessable to the unit holder (but note that interests in superan- nuation schemes or life insurance policies do not qualify for the Fifteenth Sched- ule exemption). Any income distributed by the unit trust to the unit holder will be treated as a dividend under section 4(1)(j), and will be assessable in the nor- mal manner. A credit will be allowed in New Zealand for any Australian with- holding taxes deducted from such distributions. Investment Property Sold Within Ten Years Section 67 - Profits or Gains From Land Transactions: A taxpayer living over- seas purchased a house in New Zealand in 1987. He claimed that he purchased the house for investment purposes. He asked whether any profit he made on the sale or exchange of that property for another property would be taxable in New Zealand. Section 67(4) establishes categories under which profits or gains from the sale or other disposition of land are included in a taxpayer’s assessable income. The categories of section 67(4) broadly include: • land acquired with the purpose or intention of sale • sales by land dealers • sales by developers or subdividers • sales by builders • profits arising from re-zoning of the land • development or subdivision schemes entered into within 10 years of acquisi- tion • significant development or subdivision schemes not caught by any other categories. The effect of section 67(4)(a) is to include within assessable income any profits or gains derived from the sale or other disposition of the land, where the land was “acquired for the purpose or intention, or for purposes or intentions including the purpose or intention, of selling or otherwise disposing of it.” It is the purpose or intention at the time of acquisition that is important for this provision. In this case Inland Revenue did not receive enough information for the assess- ability to be determined. Farmers' Valuation Options once Trading Stock (or Standard Value) Scheme Repealed Section 86A - Valuation of Option: A farmer who used the trading stock scheme to value his specified livestock asked if he had to enter the herd scheme now that the option of the trading stock scheme has been repealed. To allow a more accurate valuation of livestock, the trading stock scheme has been repealed from the 1992/93 income year and a national standard cost scheme has been implemented. This is based on the national average cost of production, rather than market values, on which the trading stock scheme was based. from page 7 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.6 (November 1993) In the case of specified livestock, valuation is determined under section 86A by electing any of the methods specified in sections 86B to 86F. These methods are: Section 86B- cost price (self assessed cost), or - market value, or - replacement value, or Section 86C- national standard cost method, or Section 86D- herd scheme method, or Section 86F(3) - bailed livestock method (where appropriate) Therefore, the farmer is not limited to a set method now that the trading stock scheme has been repealed. He can elect any of the above methods for his speci- fied livestock. There are transitional provisions which allow a five-year spread of any revalua- tion income arising from the move to the new livestock regime. Interest Disclosures when Receiving Foreign Income Section 245W - Disclosure: A New Zealand resident with a 15% interest in a company in Canada asked if he had to make a disclosure of his interest in the company. Section 245W(1) requires a taxpayer with an interest in a foreign company or foreign investment fund (FIF) to disclose that interest in the prescribed form (IR 4G for foreign company interests, or IR 4H for FIF interests) with the taxpay- er’s return of income. Section 245W(2) and the International Tax Disclosure Exemption D4 provide exemptions from the disclosure requirements for the 1993 income year. The 1993 exemption is not as wide as previous years’ exemptions. In particular the disclo- sure requirement now applies equally to previously exempted Fifteenth Sched- ule countries (Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, United Kingdom and the United States). Control and income interests held in a foreign company during the 1993 income year must be disclosed where the income interest is 10% or greater, regardless of the foreign company's country of residence. The taxpayer in this case will there- fore need to disclose his interest in the Canadian company on an IR 4G form. Family Support where Child Leaves School Section 374D - Family Support Credit of Tax: A taxpayer who was receiving Family Support during the income year asked until what date she was eligible to receive Family Support for her son. He turned 18 in June 1992, and left school in September 1992. Section 374D(1)(a) permits the Commissioner to allow a Family Support tax credit for a child who is: • 18 years or over, and • not financially independent, and • still attending school or a tertiary educational establishment until no later than the first pay day after 31 December of the year in which the child turns 18 (in this case 31 December 1992). In this case the child was still at school from June to September 1992, when he left to go to work. The Commissioner can allow a Family Support Tax Credit for him until September 1992, when the child left school. 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.6 (November 1993) Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 GST Registered Tenants Renting From Non-Registered Landlords Section 2(1) - Input Tax: An artist who is registered for GST started renting space in a commercial building from a non-registered landlord. He asked whether he could claim an input tax credit on the rent paid. An input tax credit is normally available only for GST paid by a registered person. However, paragraph (c) of the definition of the term “input tax” for- merly allowed a credit in this situation. This paragraph was amended in 1989. It now applies only to a supply by way of sale. There is now no input tax credit in the situation described. In the artist’s situation no GST is payable so he cannot claim an input tax credit. If the landlord was registered and charging GST then the artist could claim an input tax credit (because of para (a) of the definition of “input tax”), provided the rental related to his making taxable supplies. GST Incurred By Overseas Tourists Section 8 - Imposition of Goods and Services Tax on Supply: A tourist in New Zealand purchased a motor vehicle in New Zealand on a purchase/buyback arrangement with a local motor vehicle dealer. He asked whether he was eligible for a refund of the GST paid on the purchase price of the motor vehicle. In some countries a refund is available. However, a tourist leaving New Zealand cannot claim back the GST component of goods and services purchased while in New Zealand. In general (see the exceptions below), tourists must bear the GST incurred on their purchases in New Zealand. Consequently, they normally incur GST on their purchases from registered persons, and a refund is not available. Another tourist was in New Zealand for six months. He requested a refund of the GST paid on his purchases on the basis of the double taxation agreement between New Zealand and Germany. GST that is incurred by tourists in New Zealand is not refundable. Under section 8(1) GST will be incurred on any purchases that tourists make, in the same way that it is incurred by New Zealand residents. A supply of goods will be zero-rated in these situations: • when purchased items are entered or deemed to be entered for export by the supplier under the Customs Act 1966, and the supplier exports the items • where the sealed bag system operates • where goods are sold within an area licensed under section 32 of the Customs Act 1966 as a Customs examining place. The Double Taxation Relief (Federal Republic of Germany) Order 1980 only applies to income tax. It does not apply to GST and does not provide for the refunding of GST incurred by German tourists. GST Payable on Sale of a Business Asset Section 11- Zero-Rating: A taxpayer asked whether the sale of a business work- shop would be zero-rated where the vendor retained the remaining assets of the business. 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.6 (November 1993) To qualify for zero-rating under section 11(1)(c) of the Act, a sale must be the sale of a taxable activity (or part of a taxable activity) as a going concern to another registered person. This means that the purchaser must be registered for GST and that the business must be capable of being carried on when it is sold. In this case Inland Revenue did not receive enough information to work out whether the business was capable of being carried on when it was sold. Corrections to Earlier Items Subdivision of an Orchard In earlier issues of “Questions We’ve Been Asked” (Volume Four, No.10 and Volume Five, No 1), we stated that any profits from the subdivision discussed were assessable under section 67(4)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1976. We concluded the item by saying the value of the land at the beginning of the undertaking or scheme may be used in determining the assessable income. This is not correct. Profits assessed under section 67(4)(e) are determined by reference to the origi- nal cost price to the owner. Section 67(9A) allows the Commissioner to deter- mine the cost price where necessary. This would apply, for example, where only some of the sections are sold out of a larger block of land, or the land was pur- chased along with other land or assets and a separate cost price was not fixed at the time of purchase, and there is some difficulty in now determining the cost price of the land being sold. However, the value of the land at the beginning of an undertaking or scheme (not the cost price) will be used when assessing profits under section 67(4)(f) (used essentially for subdivision schemes involving major work commenced after 10 years of purchase). This section only applies to the sale of land not caught under one of the other paragraphs of section 67(4). The authority to use the value of the land at the beginning of the scheme is provided for in section 67(10), and is there to ensure that only the “developer’s profit” is assessed for tax. This means that an increase in the land value up to the time the scheme is commenced is not taxable, only the profits from the scheme. Capital Cost of Devising an Invention In TIB Volume Four, No.11, we stated that section 143(2) permits the Commis- sioner to allow such deductions as he thinks fit for any expenditure incurred in devising an invention where a patent has been granted. Sections 83, 142 and 143 are tax provisions that relate to patents. Deductions allowed under sections 142 (purchase of patent rights) and 143(2) (expenses incurred in devising an invention) ceased on 31 March 1993. Expenditure of this nature incurred after 31 March 1993 can only be claimed as a deduction under section 83 in the year the patent rights are sold. Under section 83, any amount received on the sale of patent rights is assessable income. Expenditure incurred in connection with the grant, maintenance, or extension of a patent (e.g. application and patent attorney’s fees) which are deductible under section 143(1), and expenditure incurred in connection with scientific research deductible under section 144, remain fully deductible after 1 April 1993. Patents created or acquired after 31 March 1993 can be depreciated. They are generally classed as fixed life intangible property (FLIP), as their legal life can reasonably be expected to be the same as their economic life. FLIPs are depreci- ated using the straight line method, calculated by reference to their remaining legal life. 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.6 (November 1993) Legal Decisions - Case Notes This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council.

On a secondary issue it was held that while the objector’s original intention in building a yacht had been to sell it as a business asset it was found to be a domestic asset when it was sold. Conse- quently the proceeds were a capital gain on the costs of construction and not income. 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.6 (November 1993) Facts:(i) Export Incentives The objector’s claim for export incentives was essentially based on the fact that he was engaged in processing metal settings and gemstones (some of which he already had and others which were imported) into finished jewellery for export to Australia and the United Kingdom. The companies in the United Kingdom (C) and Australia (S) which the objector appointed as marketing agents were beneficially owned by him. The principal agents involved in Com- pany C also supplied a large componentry for the jewellery through the compa- nies and eventually purchased the objector’s interest in Company C from him. Inland Revenue maintained that the facts as a whole indicated that the whole arrangement was a sham that had been set up to obtain tax credits. Conse- quently, assessments could be reopened under section 25(2) of the Income Tax Act 1976 after the expiration of four years from the end of the year in which the notice of original assessment was issued. (ii) Yacht The Objector outlined the history of the yacht (its construction, use, his inten- tions for it and treatment in accounts and sale) from 1970 to 1986. The yacht had been treated as a business asset but had become a personal asset. Decision:(i) Export Incentives Judge Willy concluded that the objector had been in the business of manufactur- ing and exporting jewellery. He accepted the objector’s explanation about the operation of the business. He also had regard, amongst other things, to inde- pendent documentary evidence involving the Reserve Bank, New Zealand Customs and the Department of Trade and Industry. His Honour considered that such evidence confirmed the objector’s evidence and established that the transactions were bona fide. Judge Willy also concluded that there was no evi- dence of fraud justifying the reopening of assessments. (ii) Yacht Judge Willy concluded that the objector had shown, on the basis of evidence as a whole, that at the time of sale the yacht was a private recreational asset. The fact that the yacht had continued to be treated as trading stock in the objector’s personal accounts, as opposed to his business accounts, could not justify taxa- tion. This was particularly so given that the objector had never deducted any costs incurred in the construction of the vessel or its depreciation. Comments:Inland Revenue has decided not to appeal this decision because of the particular facts of the case. There is separate policy statement on page 15 that concerns this case. Profits from Subdivision of Land Rating:••• Case:Costello and Costello v. CIR M984/92 & M985/92 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - section 67(4)(e) Keywords:Profits from subdivision, work of a minor nature Summary:The complicated nature of the subdivision scheme and the number of resulting lots meant that the development or division work was not of a minor nature. continued on page 14 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.6 (November 1993) from page 13 Facts:The objectors subdivided a block of flats into nine unit titles for sale. The sole question for consideration by the Court was whether the work involved in the development or subdivision into lots was of a minor nature. Decision:Apart from issuing instructions to lawyers, surveyors, and valuers, the objectors played no part in bringing the scheme to fruition. Subdivision costs incurred totalled approximately $1,800 which comprised lawyer’s and surveyor’s fees. The profits derived from the sale of the nine units totalled approximately $140,000. The objectors submitted that the subdivision work required was of the simplest variety and represented only a small percentage of the cost of the property. Justice Speight referred to the discussions in High Court cases such as Wellington v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,101 and K v CIR (1991) 13 NZTC 8,219. While the amount of the subdivision costs is a factor to be taken into account, and were modest in this case, greater emphasis was placed on the legal and other types of professional services required to complete the subdivision scheme. He noted that there was a complicated series of steps needed to be taken by the lawyer, surveyor, and valuer, and unless each carried out his or her duties accurately the scheme could not have been completed. Finally, the number of resulting lots, when combined with the complicated nature of the scheme, convinced Justice Speight that the work was not of a minor nature. Comments:We do not know whether the taxpayers will be appealing this decision. Loss on Redemption of Preference Shares Rating:•• Case:TRA 91/75 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - sections 65(2)(e) and 106 Keywords:Loss on redemption of preference shares, unrealised loss, sale, disposition Summary:The case concerned whether an unrealised loss on preference shares was deduct- ible from the taxpayer’s assessable income. The TRA found that the shares were acquired for the purpose of sale or disposal for the purposes of section 65(2)(e) and in terms of the principles in Inglis the losses were revenue and deductible. Facts:The taxpayer purchased 27,800 redeemable preference shares in Equiticorp Ltd at an average price of 42 cents per share. The shares were redeemable by the company in 1989 at a par value of 50 cents per share. Between the time of the purchase and the redemption of the shares by the company, it went into liquida- tion and the taxpayer lost his money on the purchase of the shares. The taxpayer claimed a deduction for $12,137.78 as an “unrealised loss”. In an interim decision pending the outcome of Inglis, Judge Willy’s view was that the loss was a loss of capital and therefore prohibited from deduction under section 106(1)(a). Inglis held that if a profit on a share transaction would be assessable under any limb of section 65(2)(e) then the outlay on the transaction is made to revenue account. Inland Revenue argued that the redemption of redeemable preference shares by the issuing company was neither a sale or a disposition by the share- holder. We also argued that a redemption was not a sale or disposition as re- quired by section 65(2)(e). Decision:Judge Willy held that redemption was a “sale” and “disposition” for the pur- poses of the Act. In applying Inglis he held that it was the taxpayer's purpose at the time he purchased the shares to sell or dispose of them to Equiticorp on the 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.6 (November 1993) redemption date. The disposition would have been of a revenue nature and any profit would have been caught by section 65(2)(e). Following Inglis the loss was of a revenue nature and therefore deductible for income tax purposes. Comments:Inland Revenue is appealing this decision. Land Tax Liability of a Charity Case:HC No AP 61/93 Rating:•• Act:Land Tax Act 1976 - Sections 27(1) (j) and 27(1)(o) Keywords:charitable purposes Summary:Land owned by a charity and let to commercial tenants is not exempt from land tax Facts:A school, which operated as a charitable trust, owned land which it let to com- mercial tenants. The rents it received were used for the purposes of the school. Decision:The objector argued that the land was exempt from land tax under either section 27(1)(j) or section 27(1)(o) of the Land Tax Act 1976 in the 1990 and 1991 income years. (Note that the Land Tax Act was repealed as from 31 March 1992.) Land was exempt under section 27(1)(j) if it was used by the charity as a site for the purposes of the charity. Justice Fraser followed the decision in The Trustees of the Dunedin Central Methodist Mission v CIR (1988) 10 NZTC 5006. This decision held that there was a distinction between the receipt of rents from land and the use of land for charitable purposes or purposes wholly ancillary to or directly facilitating those purposes. In this case the land was not used as a site for the purposes of the school as the phrase was interpreted in the Dunedin Central Methodist Mission case. Land was exempt under section 27(1)(o) if it was used for the purposes of a school. The question was whether the wording means all land owned and used by the school, including school buildings and land let to commercial tenants, or whether the exemption was restricted to land used for educational purposes or purposes wholly ancillary to or directly facilitating those purposes. Justice Fraser noted that the wording could be read either way. He held that the legislative history supported the narrower interpretation and that the land was not within the terms of the exemption. Comments:We do not know whether the taxpayer will be appealing this decision. Legal Requirements in Cases of Fraudulent Actions Inland Revenue considers that the TRA has placed an additional requirement to that in section 25(2) of the Income Tax Act. We rely on the Court of Appeal decisions in CIR v Maxwell (No.2) \[1962\] NZLR 683 and CIR v Legarth \[1969\] NZLR 137 in this regard. The onus is on the objector from the outset to prove that s/he did not act fraudulently or file a wilfully misleading return. The only condition that the Commissioner must meet is that his opinion is honestly held. Inland Revenue did not appeal the decision in Taxation Review Authority Case No.92/162 because of the facts of the particular case. (This case is reported on page 12 of this TIB.) However, there are aspects of the decision that we do not accept. The TRA considered that the Commissioner must establish that he had reasonable grounds to form an opinion that the objector has acted fraudulently. This departs from the accepted view that the objector has the onus of proving all facts. 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.6 (November 1993) December 1993 5 PAYE deductions and deduction schedules for last 15 days of November 1993 due - ìlargeî employers only. 7 First instalment of 1994 provisional tax due for taxpayers with August balance dates.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.7 (December 1993) Payment of unclaimed money and Inland Revenue’s role Introduction We are publishing this article to coincide with the release to the media of the names of people identified as being owed money under the Unclaimed Money Act 1971. That release is being made to try and find the owners of the money. A copy of the list released to the media is also available at every Inland Revenue office. The Unclaimed Money Act 1971 (ìthe Actî) has these purposes: ï to ensure that people or organisations who hold funds on behalf of someone else take adequate steps to find the owners of unclaimed deposits and other amounts owing: ï to enable businesses and the personal representatives of deceased people to clear their accounts of un- claimed money: ï to require unclaimed money be paid to the Crown as the custodian for the owner of the funds, with the benefit from the use of the money accruing to the community in the interim: ï to establish a mechanism for the owner to recover the unclaimed money at a future date. The Act applies from 1 June 1971 and sets out the procedures to follow for unclaimed money. It defines unclaimed money and holders of unclaimed money. Generally, money held in an account where there is no activity for 6 consecutive years (or 25 consecutive years, for some deposits) becomes unclaimed money. There are special provisions for amounts of $100 or less. The Act applies to all companies, banks, building societies, insurance offices, money-lenders, auctioneers, real estate agents, accountants, sharebrokers, and motor vehicle dealers that hold defined classes of unclaimed money. There are special provisions where the holder has ceased to carry on business or has died. The Com- missioner of Inland Revenue (ìthe Commissionerî) may also enter into special arrangements to exempt holders from some of the administrative requirements of the Act. The Act does not apply where provisions relating to unclaimed money exist under other legislation, e.g. for solicitors. However, any person or organisation who is not required to comply with the Act may elect to become a holder, and take advantage of the Actís facilities to clear unclaimed money. The Act sets out the obligations of holders and the Commissioner for unclaimed money held on behalf of the owner. Inland Revenue administers the Act on behalf of Treasury. Unclaimed money What is unclaimed money? Unclaimed money falls into three broad groups - deposits of money, life assurance proceeds, and certain types of trade debts. Money only becomes unclaimed money after it has been held for a certain length of time and it is situated in New Zealand. Money unclaimed in another country is generally subject to that countryís law. The following money is treated as unclaimed money for the purposes of the Act: ïFixed term deposits - money (including interest) deposited by the customer to earn interest for a fixed term. The money becomes unclaimed money if the holder has held the money for 6 years after the end of the fixed term. ïDeposits for indefinite periods - money (including interest) deposited by the customer to bear interest for an indefinite period, e.g. an ordinary savings account. The money becomes unclaimed money if the customer has not used the account for 25 years by making a deposit, withdrawing money, or giving written instructions. ïAutomatically renewable fixed term deposits - money (including interest) deposited by the customer to bear interest for a fixed period where the money is automatically reinvested at the end of the term. For example, the customer may give a written standing instruction that the holder should reinvest the deposit on the expiry of each deposit term. This money becomes unclaimed money if the customer has not used the account for 25 years by making a deposit, withdrawing money, or giving written instructions. ïNon-interest bearing current accounts - money deposited by the customer in a current account which does not bear interest. The money becomes unclaimed money if the customer has not used the account for 6 years by making a deposit, withdrawing money, or giving written instructions. If the account is held by a savings bank, the money becomes unclaimed if the customer has not used the account for 25 years. Savings banks include the Post Office Bank Ltd, trustee savings banks, private savings banks, and building societies. ïLife assurance proceeds - money payable on the maturity of a policy of life assurance. This money becomes unclaimed if held by the holder for longer than six years after the earlier of the date that the policy matures (otherwise than by death) or the date continued on page 2 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.7 (December 1993) ïRestricted mandatory holders - there are certain holders (who are not companies) who are only obliged to account for particular kinds of unclaimed money. These holders, and the unclaimed money they must account for, are: Moneylenders - money they have borrowed in the course of the money lending business Auctioneers - the balance of any proceeds of goods sold at auction Real estate agents - money held in the real estate agentís trust account Sharebrokers - money held on behalf of clients Members of the New Zealand Society of Ac- countants - money held on behalf of clients Motor Vehicle Dealers - proceeds a dealer receives when acting as agent. ïVoluntary Holders - any person, firm, body, or institution not included above may elect to be a holder and comply with the provisions of the Act. In addi- tion, any of the restricted holders mentioned above may elect to be a holder of additional money except: - money which they hold as a mandatory holder; and - funds which do not qualify as unclaimed money (e.g. dividends, mutual association rebates, or pension and superannuation fund benefits). Any person (or personal representative) may elect to be a holder where the business has ceased or death has occurred. Before the Commissioner can accept the unclaimed money held by a person who has elected to be a holder, the person must give the Commissioner a copy of the entry in the holderís unclaimed money register. In the case of business cessation or death, the holder must give the Commissioner brief details of the money and its owner. Requirements for holders ï On 1 June each year, holders must enter in an alpha- betical register details of unclaimed money arising in the preceding year. The register must be available for inspection by the public. ï By 30 June each year, the holder must send a letter to each owner (at the last known address), providing details of the unclaimed money. ï By 30 September each year, the holder must advise the Commissioner of the entries made in the register. ï If the money is not claimed by the owner, the holder must pay it to the Commissioner according to the requirements set out below. ï The holder must make an election for amounts not exceeding $100 for any one owner according to the requirements set out below. from page 1 that it matures due to death. The holder only needs to have reason to suppose that the policy has matured due to death. The holder does not need to ensure that the death is legally proved, even if this is a condition of the life assurance policy itself. For example, if a policy holder disappears while swimming, the 6 year period starts to run from the date of the probable drowning, although the death may not be legally presumed until later. ïTrade debts and other money - any other money which has been owing by a person who is defined as a ìholderî (explained below). Examples of money which falls into this group include trade debts, wages, and unpresented cheques. This money becomes unclaimed money if it has been owing for 6 years after the due date for payment. What is not unclaimed money? Three types of money can never become unclaimed money (except where the holder or person owing the money ceases business - see discussion below). These are: ï Dividends - This exclusion does not apply to divi- dends payable by mutual associations if the dividends are effectively interest on membersí contributions or deposits. ï Mutual association rebates - This exclusion applies to rebates on store trading payable by mutual associa- tions to their members. Interest on membersí contri- butions or deposits can become unclaimed money. ï Benefits payable from a pension or superannuation fund. Other legislation The Unclaimed Money Act does not override any special provisions for the treatment of unclaimed money which are contained in any other act. Acts which include such special provisions include: ï The Law Practitioners Act 1982 ï The Companies Act 1955 and the Companies Act 1993 (liquidations) ï The Innkeepers Act 1962 ï The Public Trust Office Act 1957 Holders Who is a holder? Holders of unclaimed money fall into one of the follow- ing three groups: ïGeneral mandatory holders - these are companies, banks, building societies, and insurance offices. General holders are liable to account for all classes of unclaimed money. 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.7 (December 1993) Payment of unclaimed money The money is payable to the Crown through the Com- missioner when: ï The money is deemed to be unclaimed money; and ï It has been held unclaimed for the required number of years (6 years or 25 years as applicable); and ï It is held by a holder. The holder of unclaimed money in any year ending on 31 May, where either the money has not been paid to or claimed by the owner by 30 September, must pay the money to the Commissioner by 31 October. Where the holder pays unclaimed money to the Commissioner in accordance with the Act, the holder has no further liability to anyone who claims the money. Amounts of $100 or less There are special provisions to overcome the expense of handling small amounts of unclaimed money that do not exceed $100 for any one owner. A holder can choose within twelve months after the end of the 6 year or 25 year period not to search out owners and not to pay the unclaimed money to the Crown. The money ceases to be unclaimed money. The holder can apply the amount for personal benefit or for the benefit of any other person or for any purpose or object. The owner can still claim the money from the holder in the future. Where the holder has ceased business or died Where a business ceases or a death occurs, money that has been held unclaimed for six months after cessation or death may be paid to the Crown to hold as custodian. This applies to money which: ï would become unclaimed money when the time limits expired; or ï would have become unclaimed money if it had not been one of these items: - dividends - a rebate from a mutual association to members in relation to trading transactions - benefits payable from any pension or superan- nuation fund. This is an option that will assist in the early clearing of books, and is available to anyone who ceases business or in the event of death. Inland Revenue's role The Commissioner administers the Act on behalf of Treasury. All unclaimed money received is paid into the Consolidated Account. The Act provides that all Inland Revenue officers must maintain secrecy about all information obtained in administering the Act. Inland Revenue only communicates such information for the purpose of administering the Act. There is one excep- tion to this strict secrecy requirement; the Commis- sioner may make available for publication the names of owners and amounts of unclaimed money paid to the Commissioner. Examination of register The Commissioner may authorise officers to examine at any time any register kept by a holder and any accounts of the holder that relate to unclaimed money. The officer may require the holder to correct any errors in the register. Special arrangements The Commissioner may enter into a special arrange- ment in writing to exempt any holder or class of holder from these obligations: ï keeping an unclaimed money register ï notifying owners (although this particular exemption would be rare) ï supplying register entry copies to the Commissioner ï paying unclaimed money to the Commissioner by 31 October where no person has established a valid claim by 30 September. Repayment of money If a claimant establishes a valid claim for unclaimed money paid to the Crown, the Commissioner will repay the money out of the Consolidated Account. A claimant must satisfy the Commissioner that he or she is the owner of the money. There are no specific rules as to what is satisfactory evidence of ownership. In some cases it may be necessary to consult the former holder. For example, Inland Revenue might consult a former holder such as an insurance company or bank, for comparison of signatures or other evidence. Where the Commissioner pays money to a claimant and another person later claims to be the owner the Com- missioner is not responsible for repayment. The second claimant may have a claim against the first claimant. Offences It is an offence for a holder to wilfully or negligently fail to comply with the Act. Where the holder is a company, both the company and the executive officer who author- ised or permitted the failure are open to prosecution. The Court can impose a fine of up to $500 upon convic- tion for each offence.

The Act's main purpose is to assist in retaining Maori land (comprising Maori customary land and Maori freehold land) in Maori ownership. The Act generally governs the ownership of Maori land (especially restrictions on its transfer) and its management. It consolidates and reforms Maori land law and replaces the Maori Affairs Act 1953 and various amendment Acts. The major topics covered by the Maori Land Act 1993 are: ï The constitution and role of the Maori Land Court. ï The classification of all land in New Zealand for the purposes of the Act. The main categories are Maori land, general land, and Crown land. ï Restrictions on the transfer of ownership (alienation) of Maori land. ï Provision for the establishment of different types of trusts. ï Continued provision for Maori incorporations. ï Administration of the estates of individual Maori. This article deals with the tax implications of the Maori Land Act 1993. It provides an explanation of the Actís provisions only where this is necessary to discuss the Actís tax implications. Te Puni Kokiri (Ministry of Maori Development) has published extensive back- ground material on the Act which gives a detailed description of what the Act does generally. Trusts Five types of land holding trusts are established under the Act. These trusts are generally designed to limit the further fragmentation of Maori land titles by limiting rights of succession (i.e., inheritance) in certain cases. Note that while these trusts hold the legal title in the land, the individual Maori beneficiaries of the trust retain beneficial ownership of the land. The five types of trusts are: ïPutea Trusts - These may be established to deal with interests in Maori land or general land owned by Maori, or shares in a Maori incorporation. They are designed to deal with small land holdings which have become difficult to administer as separate interests. Future succession is prevented, and the assets and income are to be used for Maori community purposes. ïWhanau Trusts - These trusts are available to consoli- date the land (both Maori land and general land owned by Maori) or Maori incorporation shareholdings of Maori families. The assets and income of these trusts are to be used for the benefit of the descendants of the tipuna (ancestor) named in the court order constituting the trust. As with putea trusts, it is not possible to succeed to any interests held by whanau trusts. ïAhu Whenua Trusts - These trusts are designed to promote and facilitate the use and administration of land in the interests of the Maori beneficial owners. Unlike putea or whanau trusts, the establishment of an ahu whenua trust does not affect succession to the beneficial ownersí interests. Trusts created under section 438 of the former Maori Affairs Act 1953 will continue under the Maori Land Act 1993 as ahu whenua trusts. The trust assets are held for the beneficial owners of the land in proportion to their interests in the land. ïWhenua Topu Trusts - These trusts can be established to hold all or a substantial part of the land owned by members of an iwi or hapu. Assets and income of these trusts are held for Maori community purposes for the general benefit of the members of the iwi or hapu. Succession rights under these trusts are re- stricted. ïKai Tiaki Trusts - These trusts may be established for minors or for adults who cannot manage their busi- ness affairs because of disability. They can be estab- lished to hold any interests in Maori land or general land owned by Maori, any shares in a Maori incorp- oration, or any personal property. Rights of succession to any property held by these trusts are preserved. An application to the Maori Land Court is necessary to establish any trust under the Act. Trusteesí powers and obligations are contained in the trust order made by the Court establishing a particular trust. All trusts are subject to regular review by the Maori Land Court. Tax effect of charitable status approval Under section 245 of the Act the trustees of any trust established under the Act may apply to the Court for an order that they hold any part of the trustís income on trust for such charitable purposes as are specified in the Court order. The Court may only make such an order if it is satisfied that: ï the beneficiaries of the trust have had sufficient notice of the proposal and sufficient opportunity to discuss and consider it; and ï there is a sufficient degree of support for the proposal among the beneficiaries of the trust. Only those trusts approved under section 245 (ìsection 245 trustsî) which are, in fact, charitable at general law will be entitled to the various taxation benefits accorded to charities. Section 245 of the Act is an enabling provision only. Without this provision the Maori Land Court would not 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.7 (December 1993) be authorised to allow trustees to hold any part of the trust income on trust for charitable purposes. Section 245 does not deem any income derived by an approved trust to be held for charitable purposes for the purposes of the Inland Revenue Acts, regardless of whether the trustís purposes are in fact charitable at general law. Inland Revenue will apply its usual criteria, (see Technical Rulings Chapter 53, or our ìCharitable Organisationsî booklet - IR†255) when determining whether a section 245 trust will receive charitable status for Inland Revenue Act purposes. Briefly, a trust must meet all of these requirements to gain charitable status for Inland Revenue Act purposes: ï It must have a charitable purpose at general law. ï It must not be carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual; ï If it is wound up, it must have provision in its rules for its assets to be given to another charity with terms at least as strict as the donor charity. ï It must have no power to amend its rules to detract from the above charitable requirements. The definition of ìcharitable purposeî in section 2 of the Income Tax Act 1976 equates with the general law definition of charitable purpose because it utilises the four main classes of charitable purpose identified by Lord McNaughton in Pemselís Case \[1891\] AC 531. These four classes or heads of charitable purpose are the relief of poverty, the advancement of education, the advancement of religion, and other purposes beneficial to the community. Inland Revenue must therefore use the general law criteria as to what constitutes a charit- able trust when we determine whether a particular trust is charitable for Inland Revenue Act purposes. The law relating to charities contains a number of requirements (mainly developed by the courts) which ensure that trusts which are of an inherently private nature do not qualify as charitable trusts. Every charit- able trust (except trusts for the relief of poverty) must satisfy the public benefit rule, i.e., it must be directed to the benefit of the public or a sufficient section of the public, and not for the private benefit of particular individuals. It is unlikely that section 245 trusts established by whanau trusts would be accepted by Inland Revenue as having a charitable status unless they had a relief of poverty purpose. This is because these trusts are inher- ently of a private nature so they would not satisfy the public benefit rule. On the other hand, section 245 trusts established by whenua topu (iwi) trusts could satisfy the public benefit rule if Inland Revenue considered them to be directed to the benefit of a sufficient section of the public. For example, a section 245 trust with an educa- tion purpose (an accepted charitable purpose) set up for the benefit of members of a major tribe such as the Ngati Porou would satisfy the public benefit test as it would be directed to the benefit of a sufficient section of the public. Charitable trusts enjoy certain advantages under the Income Tax Act. Section 61(25) exempts from tax income (except business income) derived by a charitable trust which is not carried on for the private benefit of any individual. Section 61(27) exempts from tax income derived by a charitable trust from any business carried on by or on behalf of or for the benefit of it. There are a number of other taxation advantages enjoyed by charit- able trusts under other Inland Revenue Acts. Charitable status of Maori community purposes The assets and income of putea and whenua topu (iwi) trusts must be held in trust for Maori community purposes. The issue arises whether Maori community purposes qualify as charitable purposes at general law (and therefore for Inland Revenue Act purposes). Maori community purposes are defined in section 218 of the Act. While some of these listed purposes would be charitable at general law (e.g., those relating to the promotion of health and education) others would not be (e.g., the provision of loans for industries and especially subsection (2)(d): ìSuch other or additional purposes as the trustees with the approval of the Court from time to time determineî). It is a requirement of charitable trust law that the purposes of a trust need to be wholly charitable for the trust to have a charitable status, so putea and whenua topu trusts would not be accorded a charitable status for tax purposes. However, if putea or whenua trusts themselves establish section 245 trusts whose designated purposes were only those specific Maori community purposes in section 218 (which are in fact charitable at general law) then Inland Revenue would accept these section 245 trusts as having a charitable status if they also satisfy the public benefit rule. Maori incorporations Maori incorporations are established by order of the Maori Land Court. The effect of the order of incorpora- tion is to vest only the legal title in Maori land in the incorporation. The beneficial ownership of the land remains with the shareholders in the Maori incorpora- tion. The incorporation holds the legal title to the land on trust for the shareholders. Previously, Maori incorp- orations held both the legal and beneficial interest in the land that they owned. Under the new Act owners in a Maori incorporation will hold a direct interest in the land. The ownersí link to the land will therefore be maintained. Maori incorporations have wider powers under the new Act (more like those of standard companies) to operate commercially in the best interests of their shareholders. The law no longer restricts incorporations to certain activities. continued on page 6 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.7 (December 1993) Estate duty payable on succession to Maori land Although estate duty has been abolished on the estates of people dying on or after 17 December 1992, section 105 of the Act remains relevant for estate duty payable on the estates of Maori who died before 17 December 1992. This provision enables the Registrar of the Maori Land Court, on the application by the administrator of an estate, to certify for the purposes of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 the value of any undivided interest in Maori freehold land if the value of the interest does not in the Registrarís opinion exceed $15,000. The dutiable estate of a deceased person does not include any interest in land set apart under section 338 of the Act as a Maori reservation. Conveyance duty payable on vesting orders The Maori Land Court may make vesting orders to transfer any Maori freehold land to any person to whom the land is entitled to be transferred under the Act. Section 168 provides for the payment of conveyance duty on the making of a vesting order in accordance with the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. On making a vesting order, the Maori Land Court must determine the value of the land. If the value of the land is determined to be $6,000 or less the vesting order will be exempt from conveyance duty. If the value of the land comprised in the vesting order exceeds $6,000, conveyance duty is payable. This duty must be paid into Court, and a vesting order cannot be issued until the duty is paid. Conveyance duty is not payable on vesting orders which merely vest the land in the persons beneficially entitled to it (or in someone acting in a representative capacity for the beneficial owners). Late GST return filers could be prosecuted More than 22,000 people who have failed to send in their GST returns received final reminders from Inland Revenue recently. These people have failed to put in over 54,000 GST returns, and they will get no further warnings before Inland Revenue begins prosecution action. We sent reminder letters to people in June, and have also been in contact with them since then. As a result, the number of outstanding GST returns has gone down from 74,000 to 54,000. Inland Revenue will now concentrate on the hard core who have continued to ignore their responsibilities. People who have received letters recently should respond immediately to avoid prosecution action. In a recent court case a taxpayer with GST returns outstanding was fined more than $40,000. from page 5 Maori incorporations established under previous legislation now operate under the provisions of the new Act. Tax effect of charitable trust declaration Under section 258 of the Act a Maori incorporation may, by special resolution, declare that it shall possess any part of its property, or the income derived from any part of its property, on trust for charitable purposes. Again only those trusts established under section 258 (which are, in fact, charitable at general law - and therefore for the purposes of the Inland Revenue Acts) will be entitled to the taxation benefits accorded to charities. Section 258 (as is section 245 in relation to Maori trusts) is merely an enabling provision. In the absence of this provision a Maori incorporation would not be authorised to declare that it held any of its income on trust for charitable purposes. The fact that a Maori incorporation has declared a charitable trust under section 258 does not deem the trust to have a charitable purpose for the purposes of the Inland Revenue Acts. Inland Revenue will apply its usual criteria when determining whether a trust established under section 258 should have a charitable status for tax purposes. The statements above relating to charitable trusts approved under section 245 apply equally to charitable trusts declared by Maori incorporations under section 258. Taxation of Maori trusts and incorporations All Maori trusts and incorporations established or operating under the Maori Land Act would come within the Maori authority definition in section 234 of the Income Tax Act 1976. They would therefore be taxed according to the terms of sections 234 to 240 (Maori authority taxation provisions) of the Income Tax Act. 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.7 (December 1993) Questions We’ve Been Asked This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that we've answered. We've published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received.

Section 16 of the Student Loans Act 1992 states that section 9 of the Income Tax Act 1976 applies to student loan borrowers. Section 9 requires every taxpayer to file a tax return. A tax return is not required where the taxpayer is a pay period taxpayer under section 357(2) Income Tax Act 1976. However, a student who has an IRD loan balance at any time during the year is excluded from being a pay period tax- payer and therefore must file a tax return. If the borrower is a non-resident for the full year, for Student Loan purposes a tax return is not required as the repayment obligation will be based on the amount of the loan balance, rather than the borrower’s assessable income, if any. Extra emolument - PAYE deducted at 28 cents per dollar Section 50D Low Income Rebate: A restaurant employee was paid a bonus which was to be taxed at the extra emolument rate of 28 cents in the dollar (excluding earner premium). The employer stated that when the employee filed a tax return, there would be a refund of 4 cents in the dollar because the employ- ee’s assessable income would be taxed at 24 cents in the dollar at the end of the year. This is incorrect. When PAYE is deducted, an allowance for the expected low income rebate is calculated based on the income. When an extra emolument is paid, the income is increased while the allowance for the rebate by way of re- duced PAYE will not have changed. Taxing the extra emolument at 28 cents in the dollar compensates for the 4 cent rebate reduction and the 24 cent end of year tax rate where the employee’s income is $9,500 or greater. The low income rebate reduces as assessable income gets closer to $30,875. Example An employee has wages of $20,391 with PAYE of $4,472.52. The employee receives a bonus of $2,000 with PAYE @ 28% = $560 Tax to pay before the bonus would be as follows: Tax on 20,391 @ 24%$4,893.84 Less low income rebate$419.36 Less PAYE $4,472.52 Tax to pay$1.96 Tax to pay after the bonus is paid will be as follows: Tax on 22,391.00 @ 24%$5,373.84 Less low income rebate$339.36 Less PAYE (4,472.52 + 560.00)$5,032.52 Tax to pay$1.96 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.7 (December 1993) Request for donee status Section 56A(2) Qualifying Gifts: An organisation has asked if it meets the criteria to be an approved donee organisation. Money donated to the organisa- tion is applied to the preservation of natural forests around the world. Section 56A(2)(a) of the Act requires that the donations made to the organisation be applied wholly or principally within New Zealand, and that no individual should benefit from the organisation. As funds are applied overseas, approval can not be given. Should the organisation wish to set up a separate fund for exclusive use within New Zealand, approval could be reconsidered. Section 56A(2) also lists organisations whose funds are not applied wholly or principally within New Zealand. Any donations to these organisations will still qualify for the donations rebate. The list includes such organisations as the Red Cross and The Save the Children Fund. Organisations can be specifically added to section 56A(2)(a) by way of a legislative amendment. Donations rebate - donations must be in money Section 56A(2) - Qualifying Gifts: An unpaid volunteer works for a local charity in his spare time. He asked if he could claim the donations rebate on the esti- mated value of his time spent there. The value of time spent at the organisation will not qualify for the donations rebate. Section 56A(2) provides that qualifying gifts can only be made in “money” which excludes time and effort or donated goods. Confirmation of charitable status Section 61(25) Charity: A trust was formed by a church group with approved charitable status. They now wished to confirm that the trust would also be charitable for the purposes of section 61(25) of the Act. Provided the newly-formed trust conforms to the rules of the parent body and is under its ultimate control, the trust will enjoy the same tax exemptions as the parent. In this instance, a letter of assurance stating that the trust is subject to the parent’s rules will satisfy Inland Revenue that the trust is also charitable. Disabled people’s tax free earnings Section 61(53) - Disabled Persons: A taxpayer involved in establishing work- shops for disabled people has asked whether the income earned by the partici- pants in the workshop will be taxable. Section 61(53) of the Act provides that where a disabled person earns $50 or less on average per week and the employment undertaken is for the therapeutic benefit to the person at a “sheltered workshop”, the income is exempt from income tax. To qualify for the exemption, the workshop must be a sheltered workshop within the meaning of the Disabled Persons Employment Promotion Act 1960. Generally, this will be where the object is the care, treatment, and rehabilitation of disabled persons. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue may approve a “sheltered workshop” if it meets similar criteria. 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.7 (December 1993) Ministry of Defence personnel stationed in an operational area Section 64 - Exemption From Tax of Pay of Serviceman in Operational Areas: An army officer has asked if the pay received while on a peacekeeping mission was exempt from income tax. The request for personnel was made by the United Nations to the New Zealand Government. An exemption from income tax under section 64 on salary and wages applies to the pay of service personnel when the area in which they are posted is declared to be an operational area. The declaration is made jointly by the Prime Minister, the Minister of Defence and the Minister of Finance. As to date, no such declara- tion has been made, and therefore the salary paid by the Ministry of Defence is not exempted from tax. Subsidised mortgage where employee on transfer Section 65 - Items included in Assessable Income: An employer was consider- ing the tax implications of a mortgage subsidy paid to an employee. Where the employer pays a subsidy to the employee or pays a subsidy to the lending institution on behalf of the employee, the payment will be treated as monetary remuneration under section 65(2)(b) of the Act. Tax deductions must be made from all amounts that constitute monetary remuneration. The amounts paid by the employer are also tax deductible. Where the employer is liable for loan repayments with the lending institution, or where the employer loans money at a reduced interest rate to the employee, fringe benefit tax applies. Value of board and lodging when extra pay received Section 72 - Value of Board, Lodging and House Allowances: An employee assessed for the value of board and lodging supplied by his employer asked if the value assessed on an annual basis should be proportionately increased when there is an additional pay in the year. The employer and Inland Revenue had mutually agreed that the value of accom- modation supplied to each employee be assessed at $4,000 per annum. The employer had therefore included $153.84 ($4,000/26 pays) in each fort- nightly pay of the employees for two years. In the 1993 tax year, 27 pays were made so that $4,153.68 ($153.84 x 27 pays) would be included in the gross tax- able income amount on the IR 12. Where Inland Revenue has agreed to the value of a taxable allowance on a per annum basis, the amount of the taxable allowance (in this example $4,000) is unaltered, regardless of the number of pays. Therefore the employer should not have included the housing allowance in the 27th pay of the year. CFC and FIF regimes: effect of grey list Section 245P - Controlled Foreign Companies in Certain Countries: A New Zealand company was expanding into Asia. The company wanted to know if the countries in which it wanted to operate could be included on the “grey list’ of countries - a list of countries whose resident companies are exempt (with certain 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.7 (December 1993) exceptions) from the attribution requirements of the controlled foreign company (CFC) and foreign investment fund (FIF) regimes. New Zealand residents are not required to attribute to themselves under the CFC or FIF regimes the income of companies resident in grey list countries in which they have interests. The grey list countries, listed in the Fifteenth Sched- ule to the Income Tax Act, are currently: Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. There are two exceptions to the general grey list exemption. First, companies which enjoy the benefit of certain tax concessions in grey list countries, set out in the sixteenth schedule, are still subject to the attribution requirements of the CFC regime. Secondly, the interests of New Zealand residents in superannuation schemes constituted in grey list countries or in life insurance policies entered into in grey list counties remain subject to the FIF regime. The Government announced in its 1992 Budget that it would keep the grey list under active review. It also announced the following criteria for grey list inclu- sion, all of which a country must satisfy before it is included: • It must have strong anti-avoidance rules, such as its own CFC or FIF regimes. • It must impose on resident companies an average effective tax rate on their income that is not less than 85% of the average effective tax rate that is im- posed by New Zealand tax law on New Zealand companies in any income year. • It must have a tax treaty with New Zealand. • It must have a tax base similar to that of New Zealand. • Its income and expense recognition rules should be no more favourable than those of New Zealand. • It should have few or no tax incentives, other than those that may be specified in the Sixteenth Schedule. Double Taxation Agreement - Vietnam Section 293(2) - Credit for Tax Paid Overseas: A New Zealand resident com- pany has been operating a business in Vietnam through a subsidiary. As there is no double taxation agreement with Vietnam the company was concerned about being subject to double taxation and asked whether a double taxation agreement with Vietnam was envisaged. There are no current proposals for a double taxation agreement to be negotiated between New Zealand and Vietnam. However, most double taxation is elimi- nated by the operation of the unilateral tax credit provision in section 293(2) of the Income Tax Act. This provision allows a New Zealand resident a tax credit for foreign tax paid which is substantially of the same nature as New Zealand income tax or non-resident withholding tax. Accordingly, the New Zealand company can claim a credit for withholding taxes paid in Vietnam on dividends, interest and royalties. The amount of the credit for foreign tax paid is limited to the lesser of the for- eign tax paid or the New Zealand tax payable on the relevant item of foreign income. The amount of New Zealand tax payable is determined by the following formula: Foreign income itemxtotal New Zealand tax payable Total income continued on page 12 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.7 (December 1993) The New Zealand company may also be eligible for a credit for company taxes paid by the subsidiary in Vietnam to the extent that: (a) it is attributed with the income of the subsidiary under the controlled foreign company regime; or (b) it receives a dividend from the subsidiary and claims a credit under the underlying foreign tax credit regime. Pension liable for National Superannuitant Surcharge Section 336D - Determination of Other Income: A taxpayer asked if half of the pension he received was liable for National Superannuitant Surcharge. The pension was paid directly to him from a previous employer. The assump- tion that half would be liable to surcharge was incorrect, because the pension was not paid from a scheme with the approval of the Government Actuary. Therefore, the full amount of the pension would be liable for surcharge and the pension would be liable for income tax. Only pensions paid from a registered superannuation scheme are paid tax-free to the recipient (the superannuation scheme pays the tax) and only half is liable to the surcharge. National Superannuitant’s surcharge payment method Section 336G - Election by National Superannuitant in respect of Payment of Surcharge: A superannuitant received income from National Superannuation and interest or dividends, and expected to be liable for surcharge. She asked which method she had to use to pay surcharge - either a special tax code or by provisional tax payments. The payment method to use is determined by the source from which the income is expected to be derived. In this case where the other income is from interest and dividends only, the superannuitant must elect that payment be made by either provisional tax payments or by requesting a surcharge deduction from the National Superannuation. Inland Revenue will calculate the surcharge deduction rate. If a superannuitant will derive other income from salary and wages only, he or she must pay the surcharge either by having it deducted from National Superan- nuation, or by using a SAJ, MAJ or MIN tax deduction code for the salary or wages. If a superannuitant's other income is made up of both salary and wages and other income (such as interest, rents, business profits etc), he or she can elect either to have the surcharge deducted from National Superannuation, or elect both methods - provisional tax payments and a SAJ, MAJ or MIN deduction codes on the salary or wages. The exception to the rule (section 336LA) is for National Superannuitants who are also Student Loan borrowers. They cannot use the SAJ, MAJ, or MIN codes; instead they must have a special tax code so that both surcharge and loan repay- ment deductions will be made from salary and wage income. from page 11 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.7 (December 1993) Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 GST on gift vouchers Section 10(16) Token, Stamp etc and 10(17) Redemption of Token, Stamp, etc: The taxpayer who wished to sell gift vouchers asked about any GST implica- tions. Where the voucher has a face value that is equal to or greater than the amount paid, GST will be charged when the voucher is redeemed and not at the time of purchase. Where the voucher has a face value that is less than the amount paid, GST will be charged at the time of sale on the difference between the amount paid and the voucher’s face value. When the voucher is redeemed GST will be payable on the face value. Where there is no face value stated on the voucher, (e.g., a milk token) GST will be payable at the time of purchase of the voucher and not when it is redeemed. GST treatment on licence granted to non-resident Section 11(2) - Zero-rated services: A non-resident manufacturer was granted a licence to use a manufacturing technique developed in New Zealand. The non- resident has asked if GST would be payable on payment for the licence. Section 11(2)(fa)(i) permits zero-rating on services for various intellectual prop- erty, including the granting of licences. This is subject to the condition that the services are to be supplied to a person who is not resident in New Zealand and is outside New Zealand when the services are performed. In this case, the New Zealand company will charge GST at the rate of zero per- cent. Application for buyer-created tax invoice Section 24(2) - Invoice Created by Recipient: A company purchases supplies from regular suppliers. It has advised that it is in a better position to issue in- voices, rather than have the seller issue them. Where such a case arises, the purchaser can request approval from Inland Rev- enue to be allowed to issue buyer-created tax invoices. Inland Revenue’s conditions of approval are: • Both parties must agree that the supplier will not issue a tax invoice for the supply. • Both parties must keep a copy of the tax invoice. • The words “buyer-created tax invoice - IRD approved” must be included in the invoice. Buyer created invoices must also comply with all the requirements of section 24(3). This means they must contain all these items: • the words “tax invoice” in a prominent place • the name and registration number of the supplier of the goods, i.e., not the person who generates the tax invoice continued on page 14 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.7 (December 1993) • the name and address of the recipient, i.e., the purchaser • the date on which the tax invoice is issued • a description of the goods and services supplied • the quantity or volume of the goods and services supplied • either - the value of the goods and services and the amount of tax charged, or - the tax inclusive price and a statement that it includes the tax. Note that Inland Revenue will not automatically approve an application and approval may be withheld if the registered person has a poor compliance record. Approval once given may be revoked if the conditions of consent have not been complied with. Child Support Act 1991 Request for Child Support declined - not NZ resident Section 5 - Children who qualify for Child Support: A custodial parent has asked why Child Support is not payable for her children. The custodian and her child live and have always lived in Australia, while the non-custodian is a New Zealand resident. Only children who are New Zealand citizens or ordinarily resident in New Zealand will qualify for Child Support. In this case, as the children are not New Zealand residents the non-custodial parent is not required to make contributions under the Act. Estimating Child Support income Section 44 - Reconciliation of estimated and actual taxable income after end of year Child Support year: A liable parent estimated his income for the 1994 year. He asked what will happen if the estimate is incorrect. When he files his 1994 tax return, the assessment previously based on his esti- mated income will be recalculated using the actual income from the 1994 return. If an additional Child Support payment is required, it will be due within 30 days from the date of the assessment. An underestimation penalty and daily interest will also be charged if the estimated Child Support liability is less than 80% of the actual liability. Exemption for prisoners Section 73 - Application for exemption by prisoner or hospital patient: A prison inmate advised that he cannot pay his Child Support liability and asked that his liability for Child Support be held over until he comes out of prison. He expects to resume family life when he is released. If the prisoner is still married or living in the nature of marriage, (the fact that he is in prison may not alter the marriage status) an application for Child Support will not be accepted. This is because the custodian will not be an eligible custo- dian under section 8(2)(b) of the Act, as she will still be living in the nature of marriage. from page 13 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.7 (December 1993) Where the prisoner is not married or living in the nature of marriage, then an exemption may apply for the period of imprisonment, provided that the pris- oner has no assessable income, or assessable income from investments of $520 or less for the full tax year. The exemption must be requested in writing, and ceases on the earlier of the day on which any assessable income except income from investments, or investment income exceeding $520 is earned. When the exemption ceases as a result of one of these income tests, the prisoner is liable for the full Child Support year, under section 75(2) of the Act. Child Support payment required when assessment under objection Section 95 - Obligation to Pay Child Support Where Objection Made: A liable parent has asked why payment is being pursued when there is a valid objection to the Child Support assessment. Child Support liability can only be suspended because of an impending appeal where the grounds are that the liable parent is not a parent of the child. In this case any liability is suspended until the date that the Family Court makes its determination of the appeal. Where an objection has not been finally deter- mined, the objector may apply to the Family Court for an order under section 117 of the Act for suspension of liability. If the objector loses the objection, the liability becomes payable on the original due date unless the Family Court considers that time to pay should be allowed for special reasons. Departure order from formula assessment Sections 104 and 105 - Application for departure from formula assessment in special circumstances: A non-custodial parent who is liable for Child Support payments of $150 per week asked under what circumstances it would be permis- sible to apply to the Family Court for a departure order from the formula assess- ment. Either parent can make an application. The Family Court must take into account the following circumstances before deciding to adjust any part of a formula assessment: • Whether either parent’s capacity to provide financial support is significantly reduced because of special circumstances such as: - a duty to maintain any other child or person, or - the special needs of any other child or person, or - commitments in supporting himself or herself or any other child or person. • Whether the costs of maintaining the child are significantly affected in special circumstances because: - the cost of access to the child is greater than 5% of the Child Support income, or - the child has special needs, or - the child is being cared for, educated, or trained in a manner expected by either parent. continued on page 16 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.7 (December 1993) • That the formula assessment would be unfair because of special circumstances such as: - the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of parents or child, or - any previous payments or property settlements, or - the continued occupancy by the custodian of the family home. Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 Base interest write-off Section 41 - Periods in Which Interest Write-Off and Interest Reduction Apply: A borrower’s income was less than the repayment threshold - $12,670 for 1993. Consequently, his repayment obligation in his 1993 tax return was calculated at zero. The borrower wanted to know why he was not entitled to a base interest write-off. An interest write-off is allowable when the base interest charged is greater than the repayment obligation. However, a write-off is not allowable in the income year in which a loan has been transferred to Inland Revenue for collection. In this case, the loan related to the 1992 academic year and was transferred to Inland Revenue to administer on 28 February 1993. Therefore a write off is not allowable in the 1993 income year. Note: The interest rate for 1994 is 7.2 % This is made up of 6.2 % base interest (the cost of borrowing to Government) and 1.0 % Consumer Price Index adjust- ment. It is the base interest component only that may qualify for write off. Repayment deductions Section 49(1)(b) - Dates on Which Payments Deemed to be Credited: A bor- rower was concerned that amounts deducted by the employer are not credited to the borrower’s account on a timely basis. The Student Loan account attracts interest on a daily basis. Example: Deductions from salary or wages paid in January 1994 are required to be paid by 20 February 1994, along with the PAYE deductions. Under section 49(1)(b) of the Act, all repayment deductions credited to a Student Loan account are effectively credited on the 15th day of the month for which the deduction was made. In the above case, a deduction would be treated as re- ceived on 15 January 1994. This means that although the client’s account is charged daily interest up until the date the credit is paid to the account (say 20 February), when the amount is credited a new interest calculation will take into account the payment based on it being available on 15 January, not the date of actual payment. Student Loan repayment deferral Section 54 - Commissioner may refrain from collecting Repayment Obligation: The borrower was finding it difficult to repay his Student Loan and wanted to know if the repayment threshold ($12,670 for 1993 tax return) could be increased in order to reduce his repayment liability. from page 15 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.7 (December 1993) When the borrower earns more than the repayment threshold, the loan is paid back at 10% of the excess. The threshold is set annually at a level to ensure that a loan will be repaid within an acceptable time frame, and that a borrower has sufficient income to meet basic living expenses. Where the borrower is experi- encing serious financial hardship relief can be given, not by changing the thresh- old but under section 54 of the Act. This section allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to defer the borrower’s repayment obligations. Note that where repayment obligations have been deferred interest continues to accrue on the outstanding balance. Requests for deferral are considered by Debt Management staff at Inland Rev- enue offices. Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 Gift duty not affected by repeal of estate duty A donor asked if the repeal of estate duty had any implications on gift duty. Estate duty was lifted from the estates of people who died on or after 17 Decem- ber 1992. This will not affect gift duty. Details of any aggregated gifts made in excess of $12,000 within any twelve month period must be supplied to Inland Revenue on form IR 635. Duty is payable when the value exceeds $27,000 within any twelve month period. Receiving the TIB - have you replied?

FBT - prescribed interest rate reduced The prescribed rate of interest used to calculate the fringe benefit value of low interest employment-related loans has been lowered to 7.8% for the quarter starting on 1†October 1993. This new rate will apply to all subsequent quarters unless it is later amended. The rate reduction reflects the market interest rates during the quarter. The prescribed rate was previously 8.5% for the quarter starting 1†July 1993. 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.7 (December 1993) Legal Decisions - Case Notes This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council.

Rating:••• Case:CIR v Henwood HC Wellington AP 117/92 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:restraint of trade, capital, income Summary:Payments were made to an actor under a television commercial contract. The actor agreed not to endorse or promote any other type of competitive product. Upon appeal to the High Court, Judge McGechan held that the payments were assessable income and not capital. Facts:The taxpayer, a well-known actor, entered into a contract with an advertising agency to appear in two television commercials for a client of the agency. Under the contract, the taxpayer agreed not to participate in New Zealand in any other promotion for products similar or in competition with those advertised in the commercials. The contract stated that the payments made by the advertising agency were consideration for this agreement but did not specifically quantify the amount of consideration. After completion of the commercials, the taxpayer received $25,000 in the first income year the commercials were screened and $17,500 in the second year. The Taxation Review Authority held that both payments, less $5,000 acting fee, were clearly capital in nature. 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.7 (December 1993) Decision:In the High Court, Judge McGechan looked at what the payments were intended to achieve from a business and practical point of view. His Honour concluded that the payments were for acting services and not for a restrictive covenant. Two features of the case pointed to this conclusion. First, the payment to the taxpayer related to his special acting persona. Second, there was no realistic danger that a competitor would employ the taxpayer due to the unique format of the commercials. Therefore, the High Court held that the payments were assessable income. The court distinguished the early authorities on the assessability of restrictive cov- enant payments. In the earlier cases, the agreements typically specifically quanti- fied the consideration referrable to the restraint of trade. Comments:The taxpayer had not lodged an appeal when this item went to print in early December. Payments to employees who relocate Rating:••• Case:Shell New Zealand Limited v CIR HC Wellington AP 153/92 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - section 338(1) Keywords:Lump sum payments, transfer of employees, housing assistance, source deduction payments, salary and wages, extra emoluments Summary:Certain lump sum payments made by the company to employees were held to be made in relation to the employment of the employees. As a result, the com- pany was required to make tax deductions on these payments. Facts:The company had a housing policy to assist certain employees who were trans- ferring from one location to another at the employer’s request. The disadvantage to the employee of selling his or her house and buying another house at the new location was compensated for by the employer. The policy was to ensure that the employee was not left out of pocket as a result of the transfer. The company argued that these payments were made to reimburse the employees for expendi- ture incurred directly as a result of their employment. Therefore, these payments were not subject to tax deductions. Decision:It was held that these payments constituted extra emolument payments on the basis that these payments were made in respect of, or in relation to, the employ- ment of the employees. As a result, these payments were liable to have tax deducted from them under section 338(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Comments:The taxpayer had not lodged an appeal when this item went to print in early December.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.8 (January 1994) GST - section 21 and property developers who rent out property for residential purposes Background When a registered person acquires an asset, the Goods and Services Tax 1985 (ìthe Actî) applies an all-or- nothing approach to determine whether that person can claim an input tax deduction for the GST paid on the asset. If the asset is ìacquired for the principal purpose of making taxable suppliesî, the person can claim a full input tax deduction. The person can't claim an input tax deduction if the asset is not acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. If a person acquires an asset for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, but subsequently uses it for a non-taxable purpose, section 21(1) of the Act creates a ìdeemed supplyî and the registered person will have an output tax liability. The value of the deemed supply (and the corresponding output tax liability) is determined by section†10(8). There have been three recent cases concerning GST and property developers. One of these cases (a decision of Judge Bathgate) is reported as two separate cases - Case N13 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,105 and Case N31 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,277. The other two cases are Case N19(1991) 13 NZTC 3,158 (Judge Barber) and Case N22 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,187 (Judge Bathgate). There are difficulties in reconciling the approaches taken by the TRA in these cases. Inland Revenue has not appealed these cases because our main concern was that the registered person did not in fact acquire the property for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. After hearing the evidence in those cases, the TRA held in favour of the taxpayers. The Commissioner accepts those decisions, as they were made on the relevant facts. The problem that has arisen is a consequential flow-on effect from how the TRA has applied section 21. Inland Revenue considers that the TRA has not applied section 21 correctly, and we will not follow the decisions in applying section 21. Policy This article sets out Inland Revenueís interpretation on applying section 21(1) to property developers who rent out property for residential purposes before selling it. It does not apply to property developers who rent out property for commercial purposes. This article sets out: ï When a property developer can claim a full input tax deduction ï The section 21(1) adjustment 1. The TRA approach 2. Inland Revenueís view 3. The value of the supply ï The application of the de minimus rule ï Whether the developer can claim an input tax deduc- tion for ongoing expenses ï Treatment upon disposal of the property ï The application of section 14(d) Input tax deduction If a property developer acquires a property for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies a full input tax deduction is permitted. Whether a property is acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies is a question of fact, and all the circumstances surrounding the acquisition must be considered. A developer who has acquired a property for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies (and has received a full input tax deduction), may then rent out the property for residential purposes. This may occur if the developer is unable to sell the property. Such a supply is an exempt supply under section†14(c) of the Act. The recent cases, especially Cases N13, N31 and N22, have held that even though the property has been rented, the developer can still apply the property for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. The renting-out of the property is a separate and subsidiary purpose. This means that a developer who acquires a property for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, but who rents it out, may have two separate and distinct purposes: ï making taxable supplies; and ï making exempt supplies. Although each case must be determined on its own facts, Inland Revenue accepts that the developer can still apply the property for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, even when it is rented out. In this case the exempt application would be a subsidiary purpose. The section 21(1) adjustment Where goods acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies are subsequently applied for a purpose other than making taxable supplies, section 21(1) deems a supply of those goods to occur to the extent of the subsequent application. In other words, section 21(1) deems the supply of rental accommodation (ordinarily an exempt supply) to be a taxable supply, on which the supplier must account for output tax. TRA approach to the section 21(1) adjust- continued on page 2 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.8 (January 1994) 21(1) is not relevant to that supply. Section 21(1) becomes relevant when analysing the property developer's subsequent supplies relating to the property. In letting the property on a residential ten- ancy, the property developer is supplying land by way of lease. Section 14(c) provides that those supplies are exempt from GST. However section 21(1) overrides that exemption, and deems a supply of property under a residential lease to be a taxable supply for which the property developer must return GST output tax. These ìdeemedî supplies will be subject to output tax under section 8, therefore they are taxable supplies. The value of those taxable supplies is determined by section 10(8). Under section 21(2), the deemed supply is made at the time the goods are applied for a purpose other than that of making taxable supplies (i.e., for residential accom- modation). There will be an output tax liability in every taxable period in which the property is applied for the residential purpose. This means the deemed supply under section 21(1) must be considered on a period by period basis. Output tax must be returned from the first period of the deemed taxable supply. The value of the supply Section 10(8) of the Act states that where a person is deemed to supply goods and services under section 21(1) of the Act, the consideration in money for that supply is the lesser of; (a) The cost of the goods and services to the supplier; or (b) The open market value of the supply. The value of the ìdeemed supplyî of residential accom- modation under section 21(1) will be the lesser of the cost of the goods or the open market value. (a) ìCost of Goodsî Inland Revenue does not view the cost of the goods (property) to be the original cost of the property to the developer. Rather, ìcost of the goodsî will be the cost to the developer of making the ìdeemed supply of residen- tial accommodationî. The ìcost of goodsî will usually include items such as depreciation of the property, upkeep of the property, rent collection costs, interest etc. (b) Open Market Value of the Supply Open market value of the supply in this context is the open market value of the ìdeemed supply of residential accommodationî, i.e., the comparative market rental for the property. Usually the property will be rented at open market value. In this case, if the open market value is less than the cost of goods (explained above), the value of the ìdeemed supply of residential accommodationî will be the rent charged. If the open market value is the value of the deemed supply, the developer should return one- ninth of the rent charged as output tax in each taxable period in which the deemed supply of residential accommodation takes place. Where the property is not supplied at open market from page 1 ment In Case N19, Judge Barber held that section 21(1) applies only where the principal purpose for acquiring a property changes. If the principal purpose remains unchanged but the property is still applied for an exempt purpose such as a residential tenancy, then Case N19 holds that section 21(1) does not apply. In Cases N13, N31 and N22, Judge Bathgate held that section 21(1) did apply where there was a subsidiary exempt purpose, and held that the words ìto the extent thatî in section 21(1) indicated that there was an apportionment of the input tax credit originally allowed. CIR v Banks \[1978\] 2 NZLR 472 was cited in support of this approach. In Case N22, Judge Bathgate held that the property was applied 51% for a taxable purpose, and 49% for a non- taxable purpose. The value of the supply was, presum- ably, determined by section 10(8) and was the original cost of the property. This meant the developer made a deemed supply of 49% of the cost of the property. The TRA indicated that the section 21(1) adjustment is a one-off adjustment. It further suggested that when the rental activity ends, (and the property is again applied 100% for the purpose of making taxable supplies), there is a deemed supply under section 21(5). The developer would then be entitled to the remaining 51% of the input tax credit. The result is that when the property is rented, 49% of the input tax credit originally allowed is effectively ìclawed backî by Inland Revenue. When the property is no longer rented, there is a deemed supply under section 21(5), and the developer is entitled to the remaining input tax credit. Inland Revenue’s View Contrary to Case N19, Inland Revenue considers that section 21(1) is not limited to cases where there is a change in the registered personís principal purpose in acquiring the goods. We consider that section 21(1) applies to every supply of goods or services that is an exempt supply, if the person originally acquired those goods or services for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Further, we consider that the problem with the TRA approach in Cases N13, N31 and N22 is that it joins the supply of land to the property developer (for which the developer is allowed a full input credit) to the develop- er's subsequent supply of residential accommodation (which section 21(1) deems to be a taxable supply). Section 21 does not provide for any such joining of supplies. Inland Revenueís view is that section 21(1) does not affect the GST treatment of the supply of property made by the vendor of the property. If the property develop- erís principal purpose in acquiring the property is to use it to make taxable supplies, then the developer is entitled to a full input credit on the acquisition. Section 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.8 (January 1994) value, the open market value of the property should be determined. The developer should return one-ninth of the open market value determined as output tax in the taxable period which the deemed supply takes place. This does not mean that the property developer should charge GST on the rent. Rather, the rental charged is a means of valuing the deemed taxable supply of rental accommodation. Summary of the section 21(1) adjustment Inland Revenueís view is that there is no apportionment of the property developer's input tax deduction on the acquisition of the property. The words ìto the extent thatî in section 21(1) merely indicate that it is only the application for the non-taxable purpose (the residential accommodation) that is deemed to be a taxable supply. The value of the deemed supply must be determined under section 10(8). The de minimus proviso The first proviso to section 21(1) applies where the estimated value of all the developer's exempt supplies is less than $48,000 per annum, and less than 5% of all the developer's supplies. If the first proviso to section 21(1) applies, there is no deemed supply under section 21(1), and the developer should make no output tax adjustment. “On-going” expenses The developer may incur ìon-goingî expenses while the property is being rented. For example, the developer may pay rates and insurance, or purchase building materials. The following rules apply to on-going expenses: 1. If the developer makes an output tax adjustment under section 21(1) If the developer makes an output tax adjustment under section 21(1), there will be two taxable supplies. The first is the intended sale of the property, and the second is the deemed taxable supply of residential accommoda- tion. The developer is entitled to an input tax credit on all supplies received for the principal purpose of either the sale of the property, or the rental of the property; 2. If the developer makes no output tax adjustment under section 21(1) When the first proviso to section 21(1) applies, there is no deemed supply under section 21(1). This means the developer will be making a taxable supply (the intended sale of the property) and an exempt supply (supplying residential accommodation). The supply of residential accommodation is exempt under section 14(c). The developer is only entitled to claim input credits on supplies received for the purpose of making taxable supplies (the sale of the property). No input tax can be claimed on supplies made to the developer for the principal purpose of making exempt supplies (the renting of the property). Expenses such as rates do not relate to the exempt supply as they are payable regardless of the tenancy situation. The developer can claim input tax credits for such expenses. Disposal of the Property When the developer sells the property, the sale will be subject to GST since it is made in the course of the property developerís taxable activity. If the property developer has completely abandoned the property development purpose the sale will not be in the course of a taxable activity, so it won't be subject to GST. If the property is rented for five years or longer - application of section 14(d) (a) If the property was applied for taxable and exempt purposes Inland Revenue is aware that some property developers are claiming that no GST is payable on the sale of a building which has been used exclusively for rental purposes for five years before the sale, on the basis of section 14(d). Our view is that a property developer can only take advantage of the exemption in section 14(d) if the property has been used exclusively for rental purposes. When the property has been used for two purposes, one a taxable supply (property development) and one an exempt supply (rental accommodation), we consider that the property has not been used exclusively for the exempt purpose, so section 14(d) cannot apply. Any subsequent sale of the property will be a supply in the course of the property developerís taxable activity, and GST will be payable. (b) If the property was applied for exempt purposes only If the property owner has abandoned the property development purposes and has instead adopted residen- tial letting as his or her only purpose, Inland Revenue considers that a one-off adjustment is required. A one- off adjustment will be required under section 21(1) as there has been a complete (100%) change in the appli- cation of the asset from a taxable to a non-taxable activity. The supply is valued under section 10(8). For one-off adjustments the two limbs of section 10(8) are given a different interpretation. In this context the ìcost of goods and servicesî in section 10(a) means the acquisi- tion cost of the goods, and ìopen market valueî in section 10(8) means the amount the asset would fetch if sold on the open market. Because land usually appreci- ates the value of the supply will usually be the acquisi- tion cost of the property. This means the developer will effectively pay back the amount of input tax originally allowed on acquisition of the property (by virtue of an output tax liability) in the taxable period in which the property is applied for the non taxable purpose. This effectively claws back the original input tax allowed on the property. When the property is subse- continued on page 4 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.8 (January 1994) and tenants are installed on 1 December 1992. The developer rents the property out at $600 per month. This interim measure is to defray expenses pending an upturn in the housing market. ï The developer sells the property on 1 February 1993 for $141,000. Because the developer bought the property for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, she is permitted a full secondhand goods input tax credit on the purchase price of $120,000 ($13,333.33) in the return period ended 30 September 1992. On 1 December 1992 a supply is deemed to occur under section 21(1). At that time, property which was acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies is applied for a non-taxable purpose. As there is a deemed supply the property developer must account for output tax. The following must be determined to calculate that liability: 1. The extent to which the property is applied for the exempt purpose; and 2. The value of the deemed supply. At the time the property is rented, all of it is applied for the non-taxable purpose of residential rental. There is no part of the property that is not applied for the non- taxable purpose. Under section 10(8), it is necessary to establish the lesser of ìcost of those goods and servicesî or ìopen market valueî to value the deemed supply. Cost of goods or services (section 10(8)(a)) Depreciation - straight line at 2.5% $50,000 x 2.5% x 100% = $208.33 6 Cost of goods and services = $208.33 (Because land has no depreciation rate, the deprecia- tion adjustment only applies to the building.) Open market value (section 10(8)(b)) Rent for the two month period is $1,200 Cost is the lesser amount. Therefore, under section 10(8) the value of the supply is $208.33. The adjustment to be included in box 6 of the return for the period ended 31†January 1992 is: $208.33 = $23.15 9 The developer must make this adjustment in every taxable period in which she is renting out the property. When the developer disposes of the property it will be a taxable supply, and she must charge GST on the supply. Application of section 14(d) Assuming the same fact scenario as above, but at 1†December the property developer decides to discon- from page 3 quently sold, no GST is payable as the sale is not a supply in the course of a taxable activity of property development. Conclusions ï Where a property developer acquires a property for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, a full input tax credit is allowed. ï If the developer subsequently applies the property for an exempt purpose (e.g., residential accommodation) that application is a deemed supply. The deemed supply is valued under section 10(8) and the devel- oper must return one-ninth of that value as output tax. ï If the first proviso to section 21(1) applies there is no deemed supply under section 21(1), and the developer should make no output tax adjustment. ï Where section 21(1) applies, both the intended sale of the property and the deemed supply of residential accommodation are taxable supplies. In this case the property developer's expenses relate to goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. A full deduction of input tax in- curred on expenses is allowed. ï Where section 21(1) does not apply because of the first proviso to section 21(1), the property developer makes both taxable and exempt supplies. An input tax credit is only allowed for those expenses incurred for the purpose of making taxable supplies. The property developer must account for GST on the sale of the property unless the property development purpose is completely abandoned. ï A property developer can only take advantage of the exemption in section 14(d) if the property has been used exclusively for rental purposes. Where the property developer has abandoned the property developing purpose a one off adjustment is required. Any subsequent sale will be exempt from GST under section 14(d). Examples Period by period adjustment required A property developer is registered for GST. ï On 3 August 1992 she buys land and an exterior timbered domestic residence from an unregistered person. The principal purpose for buying property is to renovate it and sell it at a profit. ï The price paid for both the land and buildings is $120,000. The land has a value of $70,000 and the buildings are worth $50,000. ï The property is not tenanted at the time of acquisition. The developer is a category A registered person with return periods ending on the last day of the odd numbered months of the year. ï The property is put up for sale on 29 September 1992. As at the end of November there is no prospect of sale 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.8 (January 1994) tinue developing the property for resale and to become a full time residential lessor. Because there has been a complete change of purpose, she must make a one-off adjustment under section 21(1). Under section 10(8) it is necessary to establish the lesser of ìcost of those goods and servicesî or ìopen market valueî. Cost of the goods and services (section 10(8)(a)). Acquisition cost of the property = $120,000 Cost = $120,000 Open market value (section 10(8)(b)) What the property would sell for on the open market = $141,000. Cost is the lesser amount. Therefore under section 10(8) the value of the supply is $120,000. The adjustment to be included in box 6 of the return for the period ending 31†January is: $120,000 = $13,333.33 9 $13,333.33 would be returned in the first period in which the property was first applied for the non-taxable purpose. Any subsequent sale of the property would be an exempt supply and not liable for GST. Surgical implant instrument sets - depreciation There is a new asset class and general depreciation rate for surgical implant instrument sets (orthopaedic). The depreciation rate is 50% diminishing value, or 40% straight line equivalent. The new rate applies to equip- ment acquired on or after 1†April 1993. The new rate is set by Determination DEP3: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 3, which is reproduced below. This determination inserts a new asset class into the Scientific, Medical and Labora- tory Equipment asset category of Determination DEP1 (published on page 54 of the appendix to TIB Volume Four, No.9 - April 1993). Determination DEP3 Student Loan Scheme - repayment threshold raised The Government has reviewed the repayment threshold for the Student Loan Scheme, and raised it to $13,520 for the 1994-95 income year.

Interpretation In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions have the same meaning as in the Income Tax Act 1976. This determination is signed by me on the 19th day of January 1994. Murray McClennan Acting Manager (Rulings) Head Office Inland Revenue Department Tax system advances Inland Revenueís annual report, which was tabled in Parliament in late December, shows unprecedented success in reducing the number of outstanding returns in the last year. Approximately 880,000 1992 returns were overdue at the beginning of the year, but by June this had been reduced by nearly 87% to only 116,000. There were also major improvements in the collection of overdue tax, with net collectable debt dropping by 25% during the year, from $829†million to $621†million. Inland Revenueís new computer systems and structures enable us to quickly identify those people whose tax was overdue, and begin collecting the money owed. Inland Revenueís audit activities also achieved good results, with back taxes of $604†million assessed during the 1993 year. Our Investigations and International Audit section collected $18.16 for every dollar spent in that area, significantly over the budgeted collection figure of $13 for every dollar spent. Many people have incorrectly assumed that Inland Revenueís actions against them will be slow, but our new structures and systems are changing those assump- tions. We will take swift and firm action against those taxpayers who put costs on the rest of the community by not fulfilling their basic tax obligations. On the service side, Inland Revenue staff had more than four million contacts with taxpayers last year, including a growing number of phone enquiries. Our market research shows that most customers like Inland Rev- enueís computerised phone system, but some do find it irritating. To alleviate this, by April 1994 the larger Inland Revenue offices will be re-equipped with systems that allow people to direct dial individual numbers according to their particular requirements.

Whitebait buyers and withholding tax Recently Inland Revenue took steps to remind people who work in the West Coast whitebait industry of their tax obligations. This was part of our increased attention to tax evasion in all areas. Early reports show that withholding tax collected from whitebait sales has nearly doubled this year on the West Coast. Last year $116,000 was collected, compared with $204,000 for the season so far. As well as the extra tax assessed, we achieved our other goal of educating and reminding people about their tax obligations. In particular, all buyers are legally required to deduct withholding tax. 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.8 (January 1994) Questions we’ve been asked This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these answers as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this section will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts.

The question that arose was whether an objection to an assessment transmitted by fax satisfies the requirements of the Act. A fax meets the requirement of “delivery” under section 30 of the Act. The taxpayer’s objection was received in time. 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.8 (January 1994) Payment of tax deductions by employee Section 342 - Payment to be made by employee where tax deduction exceeds source deduction payment: An employee received no cash earnings for a pay period. He lives in a house supplied by his employer. The benefit of living in the house has been assessed at $120 per fortnight. The employer asked whether tax deductions must be made and if so, how they can be made as there was no cash from which to make the deduction. Tax deductions must be made. Section 72 includes the value of any board or lodging, or use of a house or quarters as being within the definition of the term “monetary remuneration”. All “monetary remuneration” is assessable under section 65(2)(b). The value of such section 72 benefits are specifically included within the section 2 definition of “salary or wages” and are therefore subject to tax deductions under Part XI of the Act. Section 342 provides that where either insufficient cash is received to pay the required tax deduction or no cash is received, the employee must pay the em- ployer the amount required to meet the tax deduction. The employer must then pass the payment on to Inland Revenue. If the employee fails to make the payment to the employer, section 355 of the Income Tax Act requires the employee to pay the amount to Inland Revenue by the 20th day of the month following the pay period. Losses brought forward - income under $9,880 rebate Section 50C - Transitional tax allowance: A taxpayer incurred a rental loss in the 1992 income year. Part of that loss was offset against the taxpayer’s 1993 assessable income. When Inland Revenue calculated the taxpayer’s transitional tax allowance (income under $9,880 rebate), the loss brought forward to the 1993 income year was excluded from the calculation. The taxpayer asked why the loss was excluded. When calculating this rebate, only the assessable income for the 1993 income year was taken into account. That was because section 50C(2) of the Act specifies that the calculation is based on the “assessable income derived in the income year”. The losses carried forward were not derived in the 1993 income year, so they were correctly excluded from the calculation. For the purposes of calculating the amount of income tax owing for the 1993 income year, the loss can be carried forward and offset against the taxpayer’s 1993 assessable income under section 188 of the Act. Approved donee organisation Section 56A - Qualifying gifts: A taxpayer has asked how she would know if a donation made to a charity would qualify for the donation rebate under section 56A(2). Donations made to donee organisations qualify for a tax rebate. The amount of the rebate is 33 1 /3% of the total qualifying donations paid by a taxpayer, up to a maximum of $500. This means that the maximum amount of total qualifying donations eligible for the rebate is $1500. continued on page 10 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.8 (January 1994) Taxpayers thinking of making a donation who are unsure whether it will qualify for the donation rebate should contact their local Inland Revenue office, where there is a list of approved organisations available. Organisations may apply to Inland Revenue to obtain donee status. Inland Revenue advises such organisations if their donee status is approved. When an approved donee organisation issues a receipt for a donation, the receipt should meet these conditions: • It must be officially stamped with the name of the organisation. • It must show the date on which the donation or gift was made. • It must be signed by a person authorised by the organisation. Inland Revenue must be satisfied that the donation was made either as a gift or as a payment of fees. Any taxpayer who claims a rebate for donations must have a receipt for each donation, and each receipt must be for $5 or more. List of organisations with “donee” status The secretary of a charitable organisation has asked if Inland Revenue would release the names of other organisations that are exempt from income tax. Inland Revenue does not release specific details about taxpayers, but we do publish a list of organisations that have been granted “donee” status under section 56A(2) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Only the name of each organisation appears on the list. Copies of the list are available from Taxpayer Services, Inland Revenue Head Office, PO Box 2198, Wellington at a cost of $31.50, Alternatively, you can view this list at the counter of any Inland Revenue office. Family Support - effect of 1993 livestock revaluation Section 86L - Spreading of income arising in 1992-93 income year from re- valuation of specified livestock: A farmer wanted to know how the livestock revaluation income affected his Family Support calculation. Some farmers had additional income from livestock revaluation in the 1993 year. Section 86L of the Income Tax Act enables them to spread that income over the succeeding four years. For Family Support purposes, section 374B(1)(e)(iii) of the Income Tax Act excludes the revaluation income when determining the Family Support tax credit, regardless of the year in which the income is assessed (and that includes the 1993 income year). This treatment differs from earlier years when livestock revaluation income was included in the calculation for Family Support purposes. However, if the farmer concerned was eligible for a “section 86L spread” but had not utilised that spread, then the farmer would still be entitled to reduce his or her income for Family Support purposes by the section 86L amount. Overseas tax paid and dividend imputation credit Sections 293(2) - Credit for tax paid overseas, and 394ZE - Credit of tax for imputation credit: A taxpayer had both overseas tax credits and dividend impu- tation credits to offset against his assessable income. He has asked which credit should be offset first. from page 9 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.8 (January 1994) The overseas tax paid can be used as a credit against tax payable. Any excess is not refundable. Imputation credits in excess of tax payable are also not refund- able, although the excess can be converted to a deemed loss and carried forward and offset in succeeding income years. Inland Revenue’s practice is to offset the overseas tax credit first. This gives the taxpayer the greatest advantage through the ability to carry forward any unused dividend imputation credits by way of a deemed loss. Example One - if the overseas tax credit is deducted first: Tax payable$120 Less overseas tax credit $90 $30 Less imputation credit $50 Tax to refundNIL Deemed loss to carry forward ($ 20.00 divided by .28) = $ 71.43 Example Two - if the dividend imputation tax credit is deducted first: Tax payable$120 Less imputation credit $ 50 $ 70 Less overseas tax credit $ 90 Tax to refundNIL No deemed loss to carry forward The correct treatment is illustrated in Example One. Nominee company and imputation credit account Section 394B - Companies required to maintain imputation credit account: A taxpayer asked if a nominee company is required to maintain an imputation credit account. A nominee company is a company which holds assets in the company’s name as a bare nominee or trustee for the asset’s beneficial owners. The powers of nomi- nee companies are restricted and they do not carry on business in the normal sense. They are perhaps most commonly used by legal and accounting firms. Generally, companies are required to maintain imputation credit accounts. However, sections 394B(2)(b) & (c) of the Income Tax Act provide an exception to this where the company is acting only as trustee or where the constitution prohibits the distribution of profits or income. A nominee company is therefore not required to maintain an imputation credit account. Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keeping assets when ceasing to be registered Section 5(3) - Cessation of registration: A businessman asked what the GST implications are when he ceases business. He will be keeping assets that were previously used in the business. When the businessman completes his final GST return, he must make an adjust- ment for the value of assets that he will retain. His GST payable will be calcu- lated on the value of the assets on the day that he ceases to be registered. Section 10(8) deems the value of supply to be the lesser of cost (including any GST) or continued on page 12 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.8 (January 1994) market value of the retained assets. The businessman must pay GST on all the assets that he retains regardless of whether or not he received an input tax credit when he acquired them. The businessman must notify Inland Revenue of the cessation of his business, in writing and within 21 days of when it ceases. That notice must also contain a statement as to whether he intends to carry on any taxable activity within 12 months of cessation. Under section 75(3) the businessman must keep his GST records for at least 7 years after the end of the taxable period to which they relate. Financial services - GST charged on local authority rates Section 5(7) - Supply by local authority: A city council asked whether local authority rates that it charged are subject to GST, if part of them are used to make loan and interest repayments. The council suggested that the part of the rates attributable to the loan repayments may constitute a “financial service” and be exempt from GST under section 14(a). In this case the financial service is the loan from the lender to the council, not the payment of the rates. Therefore, as rates are not included in the definition of “financial services” and are deemed to be a supply of goods and services by section 5(7)(a), GST applies to local authority rates. Local authorities should be aware that certain “rates” imposed under sections 384, 463, 466, 514, 533, 644E, 674 and 675 of the Local Government Act 1974 are deemed by the proviso to section 5(7)(a) not to be supplies of goods and serv- ices. Secondhand goods subsequently used overseas Section 11(1)(d) - Zero-rated goods: A GST-registered person purchased an aircraft from a non-registered person. No GST was therefore charged on the purchase price. However the registered person was able to obtain a notional secondhand goods input tax credit on the purchase price. The aircraft was subse- quently leased overseas and the registered person asked if lease payments are zero-rated. As a general rule, goods supplied that are not situated in New Zealand at the time of that supply are zero-rated (section 11(1)(b)). However, in this case, sec- tion 11(1)(d) precludes the zero-rating of the supply of the aircraft because the registered person had previously been able to claim the notional secondhand input tax credit on the purchase price. GST calculated to less than a cent Section 24(8) - Fractions of a cent: A taxpayer asked if the calculation of GST on an invoice should have fractions of a cent rounded down to the nearest cent. Section 24(8) of the GST Act specifies that where a calculation results in a fraction of half a cent or less, it can be disregarded. However if the fraction is greater than half a cent, it is to be rounded up to a whole cent. from page 11 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.8 (January 1994) Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 Allowances to be included in liable earnings Section 115 - Deduction on account of earner premiums: An employer has asked if earner premium is to be paid on the value of the use of a house supplied to an employee. Section 115 of the Act specifies that earner premium deductions are imposed on earnings of an employee to which Part XI of the Income Tax Act 1976 applies. Part XI of the Income Tax Act 1976 applies to salary or wages, and to other source deduction payments. Paragraph (a) of the definition of “salary or wages” specifically includes within the meaning of that term the value of the benefits to which section 72 of the Income Tax Act 1976 applies. Section 72 applies to the value of board, lodging and house allowances. Such benefits are therefore within the meaning of the term “salary or wages” and Part XI applies to them. This means they are subject to the imposition of earner premiums under section 115. Child Support Act 1991 Application for Child Support Section 18 - Liability arises on acceptance of application: A custodial parent requested a formula assessment to be undertaken as the previous voluntary agreement had been abandoned. The parent asked if the application date of the formula assessment could be backdated. The request for a formula assessment incurs a liability for the non-custodial parent to pay Child Support on the later of; • The day on which the application is received, or; • If the application was not properly made, the date on which the application becomes properly made. Section 18 of the Child Support Act does not provide for an earlier date to be used. Therefore, the formula assessment cannot be backdated to prior to the application date. Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 Interest Capitalisation on Loan A student asked if the interest paid on his student loan is compounded. The loan agreement signed by the borrower at the time of requesting the loan provides for the interest charged during the year to be capitalised on 31 March. If a loan is transferred to Inland Revenue as at 28 February, the loan account will attract interest at a daily rate on the principal amount transferred. The interest transferred and the interest calculated by Inland Revenue for March is capital- ised on 31 March. On 1 April, interest will be charged on the new loan balance, which will include interest charged previously. Accordingly, the interest will compound on an annual basis. 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.8 (January 1994) Legal Decisions - Case Notes This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council.

HC New Plymouth M 52/91 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, section 106(1)(h)(i) Keywords:interest, deductibility Summary:A taxpayer participated in a company restructuring transaction. The transaction involved the formation of a partnership which borrowed a sum of money. The taxpayer co-guaranteed the loan and advanced money to the partnership to pay part of the interest on the loan. The High Court held that the payments to the partnership by the taxpayer were not deductible under section 106(1)(h)(i) as they were not payments of interest. Facts:The taxpayer held shares in a public company which went heavily into debt when one of its subsidiaries went into receivership. At this time the public company owed $1 million to a major creditor. The shareholders of the public company devised a financial restructuring scheme to assist the company to meet its debt obligations. The scheme involved the formation of a group partnership which borrowed $1,070,000 from the major creditor. The effect of this transaction was to extinguish the public company’s debt to the creditor. The taxpayer participated in the scheme. He was one of the guarantors of the loan to the partnership. In addition, as interest fell due on the loan, the taxpayer and the other loan guarantors also advanced money to the partnership to pay the interest. The taxpayer sought to deduct the payments made to the partner- ship under section 106(1)(h)(i) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Decision:The taxpayer contended that he had borrowed money from the partnership and used the money to acquire capital. He claimed that the payments were deduct- ible as interest payable in gaining or producing assessable income. Inland Revenue asserted that the interest was not deductible as the taxpayer was not liable to pay the interest on the loan to the partnership. In the High Court, Judge Anderson agreed with Inland Revenue. His Honour concluded that the real nature of the restructuring transaction did not obligate the taxpayer to make interest payments. The payments made by him were capital advances to the group partnership enabling the partnership to meet its interest obligations. As the payments were not interest, they were not deductible under section 106(1)(h)(i). Comments:We do not know whether the taxpayer will be appealing this decision. Purchase of secondhand asset outside New Zealand by bare trustee Rating:••• Case:TRA No. 93/56 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, section 8(1), 8(2), 20(3)(a), paragraph (c) of the definition of “input tax” in section 2(1). Keywords:Secondhand goods; bare trustee; taxable activity inside/outside New Zealand Summary:Judge Willy held that an Isle of Man company (C Limited - which was owned by the objector) held a ship as bare trustee for the New Zealand objector. The New Zealand objector company purchased the secondhand ship outside continued on page 16 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.8 (January 1994) New Zealand from a non-registered supplier and was not entitled to a secondhand goods input tax credit for the purchase of the ship. Facts:The objector, a New Zealand company, entered into an agreement on 3 Novem- ber 1990 to purchase a roll-on roll-off ship for US$18 million from an Isle of Man company. The ship was second-hand and was in need of repair. The objector had intended to use the ship for trans-Tasman work. At the time of purchase trans-Tasman work was depressed so the objector looked for alterna- tive work for the vessel. The objector had discussions with the US military and the UK Ministry of Defence about the possibility of obtaining charter work to convey military personnel and equipment to the Middle East during the Gulf War. The objector decided that if the ship was to be engaged in this type of work it would be unsuitable to employ a New Zealand crew. The vessel would also need to sail under a foreign flag, i.e., be registered under a foreign shipping registry, to avoid adverse publicity for the company in New Zealand. To facilitate the vessel being retained on the Isle of Man shipping registry, the objector acquired an Isle of Man company, C Limited, and arranged for C Lim- ited to be the registered owner of the vessel. On 30 January 1991 the objector on behalf of C Limited paid approximately US$30 million and accepted delivery of the ship at Rotterdam. The objector did not obtain a contract with the military as the conflict in the Middle East had ended. The objector decided to sail the ship to New Zealand under a bareboat charter to a company in which the objector’s parent company had a substantial interest. The charter was a non-commercial arrangement because the charter rate was US$1 per day. The ship arrived in Auckland on 24 March 1991 where the objec- tor arranged the completion of the repairs that were begun in Rotterdam. The objector also made a series of book transactions to buy the vessel from its wholly owned subsidiary, C Limited. The objector claimed an input deduction for the vessel on the basis that the vessel was in New Zealand when C Limited sold it. Decision:Judge Willy decided that C Limited held the vessel as a bare trustee for the objector as beneficial owner because: 1. It was originally intended that the vessel would be purchased by the objector. 2. The objector had exclusive control over the disposition of the vessel. 3. The circumstances of the alleged loan lacked all commercial reality. 4. C Limited had no legal or equitable right to dispose of the vessel contrary to the wishes of the objector. The objector first acquired the legal and the equitable title to the vessel from its previous owners before it set up C Limited (who acquired the legal title only). The supply took place when the objector first contracted to purchase the vessel and that supply took place outside New Zealand. Judge Willy concluded that it follows that under paragraph (c) of the definition of ‘input’ tax in section 2(1) there was no supply in New Zealand of secondhand goods. Inland Revenue acted correctly in disallowing the input tax deduction. Comments:We do not know whether the taxpayer will be appealing this decision. from page 15 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.8 (January 1994) Use of assets accretion method upheld Rating:•• Case:TRA No. 93/141 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Assets accretion method, onus of proof Summary:The case concerned a taxpayer’s objection to an assessment made by Inland Revenue using the assets accretion method to determine the taxpayer’s income. The TRA found that the taxpayer failed to discharge the evidential burden of showing that the assets accretion exercise and result was wrong and therefore the assessment was confirmed. Facts:Following an investigation into the taxpayer’s affairs Inland Revenue issued an assessment for the 1984 year. In arriving at the assessment for the 1984 year Inland Revenue relied upon the assets accretion method. The taxpayer objected to this assessment. Decision:Judge Willy found that there was an obligation on the taxpayer to demonstrate by the production of acceptable evidence on the balance of probabilities, that the result of the assets accretion method in this case was wrong and by how much it was wrong. The Judge found that the objector had failed to do this and therefore the assessment was confirmed. Comments:We do not know whether the taxpayer will be appealing this decision. Investment allowances not available on equipment hired out Case:James Bull Ltd v CIR. C.A. 37/93 Rating:••• Act:Income Tax Act 1976, section 122 Keywords:Statutory interpretation, use, performing services, directly Summary:Investment allowances under section 122 are not available to a taxpayer whose business is hiring out equipment to other taxpayers who are in the business is farming or agriculture. Facts:James Bull Ltd purchased, paid for and owned farm machinery. It hired the machinery to James Bull and a farming partnership. The partners were James Bull, a family trust and another family company. The operators of the farms used the machinery for farming purposes. The High Court judgment, reported at (1993) 15 NZTC 10,001, held that the farm machinery failed to qualify for investment allowances under either paragraph (a) or (b) of section 122(1). Decision:The taxpayer argued that the High Court had taken a too restrictive approach to the interpretation of the relevant economic incentives. The taxpayer accepted that the owner of the machinery had to satisfy the statutory criteria. However, the taxpayer emphasised that the High Court had accepted that the acquisition and the use of the machinery had the result desired by Parliament of increasing farm output. Section 5(j) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1924 requires consideration of the scheme and language of the legislative provisions and the relevant objectives of those provisions. In this case the legal answer turned on a consideration of section 122 in its statutory context giving full weight to the statutory purpose. The Court analysed the scheme and language of the section to determine the line between qualifying and non-qualifying farming-related activities. continued on page 18 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.8 (January 1994) The Court found that the true object of section 122 is identifiable without going outside the Act. The activities of the taxpayer and the operators of the farm properties, when taken together, meet the objectives of the incentive provisions. However, it is the taxpayer’s activities that are relevant. Section 122 focuses on plant and machinery for use by the taxpayer. The taxpay- er’s business was hiring out farm machinery. The taxpayer did not use the farm machinery directly for any farming business as required under paragraph (a). Supplying machinery by the taxpayer to the operators did not satisfy the re- quirement to perform services on the farmers’ land as required under paragraph (b). The Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed the appeal.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.9 (February 1994) Repairs and maintenance Summary The new depreciation regime which generally applies from the 1993/94 income year introduces new sections to replace the old section 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976 (the Act). The old section 108 specifically pro- vided for the deduction of amounts spent on repairs and alterations, but the new sections do not. Although this section mentioned repairs and alterations, the deduction available under this section was commonly called ìRepairs and Maintenanceî or ìR & Mî. The change resulted from the Governmentís agreement to the Valabh Committeeís recommendation that the deductibility of repairs and maintenance should be considered under the normal deductibility provisions of the Act. In practice what was deductible under the old section 108 and what will be deductible on revenue account under the general provisions of the Act will not differ to any large degree. The only difference is that alterations which do not increase the value of an asset may be on capital account under the general provisions of the Act, whereas they were deductible under the old section 108. Inland Revenue’s policy Here is Inland Revenueís view of how these provisions apply: ï Expenditure on repairs, maintenance, alterations etc must be on revenue account for it to be deductible. It must be deductible under the normal deductibility provisions of section 104, and avoid the prohibition of capital expenditure in section 106(1)(a). ï Capital expenditure is not deductible, but it will be subject to the normal depreciation rules. ï Expenditure required to maintain an asset in the condition it was when the taxpayer acquired it will be on revenue account, and therefore deductible. ï The replacement of a capital asset will be capital expenditure. ï Inland Revenue regards a distinct physical unit which can function on its own as a unit against which the extent of expenditure will be measured. ï Expenditure on an asset over and above making good wear and tear will be capital expenditure. ï No deduction is available for notional repairs. Comment Repairs and maintenance were specifically provided for under the old section 108 of the Act. Once this section was repealed and the new depreciation regime was introduced, the question of the deductibility of ìrepairs and maintenanceî expenditure needed to be considered under the general provisions of the Act. This means the expenditure must now be deductible under the normal deductibility provisions of section 104, and it must avoid the prohibition of deductions for capital expendi- ture in section 106(1)(a). Under general case law, whether expenditure is on revenue or capital account depends mainly on the extent of the work undertaken. Case law considers that ex- penditure on the replacement of an item is essentially the acquisition of a capital asset, so it is capital expendi- ture. It also considers that categorisation of the work depends on the type and extent of the work done, and of the relevant unit to which the work is being done. Identification of the unit is very important. Inland Revenue considers that a distinct physical unit which can function on its own is a unit against which the extent of any expenditure will be measured. So, if a building is part of a larger complex, the particular building (and not the wider complex) will be the unit if it is a ìstand aloneî building. However, each situation will depend on its own facts. Examples of assets considered to be units are: ï motor vehicles (the unit is not the fleet of vehicles) ï individual buildings (not a complex of attached buildings) ï a boat builderís slipway (not the workshop, slipway and associated plant). After identifying the individual asset, the next step is to decide whether the expenditure is on capital or revenue account. There is various case law both from New Zealand and from overseas which will help with this decision. The case law that looks at the capital/revenue distinction generally is as important as the case law that relates specifically to expenditure on repairs, mainte- nance or alterations. At the end of this article there is a section setting out Inland Revenueís interpretation of this case law. The general case law on the capital/revenue distinction has produced several tests which are useful in deciding whether expenditure is on capital or revenue account. Some of the tests are - ï Does the expenditure increase the useful life of the asset, or its output or efficiency? ï Is the expenditure recurrent? ï Does the expenditure create a new asset that did not exist before? ï Does the expenditure confer an enduring benefit to the taxpayer? ï Does the expenditure relate to the profit-earning process or the profit-earning structure of the business? None of these tests should be considered in isolation, and it would be unwise to do so. For example, just because an item of expenditure is not recurrent does not in itself mean that the expenditure is on capital account. A lump sum payment representing an aggregation of a recurrent revenue expense is not capital. examples and case law notes overleaf 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.9 (February 1994) Examples: repairs and maintenance - capital or revenue expenditure? The following examples illustrate Inland Revenueís application of these tests and relevant case law. These examples are intended to be indicative only. A general similarity with them will not necessarily produce the same tax results. Example 1 Dwayne Lucas, a horse trainer has 20 horse boxes that are in a dilapidated state because of wear and tear over the years. Instead of trying to repair the boxes Dwayne decides that he will completely replace them. In this case an item has been completely replaced. The expenditure is capital so it is not deductible. Auckland Trotting Club v CIR \[1968\] NZLR 967 is an example where the Court found that because the track had been totally replaced it was on capital account. Example 2 Joanne Smith owns a three bedroom rental property. She is finding it increasingly difficult to find tenants for the building because of its run-down state. She does some alterations which replace the kitchen and bath- room, and merges two adjoining bedrooms into one. In this case the expenditure would be regarded as being too extensive to be a revenue expense. A deciding factor in this case would be that the rental property has been substantially improved. FCT v Western Suburbs Cin- emas Ltd \[1952\] 86 CLR 102, Conn v Robins Bros Ltd \[1966\] 43 TC 266 are cases which illustrate the often fine line between expenditure which improves the asset, and expenditure which merely restores the asset. Example 3 Dwayne Lucasís foreman who lives in a house on Dwayneís property is dismissed. Before hiring a new foreman Dwayne decides to do some work on the house. He has the house repainted, the guttering replaced with the same type of material and the front door (which the foreman kicked in as he departed) replaced. Unfortu- nately Dwayne could not buy a door with frosted glass with swans on it like the old door to replace it, so he settles for the cheapest solid wooden door he can find. In this case the expenditure would be regarded as being on revenue account. The repainting is recurrent ex- penditure and along with the reguttering and replace- ment of the door does not improve the house in any way. Further, this expenditure is not of sufficient magnitude to be on capital account. Cases which illustrate this are as in Example 2 above and also Vallambrosa Rubber Co Ltd v Farmer \[1910\] SC 519. Example 4 Joanne Smith decides to invest some spare cash she has in the property market. She locates a house in Wadestown with harbour views which she feels has great potential (the real estate agent describes it as a handymanís dream). Because of its particularly run- down state she buys it for $40,000 less than other similar properties in the area. However, before she can rent the property out she embarks on a maintenance programme that includes repainting, wallpapering, and replacing the bath and showers. Repairs to recently-acquired assets are a special case. Much of the expenditure incurred would normally be deductible, but in this case the expenditure will be on capital account for these reasons: ï the house was recently acquired ï it was purchased for $40,000 less than it normally would have cost, because of its dilapidated state. Relevant cases are The Law Shipping Co, Ltd v CIRs \[1923\] 22 TC (Court of Session, Scotland), Collector of Inland Revenue Cook Islands v A B Donald Ltd \[1965\] NZLR 679. Example 5 In the situation outlined in example 1, Dwayne consid- ers that he should get a deduction for the amount that it would have cost him to repair the boxes if he had decided not to replace them. A claim is not allowable for notional expenses. What must be considered is the actual factual situation that occurred. A relevant case is FCT v Western Suburbs Cinemas Ltd \[1952\] 86 CLR 102. Example 6 Wade Boggs runs a courier business. The engine in his van seizes, and the van cannot be driven. Wade cannot afford to purchase a new van, so he buys a replacement reconditioned engine of the same make and capacity as the old engine. In this case the ìunitî is the van. The replacement of the engine merely restores the van to a workable state so the expenditure is on revenue account. Example 7 Laurence Taylor owns a property which he has let for the past 5 years. He lived in it himself for 10 years before he started letting it out. The old concrete tile roof needs repairing, so he replaces it with a new steel- backed tile roof. Even though the roof has been replaced with different materials the house has not been improved in any way, so the expenditure is on revenue account. 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.9 (February 1994) Case law: repairs and maintenance - capital or revenue expenditure? the entirety which it is relevant to consider, one is looking not for a profit - earning structure or entity, as such, but for a physical thing which satisfies a particular notion.î Overseas Cases Lurcott v Wakely & Wheeler Lurcott v Wakely and Wheeler \[1911\] 1 KB 905 was a case where a wall was considered to be part of the asset being the premises as a whole. In this case the replace- ment of the wall was considered to be a repair. This case was not a tax case but was cited in the Auckland Trotting Club as it considered the meaning of the word ìrepairî as used in the old section 108. Law Shipping The Law Shipping Co, Ltd v CIRs \[1923\] 22 TC 621 (Court of Session, Scotland) is a case that contains useful general comment which is specifically directed at a capital/income distinction, rather than interpreting words such as ìrepairsî and ìimprovementsî. The decision itself is concerned with the special situation of a recently-acquired asset. The Law Shipping case was concerned with a company which purchased a ship in poor state of repair for £97,000. The company then used the vessel in its current state of repair for one voyage, and then carried out repairs to the value of £51,558. The company claimed the cost of the repairs as a revenue expense. The claim was disallowed and this decision was upheld by the Court. The Court indicated that repairs would usually be a revenue outgoing, even if the repairs were delayed for a lengthy period: ìRepairs may be executed as the occasion for them occurs; or, if they are such as brook delay, they may be postponed to a convenient season: but, in either case, they truly constitute a constantly recurring incident of that continuous employment of the ship which makes them necessary. They are therefore an admissible deduction in computing profits, and, as is admitted in the case, if the ship had not been sold, the purchasersí predecessors would have been entitled to deduct the whole of the £51,558 in returning their profits for Income Tax. Accumulated arrears for repairs are, in short, none the less repairs necessary to earn profits, although they have been allowed to accumulate.î (per Lord President Clyde p 625) However the Court decided in this case that the repairs were nothing more than part of the expenditure in- volved in acquiring a capital asset in good working order. It was said: ìIt is obvious that a ship, on which repairs have been allowed to accumulate, is a less valuable asset with which to start business than a ship which has been This section sets out Inland Revenueís interpretation on several leading cases on repairs and maintenance expenditure which form the basis of the statement. It also considers cases which have looked at the capital/revenue distinction. Cases Concerning Repairs and Maintenance Expenditure Leading NZ Case - old section 108 The leading New Zealand case on the old section 108 was Auckland Trotting Club v CIR \[1968\] NZLR 967. This case involved the Trotting Clubís claim for the cost of demolition of a shell trotting track and the construc- tion of a new limestone track on the same site. The Court of Appeal found that the replacement of the old track with a new track was more than repairs and alterations (the term used in the old section 108), and therefore confirmed Inland Revenueís assessment disallowing this expenditure. Although the Auckland Trotting Club case focused on the wording of the old section 108 it contains comments which are a useful guide to what will constitute deduct- ible expenditure under the new regime. For example, in determining the unit against which the expenditure must be measured, the Court made these comments: ìMr Barker, for the Club, argued before us that the ìpremisesî of the club, with regard to which the work must be evaluated, were constituted by the whole of the Clubís complex of buildings and improvements at Alexandra Park: alternatively, if this submission were not accepted, he argued that they were constituted by the track, with its rails, posts, and lighting system, all of which he pointed out, were fixtures. We reject, as Moller J rejected, the first of these contentions. It seems to us to completely to lack reality in the context of the particular statutory provision. It must necessarily involve the proposition that if the total undertaking of a taxpayer is only large enough, the demolition of (e.g.) a single large building forming part of a complex, and the construction of another in its place, is to be classed as ìrepairs and alterationsî to the whole. We agree with, and adopt in this case, the reasoning of Kitto J. in Lindsay v Federal Commis- sioner of Taxation (1961) 106 C.L.R. 377; (1961) A.L.R. 58 at pp. 384, 62 where he says: ì In order to determine whether an item of expenditure is to be held on general principles to be chargeable to income or capital account, it is of course necessary to distinguish between the business entity, structure or organisation set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisa- tion operates to obtain regular returns of regular outlay ........... But where the question is whether expenditure has been for repairs, and, for the purposes of deciding that question, one asks what continued on page 4 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.9 (February 1994) ìNo doubt in the course of carrying out these works certain structural alterations were made, as one would expect with any extensive repair of a building over 400 years old, when repairs were being carried out at a time when building techniques have com- pletely altered. But the fact that there were altera- tions in the structural details of the building does not seem to me to be a good ground for proceeding upon the basis that the work produced something new. On the contrary, I think it is implicit in the Commis- sionersí finding that the result of this work was not to produce something new but to repair something which had previously existed. Upon that basis it seems to me that there is no ground for regarding this expenditure as capital expenditure.î It is debatable whether the decisions in the Western Suburbs Cinemas and Robins Brothers cases can be reconciled. Inland Revenue considers that capital/income distinctions often depend on fine factual differences and it would not be wise to simply take the view that the cases are necessarily irreconcilable or that the approach in one case is to be preferred over the other. What is clear is that when major components of the material unit (e.g. a building) are renewed instead of being simply kept in serviceable condition, a judgment has to be made as to whether the work is of sufficient substance to put the expenditure on capital account. The question of whether the asset is improved in a substan- tial way will help with that judgment. If the Western Cinemas and Robins Brothers cases are to be reconciled, that would appear to be the factor which distinguishes the cases. In the Western Cinemas case the Court focused on the improvement made by renewing the ceiling. The Robins Brothers case took a long term view of maintaining the building (parts of which were 400 years old), and viewed the replacement of major compo- nents as a natural process of repair which would be effected and repeated over the centuries, using materials which were appropriate for construction at the time the work was done. The building itself remained the same size, in the same location, and accordingly the work no more than maintained the buildingís inherent utility. Viewed in that way, the differences between the two cases only involve a different emphasis on facts. Revenue/Capital Distinction BP Australia v FCT One of the leading cases in determining whether an outgoing is of a capital nature is BP Australia v FC of T \[1965\] 3 All ER 209. This case concerned payments that an oil company made to service station proprietors to obtain trade tie agreements by which only the oil companyís products were sold from the service station. The Privy Council decided that on balance the expendi- ture was of a revenue nature. Lord Pearce made the following general observations, which help to determine whether expenditure is of a revenue or capital nature: from page 3 regularly kept in repair. And it is a fair inference that the sellers would have demanded and obtained a higher price than they actually did, but for the immediate necessity of repairs to which the ship was subject when they put her in the market.î (per Lord President Clyde p 626) ì\[The cost of repairs\] is, in substance, the equivalent of an addition to the price. If the ship had not been in need of the repairs in question when bought, the Appellants would, presumably, have had to pay a correspondingly higher price.î (per Lord Cullen p 628) Odeon Theatres The limits of the principle in the Law Shipping case are illustrated by Odeon Associated Theatres Ltd v Jones \[1972\] 1†All ER 681. In that case the purchaser had bought a cinema, and some repairs had been deferred before the time of purchase. In the ten years after acquiring the cinema alterations were made and they were treated as capital, but in addition repairs were effected and they were held to be on revenue account. In considering the Law Shipping case the Court held these distinctions were material: ï The cinema could have continued to be used effec- tively without the repairs being effected (unlike the necessity for a ìsurveyî of the vessel in the Law Shipping case before the vessel could be used in the ordinary course of trade), ï The need for repairs did not alter the cost of acquiring the cinema. ï There was accounting evidence that the repairs to the cinema should be on revenue account. Western Cinemas and Robins Brothers It is difficult at times to determine when repairs are of sufficient magnitude to be on capital account. Two cases which illustrate this are Conn v Robins Bros Ltd \[1966\] 43 TC 266 and FCT v Western Suburbs Cinemas Ltd \[1952\] 86 CLR 102. In the Western Cinemas case it was decided that a ceiling that was replaced because it was impracticable to repair it was on capital account. The ceiling was replaced with more modern materials than previously. In contrast, the Robins Brothers case involved extensive repairs to leased premises in which a retail business was conducted. In this case extensive alterations were made to a building that was over 400 years old. For example, the roof was stripped, some of the roof timbers were renewed, and the roof was replaced with corrugated asbestos (it had previously been of slate). Some of the walls were removed, so steel girders had to be inserted to support the upper storeys, the joists and the upper walls. These had previously been supported by the walls of the lower floor. The Court held that although there was extensive replacement of the existing asset, the expenditure was on revenue account. The comment was made - 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.9 (February 1994) ìThe solution to the problem is not to be found by any rigid test or description. It has to be derived from many aspects of the whole set of circumstances some of which may point in one direction, some in the other. One consideration may point so clearly that it dominates other and vaguer indications in the contrary direction. It is a commonsense appreciation of all the guiding features which must provide the ultimate answer. Although the categories of capital and income expenditure are distinct and easily ascertainable in obvious cases that lie far from the boundary, the line of distinction is often hard to draw in border-line cases; and conflicting considera- tions may produce a situation where the answer turns on questions of emphasis and degree.î British Insulated & Helsby Cables, Ltd v Atherton The case British Insulated & Helsby Cables, Ltd v Atherton \[1926\] AC 205 the company set aside the sum of £31,784 to form the nucleus of a pension fund for the benefit of its employees. The Court found that the payment was made to secure a substantial and lasting advantage for the company and therefore was on capital account. Vallambrosa Rubber Co. Ltd The Vallambrosa Rubber Co Ltd v Farmer \[1910\] SC 519 concerned expenses claimed by the company for weeding and other expenses in relation to trees that could not be productive for another six years. The Court decided that the expenditure was on revenue account, and stated: ìNow, I donít say that this consideration is abso- lutely final or determinative, but in a rough way I think it is not a bad criterion of what is capital expenditure as against what is income expenditure to say that capital expenditure is a thing that is going to be spent once and for all, and income expenditure is a thing that is going to recur every year.î Sun Newspapers Ltd The Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation \[1938\] 61 CLR 337, concerned the sum paid by the publisher of a newspaper to another company who were considering publishing a rival newspaper. The Court decided that the payment was capital in nature. Chief Justice Latham made the following comments: ìAs a direct consequence of the agreement, the publication of ìThe Worldî ceased immediately, and immunity from a threatened competition within a large area was also obtained for a period of three years. Such a transaction must, in my opinion, be regarded as a transaction which added to the good- will of the enterprise. In substance it amounted to the addition of a capital asset, immaterial in charac- ter but substantial in value and significance, to the general equipment of the business enterprise of the appellant companies.î Determination G5C: Mandatory conversion convertible notes Determination G5C: Mandatory Conversion Convertible Notes was signed by Peter Barrand, Deputy Commis- sioner on 18 February 1994. It replaces Determination G5B. The differences between the two determinations are: 1. G5C broadens the scope of the determination so that it applies to a Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note converting into shares in a company other than the company that issued the note. The scope clauses in Determinations G5 and G5A both provided for this. 2. G5C narrows the scope of the determination so that it only applies to a Mandatory Conversion Convert- ible Note where the interest rate is within a narrower range. For the purposes of the determination this is defined as between 5% p.a. (or half the rate the issuer would have paid on cash repayment borrow- ings if lower) and 15% p.a. (or double the rate the issuer would have paid on cash repayment borrow- ings if higher). The change is reflected in the addition of a further example in clause†7. There are also minor changes in the wording, grammar, and dates used in the examples. These do not alter the intent or application of the determination. Determination G5C appears in full as an appendix to this TIB. ACC earner premiums - correction In TIB Volume Five, No.6 (November 1993), there was an article about income tax deductions and GST input tax credits for ACC premiums. In that article we stated that employers could not claim an income tax deduction for earner premium payments as individual employees bear the cost of this premium. That statement was not entirely accurate. Employees do bear the cost of the premiums, as the premi- ums are deducted from gross wages. However, employers can claim an income tax deduction for the gross wages that they pay, including the earner premium deductions. Similarly, a company can claim the gross salaries paid to shareholder-employees. 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.9 (February 1994) Depreciation rate for tax software There is a new provisional depreciation rate of 100% for tax software, applying from 1†April 1993. This is to allow for the fact that tax software only remains up-to- date for one income year - the year for which it was written. Provisional depreciation rates can apply to all taxpayers in the same way as normal depreciation rates. However, if a provisional depreciation rate is reduced the lower depreciation rate will apply to all existing depreciable property for which a taxpayer used the provisional rate. A reduced general depreciation rate can only apply to assets acquired after the date of the reduction. This change was introduced in Determination PROV†1. The full text of this determination is printed below. This determination inserts a new asset class into the Software asset category of Determination DEP†1 (published on page 64 of the appendix to TIB Volume Four, No.9 - April 1993) Note that Inland Revenueís policy on the tax treatment of computer software changed from 1†July 1993 (see the appendix to TIB Volume†4, No.10). Taxpayers can claim as an expense the cost of any software bought before 1†July 1993. Determination PROV 1 This determination may be cited as ìDetermination PROV 1: Tax Depreciation Rates Provisional Determi- nation Number†1î 1. Application This determination shall apply to software purchased on or after 1 April 1993 that is able to be used in the preparation or filing of income tax returns relating to one particular income year only. 2. Determination Under the provisions of section 108I of the Income Tax Act 1976 I have determined the following provisional basic economic depreciation rate: Determination DEP1 (as amended) is amended by inserting in the asset category ìSoftwareî, the additional asset class ìSoftware able to be used in the preparation or filing of income tax returns relating to one particular income year onlyî with the following details - Estimated Useful Life1 year DV Banded Depn Rate (%)100% SL Equiv Banded Depn Rate (%) 100% 3. Interpretation In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions have the same meaning as in section†107A of the Income Tax Act 1976. This determination is signed by me on the 15th day of February 1994. Murray McClennan Manager (Rulings) Head Office Inland Revenue Department Upcoming TIB articles In the next few months we’ll be releasing policy statements on these topics in the Tax Information Bulletin: • When Inland Revenue can grant relief from payment of tax in cases of financial hardship • Various statements on the qualifying company regime • GST second-hand goods credit on property transactions • National standard cost for livestock determination 1994 • Write-off of low value assets - GST inclusive or exclusive. We’ll publish these statements as soon as we’ve finished consulting with commentators outside Inland Revenue. Student Loan scheme - interest rates for 1994-95 On 10 January the Ministers of Education and Revenue announced the interest rate which will apply to the Student Loan scheme for the year beginning 1 on April 1994. The total interest rate will be 7.0 percent. This is made up of the base interest rate of 5.7 percent and the interest adjustment rate of 1.3 percent. 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.9 (February 1994) Questions we’ve been asked This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts.

Inland Revenue’s policy is that if a person takes in one boarder, the receipts are not taxable and expenses are not deductible. If a person has two, three or four boarders, 20 percent of the receipts are taxable. continued on page 8 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.9 (February 1994) Example: Three boarders taken in at $100 each per week - total $300 Taxable income to be returned is $60, i.e., 20% of $300. Anyone who has five or more boarders must calculate profit in the normal manner, i.e., income less deductions. Any profit will then be taxable. Any board received from relations is not taxable, nor are related expenses deduct- ible. Sometimes the number of boarders will change during the year. If this occurs, there may be some periods in which the receipts are not taxable (when there is only one boarder) and others when the receipts are taxed at 20 percent. Example: One boarder from April to July 1994 -no tax liability Three boarders from August to December 1994 - 20% of gross receipts are taxable Five boarders from January to March 1995 -gross receipts less expenses are taxable. The home owner has the option of using this method or calculating actual in- come and deductions. A home owner who wishes to calculate net profit or loss may find our IR 3R form useful. This is available from any Inland Revenue office. Balance date change - rate of tax Section 16(6) - Period other than a year - rate of tax: Inland Revenue granted approval for a farmer to adopt a 30 June balance date. His previous balance date was 31 March. He asked how to calculate the tax for the year ending 30 June 1994, which would involve a 15 month tax return. When a return period is not for 12 months, taxing the income at normal tax rates may disadvantage the farmer. For example, the increased assessable income derived during the 15 month period may mean that the farmer would be taxed at a higher marginal rate, or more income could be taxed at the higher rate. Section 16(6) of the Act provides for a pro rata approach. The equivalent yearly income, divided by the tax on that yearly income, gives the rate of tax. This rate is then applied to the extended period’s assessable income. Example Farming income for 15 months$35,000 Interest and dividends for 12 months $ 2,300 Total$37,300 Calculation of income for 12 months: Farming income 35000 x 12 =$28,000 15 Plus interest and dividends $ 2,300 Total - income for 12 months$30,300 Tax calculation: Tax on $30,300=$7,272 $37,300 x $7,272=$8,952 $30,300 from page 7 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.9 (February 1994) Meals provided on aircraft Section 106G(3)(j) - Not included in entertainment: A businessman travelled on a domestic flight on which a meal was served during the flight. He wanted to know if the cost of the meal was restricted to 50% deductibility under the enter- tainment regime. In this case the meal was provided as part of the cost of the business-related flight. The meal was incidental to the flight, so the cost of it is not subject to partial deductibility. However, if the flight had been for the purposes of enjoyment of entertainment, food or beverages, the full cost of the flight would be subject to the entertain- ment regime. Interest payable on qualifying tax in dispute Section 34A - Interest on certain excess tax: A taxpayer objected to his 1993 income tax assessment. He had omitted to provide receipts for several items of expenditure. Inland Revenue disallowed the claims, thus reducing the refund calculated by the taxpayer. Eventually the taxpayer provided receipts and Inland Revenue issued a further refund. The taxpayer asked if interest is payable by Inland Revenue and if so, what amount. The interest entitlement applies to competent objections received after 1 April 1985. Under section 34(1) of the Act, a “competent objection” is an objection made in accordance with section 30 of the Act. However, it does not include a “non-qualifying objection”. The definition of a “non-qualifying objection” (also contained in section 34(1)) includes an objection where the grounds of objection are that the return or other particulars relating to the return are deficient or insufficient. In this case the return was deficient because receipts were not supplied. The objection was therefore not competent so no interest was payable to the tax- payer. Accrual expenditure - local authority rates Section 104A(4) - Unexpired portion included in assessable income: A shop- keeper decided to pay the local authority rates covering the current year and an estimate of what she thought would be payable in the following year. She asked if the rates paid in advance are deductible in the 1993 income year. The rates paid in advance are deductible in the 1993 income year under section 104 “except as otherwise provided” in the Act. Section 104A of the Act requires the unexpired portion of expenditure to be added to the assessable income, thereby negating the benefit of an early deduction. Accrual Determination E8 lists accrual expenditure that is not required to be added back to assessable income if certain thresholds and time limits apply. Rates are listed under item “p” in the schedule to the determination. The threshold is limited to the invoiced amount on or before balance date. As the payment made in advance would not have been invoiced, section 104A(4) re- quires the add-back to assessable income. Example: Rates invoiced for 1993$2,100 Rates paid in advance $2,500 Total deduction allowed$4,600 continued on page 10 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.9 (February 1994) Summary: A deduction of $4,600 is allowed. The assessable income is increased by $2,500, being the unexpired portion. The amount of the unexpired portion is deductible in the following year (i.e., $2,100 is allowed in 1993 and $2,500 in 1994). Bad debts subsequently paid Section 106(1)(b) - Bad debts: A garage owner had written off bad debts and claimed a deduction for them. Almost two years after the write-off, he received a small part of the bad debt. He asked if the money received is assessable and if so, when. Any amount received as repayment of a bad debt for which a deduction has been claimed is assessable for income tax under section 65(2)(jc) of the Income Tax Act 1976. (This section was inserted by section 15 of the Income Tax Amend- ment Act (No 3) 1993). The amount will be assessable in the year in which the taxpayer receives it. These amounts were previously assessable under the pro- viso to section 106(1)(b) (since amended). In this case, the garage owner was registered for GST. He also had to make an output tax adjustment in the GST period in which he recovered the debt, under section 26(2) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. If the garage owner ac- counted for GST on a payments basis, output tax is payable in the period the debt is paid by the debtor. Insurance receipts to be taken into account Sections 79(2), 106(1)(c) and 117(5): A dairy owner’s cooling unit became water damaged. The dairy owner received $3,000 compensation. $1,000 of the compen- sation was for lost goods, and $2,000 was for repairs to the cooling unit. The dairy owner asked how the insurance payments will affect his 1994 income. There are two points to consider: 1. Trading stock: The effect of section 79(2) is that the assessable income is in- creased by $1,000. The dairy owner received no other income from the damaged goods. If he did, that income would be assessable in the ordinary course of business. In this case the result on the dairy owner’s assessable income will be nil as the insurance receipt will offset the original deduction for the damaged goods when they were purchased. 2. Depreciated assets: The dairy owner carried out the repairs to the cooling unit. The expenses incurred were $1,546 for parts and other miscellaneous costs. This expenditure is not deductible under section 106(1)(c). Section 117(5) of the Act provides that the amount of the excess of the insurance payment over the costs incurred by the dairy owner ($454) is deducted from the adjusted tax value of the cooling unit. If the excess ($454) is greater than the adjusted tax value, that excess over the adjusted book value is also assessable income (section 117(6)). from page 9 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.9 (February 1994) Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 GST on sale of fishing quota Section 8(1) - Imposition of tax: A fisherman sold some of his unwanted fishing quota in the course of his taxable activity. He asked if the sale is subject to GST. Such a sale is subject to GST, as it is not the sale of a going concern. This is because the quota is not capable of separate operation. Therefore, the transaction cannot be zero-rated under section 11(1)(c) of the Act. Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 Refund of conveyance duty Section 68 - Refund of duty or penalty on application: The purchaser entered into an agreement for sale and purchase of a property. Stamp duty was correctly paid. The purchaser could not obtain full legal title so the agreement was re- scinded, and replaced by a further agreement. The purchaser has asked if the stamp duty paid earlier could be refunded. Where there is clear evidence that the transaction has been abandoned, duty and any penalty arising on the agreement is refunded. If a verbal agreement to rescind the agreement was made, a letter from the solicitors acting on behalf of the purchasers, setting out the facts is usually acceptable evidence. In this case, the replacement agreement was acceptable evidence. The original stamped document was noted, advising that the refund had been made. Had the original document been lost or destroyed, the replacement agreement would have been noted with the amount of the refund. Approved issuer levy Section 86G - Application to register securities: A non-resident depositor asked a building society to treat his deposit as a registered security. Approved issuer levy would then apply to that contract. The building society advised Inland Revenue that this depositor is its only non- resident client, and to change its computer system would be costly. It asked if it had to comply with the depositor’s request. Section 86G allows the building society to apply to Inland Revenue for registra- tion of the transaction. The society is not obliged to do so, and in this case it did not. The depositor has remained a client of the building society, and the correct amount of non-resident withholding tax is being deducted. Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 Overseas income liable to premiums Sections 102 and 114: A New Zealand resident derived income in Singapore as an artist. She asked if this business income earned while overseas is subject to earner and employer premiums. The artist will pay premiums based on her “earnings” from personal exertion. The Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 defines “earnings” which includes all assessable income. Therefore, premiums will be payable on overseas income. 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.9 (February 1994) Child Support Act 1991 Recovery of Child Support arrears by custodian Section 180 - Payee may uplift financial support debt: A custodian was con- cerned that collection of Child Support arrears from an ex-partner was being delayed. She asked whether there was anything she could do to speed matters up. Under section 180 of the Act, the custodian can apply in writing to have Inland Revenue cease collection of any amount in arrears. The custodian can then personally pursue the debt through the District Court. A custodian who is concerned about the collection of spousal maintenance from a former partner can also use section 180. Note that a custodian who was a social security beneficiary at the time the finan- cial support was payable cannot use section 180. Further, any election under this section is irrevocable. Any elections should be in the appropriate approved form - CS 202. You can get this from from any IRD Child Support Agency. Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 Value of stamp collection Section 67 - Valuation of property: A philatelist owned a collection of stamps which she wished to give to a friend. The donor estimates that the collection is worth more than $27,000, but she is unsure as to the exact value. She asked if $27,000 is an appropriate value for gift duty purposes. Under section 67 of the Act, the Commissioner can value the collection in any manner he thinks fit. Inland Revenue will usually seek advice from experienced people in the appropriate field. In this case, a philatelic society helped to value the stamps. A small amount of gift duty was payable on the valuation made as at the date of the gift. Gift duty paid by donee Section 70 - No deduction to be made in respect of benefit to donor: A donor gave $45,000 to each of his three grandchildren, to be held in trust. A condition of the gift was that the trustees would pay any gift duty. The donor did not make any other gifts during the year. The trustees asked how much gift duty is payable. Is duty payable on $135,000? Donors are liable for any gift duty in the first instance. In this case the donor has effectively passed that liability to the donee (although legally the donor is still liable for the duty). This means the value of the gift is the figure arrived at by calculating the sum that, together with gift duty thereon, would produce $135,000. This table will help with this calculation: Known Gross GiftNet Gift 27,000 - 36,45027,000 + 95.238 cents per $ of gross gift over 27,000 36,451 - 56,25036,000 + 90.9091 cents per $ of gross gift over 36,450 56,251 - 77,85054,000 + 83.3334 cents per $ of gross gift over 56,250 Over 77,85072,000 + 80 cents per $ of gross gift over 77,850 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.9 (February 1994) In this case, the dutiable gift is $117,720. Gift duty on that amount is $17,280, giving a total of $135,000. If the donor had gifted $117,720 and paid the duty himself, the result would have been the same. Gaming Duties Act 1971 Interest payable on unpaid totalisator duty Section 8(1) - Interest: The secretary of a racing club asked for clarification of late payment penalties. The club deducts totalisator duty from race day proceeds. It may pay the duty to Inland Revenue immediately or hold it in trust. The due date for payment is within seven days from the day after the race meeting. There will be no interest charged if the duty is paid within one month of the due date. If the duty is not paid within that time, 5 percent interest will be charged on the outstanding amount for every month or part-month that it remains un- paid. If a club has a genuine case for remission of interest charged, it may apply for remission under the Public Finance Act 1989. The club’s application should state whether the trust account required by section 6(2) of the Act has been used, the reason for non-payment, and details of any benefit derived by the club from retention of the duty. Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 Credit interest adjustment Section 42 - Interest adjustment in respect of credit balances: A borrower made payments towards her Student Loan to Inland Revenue. The loan had not been transferred to Inland Revenue by the Loan Manager at the time the payments were made. Inland Revenue must pay credit interest when the Inland Revenue loan account is in credit and the loan has yet to be transferred for that year. The amount of interest is limited to the amount of debit interest transferred to Inland Revenue. When the Loan Manager transferred the loan to Inland Revenue, a credit interest adjustment was made. The borrower asked if the credit interest should have been more as the payments made exceeded the loan transferred. In this case the borrower was credited with $17.34 - the same amount as the debit interest charged when the loan was transferred. 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.9 (February 1994) Legal Decisions - Case Notes This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council.

GST is not leviable on that supply. Facts:Mr and Mrs D were partners in a farming partnership. The farm land consisted of nine separate titles amounting to 290 acres. Mr D was the sole registered proprietor. By 1984, all of the farm land had been sold except for one block of 9.6 hectares. Mr and Mrs D sub-divided the remaining land into two equal 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.9 (February 1994) blocks in 1991, sold one block and retained the other for themselves. Inland Revenue contended that output tax was payable on the land sold. Decision:Judge Willy found that the facts of the case showed that although legal title in the land was vested solely in Mr D at all material times, the land was neverthe- less partnership property. However, for GST purposes it was Mr D who made the supply of land rather, not the partnership. He was the registered proprietor of the land. Mr D was not a registered person for the purposes of the GST Act (as he was unregistered and not liable to be registered). Therefore, the supply was not subject to GST. Comment:Inland Revenue is appealing this decision. Preparatory expenditure in setting up a business Rating:••• Case:TRA 93/183 & 184 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - sections 104 and 106(1)(j) Keywords:New business expenses, in business, gaining or producing assessable income Summary:Expenditure is deductible for tax purposes if it is incurred in gaining or produc- ing assessable income or in the carrying on of a business intended to produce assessable income. Expenditure of a preparatory nature in setting up a business is not deductible. Facts:The objectors purchased a farm in September 1983. They intended to use the site for a mixed venture of deer farming and for running a cat and dog boarding kennel. The objectors and their family spent much time and money bringing the property up to standard for the proposed uses. In late 1983 the objectors made detailed enquiries concerning the operation of the kennels. In the following year the objectors concluded that they would not be able to satisfy the local authority zoning requirements for the kennels. An- other site was purchased a few months later to carry on the kennel business. The business operations undertaken on this second property were not called into question. The first property was sold in 1987. The objectors sought to deduct farming losses arising in the years 1984 to 1988 inclusive. Decision:Judge Willy found in evidence that it was always intended to use the first prop- erty as a mixed venture. However, from the time the kennel business on that site was abandoned, there was no evidence that the objectors intended operating a business on that site or deriving assessable income from it. Deer farming alone was not a viable business concern on that site. Accordingly, losses on the first property for the years ended March 1985, 1986, 1987, and 1988 were disallowed. Expenditure and losses incurred on the first property in the first year of opera- tion (year ended March 1984) were held to be of a preparatory nature and disal- lowed. Considering the dicta of Judge Barker in Duff v CIR (1982) 5 NZTC 61,131, Judge Willy looked at whether the expenditure of money was connected with getting the property ready for carrying on the intended business or with actually carrying on the business. The expenditure on fencing, scrub-cutting, and spraying was of a preparatory nature only. The purchase of a few sheep and calves clearly did not form part of the livestock for the intended activity of deer farming and boarding kennels. Hay was produced but not sold commercially. Comment:We do not know whether the taxpayer will be appealing this decision. 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.9 (February 1994) Assessment of accommodation under section 72 Rating:••• Case:TRA 93/163 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - section 72 Keywords:Residential benefit, monetary remuneration in the form of free accommodation Summary:Inland Revenue assessed the objector under section 72 of the Income Tax Act 1976 for the value of residential accommodation situated above the objector’s warehouse. During the year in question, the 1989/90 income year, the taxpayer only lived in the accommodation occasionally. It was not until later income years that the accommodation was made suitable for full-time living. Facts:After investigating the taxpayer’s affairs Inland Revenue assessed the taxpayer for the value of an accommodation benefit. The accommodation in question was situated above a warehouse owned by a company in which the taxpayer was a major shareholder. The argument put forward by the taxpayer was that during the 1989/90 income year he only occupied the premises on a very casual basis. It was not properly set up as a residential unit. Decision:The Authority accepted the taxpayer’s position and ruled that there was no residential benefit to be assessed to the taxpayer during the 1989/90 income year. Comment:Inland Revenue is not appealing this decision. Sick leave and redundancy Rating:• Case:TRA 93/212 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - section 68 Keywords:Redundancy entitlements, terms of redundancy agreement Summary:The TRA found that a large portion of sick leave entitlement was part of a re- dundancy payment, as it was covered by the terms of a registered redundancy agreement. Special tax treatment applied to redundancy payments at the time. Facts:The objector was made redundant, with 267 days of unused sick leave to his credit. The redundancy agreement between the objector and his employer pro- vided that redundant workers were compensated for all unused sick leave. If the objector’s employment had been terminated for any other reason, he would have been entitled, after 10 years service, to payment at the rate of 1/5 of accumulated sick leave. Decision:The TRA found that the terms of the redundancy agreement provided that workers made redundant were entitled to all their sick leave entitlement. How- ever, those leaving for other reasons were entitled to 1/5 entitlement. As 4/5 of the entitlement was payable only on redundancy, it was not excluded by section 68(5) from the concessionary tax treatment for redundancy payments then in force. Therefore, only 5% of the amount of the payment was subject to tax. Comment:Inland Revenue has not decided whether to appeal this decision. 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.9 (February 1994) National superannuation surcharge on income earned before becoming a national superannuitant Rating:••• Case:TRA 93/112 Act:Income Tax Act - section 336 Keywords:National superannuation surcharge, other income. Summary:A superannuitant received interest income after the date on which he qualified to receive national superannuation. Although part of the interest was earned before that date, the full amount must be taken into account for the purposes of the formula used in deciding the amount of the national superannuation sur- charge payable. Inland Revenue cannot apportion the interest. Facts:The taxpayer invested money at interest on 7 September 1990, and became entitled to receive national superannuation on 8 April 1991. The loan matured on 6 September 1991. The taxpayer maintained that the interest should be appor- tioned, and the amount earned before the date on which he qualified for super- annuation ought not to be taken into account when calculating his surcharge. Decision:The question of whether the interest could be apportioned was to be considered in the light of the common law principles upon which Inland Revenue can apportion interest received by non-business taxpayers. Unlike traders, non- business taxpayers are not assessable for income tax until they get their money. To shift the taxation of such individuals onto a receivables basis would be unfair to most taxpayers and contrary to the clear weight of authority. Inland Revenue was correct in assessing the whole of the income on the basis of its actual receipt in the income year. Comment:We do not know whether the taxpayer will be appealing this decision Whether taxi business purchased as a going concern Rating:•• Case:TRA No. 93/136 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 - sections 2, 11, 20 Keywords:Taxis, going concern, input tax claim Summary:This matter involves the acquisition of a taxi business by the objectors. Inland Revenue disallowed an input tax claim made by the taxpayers on the grounds that the taxpayers were unable to show that GST had been charged to them on the supply. The taxpayers objected and the case proceeded to the Taxation Review Authority (TRA). The TRA upheld Inland Revenue’s decision. Facts:The taxi business was operated in a rural locality. All the taxi proprietors operat- ing in that area belonged to a local taxi association which was a limited liability company. The proprietors owned shares in the Association. The vendor, in this case, owned 600 shares. Because of past difficulties associated with the GST implications of transferring taxi businesses and accompanying licences, the Association resolved at one of its meetings to establish certain rules for such transfers. The objectors contended that they purchased their taxi business on the basis of these rules. They acquired the business on 13 June 1991 for $18,000. $17,999.90 was appropriated to good- will and 10 cents to the value of the shares. It was intended that the $18,000 should be inclusive of GST. continued on page 18 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.9 (February 1994) Decision:Judge Willy accepted the terms of the arrangement insofar as they represented the general intentions of the company speaking on behalf of its members. How- ever, he pointed out that the intentions of the shareholder members of the asso- ciation could not bind individual vendors and purchasers. The objectors failed to produce clear evidence of the terms upon which they had contracted with the vendor for the purchase of the taxi business. Judge Willy also commented that since deregulation, Inland Revenue’s policy statement contained in Public Information Bulletin 175 cannot have any rel- evance to the sale of taxi businesses. This is because the transfer of taxi licences was no longer necessary. He stated that the purchase of a vendor’s interest in a taxi co-operative company could of itself constitute a going concern. This was on the basis that the objectors were purchasing the vendor’s business. The fact that the purchasers did not buy the vendor’s vehicle was considered to be only one element in deciding whether or not the supply was that of a going concern. Judge Willy indicated that if he had to decide on the evidence before him he would have considered the supply to be that of a going concern and therefore zero-rated for GST purposes. In this case the objectors had failed to show that the $18,000 paid for the pur- chase of the business was GST inclusive and that the business was not a going concern. As a result the case was decided in Inland Revenue’s favour. Comment:We do not know if the taxpayer will be appealing this decision. Whether profits from property sales taxable Rating:•• Case:TRA Case 83/228: TRA Decision 55/93 Act:Land and Income Tax Act 1954 - sections 88(1)(c) and 88AA(1) & Property Speculation Tax Act 1973 Keywords:purpose of selling or otherwise disposing of, purpose or intention of selling or otherwise disposing of, work of a minor nature Summary:This case dealt primarily with the assessability of profits that the objector de- rived from certain property transactions under the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 and the Property Speculation Tax Act 1973. The transactions took place in the financial years from 1974 to 1976. The Authority found that profits arising from some of the transactions were assessable as the properties in question were purchased with the intention of resale. Profits from the remaining transactions were not assessable. The case also addresses the character of several payments made to the objector in these peri- ods which were not “returned”. These were found to be not revenue in character and therefore not assessable. Facts:The objector is a solicitor. During the relevant period he purchased and sold several properties. Inland Revenue assessed the objector on the profits that he derived from these transactions. We considered that the objector bought the properties with the intention of reselling them. The objection followed. Decision:Judge Barber held that the resulting profits from two of the transactions were assessable because the objector had entered into those transactions with the intention of reselling the properties. Judge Barber also found that the profit on the sale of a flat was subject to property speculation tax at the rate of 90%. How- ever, he held that the profits from a transaction involving the amalgamation of a from page 17 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.9 (February 1994) large block with two smaller sections, the moving of a house onto the site and preparatory subdivision work before its sale, were not assessable. Judge Barber found that the objector had intended to establish a family home and orchard on the property, but then changed his mind. The Authority held that the develop- ment and subdivision work carried out on the property was work only of a minor nature. The Authority also held that the payments in question, that the objector received but did not return, were not revenue in nature and were therefore not assess- able. Comment:We do not yet know whether the objector or Inland Revenue will appeal any aspects of this decision. 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.9 (February 1994) Due dates reminder March 5 PAYE deductions and deduction schedules for last 13†days of February 1994 due - ìlargeî employers only. 7 First instalment of 1995 provisional tax due for taxpayers with November balance dates.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.9 (February 1994) - Appendix Determination G5C: Mandatory conversion convertible notes This determination may be cited as ìDetermination G5C: Mandatory Conversion Convertible Notesî. 1. Explanation (which does not form part of this determination). (1) This determination replaces Determination G5B: Mandatory Conversion Convertible Notes for notes entered into on, or after, the date of publication of this determination in the Gazette. (2) A Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note is a financial arrangement in which the holder of the Note provides money to a company, and the debt is discharged at a future date by the issue of shares (or stock) in any company. Interest may be payable for the period between the issue of the Note and conver- sion into shares. Such payments are called Coupon Interest Payments. (3) As a share is an excepted financial arrangement under section 64B of the Act, only the Coupon Interest Payments and amount attributed to those payments by this determination are regarded as income or expenditure for the purposes of calculat- ing accrual income or expenditure. (4) Determination G5C prescribes the method to be used when calculating for accrual purposes the income derived or expenditure incurred in respect of a Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note. It also details which amounts are to be included for this calculation, and which are attributable to an ex- cepted financial arrangement. (5) Determination G5C differs from Determination G5B by (a) broadening the scope of the determination so that it applies to a Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note converting into shares in a company other than the company that issued the Note; and (b) narrowing the scope of the determination so that it only applies to a Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note where the interest rate is not less than 5% pa (or half of the interest rate the issuer would have paid on cash repayment borrowings if lower) nor more than 15% pa (or double of the interest rate the issuer would have paid on cash repayment borrowings if higher). 2. Reference This determination is made pursuant to section 64E(1)(b) and (e), and section 64E(6) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 3. Scope of Determination Except where its application is specifically excluded in another determination, Determination G5C applies to every Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note which: (1) Is entered into on, or after, the date of publication in the Gazette (however, it does not apply to notes which are issued pursuant to a binding contract entered into before the date of publication); and (2) Meets the following criteria: (a) conversion into shares of a company is at a predetermined ratio; and (b) Coupon Interest Payments are payable at regular intervals of not more than 12 months; and (c) Coupon Interest Payments are of equal amount, or are set in relation to a market interest rate indicator (if this condition is not satisfied because of the issue date or conversion date of the Note, but the rate at which the payment is calculated is consistent with the other Coupon Interest Payments required under the Note, this determination shall apply as if the condition were met); and (d) the constant annual rate R calculated using Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method, applied to the Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note is: (i) not less than the lesser of: (A) 5% pa; or (B) half the annual coupon which the com- pany issuing the Note would have had to pay on similarly secured borrowings of similar amount as at the date of issue; and (ii) not more than the greater of: (A) 15% pa; or (B) twice the coupon which the company issuing the Note would have had to pay on similarly secured borrowings of similar amount as at the date of issue; and taking into account the amount or amounts payable by the holder consequent upon issue and assuming that - (iii) Coupon Interest Payments will be paid to the holder in accordance with the terms of the Note provided that if the Coupon Interest Payments are set in relation to a market interest rate indicator, the value of that indicator as at the issue date shall be assumed to apply for the term of the Note; and continued on page 2 TIB Appendix Volume Five, No. 9February 1994 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.9 (February 1994) - Appendix (1) Expressions used, except the expression ìIncome Yearî, have the same meaning as in section 2 and section 64B of the Income Tax Act 1976. (a) the ìActî means the Income Tax Act 1976. (b) ìCoupon Interest Paymentî means any amount payable on the Note by the Note issuer (bor- rower) to the Note holder (lender) other than payments relating to the redemption or conver- sion of the Note. (c) ìIncome Yearî (i) when a taxpayer furnishes a return of income under section 15 of the Act for an accounting year ending with a balance date other than the 31st day of March, ìIncome Yearî means the period of twelve months ending on that balance date. (ii) for any other person, ìIncome Yearî means the year ending on the 31st†day of March in which the income has been derived or expenditure has been incurred by that person. (d) ìMandatory Conversion Convertible Noteî, or ìNoteî means any debenture, bond, certificate, document, note or writing issued or given by a company: (i) which provides evidence that the company is indebted to the holder of the Note, whether for a loan to the company, money subscribed to the company or any other liability of the company (whether or not the amount for which the company has issued the Note is secured over the undertaking or any of the assets of the company); and (ii) which provides for the debt to be discharged only by the issue of shares in the capital of any company. This may be pursuant to a trust deed. (e) ìUnderlying Sharesî in relation to a Note means the shares or stock into which the Note is convertible, or in which it may be redeemed or paid. (2) A determination to which Determination G5C refers may be changed or rescinded by a new determination made by the Commissioner. In such a case, a reference to the old determination is taken to be extended to the new determination. (3) For convenience, words and phrases defined in this determination are indicated by initial capital letters, but the absence of a capital letter shall not alone imply that the word or phrase is used with a mean- ing different from that given by its definition. 6. Method (1) Amounts to be included when calculating income or expenditure with regard to a Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note: from page 1 (iv) the only payment (other than a coupon payment) made to the holder on the conver- sion of the Note is a cash payment equal to the issue price of the Note; and (e) the Note is not part of another financial arrange- ment. 4. Principle (1) A Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note has both debt and equity components. It can be regarded alternatively as: (a) a loan to a company with repayment in shares (debt component); or (b) a forward purchase of shares (in which case the holder of the Note is buying a share of a business and has equity in it). The accruals regime is not intended to deal with equity, and therefore classifies a share (equity in a business) as an excepted financial arrangement (see section 64B). (2) As a Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note has this dual character, when calculating income/ expenditure in relation to the Note it is first neces- sary to separate the debt and equity components of the Note. (3) This determination specifies that, apart from the Coupon Interest Payments and amounts attributed to those payments by this determination, all amounts relate to the underlying shares (equity component), and will not be dealt with under the accruals regime (section 64B to 64M) when calculating assessable income. (4) Income and expenditure in respect of the Note is calculated by pro-rata daily apportionment of the Coupon Interest Payment to income years. (5) For the purposes of this determination it is assumed that any change in the market value of the shares between the issue date of the Note and the conver- sion into shares is due to the equity component. Therefore the difference in share price can be ignored when calculating income and expenditure. (6) This approach may not be appropriate where the coupon interest rate is so much above or below market rates at the time of issue that it may repre- sent an adjustment between the acquisition price of the Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note and the expected value, as at the time of issue, of the under- lying shares at the time of conversion. This determi- nation has therefore been limited as set out in paragraph (d) of subclause 3(2). 5. Interpretation In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires: 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.9 (February 1994) - Appendix (a) in respect of income, gain or loss, or expenditure, and also of any other consideration receivable by the holder or payable by the issuer, the amounts taken into account to calculate income/expendi- ture consist of: (i) Coupon Interest Payments; (ii) amounts attributed to Coupon Interest Payments as set out in subclause 6(3). (b) in respect of the acquisition price, the amounts to be included when calculating income/expendi- ture are those attributed to Coupon Interest Payments as set out in subclause 6(4). (2) The income derived or expenditure incurred in respect of a Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note shall be calculated by daily apportionment of the Coupon Interest Payments to Income Years. For the method, see Determination G1A: Apportionment of Daily Income and Expenditure. (3) If a Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note on which interest is payable is sold part way through an interest period, then it is necessary to apportion the Coupon Interest Payment between the seller and the purchaser. The seller is allocated interest, on a daily straight line basis, that accrues before the date of sale. (See Example C). Note: If the Coupon Interest Payment is not known until after the date of sale, it shall be assumed to be equal to the Coupon Interest Payment for the previous period (adjusted for any difference in the length of the period). (4) The portion of the sale price thus attributed to accrued interest and allocated to the seller is, in turn, treated as the purchaserís acquisition price of the financial arrangement. If the purchaser later receives the Coupon Interest Payment for the sale period, then this portion attributed to accrued interest may be immediately offset against the amount received when calculating the amount of income derived from the financial arrangement in that year. (See Example C). 7. Example Example A On 13 September 1987 a convertible Note is issued for $100 with an interest coupon of 12% pa payable half- yearly in arrears. The Note is mandatorily convertible on 13†September 1988 to 10 shares in the issuing company. The market value of each share at issue date is $9.00. By conversion date this has risen to $15.00. Both the issuer and the holder use a 31 March balance date and apply Determination G1A on a 365 day basis when apportioning daily income and expenditure. The Coupon Interest Payments are made as follows: 13 March 1988$6.00 13 September 1988$6.00 (a) Year Ended 31 March 1988 Coupon payment 13/3/88$6.00 Apportionment of coupon payment due on 13/9/88. There are 18 days between 13 March and 31 March 1988, and 184 days between 13 March and 13 September 1988 18/184 x $6.00$0.59 Income/Expenditure$6.59 (b) Year Ended 31 March 1989 As the Note matures in this year the base price adjustment (section 64F of the Act) is required. The formula a - (b + c) is applied. a = the sum of all amounts paid ($12.00) b = acquisition price c = income/expenditure in previous years ($6.59). As all amounts other than the coupon payments are attributable to the underlying shares, the issue price and sharemarket value can be ignored for the purposes of calculating income and expenditure. This effectively gives the Note an acquisition price of nil (for accrual purposes). Therefore, in this example ìbî has a value of zero. Income/Expenditure = a - (b + c) = $12.00 - (0 + $6.59) = $5.41 Example B On 13 November 1992 a convertible Note is issued for $100 with an interest coupon of 10% pa payable half- yearly in arrears. The first period is only for 5 months. The Note is mandatorily convertible on 13 October 1994 to 10 shares in the issuing company. The market value of each share at issue date is $9.00. By conversion date this has risen to $15.00. Both the issuer and the holder use a 31 March balance date and apply Determination G1A on a 365 day basis when apportioning daily income and expenditure. The Coupon Interest Payments are made as follows: 13 April 1993$4.15 13 October 1993$5.00 13 April 1994$5.00 13 October 1994$5.00 (a) Year Ended 31 March 1993 Apportionment of coupon payment due on 13/4/93. There are a total of 151 days in the first period. Of these, 138 are in the Income Year ended 31 March 1993. 138/151 x $4.15$3.79 Income/Expenditure$3.79 continued on page 4 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.9 (February 1994) - Appendix holder and acquisition price to the new holder. The original holder would be considered to have sold the equity portion of the convertible Note for $118.99. (a) Income For The Original Holder: Year Ended 31†March 1993 Since this is the final year of the arrangement from the point of view of the original holder, the base price adjustment is applied, using the following values: a = the sum of all amounts paid ($1.01) b = acquisition price c = income/expenditure in previous years ($0) Income = a - (b + c) = $1.01 - (0 + 0) = $1.01 (b) Income For The New Holder: Year Ended 31†March 1993 Apportionment of coupon payment 13/4/93. There are a total of 151 days in the first period. Of these, 138 are in the year ended 31 March 1993. 138/151 x $4.15$3.79 From this, the holder can subtract the acquisition price $1.01 Income/Expenditure$2.78 (c) Year Ended 31 March 1994 As for Example B. Income$10.00 (d) Year Ended 31 March 1995 As the Note matures in this year the base price adjustment (section 64F of the Act) is required. The formula a - (b + c) is applied: a = the sum of all amounts paid ($19.15) b = acquisition price ($1.01) c = income/expenditure in previous years ($12.78) Income/Expenditure = a - (b + c) = $19.15 - ($1.01 + $12.78) = $5.36 This determination is signed by me on the 18th day of February in the year 1994. P Barrand Deputy Commissioner of Inland Revenue from page 3 (b) Year Ended 31 March 1994 Apportionment of coupon payment due on 13/4/94. There are a total of 151 days in the first period. Of these, 13 are in the year ended 31 March 1994. 13/151 x $4.15$ 0.36 Coupon Payment due on 13/10/93$ 5.00 Apportionment of coupon payment due on 13/4/94. There are a total of 182 days in the period between payments. Of these, 169 are in the year ended 31 March 1994 169/182 x $5.00$ 4.64 Income/Expenditure$10.00 (c) Year Ended 31 March 1995 As the Note matures in this year the base price adjustment (section 64F of the Act) is required. The formula a - (b + c) is applied: a = sum of all amounts paid ($19.15) b = acquisition price c = income/expenditure in previous years ($13.79) As all amounts other than the coupon payments are attributable to the underlying shares, the issue price and share market values can be ignored for the purposes of calculating income and expenditure. This effectively gives the Note an acquisition price of nil (for accrual purposes), hence in this example ìbî has a value of zero. Income/Expenditure = a - (b + c) = $19.15 - (0 + $13.79) = $5.36 Example C The original holder of the Note described in Example B sells the Note on 20†December 1992, for $120, to a new holder who holds the Note to maturity. The sale of the Note takes place part way through an interest period, so it is necessary to apportion the Coupon Interest Payment between the seller and the purchaser. The Coupon Interest Payment for this period amounts to $4.15. Using a straight-line apportionment, $1.01 of the $4.15 is attributable to that portion of the period ending 20†December 1992 during which the Note is owned by the original holder ($4.15 x 37/151). There are 151 days in the coupon period, and there are 37 days from the beginning of the period until the day that the Note is sold. This amount of $1.01 is income to the original

Establishment of NSC where calcula- tion of NSC using any of paragraphs 3 to 7 produces nil values In the event of any of the formulas in paragraphs 3 to 7 of this determination producing an average value at the end of an income year of nil, the average value shall be deemed to be, in the case of: ï a rising one year class of livestock, the national standard cost of rising one year livestock of that type for that income year; and ï a rising two year and older intake of livestock other than rising three year male non-breeding cattle, the national standard cost for rising one year livestock of that type plus the national standard cost for rising two year livestock of that type for that income year; and ï rising three year male non-breeding cattle, the national standard cost for rising one year male non-breeding cattle plus an amount equal to twice the national standard cost for rising two year male non-breeding cattle for that income year. Inventory system requirements under the National Standard Cost scheme 11. General In respect of sheep, cattle, deer and goats, as this livestock ages until it becomes mature livestock, the costs of production of the livestock accumulate and are incorporated into average values over balance dates. Once the livestock has first become mature livestock of the taxpayer at the end of an income year, the value of the livestock to the taxpayer under the national standard cost scheme becomes fixed (not accumulating any further production costs) and remains in the taxpayerís inventory valuation for the mature inventory grouping until such time as the livestock is sold, transferred to another livestock valuation option or dies (each as determined having regard to any sub-inventory grouping adopted by the taxpayer and to the cost flow identification system applied by the taxpayer, as each is detailed further below). In respect of pigs, the average cost identified with respect to the pigs entering inventory in any particu- lar income year and remaining on hand at the end of the income year remains fixed (not accumulating any further production costs) and remains in the taxpayerís inventory valuation for the mature inventory grouping until such time as the pigs are sold, transferred to another livestock valuation option or die (as each is determined having regard to any sub-inventory grouping adopted by the taxpayer and to the cost flow identification system applied by the taxpayer, as each is detailed further below). For the purposes of identifying the end of year valuation of mature livestock under the national standard cost scheme, a taxpayer must have a cost flow identification system involving specific identifi- cation, average costing or first-in first-out (FIFO) costing, as detailed further in paragraphs 13 to 15 of this determination. The average cost inventory system or the first in first out inventory system represent the minimum standard of inventory accounting for all types of livestock. The taxpayer may choose to use more accurate inventory accounting systems. Different systems may be adopted by the same taxpayer for different types of livestock. Where a mature inventory grouping of a type of livestock is broken down by a taxpayer into sub- inventory groups (as detailed further below), each sub-inventory group of that type of livestock must be valued by the taxpayer under the national standard cost scheme using the same cost flow identification system. Where a taxpayer is using the national standard cost scheme to value any livestock of a type within an inventory grouping, or as the case may be, sub- inventory group, the taxpayer shall value all live- stock of that inventory grouping or sub-inventory group under the national standard cost scheme, except for: ï livestock of that type valued under the herd scheme at the end of the relevant income year; or ï Bailees who elect to account for deficiencies of bailed livestock at market value or replacement price. 12. Separate sub-inventory groups for non-breeding and breeding livestock Notwithstanding any other provisions of this deter- mination (including in particular the formulae in paragraphs 3 to 7), a taxpayer may elect to establish separate sub-inventory groups, with respect to each livestock type, for the livestock: (a) Intended to be used by the taxpayer for breeding purposes; and (b) Intended to be used by the taxpayer for purposes other than breeding. Where separate sub-inventory groups are established by a taxpayer: 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.11 (April 1994) - Appendices (c) All livestock of the relevant inventory group which are valued under the national standard cost scheme and are intended for breeding purposes or, as the case may be, purposes other than breeding purposes, must be included in the relevant sub-inventory group of the taxpayer until disposed of or death; and (d) Separate calculations of average cost for each sub-inventory group may be made under the formulae in paragraph 3 to 7 of this determina- tion and the taxpayer may separately apply the cost flow identification system adopted by the taxpayer for mature livestock of that type to each sub-inventory group. Once livestock is included in a sub-inventory group it must continue to be accounted for under that sub- inventory group until treated as sold, disposed of, or valued under one of the other livestock valuation options. It may not be moved to another sub-inven- tory group. Cost flow identification systems for the valuation of mature livestock 13. First-in first-out system (FIFO) Where the taxpayer elects to use the FIFO system for cost flow identification, the cost and number of the livestock intake entering the taxpayerís inventory system in an income year must be recorded. In accordance with the normal rules applying under FIFO systems, dispositions and deaths of mature livestock of the type in question, and where the taxpayer so elects maturing livestock of that type, will be treated as reducing first the oldest intake of livestock of that type on hand. A taxpayer may however, at the taxpayerís option and to such extent as the taxpayer chooses, with regard to any specific livestock, adopt a specific identification system for accounting for acquisitions, dispositions and deaths. Refinements to the minimum standard of the FIFO inventory system as described above to more accu- rately account for purchases, sales and deaths affecting different intake years within the FIFO inventory system may be made. Where the average closing cost calculated in accord- ance with paragraphs 4 and 6 (and 7 at the taxpay- erís option) of this determination is to be used in association with the minimum standard FIFO inventory system that average closing cost shall be applied to all of the livestock intake of that livestock in that income year valued under the provisions of section 86C of the Act at the end of the income year. 14. Average cost system where the herd scheme was not used in the current income year or in the immediately preceding income year This inventory system is the minimum standard of inventory accounting where the herd scheme was not used in the preceding income year or the current income year. Where a taxpayer uses the average cost system of cost flow identification, the value of the taxpayerís mature and maturing inventory grouping of any type under the national standard cost scheme at the end of an income year shall be calculated by multiplying the number of mature and maturing livestock of that type on hand by the average cost calculated in accordance with the following formula in relation to that type of mature and maturing livestock and the income year: ( (a - b) x c) + ((e - (a - b)) x d) e where - a is the number of livestock of the taxpayer on hand at the end of the immediately preceding income year, being at that time mature livestock; b is the lesser of a and - (i) The number of livestock of the taxpayer on hand at the end of the immediately preceding year, being at that time mature livestock; or (ii) At the election of the taxpayer except where the livestock are pigs, the number of livestock of the taxpayer, being livestock of the tax- payer on hand at the end of the immediately preceding income year which were at the time mature livestock or during the income year maturing livestock of the taxpayer,- which are disposed of by the taxpayer or die (while owned by the taxpayer) during the income year; c is the average cost or value of mature livestock of the taxpayer on hand at the end of the immedi- ately preceding income year; d is the average cost of livestock intake of the taxpayer as calculated under paragraph 4, 6 or 7 of this determination; e is the number of mature livestock of the taxpayer on hand at the end of the income year. The average closing cost calculated according to the formula shall be applied to all livestock of the mature inventory group which are to be valued under using the average cost system the provisions of section 86C of the Act at the end of the income year. 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.11 (April 1994) - Appendices 15. Average cost system where the herd scheme was used in the preceding income year or is to be used in the current income year This inventory system is the minimum standard of inventory accounting where the herd scheme was used in the preceding income year or is to be used in the current income year. Where a taxpayer uses the average cost system of cost flow identification, the value of the taxpayerís mature and maturing inventory grouping of any type under the national standard cost scheme at the end of the income year shall be calculated by multiplying the number of mature and maturing livestock of that type by the average cost calculated in accordance with the following formula in relation to that type of mature and maturing livestock and the income year: ((a - b) x c) + ((e - (a - b)) x d) e where - a is the number of livestock of the taxpayer on hand at the end of the immediately preceding income year, being at that time mature livestock valued under a valuation method other than the herd scheme; b is the lesser of a and - (i) The number of livestock, other than male breeding sires, of the taxpayer on hand at the end of the immediately preceding year, being at that time mature livestock; or (ii) At the election of the taxpayer, except where the livestock are pigs, the number of live- stock, other than male breeding sires, of the type of the taxpayer, being livestock of the taxpayer on hand at the end of the immedi- ately preceding income year which were at the time mature livestock or during the income year maturing livestock of the taxpayer,- which are disposed of by the taxpayer or die (while owned by the taxpayer) during the income year; c is the average cost or value of mature livestock of the taxpayer on hand at the end of the immedi- ately preceding income year valued under a valuation method other than the herd scheme; d is the average cost of livestock intake of the taxpayer as calculated under paragraph 4, 6 or 7 of this determination; e is the number of mature livestock of the taxpayer on hand at the end of the income year valued under the national standard cost scheme. The average closing cost calculated according to the formula is applied to all of the livestock of the mature inventory group which are to be valued using the average cost system under the provisions of section 86C of the Act at the end of the income year. Where the herd scheme is to be used in conjunction with national standard cost in relation to a type of livestock and no rising one year livestock of that type (or rising two year male non-breeding dairy or beef cattle in the case of dairy or beef cattle) were valued using a valuation method other than the herd scheme in the immediately preceding income year, then the rules contained in paragraph 28 of this determination must be applied before calculating the average closing cost in accordance with this para- graph. 16. Change in cost flow identification system when using the national standard cost scheme Subject to the rules contained in this paragraph and in the following paragraphs of this determination, a taxpayer may change the cost flow identification system used when valuing the taxpayerís mature inventory grouping under the national standard cost scheme from FIFO to average cost or vice versa. Where a taxpayer changes to the average cost system, for the purposes of determining the average cost in the year of change, the average cost of mature livestock of the type in question on hand at the end of the immediately preceding income year will be calculated as follows: a b where: a is the total closing cost of that inventory group- ing valued under national standard cost in the preceding income year; and b is the total closing number of livestock in that inventory grouping valued under national standard cost in the preceding income year. If the FIFO inventory system is being adopted, the opening inventory cost in the year of the change will be the total closing cost of that inventory grouping in the immediately preceding income year. 17. Reduction in livestock numbers where stock valued under national standard cost scheme and the herd scheme Where a taxpayer in any income year values any livestock under the herd scheme and also values other livestock of the same type under the national standard cost scheme, any reduction in the number of livestock of that type below the number on hand at the end of the immediately preceding income year must first be accounted for from the relevant class 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.11 (April 1994) - Appendices (in any case where the taxpayer adopts a class by class separation of livestock numbers) or inventory grouping valued at the end of the immediately preceding income year under the national standard cost scheme. Accordingly, any reduction in the number of livestock of that type shall only com- mence to reduce the number of livestock valued under the herd scheme: (a) In any case where the taxpayer uses an inventory system which separates out livestock of that class, where no livestock of that class is on hand at the end of the income year to be valued under the national standard cost scheme; or (b) In any case where the taxpayer uses an inventory system which does not separately identify livestock of that class, where no livestock of the relevant inventory grouping is on hand at the end of the income year to be valued under the national standard cost scheme. 18. Treatment of livestock bailed by a taxpayer which may be valued under the national standard cost scheme Under section 86C(3) of the Act, taxpayers who bail livestock are only eligible to use the national stand- ard cost scheme in relation to bailed livestock where the taxpayer expects to have the livestock originally bailed to be re-delivered. In such a case, the provi- sions of this determination shall apply as if the bailed livestock were livestock on hand. Movement between National Standard Cost and other livestock valuation schemes 19. Changing from herd scheme, market value option or replacement price option to national standard cost scheme In respect of each livestock type, in the income year in which the national standard cost scheme is first adopted by the taxpayer, the opening inventory structure and cost must be calculated, in accordance with the appropriate paragraph 20 or 21 of this determination, in order to allow calculation of the closing inventory number and cost in respect of that type of livestock in that income year under the provisions of paragraphs 13 to 15 of this determina- tion. 20. Where the taxpayer adopts the aver- age cost system of cost flow identifi- cation If a taxpayer is to use the average cost system in respect of livestock valued under the national standard cost scheme, in respect of each relevant inventory grouping of livestock, the average cost at the beginning of the income year will be deemed to be equal to the amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: a b where - a is the aggregate value adopted for income tax purposes in the preceding income year by the taxpayer in respect of all classes of livestock of the taxpayer of the type which would have been included in the inventory grouping on hand at the end of the immediately preceding income year; b is the number of livestock of the taxpayer of the type which would have been included in the inventory grouping on hand at the end of the immediately preceding income year. 21. Where the taxpayer adopts the FIFO system of cost flow identification If a taxpayer is to use the FIFO system to account for livestock under the national standard cost scheme, the value of the opening inventory of mature live- stock of the taxpayer in the relevant income year will be equal to the values for income tax purposes of each class of livestock of the taxpayer in an inven- tory grouping of the type in question on hand at the end of the immediately preceding income year. For the purposes of application of the FIFO system in the income year of the change and subsequent income years, the opening inventory of mature livestock (in all cases other than pigs) shall be subdivided and be deemed to be aged as follows (from newest to oldest): (a) Rising two year female breeding stock; (b) Older classes of female breeding stock (subdi- vided and ranked from newest to oldest to the extent possible having regard to the taxpayerís preceding tax accounting system); (c) Non-breeding livestock (excluding male non- breeding dairy cattle and male non-breeding beef cattle); (d) Male breeding stock. In the case of pigs, the mature livestock included in opening inventory in the income year shall be subdivided and be deemed to be aged as follows (from newest to oldest): (a) Weaner pigs less than 10 weeks of age; (b) Growing pigs between 10 and 17 weeks of age; (c) Pigs over 17 weeks of age; (d) Breeding sows less than one year old; 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.11 (April 1994) - Appendices (e) Breeding sows over one year of age; (f) Breeding boars. The FIFO system will be applied accordingly, in the income year in which the national standard cost scheme is first adopted and in subsequent income years in which it is used, so that dispositions and deaths are deemed to reduce first the oldest still existing class of mature livestock. 22. Change from national standard cost scheme to the herd scheme, market value option or replacement price option for any complete inventory grouping Irrespective of which cost flow identification system was used in the income year preceding the year of the change, the opening value of the livestock of the inventory grouping in the year of change shall be treated as being equal to the value for tax purposes at the end of the immediately preceding income year. A value of the livestock at the end of the year of change will be calculated accordingly under the chosen valuation option on an class-by-class basis. 23. Change from national standard cost scheme to the herd scheme for some livestock only If the number of livestock of an inventory grouping moved from valuation under the national standard cost scheme to valuation under the herd scheme in any income year still leaves some livestock of the particular inventory grouping to be valued under the national standard cost scheme at the end of the income year, then paragraphs 24 to 26 (as appropri- ate) of this determination shall apply. 24. Average cost system used in year preceding the year of change If the average cost system of cost flow identification was used in the income year preceding the income year of change to the herd scheme, the number of livestock moved to the herd scheme shall be ac- counted for as if they were livestock disposed of or dying in the income year (see paragraphs 14 and 15 of this determination). No adjustment is required to opening inventory numbers and costs. 25. FIFO system used in year preceding the year of change If the closing inventory system used in the income year preceding the income year of the change to the herd scheme was the FIFO system, then the number moved to the Herd scheme will be deemed to have been derived from the oldest inventory on hand at the opening balance date in the income year of the change to the Herd scheme in the same manner as sales and deaths are accounted for when using the FIFO type of inventory system unless the inventory account has been accurately prepared on an age class by age class basis with the appropriate costs per head recorded for each group of livestock in each age class, under which conditions, the adjustment to closing inventory numbers and costs can be made on a class by class basis. 26. Change in cost flow identification system in the same income year as some livestock are moved from the national standard cost scheme to the herd scheme system of valuation If a change in the cost flow identification system is made in the same income year as some livestock are moved to the herd scheme, this adjustment shall be effected only after the appropriate adjustment has been made for moving those livestock to the herd scheme on the basis of the cost flow identification system used in the immediately preceding income year. 27. Complete change from national standard cost scheme to self assessed cost or from self-assessed cost to national standard cost scheme The value of livestock of each type on hand in each inventory grouping at the end of the immediately preceding income year under the preceding method will be deemed to be the opening value of livestock of that type in that inventory grouping in the year of change. Any change in the cost flow identification system accompanying the change will be subject to paragraphs 16 and 26 of this determination. 28. Value of Livestock where NSC used in conjunction with the herd scheme. Where a taxpayer has adopted the herd scheme for any class of livestock in any income year and the livestock numbers for that class are more than the base number of herd scheme animals, in accordance with section 86D(5) of the Act, and wishes to value those livestock under the national standard cost scheme, the following provisions will apply: For the purposes of calculating national standard cost for those livestock the opening value of rising 1 year livestock and rising 2 year male non-breeding dairy and beef cattle the definition of ëdí in the formulae in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of this determina- tion will be: In the case of paragraph 4 and 5:- The opening number of rising 1 year livestock of that type multiplied by the national standard cost calculated for rising 1 year livestock of that type for, at the taxpayersí option, the current or immediately preceding income year using the formula contained in paragraph 3 and 5. 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.11 (April 1994) - Appendices In the case of paragraph 6:- The opening number of rising 2 year male non- breeding dairy or beef cattle multiplied by the national standard cost calculated for rising 2 year male non-breeding dairy or beef cattle in, at the taxpayersí option, the current or immediately preceding income year using the formulae in paragraphs 3 and 5. In the event of there being no rising 1 year livestock of that type or rising 2 year male non-breeding dairy or beef cattle on hand in either the current or immediately preceding income year on which to base the calculations in paragraphs 4, 5 or 6, the national standard cost will be the average purchase cost of the rising 2 year livestock of that type or the rising three year male non-breeding dairy or beef cattle. This Determination is made and signed by me on the 29th day of March 1994. Simon Sherry Director (Rulings) 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.11 (April 1994) - Appendices Appendix B Current balance date policy The Commissionerís current policy on balance dates remains in force. Weíve reproduced this below as it appeared in TIB Volume 3 No 9 (June 1992). Introduction This article sets out Inland Revenueís policy on balance dates for income tax purposes. Taxpayers may adopt a balance date other than 31†March (a ìnon-standard balance dateî) where: ï the nature of their business makes a 31 March balance date inappropriate; or ï a subsidiary wishes to align its balance date with its parent company; or ï an estate wishes to adopt the deceasedís date of death; or ï a shareholder-employee wants the same balance date as the company. This item sets out the criteria which we will follow when we receive a request for a non-standard balance date. Current practice Section 2 of the Income Tax Act 1976 defines ìincome yearî to mean the ìyearî in which the income is de- rived. This means a year commencing on 1 April and ending on the following 31†March. Returns of income must therefore cover the year ended 31 March. However, section 15 allows a taxpayer (with the consent of the Commissioner) to elect to furnish a return of income for the year ending on the date of the annual balance of the accounts. In these cases the income derived during the accounting year is deemed to be derived for tax purposes during the income year ending on the 31 March nearest to the taxpayerís balance date. All balance dates from 1 April to 30 September inclu- sive in the same calendar year relate to the previous 31†March, and all balance dates from 1 October to 30 March inclusive relate to the following 31 March. Examples: Accounting yearCorresponding income year 31 October 199131 March 1992 28 February 199231 March 1992 30 June 199231 March 1992 30 September 199231 March 1992 Currently, a small number of recognised industry non- standard balance dates are approved. We have completed a review of our policy, and there are more circumstances in which we will approve a non- standard balance date. These are set out below. The circumstances 1. The nature of the business makes a 31 March balance date inappropriate. We will grant a non-standard balance date where it would help a business that is operating in an envi- ronment in which 31 March is not the most appro- priate balance date. Some businesses have a ìnaturalî end to their income year such as the end of a growing period, the end of a seasonally busy period, or the time in the annual business cycle in which the majority of income and their relevant costs can be brought to account. Examples of businesses which could have ìnaturalî income years not ending on 31†March include manufacturers, retailers, wholesalers, professionals, the tourism industry, farmers, horti- culturists, and service related industries. Without limiting the range of businesses that may have non-standard balance dates, these balance dates are commonly recognised: Apiarists- 30 Nov or 31 Dec Education/childcare related services- 31 December Farmers, cattle- 31 May dairy- 31 May sheep- 30 June Fishing industries- 30 September Horse breeders- 31 July Meat processing and export- 31 August to 1 October Orchardists, pipfruit - 31 March to 30 June Kiwifruit- 31 March to 30 June Seed dressers- 30 November Tobacco growers- 31 July 2. The date coincides with the balance date of a parent company, except where the change would result in a significant deferral of income. 3. For continuing estates, the date coincides with the date of death of the deceased taxpayer. 4. For shareholder employees, the date coincides with the balance date of the company in which they are major shareholders and from which they derive their main source of income. If they are major shareholders in more than one company, their balance date should be aligned to the balance date of the company which provides their 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.11 (April 1994) - Appendices main source of income. If no main source of income can be identified, the choice of which companyís balance date to align with should be the taxpayerís. Information we need An application for a non-standard balance date must be in writing, and must fully state the reasons for the application. We need the following information before we can consider a request for a non-standard balance date: 1. Full name of the entity seeking the balance date 2. Name of the tax agent 3. Full details of the reasons why a non-standard balance date should be approved 4. If the request is because a 31 March balance date is inappropriate for the taxpayerís particular business, we will also need: ï If the business is already in operation: - details of cash flows - details of stock patterns - details of customer demand - details of seasonal patterns - other evidence showing that financial infor- mation prepared to the proposed balance date will be more appropriate to the entity than information prepared to 31†March. ï If the business is a new business we will need predictions of the factors set out above. If there is an industry balance date commonly recognised (as listed above), this will be strong evidence that a request for a similar balance date would be approved. 5. Whether the entity is associated with any other entities, and if so, the nature of the relationship and the balance dates of the other entities. 6. Any other reasons for requesting the balance date other than those already stated. Unacceptable reasons for a non-standard balance date The anniversary date of the commencement of the business is not a valid reason for a non-standard balance date. We will not accept an application for a non-standard balance date if it is for reasons of tax deferral or tax avoidance, or to take undue advantage of any tax incentive or concession. 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.11 (April 1994) - Appendices This appendix gives a section-by-section analysis of the new provisional tax legislation. For a general overview, see the article on page 14 of the accompanying TIB. Section 375: Interpretation There are a number of new definitions in the provisional tax rules because use-of-money interest now applies to larger provisional taxpayers from the first instalment date. The new interest rules required new provisional taxpayer provisions, so new definitions were also required. The new provisional taxpayer provisions are required to prevent interest being charged or paid over a full income year when a provisional taxpayer had only been in business for part of an income year. Definitions ìFirst business dayî: This means the first day in an income year on which a taxpayer derives income or incurs expenditure as a result of carrying on a taxable activity. Taxable activity is defined in this section to have the same definition as in the GST Act except that the financial services exclusion is omitted. ìFirst instalment dateî means the 7th day of the month specified as the first instalment date in the eighth schedule to this Act. ìInstalment dateî means the 7th day of any month in which a taxpayerís provisional tax instalment is due. ìNew provisional taxpayerî means a provisional taxpayer who meets these three conditions: ï it is not a natural person ï it first started to derive assessable income from a taxable activity in that income year ï it has not derived any assessable income from a taxable activity in the last four years. This last requirement ensures that new provisional taxpayer status can apply to shelf companies or dormant companies that are recommencing business. To qualify the company must produce such documents and infor- mation as the Commissioner may require. ìProvisional taxpayerî means any taxpayer whose RIT is $2,500 or more, except for a taxpayer who meet one of these conditions: ï it is a company with a fixed establishment in NZ, but it is not deemed to be a resident in New Zealand ï s/he is a pay period taxpayer ï it is a non-resident contractor that has been issued an exemption certificate under regulation 5. ìResidual income taxî is largely the same as the current definition and is the taxpayerís tax liability reduced by the amount of: Appendix C Provisional tax - details of new legislation (a) Tax paid by a trustee on behalf or a beneficiary or by an agent on behalf of a principal; (b) Any export market development, tourist promotion incentives and export market development activities - sections 156F or section 156G of the Act; (c) Any foreign tax credit in respect of foreign income from a controlled foreign company -section 245K(3); (d) Controlled foreign company foreign tax credits utilised pursuant to section 245L. The legislation actually states section 245(1). This drafting over- sight will be corrected shortly; (e) Foreign tax credits - section 293; (f) Any non-resident withholding tax - section 318(2); (g) Any resident withholding tax - section 327K; (ga) Any tax credit in respect of a supplementary dividend paid under section 308A; (h) Any national superannuitant surcharge deductions - section 336J and section 336K; (i) Any PAYE deductions - section 362; (j) Any imputation credits and dividend withholding payments credits - sections 394ZE and section 394ZP; (k) Any debit balance in a BETA account in respect of a dividend received from a CFC - section 394ZZV(3); (l) Any credit balance in a policy holder credit account required to be maintained by a resident life insur- ance company - section 394ZZZC or section 394ZZZH. ìTaxable activityî has the same definition as in the GST Act except that the financial services exclusion is omitted. Section 376: Application of this Part This section specifies that provisional tax will be payable according to this Part of the Act, and that the Part applies to the 1994-95 income year and to every subsequent income year. Section 377: Amount of provisional tax payable Section 377 determines the total amount of provisional tax that a provisional taxpayer must pay, even though the calculation of that total may be done under section 378 (for taxpayers who estimate) or section 379 (if the Commissioner determines the amount of provisional tax payable). Subsection (2) states that no person shall be required to pay provisional tax if that personís residual income tax does not exceed $300,000 for the income year and did 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.11 (April 1994) - Appendices not exceed $2,500 for the immediately preceding income year. The $300,000 exception to the general rule that ìif your RIT is less than $2,500 last year you are not required to pay provisional tax this yearî is to cover the situation when income-earning assets are moved between taxpayers. Subsection (1) calculates the total amount of provi- sional tax used to be used in determining the size of any particular provisional tax instalment under section 381 (the section which calculates the amount of provisional tax due on each instalment date). The calculation of the amount of provisional tax payable must be made using one of the following four methods. (These methods apply in the order in which they are listed): 1. 105% of the taxpayerís residual income tax for the immediately preceding income year. The RIT figure for the immediately preceding income year is determined under subsection (3). It will be one of the following: ï if the Commissioner has issued an assessment for the preceding year, it will be the amount calcu- lated in this assessment ï if the taxpayer has filed a tax return for the immediately preceding income year and the Commissioner has not issued an assessment, it will be the amount calculated in the taxpayerís return for the preceding year ï if the taxpayer has to file a return before an instalment date but has not done so, it will be the amount calculated in the Commissionerís assessment for the preceding income year once that assessment is made. (Obviously, the taxpayer will not have the assessment in this situation. Such a taxpayer may wish to use another valuation option such as estimation. If the taxpayer continues to deter- mine the payment amount under the 105% provision, there is a risk that any underpayment will result in additional tax.) ï if the taxpayer did not have to file a return for the immediately preceding income year, the amount will be the residual income tax (if any) for that preceding income year. (This could happen if a taxpayer is a pay period taxpayer.) 2. 110% of the taxpayerís residual income tax for the year preceding the immediately preceding income year, if the taxpayer meets all of these conditions: ï the taxpayer has to file a return for the immedi- ately preceding income year, but an extension of time arrangement applies to the taxpayer and that return does not yet have to be furnished ï the taxpayer has not filed the immediately preceding income yearís return ï the instalment in question is not the third instalment. The option to use 110% of the year before last only applies to the first and second instalment dates. This is to ensure that provisional tax payments are a reasonably accurate reflection of the taxpayerís current income tax position. Further, this option cannot be used if the taxpayer has estimated the current yearís provisional tax liability or if the Commissioner has determined that liability. 3. The amount estimated by the taxpayer under section 378, unless the Commissioner has determined the amount of provisional tax payable 4. The amount determined by the Commissioner under section 379, provided the taxpayer was notified at least 30 days before the instalment date. (However, if the Commissioner determines the provisional tax payable because the taxpayerís estimate is not fair and reasonable, this determination is most likely to occur once the taxpayer has filed a tax return for the income year.) Subsection (4) deals with late assessments and reassessments. In effect it states that the taxpayerís provisional tax position will remain unchanged where the taxpayer was not guilty of neglect or default. If there has been neglect or default then the taxpayerís provi- sional tax position can be recalculated. It is important to note that this could affect more than one income year, because the inaccurate RIT may have been used as a base for provisional tax payments in subsequent income years. The residual income tax amount will be un- changed for this Part of the Act if these three conditions are met: ï the Commissioner makes any assessment or reassess- ment after the due date of that tax ï the taxpayerís residual income tax is increased ï the taxpayer sets a new due date under section 398(5) for paying the increased income tax liability. If a reassessment reduces a taxpayerís RIT and the taxpayer was previously charged additional tax or underestimation additional tax, the provisional tax position will need to be recalculated. Again this recalcu- lation may have to cover more than one income year. Subsection (5) specifies that those in the business of providing life insurance must provide certain informa- tion to the Commissioner. Section 378: Estimated provisional tax This section contains provisions relating to taxpayers who choose to estimate or who are required to estimate. The amount estimated under this section is used in the section 377 calculation to determine the total amount of provisional tax payable. Subsection (1) provides that any provisional taxpayer may estimate residual income tax for an income year at any time on or before an instalment date. This means no estimate may be made after the third instalment date. The taxpayer may make revised estimates at any time up 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.11 (April 1994) - Appendices until the third instalment date. Estimates must be notified to the Commissioner. Subsection (2) provides that any person who expects to have RIT exceeding $300,00 must make an estimate on or before the third instalment. Where the taxpayer does not do so, or incorrectly expects to have an RIT of $300,000 or less, that taxpayer is deemed to have estimated by subsection (3). This deemed estimate will be the amount of provisional tax paid on or before the third instalment date. If a taxpayer who has over $300,000 RIT pays the third instalment amount late and a deemed estimate applies, that taxpayer could become liable for underestimation additional tax as well as additional tax on the late payment. Subsection (4) requires that any estimate must be fair and reasonable at the time the taxpayer files it with the Commissioner. If it is not, under section 379 the Commissioner can determine the amount of provisional tax payable. Section 379: Commissioner may deter- mine amount of provisional tax Subsection (1) allows the Commissioner to increase the amount of provisional tax payable in certain instances. This will happen mainly in cases where a return is incorrect or not furnished. The Commissioner can also determine the amount of provisional tax payable if a taxpayerís estimate was not fair and reasonable at the time the taxpayer filed it. Subsection (2) covers cases where the Commissioner can increase and decrease the provisional tax payable. This applies in cases where the taxpayer has a change of balance date or if certain international provisions relating to double taxation apply. Under subsection (3), if a taxpayerís RIT for an income year is less than $300,000 and subsection (1) applies, the Commissioner may increase the amount of provi- sional tax payable, but that amount may not exceed 105% of the taxpayerís RIT from the immediately preceding income year. There is no limit on the amount of provisional tax payable that the Commissioner can specify under subsection (2). Under subsection (4) the Commissioner must notify the taxpayer of any determination of the amount of provi- sional tax payable. If the Commissioner increases the amount of provisional tax payable, any shortfall shall be due and payable on a day on or after 30 days after the date the Commissioner issued the notice. However, if the provisional tax payable is increased because the taxpayerís estimate was not fair and reasonable, the determination can apply retrospectively to any provi- sional tax instalment to which the taxpayerís estimate applied. Subsection (5) specifies that the taxpayer can object under Part III to any determination that the Commis- sioner makes. Section 380: Provisional tax payable in one, two or three instalments Once the total amount of provisional tax payable is determined under section 377, section 380 determines whether that amount is payable in one, two or three instalments. Subsection (1) provides the general rule that provi- sional tax is payable in three instalments. This rule applies to all provisional taxpayers who are not new provisional taxpayers, and to any new provisional taxpayer whose first business day is more than 30 days before the first instalment date. If a provisional taxpayer is a new provisional taxpayer whose first business day occurs on or after 30 days before the first instalment date and more than 30 days before the second instalment date, subsection (2) provides that provisional tax will be payable in two instalments. The two instalments are specified in section 381(2) as the second and third instalment dates. Subsection (3) provides if a new provisional taxpayerís first business day occurs on or after 30 days before the second instalment date, provisional tax is payable in one instalment (which is due on the third instalment date). The rationale for this section is that it is unreasonable to expect a new provisional taxpayer to pay an instalment within 30 days of commencing business, but that if business is commenced in an income year then at least one instalment date shall apply. Subsection (3) also provides that a taxpayer, who is not a provisional taxpayer and who had residual income tax of less than $2,500 last year and who has over $300,000 RIT in the current income year, shall pay in one instal- ment on the third instalment date. Section 381: Amount of provisional tax instalment A taxpayerís provisional tax liability is worked out under section 377. Section 380 then determines the number of instalments in which that provisional tax is payable, and section 381 determines the exact amount payable on each instalment date. The general principle that applies in section 381 is that if a taxpayerís total provisional tax payable changes, any increase or decrease must be fully accounted for at the next occur- ring instalment. Subsection (1) provides that when provisional tax is payable in three instalments, the instalments are due on the first, second and third instalment dates. These are the amounts of the instalments: ï First instalment: One-third of the provisional tax payable for the income year as determined under section 377 at the time of the first instalment date. ï Second instalment: Two-thirds of the provisional tax payable for the income year as determined under section 377 at the time of the second instalment date, less any amount previously due and payable. ìAny 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.11 (April 1994) - Appendices amount previously due and payableî covers the amount due on the first instalment date, but it also covers any amount the Commissioner has required the taxpayer to pay under section 379. Note that the reduction is based on ìany amount previously pay- ableî not the amount previously paid. This prevents the double up of any additional tax. ï Third instalment: The total amount of provisional tax payable for the income year as determined under section 377 at the time of the third instalment date, less any amount previously due and payable. Example A provisional taxpayer pays provisional tax for the 1994/95 income year. His RIT for the 1992/93 is $9,000 and the RIT for 1993/94 is $12,000. The taxpayer does not file his 1993/94 tax return until after the second instalment date, and he has an extension of time for filing that return. In this example, the taxpayer will underpay the second instalment to demonstrate the impact such a payment has on the third instalment. First instalment: The taxpayer uses the year before lastís option, so his total provisional tax payable (calculated under section 377) is $9,900. Under section 381(a) the amount due on the first instal- ment date is one third of $9,900, so the taxpayer is required to pay $3,300. He pays this amount. Second instalment: The taxpayer uses the year before lastís option, so he has total provisional tax payable of $9,900, as calculated under section 377. Section 381(b) provides that the amount due on the second instalment date is two thirds of $9,900 less any amount previously due an payable ($3,300 at the first instalment date), so the taxpayer must pay $3,300. The taxpayer pays $3,000. Because he has underpaid $300, additional tax of $30 (10% of $300) is applied. This additional tax would be reduced if the taxpayerís liability turns out to be less than the amount of provisional tax payable. Third instalment: The taxpayer now uses the last yearís RIT plus 5% option. This establishes a total provisional tax payable amount of $12,600 under section 377(1). Section 381(c) provides that the amount due on the third instalment date is the total provisional tax payable ($12,600), less any amount previously due and payable ($3,300 at each of the first and second instalment dates - total $6,600). The taxpayer must therefore pay $6,000. (Note that it is the amount payable - not the amount paid - which is used in calculating the size of an instal- ment. The amount used is the $3,300 due in the second instalment, not the $3,000 actually paid.) The taxpayer pays the $6,000 due ($12,600 - $6,600). After the third instalment date the taxpayer pays the outstanding provisional tax from the second instal- ment date, and the accrued additional tax. Section 381(2) applies in the same manner as subsec- tion (1) except that it applies only to new provisional taxpayers with two instalment dates. The instalment dates are the second instalment date and the third instalment date. On the second instalment date half of the taxpayerís provisional tax liability is due. The amount due on the third instalment date is all of the provisional tax due and payable for that income year, less any amount previously due and payable. Section 381(3) covers those who are required to pay provisional tax in one instalment. This includes all of these taxpayers: ï new provisional taxpayers whose first business day is on or after the day 30 days before the 2nd instalment date ï provisional taxpayers whose RIT is equal to or greater than $300,000 for the current income year, and less than $2,500 for the immediately preceding year. These taxpayers have their entire provisional tax liability due on the third instalment date. Section 382: Voluntary payments This section provides that a taxpayer may make volun- tary payments of provisional tax at any time. These payments are income tax payments if the taxpayer is not a provisional taxpayer. If the taxpayer is a provisional taxpayer, these are payments in excess of the amount of provisional tax payable. Because of this, they do not affect the calculation of how much provisional tax is due at each instalment date. However, the amount paid will effectively be counted as provisional tax paid for the next instalment (if any) which occurs. Example A provisional taxpayer pays provisional tax for the 1994/95 income year. Her RIT for the 1993/94 income year is $12,000. She files her 1993/94 tax return before the first instalment date. She wishes to avoid underpaying, so she makes a voluntary payment between the first and second instalment dates. First instalment: The taxpayer uses the last yearís RIT plus 5% option. This establishes a total provi- sional tax payable amount of $12,600 under section 377(1) so she is required to pay $4,200. She pays this amount. Voluntary payment: The taxpayer pays $800 voluntarily. Thus the total amount of provisional tax that she has paid up until this time is $5,000. Second instalment: The taxpayer uses the last yearís RIT plus 5% option, so she still has total provi- sional tax payable of $12,600. Under section 381(b) the amount due on the second instalment date is two thirds of $12,600 less any amount previously due and payable ($4,200 at the first instalment date), so the taxpayer is required to pay $4,200. The $800 voluntary payment is not an amount which was 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.11 (April 1994) - Appendices previously due and payable, so it is not taken into account in this calculation. However, as the tax- payer has made an $800 voluntary payment which is now standing in her account as a credit, the amount she needs to pay is only $3,400. However, she pays $4,200 to maintain the $800 overpayment. Third instalment: The taxpayer again pays $4,200 on the basis of her last yearís RIT plus 5%, main- taining the voluntary payment. The voluntary payment carries forward until terminal tax date, when it reduces the taxpayerís terminal tax liability (if any). Section 383: Refund of overpaid provisional tax This section provides for the refund of overpaid provi- sional tax when the either the taxpayer or the Commis- sioner reduced the amount of provisional tax payable. To qualify for a refund the taxpayer must have paid more provisional tax than is actually due and payable after the reduction in total provisional tax payable takes place. A taxpayer must make a written request before any overpaid provisional tax will be refunded. The Commissioner may use the refund to pay any of the taxpayerís income tax due which remains unpaid. Example A company pays provisional tax for the 1994/95 income year. The companyís RIT for the 1993/94 income year is $12,000. It files its 1993/94 tax return before the first instalment date. After the second instalment date the company chooses to estimate its provisional tax liability for the entire income year at $9,000. First instalment: The company uses the last yearís RIT plus 5% option. This establishes a total provi- sional tax payable amount of $12,600 under section 377(1) so the company must pay $4,200. It pays this amount. Second instalment: The company still uses the last yearís RIT plus 5% option, so it still has total provisional tax payable of $12,600. It is required to pay $4,200 (two thirds of $12,600) less the $4,200 paid at the first instalment date. It pays this amount. Estimation: Shortly after the second instalment date the company estimates its provisional tax liability at $9,000. Recalculating the first and second instal- ments on the basis of this new estimate means that the amount of provisional tax due on each of those instalments was $3,000. This means the company is entitled to receive a refund of $2,400. It sends in a written request, and receives the refund. Third instalment: The third instalment is calculated as normal on the basis of the estimate, and the company is required to pay $3,000. It does so. Section 383(2) deals with the case of taxpayers who consider themselves to be provisional taxpayers for the current income year, but who turn out not to be as the preceding income yearís RIT was less than $2,500. This section allows the Commissioner to refund the provi- sional tax incorrectly paid. Section 383(3) provides the rules for determining the amount of provisional tax payable for those instalments which occur after a refund of provisional tax overpaid. This section provides that the amount of provisional tax payable shall be calculated as if the amount payable on the previous instalment dates was an amount reduced by the amount of provisional tax refunded. This section also provides that any provisional tax refunded is not counted as provisional tax paid. This is so any amounts refunded are not taken into account for underestimation additional tax purposes. Section 384: Additional tax on underpaid provisional tax This section imposes additional tax where an insuffi- cient amount of provisional tax is paid on an instalment date. It effectively duplicates section 398(2) except that a number of provisions are inserted to prevent excess additional tax being applied. Subsection (1) provides that additional tax will be applied when any provisional tax due remains unpaid on any instalment date. The amount of the additional tax applied is 10% of the amount which is due but unpaid. The amount which remains unpaid is the difference between what the taxpayer was required to pay and what the taxpayer actually paid. If a taxpayer is not a new provisional taxpayer (or a new provisional taxpayer with three instalments) the amount that taxpayer is required to pay is the lesser of these amounts: ï the amount due on the instalment ï one-third of the taxpayerís residual income tax for that income year. This restriction on the amount of provisional tax due prevents the overcharging of additional tax where the taxpayerís income tax liability is less than the amount the taxpayer is required to pay in provisional tax during the income year. If the taxpayer is a new provisional taxpayer who must pay in two instalments, the amount that must be paid is the lesser of the amount due on the instalment date and half the taxpayerís residual income tax for that income year. Similarly, if only one instalment is due, the taxpayer must pay the lesser of the amount due on the third instalment date and the residual income tax for that income year. The amount of provisional tax paid by an instalment date includes any amount overpaid at an earlier instal- ment date which remains overpaid. This includes any voluntary payment made under section 382. 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.11 (April 1994) - Appendices This subsection also applies to any amount due on a date specified by the Commissioner, if the amount due on that date is not paid. However, the capping of the liability to ensure it does not exceed the taxpayerís income tax liability for the year does not apply in this case. The calculation is simply on the difference be- tween what was due and what was paid. Subsection (2) provides that the due date for any additional tax under this section is the instalment date. This means any additional tax first compounds six months after that instalment date. Subsection (3) provides that additional tax under this section shall be treated as additional tax calculated under section 398, and shall have incremental tax calculated under that section. Section 385: Additional tax where residual income tax underestimated as at final instalment date Subsection (1) determines when additional tax on an underestimation of provisional tax is to be charged. Additional tax can be charged to these two groups of provisional taxpayers: ï those whose residual income tax in the immediately preceding income year exceeded $2,500 (because they therefore had to make payments) ï those whose RIT in the preceding income year did not exceed $2,500, but whose RIT in the current year exceeds $300,000, if they underestimate their provi- sional tax. For underestimation additional tax to be charged, the taxpayer or the Commissioner must have estimated at less than 80% of the RIT for that income year, and the amount paid on or before the third instalment date must be less than 80% of the taxpayerís RIT for the income year. The latter requirement corrects the problem in the old legislation that allowed underestimation additional tax to be charged when a taxpayerís estimate was less than 80% of current year RIT, but the taxpayer had paid more than 80% of the tax due. Subsection (1) sets out how the additional tax for underestimation is to be calculated. The amount of additional tax imposed varies depending on whether the taxpayer is a voluntary or compulsory estimator. If the taxpayer is required to estimate, the additional tax is 10% of the difference between the taxpayerís RIT for the income year and the greater of these amounts: ï the amount of provisional tax the taxpayer was required to pay during the income year ï the amount of provisional tax paid during the income year. If the taxpayer makes a voluntary estimate, the addi- tional tax is 10% of the difference between the lessor of these amounts: ï the taxpayerís RIT for the income year ï 105% of the preceding yearís RIT and the greater of these amounts: ï the amount of provisional tax the taxpayer was required to pay during the income year ï the amount of provisional tax paid during the income year. Basing the additional tax on the difference between what should have been paid and the greater of what was due and what was paid prevents the double imposition of additional tax when a taxpayer short pays a provi- sional tax payment and underestimates. Under the old legislation if a taxpayer short paid and underestimated, and that underestimate was not caught up by the third instalment date, the amount of the underpayment was incorporated in the calculation of additional tax for underestimation. This meant that the taxpayer was penalised twice. Subsection (2) provides that the additional tax on underestimation will be due on the terminal tax date for the income year to which the additional tax applies. Subsection (3) provides that additional tax shall be recoverable as income tax. Subsection (4) provides that the Commissioner shall issue an assessment of additional tax on an underesti- mation. The taxpayer may object on the grounds that the assessment made is excessive or that the person is not chargeable with additional tax. Subsection (5) provides that the taxpayer may object to an assessment. Subsection (6) provides that additional tax under imposed this section shall be treated as if it was addi- tional tax imposed under section 398. Section 386: Remission of additional tax imposed on underestimation Subsection (1) provides for remission of additional tax. Additional tax can be remitted if the Commissioner is satisfied that any provisional taxpayer has become liable for additional tax under section 385 of this Act because of one of these occurrences: ï an Act is enacted or a regulation or Order in Council is made, if this happens on or after the first day of the month before the month of a taxpayerís third instal- ment date ï The Commissioner makes public an amended ruling on or after the first day of the month before the month of a taxpayerís third instalment date ï the taxpayer adopts an interpretation of the legislation which is reasonable but incorrect ï the taxpayer derives dividends which are an attributed repatriation, and the taxpayer could not reasonably have foreseen the amount of these dividends at the time of making the estimate. 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.11 (April 1994) - Appendices Subsection (2) allows underestimation additional tax to be remitted if certain unforeseen events occur. To qualify for this remission, these conditions must be met: 1. The taxpayerís estimate must have been fair and reasonable at the time it was filed. 2. The difference between the estimate and the taxpay- erís residual income tax for the income year must be wholly or principally due to one or more of these transactions or events: - a transaction or event which the taxpayer could not reasonably be expected to have foreseen to had knowledge of on or before the first day of the month before the month the third instalment date occurs - a transaction or event which the taxpayer could foresee, but the amount of tax liability caused by that event could not reasonably have been known on or before the first day of the month before the month the third instalment date 3. If the transaction or events had not occurred, the taxpayerís residual income tax must have been reduced by 20 percent or more. Subsection (3) provides that no transaction or event shall be taken into account for the purposes of subsec- tion (2) if it meets either of these conditions: ï the transaction or event is the payment of directorsí fees, salary, wages or other income for or on account of service as an employee to any taxpayer who is a shareholder in and an employee of a private company ï the transaction or event is one whose occurrence is controlled by the taxpayer or an associated person The objective of this section is to limit the remission to those ìtrueî unforeseen events and to exclude related party transactions. Subsection (4) provides that additional tax under this section is not eligible for relief under section 413. Subsection (5) provides that no additional tax shall be remitted under this section if the timing of any receipt of income or incurring of expenditure has been altered, and part or all of the purpose of the alteration was to have additional tax remitted. This anti-avoidance provision is to prevent changes in the timing of income receipt and expenditure to qualify for remission under subsection (2) of this section. Subsection (6) provides that a request for remission of underestimation additional must be accompanied by other documents or other information sufficient to satisfy the Commissioner that remission is warranted. Section 387: Payments to be set off within wholly owned group Subsection (1) provides that for movement of provi- sional tax payments between wholly owned companies, this section applies for both provisional tax and use-of- money interest purposes. Subsection (2) provides that any company which pays provisional tax in excess of its residual income tax for an income year may elect to allocate that excess to a company which is part of the same wholly owned group of companies, if the second company has paid less than its RIT for the income year. Under subsection (6), the first companyís election must meet these conditions: ï it must be in writing; ï it must name the underpaid company or companies to which the excess is to be allocated; ï it must be filed within the time that the underpaid company has to make its payment (but the Commis- sioner may extend this time limit) ï it must specify the day on which the excess amount is deemed to be allocated to the underpaid company, and the amount of the excess that is to be allocated. Subsection (3) provides that the excess provisional tax paid may only be allocated on or after the later of the date on which the excess is paid and the underpaid companyís first instalment date. Subsection (4) provides that the amount allocated from the overpaid company to the underpaid company shall be deemed to be transferred on the day specified in the taxpayerís notice. Subsection (5) provides that the allocation from an overpaid company to an underpaid company shall be deemed to be provisional tax paid by the underpaid company, and not provisional tax paid by the overpaid company. Section 388: Offset of further income tax Subsections (1) and (2) provide that if a company was required is required to pay further income tax to ensure that an ICA account balances, that further payment will be set off against the taxpayerís provisional tax liability. Section 389: Allowance for provisional tax paid by agent This section provides that provisional tax paid by an agent on behalf of a principal shall be deemed to be provisional tax paid by the principal. Section 390: Assessment and payment of terminal tax Subsection (1) provides that the amount of income tax for which a provisional taxpayer is liable shall be calculated under Part IV of the Act. Subsection (2) provides that the income tax which a provisional taxpayer is required to pay shall be due and payable on the taxpayerís terminal tax date. This date will be the 7th day of the month specified in the eighth schedule to the Act as being the month for the payment of terminal tax. Subsection (3) provides that the Commissioner may set an earlier due date as the due date for the payment of terminal tax, as long as this date is not less than 30 days after the issue of the assessment. 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.11 (April 1994) - Appendices Section 391: Provisional tax to be credited in payment of income tax Any provisional tax paid by in accordance with this section is credited towards the taxpayerís income tax liability. Section 392: Application of other parts to provisional tax This specifies that the other Parts of the Act shall apply as if the amount the taxpayer is required to pay under this Part were income tax levied under section 38. Section 398A: Interest to be charged when residual income tax exceeds provisional tax Subsection (1) defines the following terms: ìIncome tax payableî - This term is adjusted to account for Family Support over- and underpayments. ìInterest liability periodî - this is the period over which interest on underpaid income tax is calculated. it starts on the day after the unpaid tax was due and ends on the taxpayerís terminal tax date for that income year. ìProvisional taxpayerî has the same definition as in section 375 of this Act. ìSpecified rate of interestî means the rate prescribed under subsection 11(a) of this section. The rate on underpayments for the 1994/95 income year was recently set at 9% per annum. This rate may be deduct- ible under the normal income tax provisions. Note that under the new provisional tax rules the rate on under- payments can now be different from the rate on overpayments (4.5% assessable for the 1994/95 income year). ìTrustee incomeî has the meaning assigned to that term by subsection 226 of this Act. This term is used in specifying that those with trustee income and who are provisional taxpayers are subject to interest. This subsection then provides that other terms used have the definitions assigned to them by section 375 of the Act. Subsection (2) provides that the following taxpayers shall be charged interest where provisional tax remains unpaid by due date: ï any provisional taxpayer who is not a natural person ï any provisional taxpayer who is a natural person whose residual income tax is greater than $30,000 ï any provisional taxpayer who is a natural person who estimates his/her residual income tax ï any provisional taxpayer who is a natural person who at any time during the income year held a valid certificate of exemption from resident withholding tax under section 327M(12) ï Any natural person, in that personís capacity as trustee, to the extent that s/he is a provisional tax- payer in relation to the trustee income. The period which interest on underpaid income tax is calculated over an ìinterest liability periodî. This is the period between the date the tax was due and the taxpay- erís terminal tax date. Subsection (3) provides that the interest calculation is undertaken daily and is calculated according to the following formula: a x b 365 Hereís what the variables stand for: a is the amount of tax that remains unpaid at the beginning of the day b is the interest rate applying on that day. Subsections (4), (5) and (6) allocate the provisional taxpayerís income tax liability over the relevant number of provisional tax instalment dates. If the amount paid by any instalment date is less than the amount allocated to that date, the difference between the two amounts is the amount of tax underpaid. These subsections override the Part XII provisions for determining how much is payable on each instalment date. The general principle these subsections apply is that income tax payable, for the purposes of this section, is either due evenly during the income year or at the third instalment date. Subsection (4) provides that if a provisional taxpayer is not a new provisional taxpayer, and has more than $30,000 of residual income tax, that taxpayerís tax liability is due in three instalments for the purposes of this section. The instalments are due on the first, second and third instalment dates. Subsection (5) provides that if a provisional taxpayer is not a natural person, and its residual income tax does not exceed $30,000, its income tax due in one instal- ment on the third instalment date for the purposes of this section. This subsection also provides that if a provisional taxpayer is a natural person and has RIT for the year of less than $30,000, if s/he estimated his/her provisional tax, the income tax is all due on the third instalment date for the purposes of this section. It also applies to any natural person who holds a valid certifi- cate of exemption under section 327M(12) Subsection (6) deals with new provisional taxpayers. The income tax of a new provisional taxpayer whose RIT exceeds $30,000 shall be due in one of these ways: ï in three equal instalments, if the taxpayerís first business day was more than 30 days before the first instalment date. ï in two equal instalments on the second and third instalment dates, if the taxpayerís first business day is 30 or fewer days before the first instalment date, but more than 30 days before the second instalment date. 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.11 (April 1994) - Appendices ï in one instalment on the third instalment date, if the taxpayerís first business day is 30 of fewer days before the second instalment date. Subsection (7) covers the case where the taxpayerís income tax assessment is issued before the taxpayerís terminal tax date, and the taxpayer is being charged interest under this section. If the taxpayer pays the amount specified in the assessment together with the interest due within 30 days of the date the assessment was issued, any interest which accumulated between the issue of the assessment and the receipt of the payment is remitted. Subsection (8) provides that interest can be remitted if the Commissioner is satisfied that the taxpayer has become liable for interest because of one of these events: ï an Act is enacted or a regulation or Order in Council is made on or after the first day of the month before the month of the taxpayerís third instalment date ï the Commissioner publicises an amended ruling on or after the first day of the month before the month of the taxpayerís third instalment date Subsections (9) provides that any interest due and payable under this section is due on the taxpayerís terminal tax date for the income year to which the interest relates. If payment is not made then additional tax would be imposed under section 398. Subsection (10) provides that interest is deemed to be incurred in the income year in which the assessment is made. This generally means that interest charged is deductible in the income year following the year to which the interest relates. This prevents circularity. If the interest was deductible in the income year to which it relates this would affect the taxpayer liability which affect their interest and so on. Subsection (10) also provides that interest shall be recoverable as if it were income tax. In the case of reassessment, if a taxpayerís tax liability (and thus the interest liability) increases, the increased interest is due on the taxpayerís terminal tax date for the income year to which the interest related. This means additional tax would apply unless the Commis- sioner set a new payment due date under section 398(5). The increased interest charge would be deductible in the income year in which the amended assessment was issued (as provided for in paragraph (a) of subsec- tion†10). If a taxpayerís income tax liability is reduced under a reassessment, the taxpayerís use-of-money interest charge will correspondingly be reduced. This reduces the size of the deduction the taxpayer is eligible for in the following income year. Subsection (11) provides that the Governor-General may from time to time by Order in Council set the interest rate to apply for the purposes of this section. This subsection also provides that the $30,000 threshold may also be raised by Order in Council. Any change in threshold must be made before the 1st day of October in the year before the start of the standard 1 April to 31 March income year. Section 413A: Interest on tax overpaid Subsection (1) defines the following terms: ìPerson incorrectly assumed to be a provisional taxpayerî means a person who had residual income tax exceeding $2,500 in the immediately preceding income year and who in the current income year, and who meets all of these conditions: ï the person reasonably expected to be a provisional taxpayer ï the person made an estimate of residual income tax for that income year, in anticipation of being a provisional taxpayer ï the person paid $2,500 or more of provisional tax by the third instalment date ï the person was not a provisional taxpayer, because the residual income tax liability did not exceed $2,500 in the income year. Even though these persons are not provisional taxpay- ers, they will be paid use-of-money interest as though they were. This definition is used in subsection (2) to ensure that these taxpayers are fairly treated. Estimation of tax liabilities at low income levels can be difficult and it is unfair for a person who thought and behaved as a provisional taxpayer not to be paid interest on an overpayment due to a reduction in income which may have been unforeseeable. ìProvisional taxpayerî has the same meaning as in section 375 of the Act ìSpecified rate of interestî means the rate prescribed under subsection (10) of this section ìTrustee incomeî has the meaning assigned to that term by subsection 226 of this Act. This term is used to specify that those with trustee income and who are provisional taxpayers are eligible for interest. This subsection then provides that other terms used have the definitions assigned to them by section 375 of the Act. Subsection (2) provides that the Commissioner will pay interest on overpaid provisional tax to these types of taxpayers: ï any provisional taxpayer or person incorrectly as- sumed to be a provisional taxpayer who is not a natural person ï any provisional taxpayer or person incorrectly as- sumed to be a provisional taxpayer who is a natural person whose residual income tax exceeds $30,000 ï any provisional taxpayer or person incorrectly as- sumed to be a provisional taxpayer who filed an estimate of residual income tax for the year 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.11 (April 1994) - Appendices ï any natural person who is a provisional taxpayer in their capacity as a trustee. Subsection (4) provides that taxpayers will be eligible for interest over a period called the interest entitlement period. The interest entitlement period ceases on the taxpayerís terminal tax date and starts on either the first, second or third instalment date. The interest entitlement period starts on the third instalment date, if a person meets any of these condi- tions: ï the person is a provisional taxpayer whose residual income tax for the income year is less than $30,000 ï a person incorrectly assumed to be a provisional taxpayer ï the person is a new provisional taxpayer who is required by section 380(3) to pay provisional tax in one instalment ï the person had less than $2,500 of RIT last year, but has more than $300,000 RIT this year. The interest entitlement period starts on the second instalment date, if the person is a new provisional taxpayer whose residual income tax liability exceeds $30,000, and the person is required by section 380(2) to pay provisional tax in two instalments. In all other cases, the interest entitlement period starts on the first instalment date. After it has been established which instalments are eligible for overpayment interest, subsection (5) allo- cates a taxpayerís residual income tax liability to the relevant instalment dates, to allow the calculation of the amount by which the taxpayer has overpaid. If the taxpayerís interest entitlement period starts on the third instalment date, the taxpayerís RIT is deemed to be due and payable on the third instalment date. Simi- larly, if the taxpayerís interest entitlement period starts on the second instalment date, the taxpayerís residual income tax is deemed to be due equally over the second and third instalment dates. Finally, where the taxpayerís interest entitlement period starts on the first instalment date, the taxpayerís residual income tax is deemed to be due equally over all three instalment dates. The amount the taxpayer actually paid by each instalment date will then be compared with the amount that should have been paid, to work out the taxpayerís interest entitle- ment. Subsection (6) provides that certain amounts paid in excess are not included in the above calculations. These amounts are: ï overpaid tax retained by the Commissioner under sections 394M or section 394ZZX. These sections limit the refund of tax to the amount of credit balance in a companyís imputation credit account and to the credit balance in the companyís branch equivalent tax account. ï any tax retained which is only tax paid in excess as a result of the crediting to a provisional tax instalment date of any further income tax retained to make an imputation credit account balance. Subsection (7) credits any interest which accumulates under this section towards any underpaid provisional tax instalment, if that underpaid instalment occurs after the day the interest accrued. This prevents a taxpayer having additional tax imposed on an underpayment of provisional tax, and at the same time having an amount of interest accrued under this section on an earlier overpayment. Subsection (8) provides that the Commissioner may refund the interest as if it were income tax and that the interest is deemed to be interest for the purposes of Parts IV and IXA of this Act. This means the interest is assessable and subject to resident withholding tax. Subsection (9) provides that if any amount of interest under this section has been incorrectly paid, the Com- missioner may recover that overpayment as if it were income tax due. Subsection (10) provides that the Governor-General may from time to time by Order in Council set the interest rate to apply for the purposes of this section. Subsection (11) is a mechanical section which allows the Commissioner to pay the interest without further appropriation.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.1 (July 1994) Specified superannuation contribution withholding tax (SSCWT) Introduction This item states the Commissionerís current policy on specified superannuation contribution withholding tax (SSCWT). It sets out when employers must deduct SSCWT, how they must pay the deductions to Inland Revenue, and the amounts that may be claimed as a tax- deductible expense. Background Some employers have a staff superannuation scheme that their employees may join. In many cases, the employer makes a contribution on behalf of employees who contribute to the scheme. The employerís contribu- tion is usually based on a percentage of the employeeís salary. In the past, employersí contributions to employee superannuation schemes have had a number of different tax treatments. However, from 1 April 1989 most employer contributions have been subject to SSCWT. The SSCWT rules are contained in sections 336Z to sections 336ZL of the Income Tax Act 1976. The rate of SSCWT is given in clause†13 of the First Schedule to the Act. Policy When an employer makes a monetary contribution to a superannuation fund on behalf of an employee, the employer must deduct a final withholding tax of 33†cents per dollar. This withholding tax is called specified superannuation contribution withholding tax. Only the net amount of the employerís contribution (after the deduction of SSCWT) is paid into the super- annuation fund on behalf of the employee. If an employer makes a non-monetary contribution to a superannuation scheme on behalf of an employee, the contribution is generally subject to FBT. Paying SSCWT deductions to IRD Employers must deduct SSCWT and pay it to Inland Revenue on the same basis as PAYE. However, SSCWT is added to PAYE when determining whether PAYE and SSCWT deductions have to be paid once or twice a month. If the total PAYE and SSCWT deductions were under $100,000 in the previous year, the employer only has to pay the deductions to Inland Revenue once each month. Otherwise, deductions must be paid to Inland Revenue twice each month. These are the payment due dates for employers who have to pay PAYE and SSCWT deductions to Inland Revenue twice each month: ï deductions made between the 1st and the 15th of the month - due by the 20th of that month ï deductions made between the 16th and the end of the month - due by the 5th of the following month. If an employer only has to pay PAYE and SSCWT deductions to Inland Revenue once each month, all PAYE and SSCWT deductions made during the month are due by the 20th of the following month. Employers who are liable to pay SSCWT should use an IR†66W pay-in slip instead of an IR†66N. The IR†66W covers PAYE deductions, SSCWT deductions, and also Child Support and Student Loan deductions (if applica- ble). These employers must complete an IR 66W for each payment period and send it to IRD together with payment for the total deductions for the period. An employer who fails to pay any SSCWT owing by the due date is liable to the same penalties and fines that apply for missed or late PAYE deductions. An end of year reconciliation of SSCWT payments is not required on the IR†68P form. Amounts deductible for income tax SSCWT that is due and payable on specified superan- nuation contributions made in an income year is deductible in that income year. The timing of the deduction is prescribed by section 140AB. The net amount of the employer contribution to an employee superannuation fund is also deductible for income tax purposes. The deductibility of employer contributions is governed by section 150. Defined terms SSCWT is only payable on employer contributions to superannuation schemes that meet the definition of superannuation fund. Similarly, employer contribu- tions to superannuation schemes are only deductible if they are made to a scheme that is a superannuation fund. ìSuperannuation schemeî means any trust, unit trust (as defined in section 211 of the Income Tax Act 1976), non-resident company, or arrangement constituted under an Act of Parliament (other than the Social Security Act 1964), established principally for the purpose of providing retirement benefits. ìSuperannuation fundî includes any superannuation scheme (see previous definition) which meets either of these conditions: ï it is approved by the Government Actuary and classified as a superannuation category 1 scheme or a superannuation category 2 scheme ï it is registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 However, a superannuation scheme which is consti- tuted outside New Zealand and classified by the Govern- continued on page 2 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.1 (July 1994) contribute $10,000 to the staff superannuation scheme. M Corporation is obliged to make contributions of $10,000 each fortnight to the staff superannuation scheme, on behalf of its employees. However, M Corporation has to deduct $3,300 of SSCWT from its contributions before they are paid into the superannuation scheme. This means the net contri- bution to the staff superannuation scheme by M†Corporation is $6,700. The $3,300 SSCWT has to be paid to Inland Revenue together with PAYE deductions. Both the $6,700 net contribution to the scheme and the $3,300 of SSCWT paid are deductible for income tax. Premiums paid for use of business land - deductibility the premium that is applicable to that income year. No deduction is allowable for any period of the year in which the land is not used in the production of assess- able income. The treatment of any premium paid on a new sub-lease is the same as for a new lease. Under the proviso to section 137(2), if a lease is assigned the assignee is entitled to claim any premium paid by the lessee which the lessee has not claimed as a deduction. The proviso restricts the deduction to the premium paid by the assignee, as apportioned appropriately. This is illus- trated in the case Roy Ale Ltd v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,225. Example 1 Bill Buckner was granted a lease of premises on 1†October 1988 for a period of 3 years. He paid a premium of $3,000 for this lease. He did not use the premises for business purposes until 1 January 1989. Bill has a balance date of 31†March, so he was able to claim deductions as follows: Income yearSpreadDeduction 1989$ 500$ 250 1990$1,000$1,000 1991$1,000$1,000 1992 $ 500$ 500 $3,000$2,750 Although the premium paid was $3,000 the deduc- tions total only $2,750 as in the first income year the premises were only used for three months for business purposes. Introduction This item states the Commissionerís current policy on the deductibility of premiums paid on the grant or a renewal of a lease. The item looks at the treatment of grants and renewals made before and after 1 April 1993. Background Deductions for premiums paid on the grant or a renewal of a lease or licence were previously allowed under section†137 of the Income Tax Act 1976. For grants or renewals occurring on or after 1 April 1993 a deprecia- tion deduction is allowable under section 108 of the Act. Policy For a premium to be deductible under section 137 or depreciable under section 108, it must relate to a payment made for the goodwill attached to the land as distinct from goodwill of a business. Grant or renewal before 1 April 1993 Section 137 allows a deduction for premiums on the grant or renewal of a lease or licence. A ìpremiumî on a lease of land is defined in section 137. It includes these items: ï any payment in the nature of a fine or foregift ï any payment for goodwill attaching to the land ï any payment (except rent) for the grant, transfer, or renewal of the lease. Section 137(2) allows a deduction for the proportion of from page 1 ment Actuary under regulation 29 or 30 of the Superan- nuation Schemes Regulations 1983 does not meet the ìsuperannuation fundî definition. Employer contributions to a superannuation scheme that is not a superannuation fund may be liable to fringe benefit tax. Example M Corporation has a staff superannuation scheme for its employees. The scheme is registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 and is based in New Zealand. Employees who join must contrib- ute 6% of their annual salary to the scheme. M Corporation matches an employeeís contributions dollar for dollar. Each fortnight, the employees 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.1 (July 1994) Example 2 If on 1 April 1990 Bill had assigned the lease to Amy Blue for $2,000 and Amy had used the premises solely for business purposes, the position would be: IncomeBill’s unexpiredAmy’sAmy’s yearportionpremiumdeduction 1991$1,000$1,333$1,000 1992$ 500$ 667$ 500 Under the proviso to section 137(2) Amyís deduc- tion would be limited to Billís unexpired portion. Bill is unable to claim a deduction for the 1991 and 1992 years. Grant or renewal on or after 1 April 1993 The right to use land is included in the Twenty-second Schedule to the Act. As such it is depreciable property for the purposes of calculating a depreciation deduction under section 108. The rate to be used is calculated by using the section 108G formula, which is: ††††††1†††††† legal life Legal life is deemed to include any renewal or extension that is essentially unconditional, or conditional on the payment of pre-determined fees. Example 3 On 1 October 1993 Trevor Barnes is granted a lease for 3 years at a premium of $3,000 for a term of 3†years. The depreciation rate equals one-third, i.e., 33.33%. Trevor has a 31 March balance date. Income yearDeduction 1994$ 500 1995$1,000 1996$1,000 1997$ 500 Total deduction$3,000 Example 4 Trevor assigns the lease to Patrick OíShaughnessy on 1 April 1995 for a premium of $2,000. For the 1994 and 1995 income year Trevorís deductions will be the same as in Example 3. In the 1996 year, as Trevor has disposed of the property, he must make an adjustment under section 117 of the Act. (If the lease being as- signed had commenced before 1 April 1993, then section 117 would not apply.) This will result in an amount of $500 being included as assessable income, being the difference between the premium received ($2,000) and the adjusted tax value of the property as at 31 March 1995 ($1,500). Trevor cannot claim a deduc- tion in the 1996 and 1997 years. Patrick can claim depreciation on $2,000 at the rate of 66.66%, i.e., 1/1.5 Income yearDeduction 1996$1,333 1997$ 667 Total deduction$2,000 Budget night announcements - 30 June 1994 Lease duty on forestry, mineral and similar land use rights The Government has announced that it intends to repeal section 8(c) of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act, with effect from 1 July 1994. This change will mean that the granting of rights to use or take profits from land will no longer be liable for lease duty. This change will primarily benefit the forestry and mining industries. For example, a farmer who grants a company a forestry right to develop and harvest a forest on his or her land will no longer have to pay lease duty on the payment received for the use of the land. Simi- larly, a right granted to a gravel merchant to extract sand from land will not be subject to lease duty. Any agreements for use of land which became uncondi- tional before 1 July 1994 will remain liable for lease duty. This change will not affect leases or easements. Family Support The Government has announced that it will raise the income threshold at which Family Support begins to abate from $17,500 to $20,000 gross income per year. It will also increase the under-13-year-old rate for second and subsequent children from $24 per week to $27 per week. These changes will apply from 1 October 1994. People who are already receiving Family Support will have their entitlements automatically increased from 1†October. The Finance Bill (No.2), which gives effect to these announcements, was introduced into Parliament on 14†July 1994 and referred to the Government Adminis- tration Select Committee for consideration. 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.1 (July 1994) Cessation of GST registration Introduction This item states the Commissionerís current policy on the procedure and consequences when a person cancels a GST registration. Background A person who carries on a taxable activity and makes more than $30,000 of supplies per annum must register for GST. A person must also register if he or she expects to make more than $30,000 of supplies in an income year. Before 1†October 1990, the registration threshold was $24,000. A person who carries on a taxable activity with supplies below the registration threshold may register for GST. A ìtaxable activityî is an activity which is carried on continuously or regularly, and which involves (or is intended to involve) supplies made to another person for the payment of money or some other consideration. Policy Cancelling GST registration If a personís taxable activities all cease, and he or she does not intend to carry on further taxable activities, registration must be cancelled. To cancel the registra- tion, the person must provide the Commissioner with a notice in writing within 21†days of ceasing all taxable activities. This notice must specify: ï the date upon which the taxable activities ceased ï whether the person intends to carry on any taxable activity within 12 months of the date of cessation. The Commissioner will cancel the registration after receiving this notice. However, registration will not be cancelled if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the person will carry on a taxable activity within the subsequent 12†month period (section 52(3)). A registered person who continues to carry on a taxable activity, but whose value of supplies falls below the $30,000 registration threshold, may apply for a cancel- lation of registration. Such an application must state that the person is no longer liable to be registered. GST payable upon cancellation GST is payable on any goods and services used by the registered person in taxable activities for making taxable supplies, if these goods and services are retained when the registration is cancelled. These goods and services include all business assets retained by the registered person. Section 5(3) deems these goods and services to be supplied immediately before the cancella- tion takes effect. This liability arises regardless of whether the goods and services were acquired before or after the introduction of GST on 1 October 1986. Under section 10(8), the GST payable on such retained assets is calculated as being one-ninth of the lesser of these values: ï the cost of the goods and services, including any GST charged in the purchase price ï the market value of the supply at the time of cancella- tion (the ìopen market valueî of goods includes GST) Final return When a personís registration has been cancelled, that person must file a final GST return and pay any GST owing. This must be done by the last working day of the month following the month in which the cessation of registration took effect. Retention of liabilities After the registration is cancelled, the registered person is still liable for anything done or omitted to be done whilst registered (section 54). Keeping records A registered person is required to retain GST records in New Zealand for a period of at least 7 years from the end of the taxable period to which they relate. A person whose registration has been cancelled must still retain GST records for at least 7 years despite the cancellation. Example Jacques is a scuba-dive instructor. He has operated his business since 1980. He registered for GST in October 1986 as his projected taxable supplies for the year exceeded the then threshold of $24,000. The volume of Jacquesí taxable supplies has fluctuated since then, but he has retained his GST registration. Jacques decided to go to university, and in October 1993 closed his business and applied to the Com- missioner for his registration to be cancelled. Jacques sold most of his diving equipment, receiv- ing $5,062.50 (including GST of $562.50). How- ever, he decided to keep the business 4-wheel drive vehicle for his own private purposes. He bought the vehicle in 1984 at a cost of $9,500 so he could take clients to isolated locations. The vehicle has a current market value of $8,000. Jacques must account for these items in his final GST return: ï Any ìbusiness as usualî taxable supplies made in the final GST taxable period ï $562.50 output tax on the sale of the dive equip- ment ï $888.88 output tax on the supply of the vehicle to himself (this is one-ninth of $8,000, the lesser of the cost price and the open market value). 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.1 (July 1994) Wages paid to spouse who cooks for permanent employees - deductibility Introduction This item states the Commissionerís current policy on claiming deductions for wages paid to a spouse who cooks for permanent employees. Background Section 106(1)(d) of the Income Tax Act 1976 prohibits the deduction of wages paid to a taxpayerís spouse, unless the Commissioner consents to that deduction before the taxpayer claims it. The taxpayer must satisfy the Commissioner that the payment is for the perform- ance of non-domestic services by the spouse, or is otherwise a bona fide payment, and that the taxpayer incurs the payment exclusively in the production of income. The Commissioner can disallow as much of the deduction as he considers excessive (section 97). Policy To obtain the Commissionerís approval of the deduc- tions, the taxpayer should contact the local Inland Revenue office. The staff there will tell the taxpayer what details are needed, and advise when the approval is granted. Provided the wages meet the general statutory criteria for deductibility, the Commissioner will approve a taxpayerís request to claim a deduction for wages paid to his or her spouse for cooking for permanent employ- ees. To claim the deduction the taxpayer must satisfy the normal obligations required of employers. The spouse must complete an IR†12, and the taxpayer must deduct PAYE (including ACC premiums) and pay it to Inland Revenue. The taxpayer must actually pay the spouse wages on a regular basis (in the same manner as payments to other employees) and such wages must not be more than a reasonable amount for the services that the spouse performs. The current level of wages paid for comparable services will be taken as a guide to what is a reasonable amount. The taxpayer must make a special arrangement with Inland Revenue if he or she wishes to employ his or her spouse to cook for employees over a short period (for example, to cook for seasonal workers such as shearers), or if he or she wishes the spouse to cook for permanent part-time workers or family members who are tempo- rary employees. The wages paid to the spouse are assessable income. Disbursements by professional firms on behalf of clients - GST Summary The Commissioner has been asked to clarify how the GST Act applies to disbursements which professional firms make on behalf of their clients. This item outlines how the agency provisions of the GST Act apply to these payments. Weíve used a law firm as an example to illustrate the relevant principles, but the same GST treatment will also apply to payments made in the same circumstances by other registered persons. If a law firm makes a payment to a third party as agent for a client, the firm does not account for GST output or input tax on the supply. However, the law firm must account for GST output tax on payments that it makes in the capacity of principal and on-charges to the client. Background Law firms may charge their clients for a variety of costs incurred in the course of providing legal services, in addition to their fee for legal services. These charges may include: ï Payments made by the firm as agent for the client ï Other costs incurred by the firm as principal in order to perform the legal services for the client. The GST treatment of individual charges depends on whether the law firm charges the client for a supply received by the firm as agent for the client, or as a principal in respect of the supply. An agent is a person engaged to bring a principal into a contractual relationship with a third party. It is a mixed question of fact and law whether a person is acting as an agent or a principal for a supply. Therefore, the deter- mination of whether a law firm acts as an agent for a client depends on the particular circumstances of each supply. Payments made as agent A law firm may act as an agent for a client if it receives a taxable supply of goods and services for which the client is legally liable to pay. The firm may pay statutory fees or arrange and pay for supplies of other goods and services as agent for the client. For example, it may pay fees for supplies received from the Court or a govern- ment department, e.g., court fees and land transfer fees. If it is registered, the supplier of these goods and services must account for GST output tax on the sup- plies. The law firm acts as agent for its client when it receives and pays for the supplies. Because of the agency relationship between the law firm and the client, continued on page 6 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.1 (July 1994) If the firm passes the charges on to the client, the Commissioner considers that the charges form part of the total fee for the supply of legal services. The law firm should account for GST output tax on these items in the same manner as the rest of the legal fee (if taxable). A registered client may claim an input tax deduction for the GST paid if the legal services are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Pre-incorporation supplies If the law firm is acting for a promoter who is setting up a company (which is not yet incorporated), section 22 of the GST Act outlines the GST treatment of payments made by the firm as agent for that client. Section 22 allows the company, once incorporated and registered for GST, to claim input tax credits for goods and services acquired by the promoter before the companyís incorporation. To qualify for the input tax deduction, the company must have appointed the promoter as a member, officer or employee of the company and reimbursed that promoter for the cost of the goods and services. The promoter must have also acquired the goods and services for the purpose of carrying on a taxable activity by the company, and must not have used them for any other purpose. Section 22 does not apply in any of these situations: ï if the supply of the goods and services by the promoter to the company is a taxable supply or a supply of secondhand goods (not being a taxable supply) ï If the goods and services were acquired more than six months before incorporation ï if the company does not hold sufficient records to establish the particulars of the supply. Example Bedrock Ltd engages its law firm to provide legal services in connection with a commercial property purchase. Bedrock Ltd is purchasing the property for use in its taxable activity. Both the law firm and Bedrock Ltd are registered for GST. The firm sends Bedrock Ltd a bill setting out the following costs: ï legal services supplied in the course of the property conveyance ï the cost of a national toll call made by the law firm to investigate the terms of a lease of the property ï transfer and mortgage fees paid to the Land Transfer Office as agent for Bedrock Ltd (The Land Transfer Office issued a tax invoice for these fees to the law firm.) The firm has records of Bedrock Ltdís address and registration number. from page 5 section 60 of the GST Act governs the GST treatment of the transaction. Section 60(2) of the GST Act deems a taxable supply of goods and services made to an agent on behalf of a principal to be a supply made to the principal. Under this section, a supply of goods or services that the law firm receives as agent for a client is deemed to be supplied to the client, not to the law firm. If the law firm pays for the supply and the client reimburses the firm for that payment, the reimbursement is not consid- eration for a supply of services by the law firm. The law firm does not have to account for GST output or input tax on the supply. A GST-registered client may claim an input tax deduc- tion for the taxable supply if the supply is acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. To obtain the input tax deduction, the client must hold a tax invoice for the supply as required by sections 20(2) and 24 of the GST Act. (However, under section 24(5) the client would not need a tax invoice if the considera- tion for a supply is $50 or less.) There are two ways that a client can satisfy the invoice requirements: If invoice is in client’s name If the tax invoice for the supply names the client as the recipient of the supply and complies with the require- ments of section 24, the client may use this invoice to substantiate the input tax deduction. If invoice is in law firm’s name The proviso to section 60(2) allows the law firm to ask the supplier to issue a tax invoice for the supply as if the firm had received the supply. If the supplier issues the tax invoice to the law firm, section†60(3) requires the firm to maintain sufficient records to enable the ascer- tainment of the clientís name, address and GST regis- tration number. The client may use the tax invoice that the supplier issued to the law firm to support an input tax deduction. The client or the law firm (on the clientís behalf) must hold the supplierís tax invoice at the time that the client furnishes its GST return. This tax invoice must comply with the requirements of section 24 of the GST Act. If the law firm holds the tax invoice as agent for the client, the client must hold the tax invoice issued by the law firm to the client (setting out legal services rendered and details of disbursements) to further substantiate the input tax deduction. Law firm acting as principal The agency provisions do not apply where the law firm pays for taxable supplies which it receives as principal, and on-charges those supplies to the client. For exam- ple, a law firm may charge a client for secretarial support time, telephone calls, facsimile transmissions or for photocopying. Generally, the law firm incurs these costs to enable it to provide legal services. It does not incur these costs as agent for any particular client. 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.1 (July 1994) GST treatment ï The law firm does not account for GST output tax on the charges made for the transfer and mort- gage fees. Bedrock Ltd can claim an input tax deduction for the supply by the Land Transfer Office. Bedrock Ltd may use the tax invoice issued in the name of the law firm by the Land Transfer Office and the law firmís bill to substan- tiate the input tax deduction. The tax invoice issued by the Land Transfer Office to the law firm must satisfy the require- ments of section 24 and must be held by either Bedrock Ltd or the law firm (as agent) at the time Bedrock Ltd furnishes its GST return. ï The law firm must account for GST output tax on the fee for legal services rendered, and on the on- charged cost of the toll call. Bedrock Ltd can claim an input tax deduction for the GST so charged. Bedrock Ltd can use the bill issued by the law firm to support the input tax deduction (provided that this bill satisfies the requirements of section 24 as a tax invoice). continued on page 8 “Apples for Schools” promotion - GST Introduction This item sets out the GST treatment of the ìApples for Schoolsî promotion. The promotion involves several supermarkets who provide computer equipment either to a group affiliated to local schools (ìorganising bodyî), or directly to the schools. The organising body then gifts the computer equipment to the school. Concerns have been raised that the organising body or school may be subject to GST when they receive the computer equip- ment. Summary ï If an organising body is not registered for GST, it will not be liable for GST when it receives computer equipment from the supermarket. ï No GST liability arises to any party when the organis- ing body gifts the computer equipment to the school. ï A GST liability only arises if a GST-registered organising body or a GST-registered school promotes or advertises the participating supermarket in re- sponse to the supply of the computer equipment. Background An organising body (PTA, students, parents, commu- nity group or the school board itself) collects till receipts or coupons from one of the participating supermarkets. Once the total value of the till receipts or coupons exceeds a target amount the supermarket provides the organising body with computer equipment. The organis- ing body then donates the equipment to their affiliated school. In most cases the organising body will not be not registered for GST, however there may be occasions where the school itself collects the till receipts or coupons and is GST registered. Unconditional gift Section 2 of the GST Act 1985 defines the term ìuncon- ditional giftî. The Commissionerís interpretation of ìunconditional giftî is explained in Appendix B of TIB Volume Two, No. 4 (November 1990). In summary, a payment will be an unconditional gift if it meets these criteria: ï The payment must be voluntary. ï The payment must be made to a non-profit body for the carrying out of the purposes of that non-profit body. ï No identifiable direct valuable benefit can arise to the person making the payment, or to an associated person. ï The payment must not be made by the Crown or a public authority. If the organising body or school advertises or promotes the participating supermarket during the course of collecting the till receipts or coupons, a benefit arises to the supermarket and the payment (the computer equip- ment) does not constitute an unconditional gift. This does not automatically mean that a GST liability arises to the organising body or school. A liability only arises if that body or school is registered for GST. However, in many cases the organising body or school simply collects the till receipts or coupons and does not pro- mote the supermarket. In this situation no benefit is provided to the supermarket. The supply of the compu- ter equipment constitutes an unconditional gift in such cases. The organising body voluntarily donates the computer equipment to a non-profit body (the school). No benefit arises to the organising body as a result. Therefore, the donation of the equipment by the organising body to the school also constitutes an unconditional gift. Taxable supply If the supply of the computer from the supermarket to the organising body is not an unconditional gift there may be a taxable supply. A supply attracts GST when it is a ìtaxable supplyî. A taxable supply is a supply made by a GST registered person in the course of a taxable activity. If the organising body is not registered for GST 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.1 (July 1994) supermarket, a taxable supply does occur. The organis- ing body or school must account for GST equal to 1/9th of the value of the computer equipment. If an organising body or school is unsure whether it has a GST liability, it should contact the local Inland Revenue office.

We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received.

Section 76 of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 specifies that these are the only types of compensation paid under the Act that are taxable: • compensation for loss of earnings • compensation for loss of potential earning capacity • vocational rehabilitation allowance • weekly compensation paid to a surviving spouse, children, or other dependants of a person who dies as a result of personal injury covered by the Act. These payments are specifically not taxable: • independence allowance • survivors’ grants • funeral grants • any payment to an injured person to pay for rehabilitation (except vocational rehabilitation allowance above). from page 7 any benefits provided to the supermarket will not represent a taxable supply and therefore will not attract GST. If an organising body is a registered person, or if a registered school collects the receipts or coupons on its own behalf, and provides an advertising benefit to the 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.1 (July 1994) Depreciation recovered on sale of a building - spreading the income Former section 117 - Revised assessments where assets sold after deduction of depreciation allowances: A landlord sold his rental property in the 1992-93 income year. He asked if there were any income spreading provisions for depre- ciation recovered on the sale of the building. Buildings sold in period 28 July 1988 - 31 March 1993 Any depreciation which is recovered when an asset (including a building) is sold after 28 July 1988 is assessable income. This income can be spread over the year of sale and any or all of the three previous years if both of these conditions are met: • the sale occurred before the start of the 1993-94 income year • the amount of depreciation recovered is more than $1,000. To spread this income, either the taxpayer or his or her agent must apply to Inland Revenue in writing. Buildings sold on or after 1 April 1993 The spreading provision does not apply to buildings or other assets sold on or after 1 April 1993. Depreciation recovered on buildings sold after this date is covered by the new section 117. Losses from disposition of depreciable property - effect of Para Handkerchief case Section 117(3) - loss from disposition of depreciable property: A taxpayer asked if the Para Handkerchief case (Para Handkerchief and Textiles (1964) Ltd v CIR (1992) 14 NZTC 9,125) overrides the deduction of losses from the disposition of depreciable property available under section 117(3). The short answer is no. Before the introduction of the new depreciation rules, (which apply from the 1993-1994 income year), section 108 provided the legisla- tive basis for depreciation. Generally, section 108 allowed a deduction for “ordi- nary depreciation” to recompense fair wear and tear, obsolescence, or useless- ness of assets used in the production of income. Depreciation allowances were available at the Commissioner’s discretion. The Para Handkerchief case involved a company that purchased new plant and used it to earn assessable income for approximately ten months. The plant was sold for a substantial loss when the business venture failed. The company sought to claim a deduction of $239,907 for the loss on a sale of assets. The Commissioner disallowed the claim under the then section 108 on the grounds that the equipment was neither useless nor obsolete. The Court held that whether an item has become obsolete or useless is a ques- tion of fact to which an objective test is applied. Here the assets had suffered a reduction in value not because they had become useless, but because the com- pany could not operate profitably. The price of the assets sold was affected by the factors of supply and demand, not the state of the assets. The Court consid- ered that the loss suffered was a capital loss and therefore no deduction was allowed. As part of the new depreciation rules a new section 117 was enacted. Section 117(3) provides that if a taxpayer disposes of depreciable property for an amount that is less than its adjusted tax value at that time, a deductible loss arises. continued on page 10 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.1 (July 1994) Section 117(3) allows the taxpayer an automatic write-off for the difference between the adjusted tax value of the asset and the sale price. Section 117(3) applies to all assets except intangible property and buildings, disposed of from the 1993-1994 income year. Losses on disposal now have a statutory basis where previously they were deductible at the Commissioner’s discretion. There is no requirement for the asset to have become useless or obsolete. For these reasons section 117(3) supersedes the decision in Para Hand- kerchief. Losses on the sale of buildings are specifically not deductible under section 117(3). However, if buildings are sold at a loss, a deduction is allowable in the year of sale. The deduction is the lesser of the loss on sale or the depreciation allowance for the period of ownership in that year. Section 117(7) provides for the situation where depreciable property has been disposed of for an amount that the Commissioner believes is not its market value. In this situation the Commissioner deems the property to have been disposed of for a consideration equal to the property’s market value, or if the market value cannot be ascertained, for an amount specified by the Commis- sioner. “Other income” received after starting to receive New Zealand superannuation Section 336D(3) - Commissioner may determine date income received: A taxpayer was due to retire, and receive her last pay on 15 April 1994. She became entitled to receive New Zealand superannuation from 16 April 1994. However, because of some administrative difficulties, she did not receive her final pay until 2 May. She asked whether that final pay will be treated as “other income” for the purposes of New Zealand superannuitant surcharge. Usually, New Zealand superannuitant surcharge is payable when a super- annuitant receives “other income” which exceeds the person’s individual sur- charge exemption, at the same time as he or she is entitled to receive New Zea- land superannuation. Where New Zealand superannuation is received for part of the year only, as in this example, the exemption is apportioned. However, in this instance the taxpayer’s final pay will not be treated as other income, even though it was received at the same time that New Zealand super- annuation was being received. Under section 336D(3) of the Income Tax Act 1976, if other income is received within a reasonable time after a superannuitant starts receiving New Zealand superannuation, the Commissioner may determine that income to be received on a date other than the actual date of receipt, as long as these three conditions are met: • the income would have been received on the day on which the Commissioner determines • the superannuitant has not deliberately arranged his or her affairs so as to obtain a favourable result • it is in the superannuitant’s interests that the section should apply. The determination of what constitutes a reasonable period will depend on the facts of each case. from page 9 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.1 (July 1994) Business losses - reduction of PAYE deductions Section 351 - Special tax code certificates: A taxpayer with a business which was running at a loss asked if this loss could be used to reduce his PAYE deductions from a salary that he also receives. If the taxpayer expects the amount of PAYE deductions made from his salary or wages during the year to exceed his actual end of year tax liability, he may apply for a special tax code certificate (IR 23). Under section 351, the Commissioner may issue an IR 23 annually specifying a special rate at which tax is to be de- ducted by the employer. This special rate can take into account an entitlement to deduct past business losses carried forward (under section 188), or an estimated current year business loss (if the taxpayer provides an acceptable budget). To obtain a special tax code certificate, the taxpayer should complete an applica- tion form (IR 23B) and send it to the district office which holds his tax records. Every taxpayer who has used a special tax code certificate must file a tax return. Exemption from filing employee start and finish schedules Section 432 - Employers to make returns as to employees: A local newspaper employer has asked if it could become exempt from filing an employee start and finish schedule (IR 66ES). Its grounds were that filling out a schedule of employees for each month was time consuming as the employer had a high staff turnover, especially for newspaper delivery personnel. Section 432(6) allows the Commissioner to exempt an employer from filing a start and finish schedule for: • any class or description of employment • the employment of any class or description of employee • the employment of employees by any class or description of employer. In this case, the Commissioner did not exempt the employer from filing an IR 66ES schedule. The reason for collecting the information contained in the schedule is to help the Department of Social Welfare and the Accident Rehabili- tation & Compensation Insurance Corporation to combat benefit and earnings fraud and abuse. To date, the Commissioner has not given any exemptions. Computer software development - deductibility of costs A computer software developer intended to develop some new software, but had not yet arranged any sales. She asked if pre-development expenditure, such as a feasibility study, was deductible. These taxpayers can deduct pre-development expenditure, as long as the ex- penditure occurs in an established business (as opposed to a business in the set- up process): • taxpayers who develop software for sale or licence • in-house software developers (i.e. taxpayers who develop software for use in their own business), For further details, see the Appendix to TIB Volume Four, No.10 (May 1993). 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.1 (July 1994) Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Consignment notes appearing as tax invoices Section 24 - Tax invoice: The representative of a small firm was concerned that he was receiving more than one copy of a tax invoice for incoming goods from his major supplier. The problem was that a batch of under copies had not been endorsed with the words “Consignment Note”, and without that endorsement the two copies were identical. The recipient wondered if the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 was being infringed. Section 24(1) states that it is not lawful to issue more than one tax invoice for each taxable supply. If an under copy is a duplicate of the top copy and both are issued, a breach of the Act occurs. In this situation, it seems likely that a genuine mistake has been made. How- ever, Inland Revenue will formally advise the issuer of the alleged offence and caution against a repetition. We will take no further action provided that: • the recipient has not made any double input credit claims for the same supply • the issuer rectifies the mistake as soon as possible • No fraud has been contemplated. Upcoming TIB articles In the next few months we’ll be releasing policy statements on these topics in the Tax Information Bulletin: • When Inland Revenue can grant relief from payment of tax in cases of financial hardship • GST and temporary imports • Tax treatment of salaries and emoluments received by NZ residents employed by the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and similar entities • Dividend withholding payment accounts as they relate to consolidated groups of compa- nies • Losses of individual NZ resident insurance underwriters • Treatment of dividend imputation credits and dividend withholding payment credits in the hands of trustees and beneficiaries • GST and secondhand goods • GST treatment of goods donated to a non-profit body, when the goods undergo change • Filing a special GST return when goods are sold in satisfaction of a debt • Payment of lease duty on the variation/renewal of a lease • Misappropriation of partnership property by a partner • Meaning of terms “own” and “acquired” for depreciation purposes • Personal sickness and accident and loss of earnings insurance policies • Tax status of bodies corporate • Responsibility for deducting withholding tax from door charges at hotels and taverns We’ll publish these statements as soon as we’ve finished consulting with commentators outside Inland Revenue. 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.1 (July 1994) Legal decisions - case notes This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council.

CIR Act:Income Tax Act 1976, sections 61(21), (25) & (27) Keywords:Charitable trust, not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual, ad- vancement of religion Summary:The High Court held that income derived by the Presbyterian Church of New Zealand Beneficiary Fund (“the Fund”) was exempt from income tax under section 61(25) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (“the Act”). The Fund provided for the financial security of retired Ministers and their dependants and was held to be a charity. continued on page 14 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.1 (July 1994) Facts:The fund is a category 1 superannuation scheme under the definition in section 2 of the Act. It is administered by a standing committee of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (“the Church”). The General Assembly governs the Church in New Zealand. The Fund operates to benefit retired ministers of the Church. The primary ben- efit it provides is the payment of an annuity to ministers upon retirement at the age of 60. Some incidental benefits exist, including the facility for lump sum capitalisation of the annuity, sickness benefits and widows’ benefits (which include child and orphan allowances). The Fund’s income was exempt up until 30 April 1988 under section 61(21) of the Act. However, from that date the provision no longer exempts such superan- nuation income. The Court therefore had to consider whether the income de- rived after that date was exempt under any other provision, namely section 61(25) of the Act, which exempts income derived by charities from tax. The Fund contended that the income was exempt. The Commissioner argued to the contrary, submitting that: 1.The Fund was not a charity but rather was a superannuation fund. 2.The purpose of the Fund was not to advance religion but rather to provide benefits to its members. 3.That there was insufficient public benefit for the Fund to be charitable. 4.The Fund was carried on for the private pecuniary gain of the members of the fund. Decision:The High Court rejected the Commissioner’s contentions, concluding that the Fund was a charity and that its income was exempt from tax under section 61(25). The Court said that the Trust Deed demonstrated the Fund’s charitable purpose. The Court considered that the nature of the controlling body and its members (the Church) demonstrated that the purpose of the fund was that of advancing religion. His Honour considered that an integral part of the advancement of religion involved the activities of its Ministers, whose financial protection and welfare on retirement are the primary concern of the Fund. He therefore concluded that a fund of this kind is undoubtedly charitable as going to the advancement of religion, if it is in the hands of trustees appointed by a mainstream church. Justice Heron acknowledged that the advancement of religion was not the sole purpose of the Fund (accepting that the provision of benefits to members was also a purpose), but he concluded that the predominant purpose of the Fund was charitable. The provision of private benefits to members was merely sub- sidiary. The Fund also did not fail for lack of public benefit - His Honour considered that the protection of the clergy was of sufficient public benefit. The decision in Baptist Union of Ireland (Northern) Corporation Ltd v. CIR 26 TC 335 was central to the Fund’s case and the judgment of the Court. Justice Heron considered that decision to be indistinguishable from the facts in this case. Comment:Inland Revenue has not yet decided whether to appeal this decision. from page 13 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.1 (July 1994) Whether companies incorporated outside New Zealand can be included in a group for tax purposes Rating:•••• Case:CIR v Alcan New Zealand Limited CA 150/93 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, sections 85(4), 191, 242, 317(c), 318, 336N Keywords:Group of companies, value of trading stock, interpretation of taxing statutes Summary:This was an appeal to the Court of Appeal from the decision of Justice Tompkins in Alcan New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,125. Justice Tompkins adopted a literal approach to the interpretation of the term “companies” for section 191(3), and held that section 191(3) applied to companies whether incorporated in New Zealand or elsewhere. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. Facts:Alcan New Zealand Ltd (“Alcan”) was incorporated in New Zealand and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Alcan Australia Ltd (“AAL”), an Australian resident company. AAL is 73.26% owned by Alcan Aluminium Ltd, a Canadian com- pany. Alcan purchases aluminium ingots and billets from AAL, and processes them into semi-fabricated aluminium products. When Alcan calculated the closing value of its trading stock under section 85(4) for the 1988 and 1989 income years, it sought to use the “cost price” of that aluminium to AAL as a member of their “group of companies” rather than the “cost price” to Alcan. The Commissioner issued an assessment for the 1988 and 1989 income years which adjusted Alcan’s valuation of trading stock. Alcan objected to the assess- ment and a case was stated to the High Court. Alcan submitted that Alcan and AAL were a “group of companies” as defined in section 191(3), and Alcan was entitled under the former proviso to section 85(4) to value its trading stock “at cost”. This would mean that the profit AAL made in selling the trading stock to Alcan was to be disregarded. The Commissioner submitted that the term “group of companies” in section 191(3) is to be construed as applying only to “New Zealand taxpayers” in the sense that it refers to companies whose activities produce either income which is assessable for New Zealand income tax or losses recognised under the Income Tax Act. The High Court decided in favour of Alcan and held that the phrase “group of companies” in section 191(3) should be interpreted by applying the definition of “companies” in section 2. Therefore the term “group of companies” referred to a group of companies whether incorporated in New Zealand or elsewhere. The Commissioner appealed the High Court’s decision to the Court of Appeal, contending that the definition of “group of companies” in section 191(3) implies that it applies only to companies which are New Zealand taxpayers within Part IV of the Income Tax Act 1976. It therefore follows that Alcan is not entitled to rely on the former proviso to section 85(4) so as to value its trading stock at the cost to AAL. Decision:The Court of Appeal held that section 191(3) should not be read in a restrictive manner and that a non-resident company can be a member of a “group of com- panies”. It also held that Alcan was not prevented from relying on the former proviso in section 85(4). In arriving at this decision, the single judgment of Justice McKay looked at the principles of interpreting taxing statutes. In apply- ing the rules of interpretation of a taxing statute as set out in the judgment of the Privy Council in Mangin v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1971\] NZLR 591 continued on page 16 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.1 (July 1994) at 594, Justice McKay noted that it would be a mistake to put the interpretation of revenue statutes in a different category from other legislation. All statutes are to be interpreted on the basis set down in section 5(j) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1924 and are deemed remedial, and accordingly should receive “such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as will best ensure the attain- ment of the object of the Act and of such provision and enactment according to the true intent, meaning and spirit.” Applying the rules of interpretation set down in Mangin the Court held that none of the arguments advanced by the Commissioner provided a sufficient basis for departing from the plain meaning of the words. It was not necessary to read into those words some implied limitation and to do so would require speculation as to legislative intent. The present case was not one in which a literal interpretation would result in any injustice to the taxpayer, nor was it in conflict with the purpose of the legislation. Comment:Inland Revenue is appealing this decision. Whether a full-time student qualifies for the transitional tax allowance Rating:••• Case:TRA No 92/88 Case R19 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,096 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, section 50C Keywords:Qualifying person, full-time earner, remunerative work Summary:A full-time student was not considered to be a full-time earner, and therefore could not qualify for the transitional tax allowance rebate. Facts:The taxpayer was a full-time university student receiving a student allowance. In his 1990 tax return he claimed the transitional tax allowance rebate on the basis that he was a full-time earner. Decision:To qualify for the transitional tax allowance rebate, a taxpayer must be a qualify- ing person as defined in section 50C(1). This means that the taxpayer must be a full-time earner engaged in remunerative work. Both these terms are also defined in section 50C(1). The taxpayer considered that his study was work done to receive a student allowance. He therefore considered that he qualified for the transitional tax allowance rebate. The Judge found that study at university is not work that provides a taxpayer with income. To be remunerative work, remuneration must be received for per- sonal services performed. The connection between receiving the student allow- ance and working at university studies was not direct enough. The taxpayer was therefore not conducting remunerative work under section 50C(1). He did not qualify for the transitional tax allowance rebate. Comment:The taxpayer is not appealing this decision. from page 15 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.1 (July 1994) Whether forward wool contracts and forward foreign exchange contracts are financial arrangements Rating:••••• Case:CIR v Dewavrin Segard (NZ) Limited (1994) 16 NZTC 11,048 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, sections 64B to 64M Keywords:Accrual regime, foreign exchange contracts, wool contracts Summary:The taxpayer’s forward contracts for the sale of wool and forward foreign ex- change contracts were held to be financial arrangements subject to the accrual regime. Although the foreign exchange contracts were entered into to hedge the wool contracts the taxpayer had to account for them separately. The calculation of foreign exchange gains or losses on the wool contracts began when the wool contracts were entered into rather than on the delivery date. The calculations of income or expenditure on balance dates (under section 64C) might be modified under the “wash up” calculation upon maturity (under section 64F). Income or expenditure for the contracts under section 64C was to be calculated using market valuation methods. Facts:The Commissioner appealed this case from the Taxation Review Authority decision of Case Q2 (1993) 15 NZTC 5,005. Wool contracts The taxpayer was a commodity exporter. It was not a cash basis holder under the accrual regime. It sold wool on a deferred or forward basis. Purchase prices were denominated in foreign currencies, generally United States dollars. Typical wool contracts were those in which the balance date intervened between the dates on which the wool contracts were made and the dates of shipment and delivery. Payments were made no earlier than the dates of shipment. Between the dates the wool contracts were entered into and the company’s balance date (31 December 1987) movements in the United States dollar exchange rates re- sulted in unrealised losses of $590,409 at balance date. The Commissioner did not allow a deduction for this loss. Foreign exchange contracts The taxpayer arranged foreign exchange contracts to hedge against the risk of currency fluctuations. These forward foreign exchange contracts did not pre- cisely match the forward wool contracts but the Taxation Review Authority did not regard this mismatching as material. Under the foreign exchange contracts, the taxpayer undertook to sell United States dollars in amounts to be yielded by the wool contracts on the dates of expected receipt. In return it received fixed amounts in New Zealand dollars. At the balance date these foreign exchange contracts were showing unrealised gains of $539,724, which the Commissioner treated as assessable income. Taxation Review Authority The taxpayer objected and the Taxation Review Authority held that: • The wool contracts were not “financial arrangements” subject to the accrual regime. The unrealised losses of $590,409 were not deductible. • The foreign exchange contracts were subject to the regime but the gains on the contracts did not have to be returned until maturity. Accordingly, the taxpayer’s tax positions on the wool and foreign exchange contracts were matched at balance date. continued on page 18 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.1 (July 1994) Decision:Justice Gault delivered the Court of Appeal’s judgment. The Court allowed the Commissioner’s appeal for the foreign exchange contracts. The taxpayer had to return the $539,724 gain in the 1988 income tax year. However, the taxpayer was entitled to seek further assessments for the forward wool contracts as at 31 December 1987. The Court of Appeal held that: • The forward foreign exchange contracts were “financial arrangements” under the section 64B(1) definition. • The forward contracts for the sale of wool were similarly financial arrange- ments subject to the accrual regime. The only exceptions were contracts where settlement was required within 63 days of entry. Such short-term agreements for the sale and purchase of property are excepted financial arrangements. • Each wool contract and its corresponding foreign exchange contract could not be regarded as parts of the same financial arrangement. Accordingly, the taxpayer could not offset its currency gains and losses on this basis. Even if the two contracts matched, they could not be considered parts of the same ar- rangement because the taxpayer’s counterparties under the two types of con- tracts were different. There was no interaction or interdependence between the counterparties. • In applying section 64C(1) to each wool contract at balance date that provision could not be read with section 64F. When calculating accrual income (or ex- penditure) at balance date, section 64C(1) requires that “regard shall be had to the amount of all consideration provided to the person and by the person.” Justice Gault commented that while consistency is obviously desirable, that cannot be achieved unless the words are reasonably capable of construction to that end. Accordingly, he held that fluctuations in value between the dates contracts were entered and the balance date will be income or expenditure to be accounted for on an accrual basis. This is notwithstanding that the result might be modified on a base price adjustment under section 64F. The base price adjustment is a “wash up” calculation of overall income or expenditure from a financial arrangement required under the accrual regime. • The appropriate accrual method under section 64C for the foreign exchange contracts was the valuation method. This is the method employed under SSAP-21 for foreign exchange contracts not taken out for hedging purposes. The method compares values at balance dates with those when the contract was entered into using spot rates (determined presumably by reference to Determination G6) for the foreign currency amounts. The method was held to conform with the requirements of section 64C(4). • Section 64C(3)(b) applied to the wool contracts at balance date. Justice Gault held that the taxpayer could apply a market valuation method at balance date under this provision. • It would not be open for a taxpayer to avoid the application of the accrual rules by claiming to have adopted a different method of accrual accounting in its financial reporting, and claiming that therefore no alternative method pro- vided for in section 64C can be adopted. Comment:Inland Revenue is appealing this decision to the Privy Council. We also propose to issue a policy statement on the Dewavrin decision in a future TIB. from page 17 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.1 (July 1994) Whether expenditure qualifies for the prevention of pollution incentive Rating:•••• Case:Waste Management Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue HC55/93;NZTC (1994) 16 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, section 124 Keywords:Sanitary landfill; preventing or combating pollution; in the construction on land; treat- ing industrial waste; primarily. Summary:A taxpayer’s business operations involved the collection, treatment and disposal of waste material. It purchased and developed a sanitary landfill site and ap- plied to the Commissioner to deduct 20% per year of the capital expenditure under section 124. The Court held that legal costs, expenditure on public rela- tions exercises and valuers’ fees that were incurred solely for planning hearings were costs of acquiring the land and therefore were not costs incurred in “con- struction on land”; and that expenditure on exploratory wells and construction plans and specifications were expenditure incurred in “construction on land” and were therefore deductible under the section. Facts:The taxpayer’s operations involved the collection and disposal of commercial and domestic waste and the treatment of the material recovered. The taxpayer expanded its business by buying a sanitary landfill site at Dairy Flat 20 km north of Auckland. Two major hazards arise from poor control of a landfill: leaching of contami- nated water and production of gases, particularly methane. During the 1988, 1989 and 1990 years there was very little physical work carried out on the site. The only excavation on site was done in 1988 when 13 exploratory wells were bored to indicate the texture of the substrata. However, during the three year period engineers and others carried out extensive surveys of the land, and produced feasibility studies and preliminary working plans in case this was a viable and permitted commercial enterprise. There was heavy expenditure on planning applications. Apart from the exploratory wells no physical work was done until late 1992. The taxpayer claimed for application of the benefit under section 124 of the Income Tax Act 1976. Section 124 allows a yearly deduction of 20% of capital expenditure. The section allows a deduction if a taxpayer is engaged in a busi- ness in New Zealand and has incurred in that business expenditure in the con- struction on land in New Zealand of earthworks, ponds, settling tanks, or other similar improvements primarily for the purpose of treating industrial waste in order to prevent or combat pollution of the environment. Decision:Justice Speight held that: • All of the expenses incurred in the operation related directly or indirectly to the eventual carrying out of the waste treatment process, but not all such expenses, either current or capital, could claim the benefit of section 124. • The word “treating” is not to be construed as solely involving some chemical process. In the context of section 124, “treating” is more akin to “dealing with”. Purely physical activities such as compaction, containment and settling, are not treatments in the chemical sense, but are consonant with the type of works section 124 contemplates. • Construction work on a large scale involves exploration, preparation of plans, supervision of layout, and finally the major operation. Having regard to the object of section 124, there is no logical distinction to be drawn between continued on page 20 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.1 (July 1994) expenditure incurred on physical development and expenditure on non- physical work such as design costs. Expenditure incurred by way of research, investigation, drawing of plans, and the consequent physical activity comprise “construction primarily for the purpose of treating”. Expenditure incurred in altering the zoning restraints does not relate to construction. Expenditure for the purpose of gaining permission to carry out work which would not other- wise have been permitted is a cost of land acquisition and is not expenditure in the construction on the land. Examples of such expenditure are legal costs, public relations exercises and valuers’ fees that the taxpayer incurs solely for planning hearings. This expenditure is not incurred in the construction on land of improvements for treating industrial waste. • Some of the engineering fees might relate solely to preparation of opinions to be given to the hearings as evidence, and may not be relevant to construction plans. However, if such material served a dual purpose, and was to be utilised for construction purposes if and when the company obtained consent, then the expenditure is deductible. Physical work such as the exploratory wells and construction plans and specifications are eligible for the deduction. Comment:Inland Revenue and the taxpayer are appealing this decision Whether wool is a secondhand good for GST purposes Rating:•••• Case:L.R. McLean and Company Ltd and Others v Commissioner of Inland Revenue CA 88/93 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, section 2 Keywords:Secondhand goods, use Summary:The taxpayers appealed against the High Court decision that wool is not a secondhand good for the purposes of the GST Act. The Court of Appeal con- cluded that wool is not a secondhand good, and dismissed the appeal. (See TIB Volume Four, No. 8 (April 1993) for the High Court decision on this case.) Facts:The taxpayers are wool merchants, who buy wool from farmers. A number of the farmers are not GST-registered. The issue was whether the wool the taxpay- ers buy is a secondhand good for the purposes of the GST Act. If so, then they can claim an input tax credit for the wool they buy from non-registered persons. The taxpayers argued that the definition of “secondhand goods” was a term of art, intended to apply to any article that unregistered persons sell to registered persons, to enable registered persons to claim an input tax credit. They argued that the scheme of the Act indicated that the input tax credit mechanism was designed to apply to all goods that private persons sold to registered persons. Decision:The taxpayers could not claim an input tax credit for the wool they bought from unregistered farmers. The Court rejected the appellants’ argument that the Act intended that the input tax credit mechanism should apply to all goods sold to registered persons. The Court held that wool was not a secondhand good. The ordinary meaning of “secondhand” includes both previous use and previ- ous ownership, with the emphasis on previous use. This means that once some- thing has been used for its intrinsic purpose, it is secondhand. Primary produce is not normally regarded as secondhand, because its intrinsic use is that of consumption. There was nothing in the purpose or scheme of the Act that would justify ignor- ing the ordinary meaning of the term “secondhand”. Comment:The taxpayers are not appealing to the Privy Council. from page 19 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.1 (July 1994) Whether goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable or exempt supplies Rating:•••• Case:CIR v BNZ Investment Advisory Services Limited (1994) 16 NZTC 11,111. Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 - sections 2(1), 8(1) and 10(19). Keywords:Principal purpose, input tax Summary:This was a successful appeal against the TRA decision in Case P62 (1992) 14 NZTC 4, 427. The High Court found that goods and services acquired by a financial planner were not acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies if the financial planner was dependent on commissions from invest- ments. Instead the planner acquired goods and services with the principal purpose of making exempt supplies of services. Facts:The taxpayer was a financial planner. It offered investment plans to its custom- ers for which it charged a small fee and a commission on all investments placed under the plan. Most of the efforts of the taxpayer’s staff involved giving invest- ment advice. This advice was a taxable supply of services, being an exclusion from the definition of “financial services” in section 3(1)(l). Much less time was spent on actually implementing the plan. Implementing the advice, and receiv- ing a commission, was an exempt supply of services under section 3(1)(l). The taxpayer claimed full input tax deductions for goods and services acquired for use in its business. The Commissioner disallowed the deductions and the taxpayer’s objection. The taxpayer stated a case to the TRA. The TRA found for the taxpayer, deciding that the single goal of the taxpayer was offering investment advice to the public. The TRA held that the taxpayer acquired goods and services for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, satisfying the definition of “input tax”. The taxpayer could make a section 20(3) deduction. Decision:The issue was whether the goods and services were acquired with the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Both parties agreed that “purpose” meant the object the taxpayer had in mind, not the taxpayer’s intention or motive. The parties differed slightly on the meaning of “principal”. The Commissioner argued that “principal” meant primary or fundamental purpose. The taxpayer believed it meant “more than half”. Justice Doogue accepted the Commissioner’s view. Justice Doogue found it unnecessary to consider whether “principal purpose” was an objective, subjective or intermediate test. He believed it would not make a difference in this case. However, he did note that in other cases the appropriate test may be important. Justice Doogue decided that the taxpayer’s principal purpose of acquiring goods and services was to derive income capable of meeting the cost of the goods and services. The principal purpose was not to provide investment advice. Giving investment advice was merely a means to an end. It provided negligible income of itself. The main method of earning income was by earning commissions on investments placed with financial institutions, that is, by providing exempt supplies of financial services. The goods and services were acquired principally to achieve income through making exempt supplies. Justice Doogue said that the TRA confused the means (investment advice) by which the taxpayer achieved its purpose (earning income) with its purpose. Justice Doogue suggested his analysis may have been different if the taxpayer had achieved income by charging realistic fees. He also may have decided the case differently if the business purpose was something other than achieving a profit through earning income. Comments:The taxpayer is not appealing this decision. 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.1 (July 1994) List of Inland Revenue booklets This list shows all of Inland Revenue’s information booklets as at the date of this Tax Information Bulletin.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.2 (August 1994) Filing a special GST return when a creditor sells a debtor’s goods in satisfaction of a debt Introduction This item states the Commissionerís current policy on furnishing a special GST return when a creditor sells a debtorís goods in satisfaction of a debt. Background When a debtor fails to pay a debt, a creditor will sometimes seize or repossess goods from the debtor, and sell them to recover the money owing. Section 17(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 specifies when a special GST return must be filed in this situation. Policy When a creditor sells a debtorís goods in satisfaction of a debt, the creditor must charge and account for GST on the sale and file a special GST return (GST†121) unless either of these situations applies: ï the debtor advises the creditor in writing that the sale would not be taxable if the debtor had made it, and the reasons why a sale by the debtor would not be taxable ï the creditor holds enough reasonable information to conclude that a sale by the debtor would not have been taxable. The creditorís obligation to file a special GST return is not affected by whether or not the he or she is registered for GST. The special return must show all of these details: ï the creditorís name, address, and GST registration number (if registered) ï the debtorís name, address, and registration number (if registered) ï the date of sale ï the description and quantity of the goods sold ï the sale price and the amount of GST charged ï any other particulars that Inland Revenue requires. The creditor must file this special return and account for the GST by the last working day of the month following the month of sale. The creditor must also supply the above details to the debtor by this date. The debtor is deemed to have sold the goods, and can claim any input tax credits still unclaimed. Neither the creditor nor the debtor may include GST for that supply in any other return. The tax charged by the creditor is recoverable as a debt due to the Crown. Example John is a plumber who is registered for GST. He borrows $5,000, using his work van as security. He claimed a GST input credit when he bought the van. John defaults on the repayments so the loan com- pany sells the van on 12 February. As John is registered for GST, the loan company must com- plete and file a GST 121 return, and account for GST on the sale of the van by the last working day of March. By this date, the company must also provide John with the information supplied on the return. Neither John nor the loan company may include the GST on the supply of the van in any further GST returns. Deducting withholding tax from hotel and tavern door charges Introduction This item states the Commissionerís current policy on deducting withholding tax from money collected as door charges at hotels and taverns, when this money is later handed to resident entertainers performing on the licensed premises. Background Entertainers in licensed premises are often paid out of takings from cover charges collected at the door of the bar in which they are performing. Resident entertainers - definition Under regulation 2 of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 (the Regulations), a ìresident entertainerî includes anyone deemed under Part IV of the Income Tax Act 1976 to be resident in New Zealand and who performs or engages in any activity which meets all of these conditions: ï The activity is in connection with any regular or casual performance by actors, entertainers, musicians, singers, dancers, comperes, or other artistes. ï The person performs the activity either alone or with any other person or persons in choirs, choruses, continued on page 2 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.2 (August 1994) Withholding declaration form IR 13 If withholding tax must be deducted from the door charges, the entertainer must supply a withholding declaration form (IR 13) to the hotel. If no withholding declaration form is supplied to the hotel, under section 343A of the Income Tax Act 1976, the tax deduction is increased by an additional 15 cents for each dollar paid to the entertainer. Circumstances when a hotel does not need to deduct withholding tax Entertainers accompanied by management when collecting door charges If a band member or entertainer collects door charges and is accompanied by an employee of the hotel who acts on behalf of the management by restricting entry to the hotel, there is no requirement for the hotel to deduct withholding tax from the door charges. The band member or entertainer is not collecting the door charges as an agent or delegate of management because he or she is not exercising the power to restrict entry. In this situation the door charges that are collected do not pass through managementís hands. The band or entertainer is responsible for accounting for any tax payable on the door charges. Contract of employment If an entertainer is working under a contract of employ- ment, PAYE deductions are made by the hotel on the basis that the payments are salary and wages. Hotels do not have to deduct withholding tax because regulation 4(2)(a) excludes salary and wages from withholding tax. Payment made to a company If the payment is made to a company, regulation 4(2)(b) excludes any payments made to the company from withholding tax. Exemption certificate If the entertainer holds an exemption certificate (IR†118) the payments are exempt from withholding tax under regulation†4(2)(c). Under regulation 5, the Commissioner may issue a certificate of exemption to any person who is in business. The person will then become a provisional taxpayer. Inland Revenue will only issue a certificate of exemp- tion to taxpayers who have proven records of filing returns and paying tax by the due dates. Lease duty on lease variations or renewals Introduction This item states the Commissionerís current policy on calculating lease duty when an increase in rental occurs on leases for commercial land and buildings. Background Section 26 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 (the Act), imposes stamp duty on leases of commercial land and buildings. Stamp duty is payable at the rate of 40c per $100 (or part thereof) of the maximum rent that from page 1 bands, orchestras, ballets, or other entertainment groups. ï The activity has a purpose of education, culture, religion, entertainment, or any other purpose. Specified payments made to resident entertainers are subject to withholding tax at 20 cents in the dollar under clause 4(a) of Part B of the Schedule to the Regulations. In specific circumstances, if entertainers or bands receive a payment from the manager or licensee of a hotel or tavern, the manager or licensee must deduct withholding tax. Policy This policy concerning the responsibility for deducting withholding tax from hotel door charges applies to resident entertainers only. Circumstances when a hotel must deduct withholding tax Contract for services If there is a contract for services (i.e. the entertainers or bands charge a fee for their services), the hotel must deduct and account for withholding tax. Door charges collected by entertainers unaccompanied by hotel/tavern management Under the Sale of Liquor Act 1989, the manager or licensee has the power to restrict entry into a licensed premises. A band member or entertainer acting alone who collects door charges and restricts entry to the premises is acting as an agent or delegate of the man- ager or licensee. The band member or entertainer is exercising the power to restrict entry on behalf of the manager or licensee, so he or she is collecting the charges on behalf of the management. The entertainers or bands are then paid for their performance from the door charges. The charges handed over to the entertainers or bands are ìspecified paymentsî as defined in clause 4(a) of Part B of the schedule to the Regulations, so the licensee or manager must deduct and account for withholding tax on this payment at 20 cents in the dollar. 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.2 (August 1994) is payable or may become payable under the lease in any year. If the lease is for a term that is less than a year, the stamp duty is payable on the maximum rent that is payable or may become payable over the term of the lease. There are two situations in which the rent payable may be increased: ï when a new lease agreement or a variation of the existing lease agreement is entered into, which results in an increase in the rent payable ï when the existing lease agreement provides for the rent to be re-determined based on the valuation of the property, inflation, or other factors. (Note that under section 33 of the Act, if a lease has a fixed rent and the lease agreement provides for the rent to be re-determined by valuation or otherwise, the lease duty is calculated on the lease as if the highest amount of fixed rent for any one period was payable throughout the term of the lease.) Policy Under section 29 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, if the rent is increased during the term of the lease, the new agreement is treated as a new lease but duty is assessed only on the increase in rental. If the rental is increased by executing a new lease after the term of the original lease has expired, lease duty is assessed on the whole of the actual rental payable. Example 1 Harold Bird leases a commercial building from UM†Pire Ltd on 1 December 1983 for a term of 10†years at a rental of $50,000 per year. In June 1993 Harold exercises his right to renew the lease for a further 5 years and the rental is increased to $70,000 per year. Duty is calculated as follows: Original rental (GST exclusive)$50,000 Revised rental (GST exclusive)$70,000 Increase in rental$20,000 GST at 12.5%$ 2,500 Amount on which duty is to be charged $22,500 Duty payable$90 This calculation method is used so that stamp duty is not charged retrospectively on the GST element of the original lease rental, as at the date of the original lease there may have been either no GST in existence, or GST at a different rate. Example 2 Details as in Example 1, but Harold does not exercise his right of renewal until January 1994. In this situation section 29 does not apply, and duty is assessed on the total rental payable under the new lease. Note: ìStamp dutyî, as defined in section 2 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, includes lease duty. Misappropriation of property by partner in a partnership Introduction This item states the Commissionerís current policy in situations when there is a partnership liability to make good a loss resulting from the misappropriation of property by a partner. Background Section 163 of the Income Tax Act 1976 allows a deduction for payments made by a partner to make good a loss suffered by any person outside the partnership (other than the spouse of any partner) as a result of the misappropriation of property by another partner. Before section 163 was introduced, losses of this kind were not deductible because they were capital in nature. The payment is deductible only if the partner is under a legal liability to make good the loss. It is not sufficient that the payment is made under a moral rather than a legal obligation. Section 13 of the Partnership Act 1908 sets out the general principle by which partners are liable for any wrong committed by one of their partners. All partners are liable if a wrongful act or omission by any partner causes loss or injury to any person (except a partner in the firm) or incurs any penalty. The partners are only liable if the wrong is caused by a partner acting in one of these capacities: ï in the ordinary course of the business of the firm ï with the authority of his or her co-partners. In addition to the general liability for wrongs imposed by section 13, section 14 of the Partnership Act 1908 also holds the partnership liable for a loss in these two specific situations: ï if a partner who is acting within the scope of his or her apparent authority receives a third personís money or property and misapplies it ï if the partnership receives a third personís money or property in the course of its business, and the money or property is misapplied by one or more of the partners while it is in the partnershipís custody. continued on page 4 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.2 (August 1994) The deduction is allowable in the year of payment. If the taxpayer later recoups all or part of the amount that was previously allowed as a deduction (for exam- ple, by way of insurance, indemnity, reimbursement, recovery or other means), the amount recouped is assessable income in the year the taxpayer receives it. Example John, Jane, and Jake carry on a car repair business in partnership. Susi brings her car in for repair. John sells the car (without the knowledge of Jane or Jake) and spends the proceeds at the race track. John, Jane, and Jake reimburse Susi for the loss of property. All three of the partners are liable to make good the loss. However, only Jane and Jake can deduct their part of the amount paid under section 163, in the year they pay it. Any amount that Jane and Jake later recover from John is assessable income in the year they receive it. Dividend withholding payment accounts and consolidated groups of companies Introduction This item states the Commissionerís current policy on dividend withholding payment accounts (ìDWPAî) as they relate to consolidated group companies. Background Sections 191C to 191WC of the Income Tax Act 1976 set out the rules for consolidated groups of companies. Under these rules, two or more New Zealand resident companies can elect to be treated as a consolidated group of companies if they are wholly owned (that is, if they have 100% common shareholding at all times in the income year). Companies which elect to form a consolidated group will effectively be taxed as if they were a single company. An election to form a consoli- dated group will apply from one of these years: ï from the 1993/94 income year onwards, if the compa- nies have a standard or late balance date for the 1993/94 year ï from the 1994/95 income year onwards, if the compa- nies have an early balance date for the 1993/94 year. Policy If a member of the consolidated group is liable for a foreign dividend withholding payment (FDWP) on a foreign dividend that it derives, all member companies of the consolidated group are jointly and severally liable for that payment (section 191T(2)). The amount of the FDWP due can be satisfied by any of these methods: ï actual payment of the liability ï a debit to the credit balance of the groupís branch equivalent tax account (ìBETAî) (section 191T(1)) ï an offset against the groupís tax losses (section†191T(3)). A consolidated group must maintain a group DWPA if any member of that group maintains such an account. The group account must be maintained separately (section 191U(1)(a)). A group may also elect to main- tain such an account even if no member operates one (section 191U(1)(b) & (2)). If a group elects to maintain an account, it may elect to cease maintaining it subject to certain conditions in sections 191U(4) & (5). The effect of the group DWPA is that all credit and debits of group members move through the group account, reflective of the fact that consolidated groups of companies are treated as a single entity taxpayer. DWP credits may only be transferred from a member company DWPA to the group account if both of these conditions are met: ï a debit arises in the group DWPA ï that debit is not offset by any group credit that arose earlier or on the same date as the credit in the indi- vidual DWPA (section 191UC(2)). from page 3 Policy Under section 163 of the Income Tax Act 1976, a taxpayer can claim a deduction for any amount paid to make good a loss that another person suffers because of the misappropriation of property, if these five conditions are met: ï the taxpayer carries on business in partnership ï the partnership or any of the partners receive property in the course of the partnership business ï the owner of the property is not a partner in the partnership, or the spouse of one of the partners ï Any partner except the taxpayer or his or her spouse misappropriates the property, causing a loss to the property owner ï The taxpayer is legally liable to make good the loss. It is not necessary for the taxpayer to make the payment directly to the property owner. Any reimbursing pay- ment made to an insurance office or indemnity fund that had previously made good the loss is deductible. 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.2 (August 1994) The offsetting of group credits against any debit takes precedence over the offset of any member credits. When a credit transfer occurs, a corresponding debit arises in the member companyís DWPA, unless such a debit would result in creating or increasing a debit balance in the memberís account. In such a case the debit does not arise in the memberís DWPA but is borne by the group account (section 191UC(5)). When a group member pays any amount of further DWP payable on the end of year debit balance (through section 394ZZF), the amount paid is available for crediting against any other DWP payable by any member of the group at a later date. However, the amount is not available to be credited to an individual member (section 191UC(6)). FBT - prescribed rate of interest increased The prescribed rate of interest used to calculate the fringe benefit value of low interest employment-related loans has been increased to 7.9% for the quarter starting on 1 July 1994. This rate will also apply to all subse- quent quarters unless it is later amended. It reflects increased market interest rates. The prescribed rate was previously 7.7% for the quarters starting on 1 January 1994 and 1 April 1994. IRD Deputy Commissioners - changes in portfolios The Commissioner, David Henry, has announced changes to the portfolios held by Inland Revenueís Deputy Commis- sioners.

There are special rules for calculating GST when commercial dwellings, such as motels, hotels, rest homes, or hospitals supply domestic goods and services to people who are, or will be, residing there for four or more weeks. At the end of this item there are several examples and two flowcharts to show how registered persons are to calculate and account for GST in cases when they should apply the 60†percent rule in section†10(6) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act). Legislation Under section 10(6) of the GST Act, if a person resides in a commercial dwelling for more than four weeks, the value attributable to the supply of domestic goods and services in the commercial dwelling is reduced to 60†percent after the end of the four weeks. Further, the 60†percent rate will apply from the start of the personís stay, if the commercial dwelling is also a residential establishment and the supplier and recipient have agreed that the total length of the stay will be four weeks or longer. Section 2 of the GST Act defines the terms used in section†10(6). The term ìcommercial dwellingî means: (a) Any hotel, motel, inn, hostel, or boardinghouse; or (b) Any camping ground; or (c) Any convalescent home, nursing home, rest home, or hospice; or (d) Any establishment similar to any of the kinds referred to in paragraphs (a) to (c) of this definition; - but does not include - (e) A hospital, except to the extent that that hospital is a residential establishment: (f) A dwelling situated within a retirement village or within a rest home, where the consideration paid or payable for the supply of accommodation in that dwelling is for the right to occupy that dwelling: The term ìresidential establishmentî means: any commercial dwelling in which not less than 70†percent of the individuals to whom domestic goods and services are supplied reside, or are expected to reside, for a period of, or in excess of, four weeks; and also includes any hospital to the extent that it is used to provide domestic goods and services in a way similar to any such residential establishment. The term ìdomestic goods and servicesî means: the right to occupy the whole or part of any com- mercial dwelling, including, where it is provided as part of the right to so occupy, the supply of - (a) Cleaning and maintenance: (b) Electricity, gas, air conditioning or heating: (c) Telephone, television, radio, or any other similar chattel: Examples of goods and services that do not fall within the definition of domestic goods and services are meals, toll calls, medication and nursing. These must be taxed in full. Section 10(6) Section 10(6) ensures that long-term occupants of hotels, rest homes, hospitals, etc. are not disadvantaged in comparison with others who rent or lease their accommodation (which is exempt from GST). This section provides two different treatments for supplies in commercial dwellings, depending on whether the commercial dwelling is also a residential establishment. Commercial dwelling - residential establishment Under section 10(6), the supplier charges GST at 12.5% on 60 percent of the total value of domestic goods and services from the start of any contract or arrangement under which the recipient intends to reside for four weeks or more in a commercial dwelling that is a residential establishment. (This equates to charging GST at 7.5% of the total value of the domestic goods and services.) Those residents whose stays will be less than four weeks on any occasion, but whose stays will exceed four weeks in total over the course of the ar- rangement, will also qualify for the reduced rate. Commercial dwelling - not a residential establishment If a person intends to stay in a commercial dwelling, which is not a residential establishment, for periods in excess of four weeks, GST is chargeable on the reduced value of domestic goods and services only after four weeks. The reduced rate will apply only if the resident is charged for accommodation for seven days of the week. GST is charged at the standard rate on the full value of the supply for the first four weeks. In all cases, GST is still chargeable at 12.5 percent on the full value attributable to any non-domestic goods and services supplied. Rates for domestic and non-domestic goods and services Only domestic goods and services supplied are subject to the lower GST rate under section 10(6), so the supplier must make an apportionment between domestic and non-domestic goods and services supplied. The flowcharts at the end of this item illustrate how section 10(6) operates. 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.2 (August 1994) In 1986, Inland Revenue and the bodies that represent rest homes and private hospitals agreed to standard apportionment rates for the supply of domestic and non- domestic goods and services. These standard rates assist all parties to determine what will generally be accept- able to Inland Revenue. These rates also provide a degree of certainty within this industry group. The rates are: Rest homes - 45% domestic goods and services. - 55% non-domestic goods and services. Private- 35% domestic goods and services. hospitals - 65% non-domestic goods and services. Rest homes and private hospitals may use a factual basis for apportionment if they believe that the above rates are not consistent with the supplies they make. However, in this case they must maintain sufficient records to support the basis of their calculations, in the same way as other commercial dwellings. In all other cases where a commercial dwelling, such as a motel or hotel, will be supplying domestic goods and services to residents for periods in excess of four weeks, an apportionment must be made on a factual basis. Sufficient records must be retained to support the basis of apportionment. Claiming input tax It has been suggested that input tax can only be claimed on 60 percent of the expenses of operating a commercial dwelling when section 10(6) applies. Operating a commercial dwelling is a taxable activity. The supply of domestic goods and services in a commer- cial dwelling is a taxable supply and is chargeable with GST under section 8 of the GST Act. The different valuation of the supply under section 10(6) does not alter the fact that the supply is a taxable supply. Section 10(6) determines the value placed on the supply of domestic goods and services. It does not deem part of that supply to be non-taxable. As a result, the entire supply is taxable, although at a deemed reduced value. This means that any expenses incurred in providing domestic goods and services in a commercial dwelling are incurred in the course of making taxable supplies. As a result, input tax can be claimed in full for expenses incurred in the course of operating a commercial dwelling. Example 1 The Fireside Home is a rest home. More than 70†percent of its residents are there on a long term basis in excess of four weeks. This rest home is a commercial dwelling and is also a residential establishment within the meaning of the GST Act. The Fireside Home applies the standard apportion- ment rates: ï 45% domestic goods and services (i.e. right to occupy, cleaning, maintenance, etc.); ï 55% non-domestic goods and services (i.e. meals, medication, etc.). The Fireside Home charges the following amounts for accommodation, excluding GST: Short stay residents$130.00/week (under four weeks) Day care residents$ 30.00/day Permanent residents$120.00/week For short stay and day care residents, GST is calculated in the normal way because the contracts are for less than four weeksí stay.

The motel established that it had supplied: 25% domestic goods and services 75% non-domestic goods and services. The GST exclusive charge to the resident is $400 per week. The first four weeksí stay is charged at the full rate of 12.5% because the motel is not a residential establishment. $400.00 x 12.5% =$ 50.00 $400.00 (GST inclusive charge per week for$450.00 each of the first four weeks) The charge for the following 6 weeks will be as follows: $400.00 x 25% = $100.00 (domestic goods and services) $100.00 x 60% x 12.5% =$7.50 (GST on domestic goods and services) $400.00 x 75% = $300.00 (non-domestic goods and services) $300.00 x 12.5% =$37.50 (GST on non-domestic goods and services) Total GST on charge =$45.00 Total weekly charge to client incl.

This percentage will alter if the apportionment is altered, as is the case in the following examples. Example 2 The Ironside Hospital is a private hospital with a wing that caters for long term residents. It applies the standard apportionment rates for private hospitals, i.e. 35% domestic goods and services and 65% non-domestic goods and services. The hospital has set a GST exclusive charge of $200.00 per week. There are 20 patients resident at the hospital. The hospital files returns on a monthly basis.

It contains five changes to the Child Support scheme. Three of the changes result from the 1993 Child Support Operations and Procedural Review. The other two changes are of an administrative nature. At the end of this item there is a section-by-section analysis of the new Amendment Act. Summary of changes The five areas covered by the Amendment Act are: ï offsetting of Child Support liability when one party is a beneficiary ï actions to regularise an anomaly when a person receives an unsupported child benefit ï a process for administrative review of Child Support formula assessments ï corrections to difficulties surrounding the provisions relating to the Child Support Trust Bank Account ï a new method for setting the rate of interest in reconciliation of estimation cases. Offsetting Child Support liability when one party is a beneficiary Section 3 of the Amendment Act amends sections 34 and 35 of the principal Act, so that when one parent is a beneficiary, the other parent may elect that the offset- ting provision be extended. The effect is that the amount to be deducted from the benefit will reduce the amount payable by the non-beneficiary. Amounts paid by the non-beneficiary will be passed on to the beneficiary only in the limited circumstances which are already in place, i.e., when the amount of Child Support collected exceeds the net amount of the benefit paid. Previously under section 35, in shared and split custody cases, if both parents were liable to pay Child Support, offsetting of liabilities between the two parents was limited to situations in which neither parent was a beneficiary. Unsupported child benefit anomaly Sections 8 and 9 of the Amendment Act amend sections 142 and 143 of the principal Act. They provide that Child Support paid for a custodianís own children will no longer be used to pay for an unsupported childís benefit that is paid to the custodian for other children. Child Support received for an unsupported child will also no longer go towards offsetting a social security benefit paid for the custodianís own children. From 1 July 1994 custodial parents who receive the unsupported childís benefit only have to apply for Child Support for the children for whom they are receiving a benefit; not for the unsupported child. The amendments to sections 142 and 143 will apply retrospectively from 1 July 1992. The amendments to the Child Support Act ensure that custodians who have applied for Child Support for their own children will receive that Child Support (when paid by the liable parent). The Child Support received for their own children will not be used to offset the cost of the unsupported childís benefit. Administrative review Before 1 July 1994 the only available avenue for the variation of a Child Support formula assessment was to apply to the Family Court for an order to depart from the assessment. Many people had complained that certain barriers existed to prevent parents from applying to the court, such as the cost (including the cost of legal representa- tion), the delays, and the general difficulty with Court procedures as prescribed by the Child Support Act. To overcome these barriers the Amendment Act pro- vides for an administrative review procedure within Inland Revenue from 1 July 1994. The key features of the administrative review procedure are as follows: ï Review officers will use the departure order grounds contained in sections 105 and 106 of the Child Support Act, and will make determinations on the same basis as the court, in the form of a hearing. ï Either party to a Child Support formula assessment may apply for an administrative review. ï The other party to the Child Support assessment will be advised of the application for review of the assess- ment. The other party will have the right to reply, to confirm or contest details given by the applicant, and to attend the hearing. ï No legal representation will be allowed at the hearing. However, there is provision for representation or support in certain circumstances. ï The administrative review determinations will not affect the right of either party to apply to the Family Court for a departure order if they are not satisfied with the decision. ï There will be no fee for applying for an administrative review. Applications The administrative review process is available to either party to a Child Support formula assessment. The only formal requirements are that: 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.2 (August 1994) ï the applications must be in writing ï the grounds on which the application is made must be stated ï the application must relate to an assessment for a Child Support year beginning no earlier than 1 April 1994. Existing liability An application for administrative review will not in itself suspend the obligation to pay the amount of Child Support assessed pending the outcome of the review. However, there is provision under section 96N of the Child Support Act for anyone applying for an adminis- trative review to also apply for suspension of his or her assessed liability. Attendance at hearings Both parties to the application for an administrative review can attend the review hearing. However, neither party can be compelled to appear in the presence of the other, or to be allowed to have legal representation at the hearing. Under section 96J of the Child Support Act, approval can be given for either party to be repre- sented at the hearing where special circumstances exist. A support person may also be allowed to attend the hearing. In either case, the representative or support person cannot be, or have been, a barrister or solicitor, or someone involved in advocacy work. Child Support trust bank account Before the Amendment Act when payments were received from parents it was not possible to distinguish between payments for Child Support and payments of tax. Section 140 of the principal Act has been amended by section 7 of the Amendment Act providing for all Child Support payments to be banked initially into the Crown Bank Account. Later, those amounts which are to be passed on to custodians, are paid into the trust bank account and payment is made from that account to the custodial parent. Interest on underestimation of income Section 40 of the principal Act provides that liable parents may elect to have their Child Support liabilities based on their estimated taxable income for the current year. They can only elect to use this provision where they estimate that their current income has decreased by 15% from their actual taxable income for the last relevant income year (the figure on which the formula assessment is based). When a liable parent makes an election under section 40 and underestimates his or her current income, that parent is liable for interest on the amount of underpaid Child Support. Section 4 of the Amendment Act has amended section 46 of the principal Act and provided for the setting of the applicable interest rates by Order in Council. Section 12 of the Amendment Act amends section 235 of the principal Act and allows the Gover- nor-General to make the Order in Council specifying the rate of interest. Previously the interest rate for underestimations was linked to the interest rate for underpayments of provi- sional tax. It was necessary to separate the two rates of interest because of recent changes made to the provi- sional tax rules. Application date The provisions of the Child Support Amendment Act 1994 are to apply from 1 July 1994 unless expressly stated otherwise. Child Support Amendment Act 1994 - Details of new legislation Section 2 This section amends section 9 of the Child Support Act to provide that a custodian who is receiving an unsup- ported childís benefit but no other social security benefit does not have to apply for Child Support for other children for whom no benefit is paid. Section 3 This section deals with the situation when two liable parents have split or shared custody of one or more children who qualify for Child Support, and neither parent is receiving a social security benefit, or only one parent is receiving a social security benefit. In this situation the amount of Child Support that is payable by one parent can be offset by the amount that the other parent is liable to pay. If one parent is receiving a social security benefit, only the non-beneficiary parent can request that the offset- ting provision be activated. In this case the amount to be deducted from the benefit will reduce the amount payable by the non-beneficiary. Section 4 This section repeals the definition of ìspecified rate of interestî found in section 46 (1) of the principal Act and substitutes the following definition: ìëspecified rate of interestí in relation to any day, means such rate percent per annum as may be specified by the Governor-General by Order in Council.î When a liable person elects to estimate his or her income under section 40 of the principal Act, and underestimates his or her current income, that person is liable to pay interest on the amount of underpaid Child Support that has arisen as a result of the underestima- tion of income. continued on page 12 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.2 (August 1994) with by the administrative review process then the Commissioner may refuse to make a determination. The Commissioner can recommend that an application is made to the Court for a departure order. The reasons for refusing to make a determination are required to be given, in writing, to the applicant. Section 96G Under this section if the Commissioner considers an application, and is satisfied that either there are no grounds for departing from the formula assessment or the formula assessment that is sought to be reduced is already set at the minimum liability then the Commis- sioner may refuse to make a determination. The reasons for refusing to make a determination must be given, in writing, to the applicant. Section 96H This section provides that when one party applies for a determination, the Commissioner will notify the other party of the application. The Commissioner will also send to the other party a summary of the grounds of the application, and inform the other party that he or she may request a copy of the application and make any representation if he or she so wishes. A reply to an application must be in writing and filed with the Commissioner either within 14 days after the date on which the copy of the application and accompa- nying documentation is sent to the other party, or, within 14 days of the date on which the notification was sent, if the other party does not request a copy of the application. A copy of the other partyís reply and any accompanying documentation will be sent to the applicant. If the Commissioner refuses to make a determination then this section does not apply. Section 96I This section provides that the Commissioner may act on the basis of the application and the reply (if any) and may, but is not required to, conduct an inquiry into the matter. The Commissioner is not bound by any rules of evidence. The section also provides that the Commissioner must give an opportunity to both parties to appear before the Commissioner and be heard. Neither party can be compelled to appear in the presence of the other. Section 96J This section provides that approval for a party to the application to be represented can be given in cases where the Commissioner is satisfied that the person is unable to present his or her own case. Subsection (4) provides that, if the Commissioner considers that it is proper, taking into account all the circumstances of the case, the Commissioner may approve a person nominated by a party to be present at Section 4 provides for the setting of the applicable interest rates by Order in Council, instead of having the rate linked to the interest rate applicable to underpay- ments of provisional tax as was previously the case. Section 5 This section inserts into the principal Act a new part known as ìPart VIAî. Part VIA contains the new administrative review procedures that have become available within the Inland Revenue Department from 1†July 1994. Part VIA Section 96A This section empowers the Commissioner to make determinations to vary Child Support formula assess- ments. Section 96B This section provides that either a custodial parent or a liable parent can apply for a determination to be made by the Commissioner. The application must be in writing and can only be made where there is a formula assessment already in force. An application may only be made in relation to Child Support payable in the Child Support year commencing on the 1st day of April 1994 or any later Child Support year. Section 96C This section provides that an application cannot proceed to determination unless the Commissioner is satisfied that one or more of the grounds specified in section 105 of the principal Act exist and that it would be just, equitable, and otherwise proper to make a determina- tion. Section 96D This section empowers the Commissioner to make determinations in the same way as the Court makes departure order decisions under section 106 of the principal Act. The Commissioner is required to give both parties to the application, in writing, the reasons for making the determination. Section 96E This section sets out the formal requirements that are needed when making an application. An application that is made, under section 96B, must be in writing and must set out the grounds on which it is made. The grounds are those set out in section 105 of the principal Act. Section 96F This section provides that, after considering the applica- tion, if the Commissioner is satisfied that the issues raised in the application are too complex to be dealt from page 11 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.2 (August 1994) the hearing and to assist the party in the presentation of his or her case. Subsection (6) provides that under no circumstances will legal representation be allowed at the hearing. This ban on legal representation extends to any person who is, or has been, enrolled as a barrister or solicitor, or who, in the opinion of the Commissioner, is or has been engaged in advocacy work before other tribunals. Section 96K A determination may not be made if, while the applica- tion is pending, the parties enter into a qualifying voluntary Child Support agreement, in relation to the Child Support assessment in question, and the agree- ment is accepted by the Commissioner. Section 96L This section provides that subsequent applications can be made after a determination has been issued if new matter has been submitted or the application covers a different ground from the previous application. Section 96M This section provides that the making of an application does not suspend or alter the amount of a formula assessment or the obligation to pay Child Support pending the issuing of a determination. Section 96N Under this section an application for a suspension order can be made to the Commissioner, and section 117 of the principal Act shall apply in the same way as it does when it is being used by the Courts. However, a suspension order will not be made unless the Commissioner is satisfied that the making of a determination is likely to be unusually delayed and the time for filing a reply to the application has expired. Section 96O The Commissioner can make retrospective decisions using this section. The decision can only be made retrospectively to any day that the Commissioner considers appropriate but not being a day that precedes the later of the 1st day of April 1994 or the day on which the application for formula assessment to which the determination was made. Section 96P This section restricts the publication of reports by applying section 124 of the principal Act to Part VIA. (End of Part VIA) Section 6 This section provides for the consequential amendment of the principal Act in the manner indicated by the schedule to the Amendment Act. The amendments provided for in the schedule apply from 1 July 1994. Section 7 This section provides that all Child Support payments received by the Commissioner shall be paid into the Crown Bank Account. From the Crown Bank Account there will be paid into the Child Support Trust Bank Account such amounts that are necessary to be passed onto custodians. Section 8 This section deals with the payment of formula assess- ment Child Support to custodians who are social security beneficiaries. The effect of this section is that Child Support paid for a custodianís own children will no longer be used to pay for an unsupported childís benefit which is paid to the custodian for other children. Neither will Child Support for an unsupported child go towards offsetting a social security benefit paid for the custodianís own children. This section provides that if a beneficiary custodian is receiving an unsupported childís benefit and Child Support under a formula assessment then for each child for whom an unsupported childís benefit is being received, the Commissioner shall aggregate all pay- ments of Child Support payable for each child and deduct an amount equal to the lesser of the net of tax amount of the unsupported childís benefit or the aggregate of all payments of Child Support received by the Commissioner in respect of that child or children. Any remaining amounts are to be paid to the custodian. For any other child or children the Commissioner shall aggregate all Child Support payments received for those children and deduct an amount equal to the lesser of the net of tax amount of the social security benefit or the aggregate of all payments received by the Commissioner for those children. Any remaining amounts are to be paid to the custodian. Section 9 This section deals with the payment of voluntary agreement Child Support to custodians who are social security beneficiaries. The effect of this section is exactly the same as the effect of section 8. Both sections 8 and 9 ensure that custodians who have applied for Child Support for their own children will receive that Child Support. The Child Support received for their own children will not be used to offset the cost of the unsupported childís benefit. The section provides that where a beneficiary custodial parent is receiving an unsupported childís benefit and Child Support under a voluntary agreement then the Commissioner shall pay to the custodian in respect of each child for whom money is paid under a voluntary agreement, the amount by which that money exceeds the payment that would have been made under a formula assessment. In regards to each child for whom an unsupported child benefit is being paid the Commissioner shall aggregate all remaining payments of Child Support that are paid continued on page 14 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.2 (August 1994) Section 12 This section amends section 235 of the principal Act by inserting the following paragraph after paragraph (c): ì(ca) Specifying the rate percent per annum of interest that is to apply for the purposes of section 46 of this Act:î Subsection (2) provides that the first Order in Council made under section 235(ca) may have effect from the commencement of the Child Support year. Section 13 This section deals with the transitional provisions relating to departure order applications pending as at 1†July 1994. The section provides that if any application has been made to the Family Court under section 104 of the principal Act before 1 July 1994, but has not yet been heard by the Court, the applicant may elect to withdraw the application from the Family Court and to make an application under Part VIA of the principal Act. However, there is no right of election if, either the custodian or the liable parent is a party to another application which is pending in a Family Court and the Court is satisfied that it would be more appropriate for the Court to consider the application at the same time as it hears the other application or the application relates either wholly or in part to a Child Support assessment payable in the 1994 Child Support year or any earlier Child Support year. The election to withdraw the application from the Family Court is only available until 1 September 1994 or the date on which the Court commences hearing the application, whichever comes first. GST - advertising for non-resident clients Wilson & Horton decision Summary This item outlines the Commissionerís view of how section 11(2)(e) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act) applies to the supply of advertising space and related services, in light of the High Court decision in Wilson & Horton. The High Court recently gave its judgment in Wilson & Horton v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,221. This case dealt with the circumstances in which a newspaper publisher should account for GST on the service of placing advertisements for overseas clients. We understand that there is some uncertainty about the correct GST treatment of the supply of advertising space and other related services to overseas clients. The two main elements to the Commissionerís policy on the GST treatment of advertising services under section†11(2)(e) are: ï To qualify for zero-rating under section 11(2)(e), the services must be provided ìcontractually toî and ìbeneficially forî a non-resident person. If a New Zealand resident receives the benefit of the advertis- ing services, the services are not zero-rated; and ï The provision of advertising space and related services are not supplied directly in connection with either moveable personal property or land (or im- provements to the land). The Commissioner will review this policy from time to time in light of any relevant Court decisions. Wilson and Horton are appealing the High Courtís decision to the Court of Appeal. This item replaces PIB 164, ìGST on Advertising for Non-Resident Clientsî. to the custodian for that child and deduct the lesser of the net of tax amount of the unsupported childís benefit or the aggregate of all payments of Child Support received by the Commissioner in respect of that child. Any remaining Child Support will be paid to the custodian. In regards to any other child the Commissioner shall aggregate all remaining payments of Child Support and deduct an amount equal to whichever is the lesser of the net of tax amount of social security benefit other than the unsupported childís benefit or the aggregate of all payments of Child Support received by the Commis- sioner in respect of this child. Any remaining Child Support will be paid to the custodian. Section 10 This section deals with unremitted deductions made by employers. It repeals section 147 of the principal Act by repealing the words ìan amount equal to the amount of the deduction unpaid on or before that day shall be payable into the Child Support Trust Bank Account out of the Crown Bank Account without further appropria- tion than this sectionî and substituting the words ìthe amount of that deduction shall, for the purposes of this part of this Act, be deemed to have been received by the Commissioner on or before the 20th day of the follow- ing monthî. These changes are consistent with the amendments made in section 7 of the Amendment Act. Section 11 This section amends section 149(2) of the principal Act by omitting the words ìin the Child Support Trust Bank Account.î from page 13 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.2 (August 1994) Effect of Section 11(2)(e) Section 11(2)(e) zero-rates services supplied for and to a person who is not resident in New Zealand and who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed, not being services which are supplied directly in connection with: (i) Land or any improvement thereto situated inside New Zealand, or (ii) Moveable personal property (other than choses in action or goods to which section 11(2)(ca) applies) situated inside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. A person is ìresidentî in New Zealand under section 2 of the GST Act if that person is a resident for income tax purposes under section 241 of the Income Tax Act 1976. The GST Act also deems a person to be resident for GST purposes if (and to the extent that) the person carries on a taxable activity or any other activity while having a fixed or permanent place of business in New Zealand relating to that activity. Moveable personal property covers all types of goods other than land and improvements. The Decision in Wilson & Horton Facts Wilson & Horton carries on the taxable activity of producing newspapers. Its main publication is The New Zealand Herald, in which many overseas parties place advertisements. The Commissioner argued that Wilson & Horton should charge GST at 12.5% on the publish- ing services provided to these overseas clients. Wilson and Horton contended the services were zero-rated. Wilson & Horton and the Commissioner asked the High Court to rule on the GST treatment of five categories of advertisements: ïCategory 1: Advertisements placed by overseas parties which refer to services offered by New Zealand residents. ïCategory 2: Advertisements placed by overseas parties which refer to goods situated outside New Zealand which New Zealand residents offer for sale. ïCategory 3: Advertisements placed by overseas parties which refer to goods situated in New Zealand which non-residents sell. ïCategory 4: Advertisements placed by overseas parties which refer to goods situated in New Zealand which New Zealand residents offer for sale. ïCategory 5: ìImageî advertisements placed by overseas parties for the promotion of a brand name or product, when the goods or services referred to in the advertisement are sold in New Zealand. Decision The High Court discussed the interpretation of the phrases ìdirectly in connection withî and ìfor and toî in section†11(2)(e) of the GST Act in deciding whether the advertising services were properly zero-rated. The High Court held that the services provided by Wilson & Horton are not supplied ìdirectly in connection withî land or any moveable personal property in New Zea- land. Justice Hillyerís reasoning was that: ìThe supply of space and the services rendered by Wilson & Horton are directly connected with the advertising but not with the goods advertised. The goods are, as it were, at least one step removed from the services supplied by the newspaper proprietorî (1994) 16 NZTC 11,224. The High Court also examined the meaning of ìfor and toî and agreed with the Commissioner that ìforî means ìbeneficially forî and ìtoî means ìcontractually toî. The Court illustrated this analysis with the example of a non-resident manufacturer who advertises goods in the New Zealand media so that New Zealand resident retailers can sell the goods. This supply of advertising is ìforî the benefit of the manufacturer and the New Zealand retailers. The retailers enjoy the benefit of being able to sell the advertised goods to the New Zealand public. The advertising services would not be zero-rated because the supply is not made for and to the non-resident manufacturer. Applying these principles, the High Court found that: ï Category 1 services are standard rated - the services are provided beneficially ìforî the resident offering the services. ï Category 2 services are standard rated - the services are supplied beneficially ìforî the residents who offer the goods for sale. ï Category 3 services are zero-rated - the services are provided ìfor and toî the non-resident selling the goods. The fact that the goods are located in New Zealand does not matter because the services are not supplied directly in connection with the advertised goods. An example is a New Zealand resident who went overseas, left household goods in New Zealand, and advertised from overseas to sell the goods. ï Category 4 services are standard rated - the services are beneficially ìforî the resident offering the goods. ïThe treatment of Category 5 services depends upon whether New Zealand residents sell the goods or services for sale in New Zealand. If residents do sell the goods, the supply is standard rated. Otherwise the services are zero-rated. (The Courtís analysis of the GST treatment of the five categories of advertisements is summarised in the table at the end of this item.) continued on page 16 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.2 (August 1994) the basis that they are supplied directly in connection with moveable personal property or land in New Zealand. As Justice Hillyer said in the Wilson & Horton case (at page 11,224), the services are ìat least one step removedî from the subject matter of the advertisements. Agency provisions In the advertising context, the agency provisions in section 60 of the GST Act may need to be considered to determine whether a supply is zero-rated. Section 60(2) deems a taxable supply of goods and services made by a registered person to an agent who is acting on behalf of a principal to be a supply made to the principal. The fact that a non-resident advertising agency arranges for the placement of advertisements does not necessarily mean that the supply of advertising services is made ìtoî that advertising agency. If the agency is acting as an agent on behalf of a principal, section 60(2) will deem the supply to be made to the principal and not to the agency. In this situation, the residence of the principal will determine whether there is a supply ìtoî a non-resident for the purposes of section 11(2)(e). The High Court in Wilson & Horton (at page 11,225) agreed with this approach. Example 1 Gadget Co contacts a Wellington newspaper and books an advertisement for a newly developed product. Gadget Co is resident in the United Kingdom. It has a GST registered subsidiary in New Zealand that sells the advertised product. The subsidiary is resident in New Zealand because it is incorporated in New Zealand. The advertisements contain details of the address of the New Zealand subsidiary as distributor of the product. Are the services provided by the Wellington newspaper publisher zero-rated? GST treatment The services supplied by the publisher are subject to GST at 12.5%. They are not zero-rated under section 11(2)(e) because: ïThe publisher supplies the services contractually ìtoî a non-resident, Gadget Co. ïHowever, the New Zealand resident subsidiary enjoys the benefits of the advertising. The supply is ìforî a resident and so the ìfor and toî test in section 11(2)(e) is not met. Example 2 Slick Co, an Australian resident advertising agency, places a series of advertisements with a New Zealand magazine. Slick Co has placed the adver- tisements as agent on behalf of the owner of a luxurious holiday resort in Australia. The ads relate to job vacancies at the resort. Are the services supplied by the New Zealand magazine zero-rated? The High Court did not think that it would be unduly onerous for Wilson & Horton to determine whether any particular supply would be zero-rated or not using the Courtís interpretation of the legislation. Policy The Wilson & Horton decision outlines how GST applies to the supply of advertising space and related services under section 11(2)(e) of the GST Act. The key features of section 11(2)(e) are the phrases ìfor and toî and ìdirectly in connection withî. “For and to” The determination of whether services are supplied ìfor and toî a non-resident is a question of fact depending upon the particular circumstances of any one supply. Appendix B to TIB No.9 (March 1990) provides some guidance on the meaning of ìfor and toî in section 11(2)(e). The TIB states that the word ìforî suggests that goods or services must be supplied ìfor the benefit ofî the recipient of the services. The Commissioner considers that advertising services must be supplied for the benefit of a non-resident as well as contractually to the non-resident before the services can be zero-rated under section 11(2)(e). If a New Zealand resident enjoys the benefit of a supply of advertising services, the supply is ìforî that resident. The ìfor and toî test in section 11(2)(e) is not satisfied and the supply is not zero-rated. “Directly in connection with” Appendix B to TIB No.9 (March 1990) sets out the Commissionerís interpretation of the meaning of ìdirectly in connection withî. This view is that: (a) The meaning of this phrase depends upon the context in which it is used. (b) The words ìin connection withî require a relation- ship of more than remote degree. (c) That relationship must be direct (i.e., in the case of services supplied in connection with goods, directly with the goods and not with some other person or thing). (d) The following questions are useful in determining the matter in particular cases: (i) What is the service supplied in connection with, if anything? (ii) Is the connection direct - does anything inter- pose between service and object? (iii) Is the service merely incidental to the object? Applying these tests, the Commissioner considers that the relationship between the supply of advertising space (and other related services) and any property to which the advertising relates is not ìdirectî. The services cannot be denied zero-rating under section 11(2)(e) on from page 15 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.2 (August 1994) GST treatment The services supplied by the magazine are zero- rated under section 11(2)(e) because: ï The magazine provides services contractually ìtoî a non-resident. Section 60(2) of the GST Act deems the supply to be made to the Australian resident resort owner, as principal. Slick Co simply acts as agent in receiving the supply. ï The supply is also ìforî the benefit of the non- resident resort owner. No New Zealand resident person benefits from the advertising. Example 3 Adcorp, a New Zealand advertising agency, places an advertising campaign on a New Zealand national radio station. A US resident manufacturer of sports shoes engaged Adcorp to act as its agent to arrange this campaign. The advertisements promote a popular brand of sports shoes, which are available from retailers throughout New Zealand. Are the services provided by the radio station zero-rated? GST treatment The services provided by the radio station are subject to GST at 12.5%. Section 11(2)(e) does not apply to this supply because: ïThe radio station supplies services contractually ìtoî a non-resident. Section 60(2) of the GST Act deems the supply to be made to the non-resident sports shoe manufacturer, as principal. Adcorp receives the supply as agent only. ï However, the New Zealand resident retailers of the sports shoes enjoy the benefits of the advertis- ing. The supply is ìforî New Zealand residents and so the ìfor and toî test in section 11(2)(e) is not met.

The policy is based on his view of the law, and incorporates the new depreciation rules introduced in 1993. It is also consistent with generally accepted accounting principles.

He is therefore seeking written submissions from people who have had prob- lems in applying the policy.

We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Income Tax Act 1976 Cost of function ticket - when charitable portion can qualify for rebate ....................................... 18 Alternative methods for returning income from financial arrangements ..................................... 18 Recovery of interest when property sold within ten years .............................................................. 19 Depreciation on library books .............................................................................................................. 19 Special tax code - privacy of information ........................................................................................... 20 Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 When gifts of land and shares are said to be complete .................................................................... 20 Adjustment to conditions on mortgage to family member .............................................................. 21 Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 Stamp duty reduced if gift duty payable on transferred property ................................................. 22 Income Tax Act 1976 Cost of function ticket - when charitable portion can qualify for rebate Sections 56A and 147 - Qualifying Gifts: A promoter is organising a charitable function. Tickets for the function will sell at $60, and the promoter has guaran- teed that $15 of the ticket price will be donated to a recognised charity. The promoter wanted to know Inland Revenue’s requirements that will enable purchasers of tickets to claim the charitable donation of $15 in their income tax returns. If a proportion of the ticket price is guaranteed by the promoters as being a donation to a charitable organisation, that amount could qualify for the purposes of sections 56A and 147 of the Income Tax Act 1976. However, to obtain this approval the ticket must meet all of these conditions for a receipt: • it must be officially stamped with the name of the organisation • it must show the amount of the donation content • it must show the date the donation was received • it must be signed by a person authorised by the organisation to accept dona- tions. To qualify for the rebate, the donation must be for at least $5.00. Alternative methods for returning income from financial arrangements Section 64C - Accruals in relation to income and expenditure in respect of financial arrangements: A taxpayer asked what alternative methods to yield to maturity (YTM) - for example, straight line or the rule of 78 methods - could be 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.2 (August 1994) used to return income from financial arrangements. The taxpayer was not a cash basis holder under section 64D as it held financial arrangements of more than $600,000 in the income year. Historically, the taxpayer had recognised financial arrangement income on a straight line basis. The taxpayer did not qualify to use the straight line method under section 64C(2A). That provision is only available for taxpayers that hold or issue finan- cial arrangements of $1,000,000 or less on every day within the income year. Also, section 64C(2A)(c) of the Act did not apply. (See page 16 of TIB Volume Three, No.1 (July 1991) for a full discussion of the requirements of section 64C(2A)). Additionally, it was possible for the taxpayer to calculate income or expenditure using the YTM method. Accordingly, section 64C(3) was not relevant. Section 64C(2) generally requires holders and issuers of financial arrangements, except cash basis holders, to calculate income or expenditure using the YTM method so as to allocate it in a fair or reasonable manner. Broadly however, the proviso to section 64C(2) allows a taxpayer to use an alternative to the YTM method if the alternative meets all of these conditions: • it has regard to the principles of accrual accounting • it conforms with commercially accepted practice • it is consistently applied for financial reporting purposes • it results in an allocation that is not materially different from that under YTM. The taxpayer’s use of the straight line method did not meet the materiality test under the proviso. It would have resulted in a materially different allocation of financial arrangement income to a YTM method. Accordingly, the taxpayer could not use the method. The taxpayer was not permitted to use the rule of 78 method for the same rea- son. The rule of 78 method may produce results materially different from YTM in certain circumstances, but it has an inherent bias which accelerates the interest amounts to earlier periods of a loan. The bias tends to become greater the higher the interest rate or the longer the term. Inland Revenue required the taxpayer to use a YTM method. Recovery of interest when property sold within ten years Section 129(A1) - No application to transactions after 24 July 1990: Two taxpay- ers owned a rental property. They claimed mortgage interest as a deduction against the rental income. At the time they bought the property they knew that if they sold it within ten years they would be assessed on the interest that they had deducted. They asked if this is still the situation. Under section 129, deductions which were previously allowed for certain assets become assessable if the assets are sold within ten years of acquisition. However, section 129(A1) states that section 129 does not apply to property sold after 24 July 1990. Accordingly, if the taxpayers sell their rental property within 10 years of buying it, the interest previously deducted will not be assessed. Depreciation on library books Section 108 - Annual depreciation deduction: A consultant asked if the cost of setting up a library for his new consulting business is deductible. continued on page 20 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.2 (August 1994) Books are depreciable items under sections 107A and 108. The depreciation rates for books are set out on page 56 of the appendix to TIB Volume Four, No 9 (April 1993). In this case the rate is 9.5% diminishing value or 6.5% straight line. If the consultant buys a business-related book which costs less than $200, under section 108O(2) he may elect to write it off as a “low value asset”. This means he can claim the cost of the book as a deduction against his assessable income, rather than claiming depreciation at the appropriate rate. If the consultant claims a low value asset deduction for any book, and later sells it, he will have to declare the sale proceeds as assessable income in the year of sale. Any amount spent on maintaining the library books is also deductible. Note: If two or more books are purchased from the same supplier on the same day, and the depreciation rate is the same for each item, a further rule applies. The books must be treated as a single item for the purpose of determining whether they qualify for the low value write-off. Special tax code - privacy of information Section 344(10) - Notice of cessation: An employee advised us of the following situation: At the time of taking up her current employment with Mr X, she agreed to obtain his permission before commencing any additional employment. An opportunity has now arisen for her to take an additional job with Mrs Y that will pay more than she receives from Mr X. She doesn’t want Mr X to know of her plans, but realises that if she accepts the job with Mrs Y, the job with Mr X will become secondary employment. She asks if she can retain the G tax code for her Mr X job, as asking him to alter her IR 12 to show the SEC code would reveal her situation. Section 344(10) requires an employee to notify the employer of a change of tax code entitlement within 4 days of becoming aware of the necessitating circum- stances. However, in this situation the employee could apply for a special tax code cer- tificate under section 351, because she has income from more than one employer. Under section 351(3), once the new employer receives that certificate the section 344(10) requirement would effectively be overridden. Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 When gifts of land and shares are said to be complete A taxpayer planned to gift a section of land (valued at $100,000) and some shares (valued at $1,500) to a friend. She was aware of the “12 month rule”, under which any gifts that the same donor makes within 12 months of making a duti- able gift must be aggregated with the dutiable gift for the purpose of calculating gift duty. (This period will be either the 12 month period that starts on the date of the dutiable gift, or the twelve month period that ends on that date. It does not include both of these periods.) The taxpayer asked when the planned gifts would be considered complete, and therefore, when liability for gift duty on the transactions would arise. Until an intended gift is complete, the donor can revoke it at any time. The following are the relevant dates of completion: from page 19 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.2 (August 1994) Land subject to the Land Transfer Act 1952 The earlier of these dates: • the date on which the instrument of transfer is registered with the Land Trans- fer Office • the date on which the beneficiary has in his or her possession all the docu- ments needed for registration to be effected. However, where a valid trust is created, the trust’s creation date is used. Shares The earlier of these dates: • the date on which the company registers the instrument of transfer • the date on which the beneficiary has in his or her possession all the docu- ments needed for registration to be effected. Note: Dates of completion may differ for shares transferred under a system approved under section 7 of the Securities Transfer Act 1991. In this particular case, the gift of land was completed at the date of registration with the Land Transfer Office, and the gift of shares was effective two weeks later when the transfer was registered by the company. As the gifts were made within 12 months of each other, they must be aggregated under section 62 of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. The gift duty on $101,500 is calculated under the Third Schedule to the Act as follows: Value of gift$101,500 Gift duty on $ 72,000= $ 5,850 Gift duty on balance$ 29,500@ 25% = $ 7,375 Total gift duty payable$13,225 Adjustment to conditions on mortgage to family member A taxpayer provided his son with substantial business funds by way of mort- gage in July 1992. The son’s business currently has some liquidity problems. In order to assist his son, the taxpayer is considering adjustments to the mortgage conditions, but realises that there may be gift duty implications. The taxpayer asked about the gift duty consequences of these actions: • postponing the date that repayments are due • granting an “interest holiday” • reducing the interest rate payable. Postponing repayments of principal required under the mortgage does not involve a gift if the postponed repayments continue to attract interest. Granting an “interest holiday” involves a gift of the interest forgiven for the period of the holiday. However, if the mortgage provides for payment of interest only if demanded by the lender each year, and the lender does not exercise this right to demand, no gift is involved (see Re Marshall \[1965\] NZLR 851). A simple reduction in the interest rate payable under a mortgage does not involve a gift, unless the reduced rate of interest is set at an unrealistically low level, given the particular circumstances of the transaction. If the new rate was set at current commercial rates there would be no gift duty implications. 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.2 (August 1994) Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 Stamp duty reduced if gift duty payable on transferred property Section 23 - Conveyance duty reduced if gift duty paid on conveyance: A taxpayer has asked if a gift of land can attract both conveyance duty and gift duty. A gift of land can attract both gift and conveyance duties. However, section 23 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 allows a reduction in the value of the property being conveyed (and consequently a reduction in conveyance duty) if a dutiable gift is involved. For section 23 to apply, gift duty must have been pay- able. Example A block of land valued at $35,000 is gifted, and gift duty is charged on that value as follows: 5% of ($35,000 - $27,000) $8,000 = $400. If the land for conveyance duty purposes is valued at $35,000, this amount is reduced under section 23 by the value of the land for gift duty purposes (i.e., $35,000), resulting in nil value and therefore no conveyance duty. Gifts on which no duty is payable or that are exempt under the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 do not qualify for the reduction. For example, if one person makes gifts to another in good faith and as part of the donor’s normal expendi- ture, the gifts will not be subject to gift duty if their total value does not exceed $2,000 in a single calendar year.

The volume of its transactions increased in the 1980s and Inland Revenue assessed gains on transactions under sections 65(2)(a), (e) and 191(4A). Certain gains were found to be taxable under the second limb of section 65(2)(e). Otherwise the gains were not taxable. Facts:The taxpayer was an unlisted public company that carried on an investment business. The shareholders were charitable and family trusts established by the continued on page 24 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.2 (August 1994) company founder. The overall scheme was that the taxpayer administered the assets of the charitable trusts and the trusts allocated the income received. Until 1983, the policy of the taxpayer’s directors was capital maintenance and the provision of regular dividends. During the 1980s the taxpayer made substan- tial gains on the sale of shares. Inland Revenue assessed the taxpayer for gains in the 1986 to 1990 income years for these reasons: • the taxpayer was in the business of share dealing under section 65(2)(a) or the first limb of section 65(2)(e) of the Act • particular transactions were within the second and third limbs of section 65(2)(e) • a wholly owned subsidiary of the taxpayer was a share dealer and section 191(4A) applied. Decision:Justice Gallen in the High Court held that: • The tax treatment under section 65(2)(a) and the first limb of section 65(2)(e) was as formulated in Californian Copper Syndicate (Limited and Reduced) v Harris (Surveyor of Taxes) \[1904\] 5 TC 159. Under this treatment, when the owner of an ordinary investment chooses to realise it, any gain is not normally a taxable profit. However, such a gain is taxable when securities are realised not on a mere realisation or change of investment, but when done in the carrying on, or carrying out, of a business. • Although there were factors leading to the opposite conclusion, the facts fell into the first case. The economic situation of the 1980s required regular rein- vestment by the taxpayer. There was no fundamental change to the investment philosophy or approach of the taxpayer. Investments made in a certain group of companies were consistent with this philosophy. Also, some of the share realisations were to allow the company to switch investments to a car-parking building. • The second and third limbs of section 65(2)(e) applied to some, but not other, categories of transactions. Twenty-two categories of transactions were ana- lysed case by case. • Losses on certain investments could not be deducted, where corresponding profits would not have been assessable under section 65(2)(e). • Section 191(4A) did not apply to the transactions. Justice Gallen noted that the fact that the transactions carried out by the taxpayer did not come within the category of transactions normally operated by the share dealing subsidiary indicated that it should not apply. He concluded that the tax status of the transactions should be as under section 65. Comments:Inland Revenue has not decided whether to appeal this decision. Loss on disposition of depreciated property Rating:••• Case:TRA 93/211 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - section 117 Keywords:Motor vehicle value, depreciation, loss on sale Summary:The taxpayer company sold a motor vehicle to its directors/shareholders at below book value. The taxpayer claimed a deduction for the loss. The Commis- sioner disallowed the deduction on the basis that the sale was below market from page 23 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.2 (August 1994) value. The TRA upheld the Commissioner’s decision, finding that the taxpayer had not established on the balance of probabilities that the sale price was the market value. Facts:The taxpayer purchased the motor vehicle in early 1988. The sale occurred in early 1989 at a price well below book value. The taxpayer claimed a deduction for the difference between book value and the sale price. The Commissioner considered the sale was at less than market value and disallowed the deduction. The taxpayer relied on the sale prices of the same vehicle in the 1992 and 1993 income years to justify the 1989 price, and also relied on notional depreciation figures for the 1990 to 1992 income years. Decision:The TRA upheld the Commissioner’s assessment. Generally, the onus of proof in a tax case rests with the taxpayer on the balance of probabilities. When the Commissioner forms the view that a vehicle is sold below market price (under the previous section 117(5)(b)) the Commissioner should determine a price on the basis of information supplied by the taxpayer. In this case, it was reasonable for the Commissioner to arrive at a higher selling price by disallowing the loss. Particularly important was the taxpayer’s failure to supply reasonable informa- tion as to the true value of the vehicle. The information supplied by the taxpayer was inadequate to establish, on the balance of probabilities, that the selling price was the market value. It was hear- say evidence. While the TRA can accept hearsay evidence, in this case the TRA could not rely on, or make reasonable conclusions from, the particular evidence supplied by the taxpayer. Sale prices years after the original sale did not help with valuation at the time of that first sale. Nor did notional depreciation figures. The TRA favoured a practical approach to valuation using the robust attitude of the market, not a minute assessment of the particular vehicle. The TRA would have accepted a letter of valuation from a motor vehicle dealer as appropriate evidence. It may even have been acceptable to obtain such a letter some years after the sale on the basis of a similar valuation in the past. There may have even been information from the dealer’s records as to what was the earlier valuation. Also, from an inspection of the vehicle, the dealer may have been able to estab- lish its earlier value. However, although given every opportunity to do so, no such evidence was tendered by the taxpayer. Comments:The taxpayer is not appealing this decision. Wages subsidised by Employment Service - employer to deduct tax Rating:••• Case:TRA 93/100 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - section 338(1) Keywords:Employer, person making payment, subsidy Summary:Under the Community Restart Programme an organisation can employ workers and receive a subsidy for their wages from the New Zealand Employment Service (NZES). In such cases it is the organisation, not the NZES, which is obliged to deduct PAYE and ACC levies. Facts:A charitable trust received subsidies from the NZES for workers referred to it under the Community Restart Programme. It engaged these workers to carry out the purposes of the trust. The trust did not deduct PAYE or ACC levies from payments it made to the workers because it understood the NZES to be the employer and the trust itself to have no such responsibilities. The Commissioner continued on page 26 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.2 (August 1994) issued an assessment for the outstanding PAYE and ACC levies. The trust objected on the ground it was not the employer. The TRA heard evidence as to the nature of the relationship between the NZES, the trust, and the workers, and as to the advice that was given to the trust. The TRA accepted there had been a genuine misunderstanding by well motivated people who did not profit from the omission to make the deductions. Decision:The payment by NZES to the trust was a subsidy. It is not possible for an em- ployer to “subsidise” the wages of its own staff. It should have been clear there- fore that NZES was not the employer. On the facts the trust was the employer under general law. Even if this had not been the case, the trust would still be obliged by section 338(1) to make PAYE tax deductions. The payments to the workers fell clearly under the definition of “salary or wages” in section 2. They were therefore “source deduction pay- ments”. Section 338(1) imposes the obligation to make deductions from source deduction payments on “the employer or other person by whom the payment is made”. The assessments were therefore correct. The TRA observed that it had no jurisdiction to deal with the hardship to the trust. Comments:The taxpayer is not appealing this decision. Profits from subdivision of land Rating:•• Case:Prouse v Commissioner of Inland Revenue CA 239/93 Act:Land and Income Tax Act 1954 - section 88AA Keywords:Land subdivision, sale or other disposition, retrospective application of statute. Summary:This was a Court of Appeal judgment from the High Court decision of Justice Gallen in Prouse v CIR \[1993\] NZTC 10,271. This case was about the sale of sections in a subdivision following a change in the law. Profits on sections sold after the change were subject to income tax despite the fact that the scheme or undertaking commenced before the new law change. Facts:The taxpayer entered into a scheme to subdivide his land in May 1973. This was before the Government announced the intention to introduce new legislation relating to the sale of land. The 1973 Amendment Act introduced section 88AA(1)(e) which dealt with profits and gains from the subdivision of land. After 10 August 1973 (the date of the public announcement of the intended legislation) Inland Revenue assessed the profits and gains from the sale of property. The taxpayer argued that the legislation should only apply to undertakings or schemes begun after the date of the public announcement. In the High Court, Justice Gallen held that the amendment applied to profits and gains on the sale of sections after the application date of the new legislation. The fact that Inland Revenue had previously confirmed that the subdivision proposal was not tax- able did not affect the situation. The taxpayer appealed to the Court of Appeal. Decision:The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and agreed with the conclusions reached by Justice Gallen in the High Court and by Justice Tompkins in Aubrey v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1984) 6 NZTC 61,765, on which Justice Gallen relied. from page 25 27 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.2 (August 1994) The Court of Appeal held that the 1973 legislation was intended to apply to all sales of land after 10 August 1973. It did not matter whether any undertaking or scheme involved was embarked on before or after that date. Factors that influ- enced the Court of Appeal’s decision were: • The 1973 statute changed the rules applying to land transactions. Any sale before 10 August was dealt with under the old provision, and any sale after that date under the new provision. • The legislative focus on sales and on the dates of sales was entirely rational in policy terms as it prevented a tax gap caused when the old section ceased to apply. • In the Court of Appeal’s view the words of the legislation were clear. Section 9(5) of the Amendment Act 1973 applied to any profit derived from any sale made on or after 10 August 1973. The legislation could not be read down to exclude sales if the undertaking or scheme commenced before that date. Comments:The taxpayer is not appealing this decision. Whether subdivision work was of a minor nature Rating:••• Case:Costello v Commissioner of Inland Revenue CA 237/93 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - section 67(4)(e) Keywords:Profits from subdivision, work of a minor nature Summary:This was an appeal to the Court of Appeal from the High Court decision of Justice Speight in Costello v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1993) 15 NZTC 10,285. The Court of Appeal held that on the overall judgment of the facts of the case, the work was not of a minor nature. Facts:The taxpayers were the joint owners of property consisting of nine self-con- tained flats. They decided to subdivide the flats into unit titles and sold the resulting nine lots individually. The subdivision did not require any physical work and the surveying, valuation and legal work involved was straightfor- ward. The fees charged by the solicitor and surveyor were only $560 plus $13 disbursements and $1,012 plus $92 disbursements respectively. The valuer, whose work only involved allocating percentages of the total value to the respec- tive units, did not charge a fee and it seems received a small gift. The units were sold at a profit and the Commissioner assessed the taxpayers under section 67(4)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1976. In the High Court, Justice Speight held that the complicated nature of the subdi- vision scheme and the number of resulting lots meant that the development or subdivision work was not of a minor nature. The scheme was caught under section 67(4)(e) as the other elements of the provision were satisfied on the facts of the case. The taxpayers appealed to the Court of Appeal. Decision:The Court of Appeal said that whether the work in question was of a minor nature was a matter of fact to be determined on all the circumstances of the particular case. Every subdivision of a larger area into lots would include some survey work, the preparation of appropriate plans, obtaining planning consents and local authority permits and associated legal work including the depositing of subdivisonal plans and the issue of any separate titles. Each particular case called for an assessment of what was done, which in practical terms may require consideration of the time, effort and expense involved. continued on page 28 28 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.2 (August 1994) The Court of Appeal considered the facts of the case. The property was subdi- vided into nine lots, six of which had street frontage. There were four separate buildings involved. Each unit had one or more accessory units which had to be delineated on the plan and four common property areas were provided. Al- though the surveyor’s fee was very modest in 1994 prices, and the total profes- sional charges were very small relative to land values, the job took 36 hours of time in order to achieve the object of a subdivision into nine lots. In addition there was the associated legal work including the establishment of a new corpo- rate body for the property under the Unit Titles Act. Taking the facts into account, the Court of Appeal held that the work was not of a minor nature and dismissed the taxpayers’ appeal. Comments:The taxpayer is not appealing this decision. GST and subdivisions Rating:••••• Case:Newman v Commissioner of Inland Revenue HC Dunedin AP 83/92 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1976 - section 6 Keywords:Taxable activity, continuously, regularly Summary:On appeal, the High Court upheld the TRA decision that a “one-off” property subdivision can constitute a taxable activity for GST purposes. Facts:This case involved a builder who purchased a block of land on which he in- tended building a family home for himself. During the construction of the house, he subdivided the property to fund the completion of the house. This subdivi- sion was independent from his taxable activity of building. Following the sale of the subdivided land Inland Revenue determined that the subdivision activity was a taxable activity and GST was assessed on the sale. The taxpayer’s objection to the assessment was disallowed and he requested that a case be stated to the TRA. The TRA found that the assessment was correct and the taxpayer appealed to the High Court. Decision:Justice Fraser held that the ordinary and natural meanings of the words “con- tinuous” and “regular” did not preclude a one-off subdivision from being char- acterised as a taxable activity. Justice Fraser held that the series of sequential steps undertaken in the subdivision process, such as drainage, electrical and access work and the usual real estate and lawyers fees, constitute an “activity”. He likened the transaction to that of a person who as a single venture constructs a commercial building for ultimate sale. Even though it is “one off”, it would still be described as an activity because of the series of acts involved in the building’s construction. In the case at hand the builder carried on the activity without interruption from the time the decision was made to proceed with the subdivision until the time the section was sold. This meant the activity was carried on “continuously”. Justice Fraser concluded that the subdivision process was a taxable activity in its own right. Comments:The taxpayer is appealing this decision to the Court of Appeal. from page 27 29 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.2 (August 1994) Whether chartering a private launch constitutes a business Rating:••• Case:LR Lawrence v Commissioner of Inland Revenue HC Auckland M695/92 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - sections 2, 33(13) and 104. Keywords:deductions, carrying on a business, request for case to be stated directly to the High Court Summary:The High Court held that a taxpayer could not deduct the running costs of a launch against his assessable income as he did not use the launch in carrying on a business. Facts:The taxpayer purchased a launch that was suitable for charter operations as well as personal use. He claimed most of the expenditure incurred in running the launch as a deduction against his income as a dentist. The Commissioner disal- lowed the deduction. The taxpayer requested that the case be stated directly to the High Court on the grounds he incurred that expenditure in carrying on a business under section 104(b) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Decision:Justice Fisher held that the running costs of the launch were not deductible as the taxpayer had not used the launch for carrying on a business. These are the reasons that Justice Fisher took into account: • There had been no serious inquiry into the feasibility of the charter business before purchasing the launch. • There had been no serious attempt by the taxpayer to promote the charter venture. • There was a small proportion of chartering use compared to private use. • There had been limited availability of the launch for charter use. • Following the financial year in question the taxpayer kept the launch for his own personal use. The Judge refused the Commissioner’s application for costs because the Com- missioner had consented to a High Court hearing in the first instance, when in the Judge’s view, the Taxation Review Authority should have heard the case as it did not involve difficult questions of law or large sums of money. Comments:Inland Revenue is still considering whether to appeal the Judge’s decision to refuse the Commissioner’s application for costs. Exchange of yachts - whether supply of taxable activity as a going concern Rating:••• Case:Allen Yacht Charters Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue, HC Auckland M 118/94 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, sections 6(1), 8(1) and 11(1)(c). Keywords:Taxable activity, going concern Summary:The case concerned a sale of a yacht in return for another yacht with the differ- ence paid in cash. The High Court found that in each case there was a taxable activity, but there was no supply of a taxable activity as a going concern. Facts:Allen Yacht Charters Limited (the objector) entered into an agreement to sell its yacht Chateau Briand to a Mr and Mrs Macalister (the Macalisters) in exchange continued on page 30 30 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.2 (August 1994) for the Macalister’s yacht Laissez Faire and $80,000 in cash. The objector issued a tax invoice to the Macalisters which showed the GST as being nil and stating the Chateau Briand was sold to the Macalisters as a going concern. The Commis- sioner issued an assessment to the Macalisters showing the purchase of the Chateau Briand to be of a going concern. The Macalisters objected on the basis that the purchase was not the purchase of a going concern and therefore they were entitled to an input claim for the GST. The objection eventually came before the Taxation Review Authority. In a TRA Case, Q1 (1993) NZTC 5001, Judge Willy upheld the objection and found that the Macalisters did not purchase the business as a going concern and therefore were entitled to claim a refund of GST on the purchase. The Commissioner then reassessed the GST liability to the objector charging GST on the sale, the objector objected to that assessment and the case stated resulted. The Court decided that the issues to be determined were • Whether the activity carried on before the exchange by the objector with Cha- teau Briand and by the Macalisters with Laissez Faire was a taxable activity • If so, whether there was in each case a “supply” of that taxable activity “as a going concern”. Decision:Justice Tompkins in both cases held that both the objector and the Macalisters were carrying on a taxable activity but there was no supply of that taxable activ- ity as a going concern. In approaching the question of whether a taxable activity had been supplied as a going concern Justice Tompkins referred to Variety Leisure Corporation v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1988) 10 NZTC 5255. The one reservation Justice Tompkins had with this decision was Justice Hardie Boys’ reference to an undertaking remaining active and operating “before, during and after its transfer to the new ownership”. He did not consider that it was necessary for the undertaking to remain active after its transfer. He consid- ered that the purchaser may be supplied with the vendor’s going concern but may, immediately after acquisition, close it down. There would still have been the supply of a going concern. He considered, however, that the concern must be going at the time of transfer to the new owner. In relation to the Chateau Briand transaction Justice Tompkins concluded that the sale to the Macalisters was only of the assets of the business and there was no supply of the business as a going concern. Relevant facts were that there was no payment for goodwill, there was no transfer to the Macalisters of forward book- ings, there was no examination of the accounts of the business, there were no steps taken for the Macalisters to take over the objectors’ customers, and there was little evidence that the Macalisters had any detailed knowledge of the busi- ness. In relation to the Laissez Faire the Macalisters’ management agreement with a chartering company came to an end on the day the yacht was sold to the tax- payer. For this reason Justice Tompkins decided there was no supply of a going concern. The fact that the objector effected a new agreement with the same company on that same day was not considered sufficient to change the decision. Justice Tompkins commented that if the clause in the agreement between the Macalisters and the management company prohibiting the sale of Laissez Faire without the purchaser signing a management agreement with Rainbow had been enforced, there would be good grounds for concluding that the transaction involved the carrying on by the objector of the same taxable activity as had been carried on by the Macalisters. However, this had not happened.

All legislative references in this item are to the Stamp and Gift Duties Act 1971 unless otherwise stated. An unincorporated company is unable to form an agreement to purchase property as it is legally unable to contract or perform any other act. An agent may form an agreement to purchase property for and on behalf of an unincorporated company. Upon incorporation, the company may ratify the contract and adopt the agent’s contractual rights and obligations. Ratification was not possible at common law. On incorporation the company had to take over the contract by executing an adopting agreement. This adopting agreement was subject to conveyance duty, as was the original agreement. This would mean conveyance duty was paid twice on what was in reality one transaction. Section 25 exempted the adopting agreement from conveyance duty. Section 42A of the Companies Act 1955 (effective 6 December 1983) changed the law to allow companies to ratify pre-incorporation contracts. (Sections 182 to 185 of the Companies Act 1993 substantially re-enact section 42A.) Legislation Section 25 states: If the Commissioner is satisfied that an instrument of agreement to convey any property, duly stamped with conveyance duty as an instrument of conveyance, has been made for and on behalf of a company about to be incorpo- rated at the date of executing the agreement, the company when incorporated shall, for the purposes of computing the conveyance duty payable on the instrument of convey- ance of the property to the company to the extent that the conveyance is pursuant to the agreement, be deemed to be the party entitled to the conveyance under the agreement. An agreement to purchase formed by an agent on behalf of an unincorporated company is liable to conveyance duty unless it falls within an exemption in the Act. An adopting agreement will also be liable to conveyance duty as a transfer by direction under section 16, unless there is a relevant exemption in the Act. If a company can ratify the original agreement there is no further duty liability because there is no new instrument. Pre-1983: Before 6 December 1983 a company had no power to ratify pre-incorporation contracts formed on its behalf by an agent. An adopting agreement was re- quired. Contractually the adopting agreement was a new and substituted contract between the vendor and the company. The adopting agreement was liable to further conveyance duty as a transfer by direction under sec- tion 16. Section 25 exempted the adopting agreement from conveyance duty. It did this by deeming the newly incorporated company to be the party entitled to the transfer under the agreement to purchase. Therefore, there was only one conveyance subject to conveyance duty. Post-1983: Section 42A of the Companies Act 1955 and sections 182 to 185 of the Companies Act 1993 allow companies to ratify pre-incorporation contracts without the need for an adopting agreement. A directors’ resolution is the most common way to ratify the con- tract. However, ratification may also be oral or inferred from conduct. In all cases ratification does not create another instrument liable to conveyance duty. Instead it effectively makes the new company a party to the original agreement. The company can sue and can be sued on the original agreement. Consequently, section 25 is irrelevant as there is no need to deem the company to be a party to the original agreement. Sometimes a purchaser under an agreement to purchase executes the agreement as the principal, and then decides to incorporate a company to take over the contract. In such a case both the agreement to purchase and the transfer to the company will be liable for full conveyance duty as a transfer by direction under section 16. Section 25 will not apply to exempt the transfer because the instrument of transfer to the company was not “made for and on behalf of a company about to be incorporated at the date of executing the agreement...”. Conveyance duty on property conveyed on behalf of a company yet to be incorporated Introduction Background Policy Conveyance duty when there is no pre-incorporation contract 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.3 (September 1994) Late last month the Government released a discussion document seeking submissions on proposals for a reformed compliance and penalties regime for the taxation system. The discussion document, Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties, proposes clear standards of behaviour for taxpayers, and a comprehensive set of penalties for failure to comply with the law. It proposes that two standards based on reasonableness be introduced into tax law: • Taxpayers must take reasonable care in meeting their obligations; failure to do so will lead to a penalty. • Where the tax at stake is over $10,000, taxpayers will also need to have a reasonably arguable position in support of the way they have applied the law. The proposed standards would be reinforced by a consistent system of civil and criminal penalties that include: • a new penalty for abusive tax avoidance of 125% of the shortfall, aimed at those who use avoidance schemes designed to frustrate the scheme and purpose of the law; • new civil penalties for negligence, lack of a reason- ably arguable position, gross negligence, and evasion; • a late payment penalty of 5% (reduced from 10%) of the unpaid tax plus an additional 2% per month to apply to GST and income tax; • introduction of a maximum term of five years’ imprisonment for tax evasion; • an increase in maximum fines imposed by the courts from $15,000 to $25,000 for first offences, and from $25,000 to $50,000 for second and subsequent offences; • a new $50 penalty for late filing of annual returns. The discussion document also proposes a comprehen- sive, two-way interest regime for overpayments and underpayments of tax. Taxpayers would be paid interest on overpayments, to compensate them for loss of the use of their funds. They would be charged interest for late payment or underpayment. Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties is available from Bennetts Government Bookshops. Submissions should be made by 14 October. This item clarifies the Commissioner’s policy on the zero-rating of goods and services supplied to owners of yachts and other vessels that are in New Zealand on a temporary basis. It describes a supplier’s obligations when the supplier supplies goods and services to a non- resident in respect of a temporary import. All legislative references in this item are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. Any direct quotations from this Act are printed in smaller type. A number of foreign yachts visit New Zealand every year. The Act provides for zero-rating for goods and services supplied in relation to items that are temporar- ily imported. Suppliers often ask Inland Revenue and NZ Customs how they should treat such supplies, for the purposes of the Act. Services Section 11(2)(ca) of the Act provides for the zero-rating of a supply of services when the services - (i)Are supplied directly in connection with goods referred to in either section 47(2) or section 181 of the Customs Act 1966, notwithstanding that the goods are in New Zealand; and (ii)Are supplied to a person who is not resident in New Zealand at the time the services are performed; Section 11(2)(ca)(i) Section 47(2) of the Customs Act 1966 deems goods that enter New Zealand but have a destination outside the territorial limits of New Zealand not to have been imported. This definition includes yachts, aircraft and other goods. They are not subject to customs duty. Government seeks submissions on compliance and pena lty proposals GST - zero-rating and temporary imports such as yachts Introduction Background Legislation 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.3 (September 1994) Section 11(2)(ca)(ii) Section 11(2)(ca)(ii) of the Act restricts zero-rating to supplies of services made to people who are not resi- dents of New Zealand when the services are performed. When services are performed in respect of a temporary import but are provided to a resident, the supply is subject to GST at 12.5%. Section 2 of the Act provides that the term “resident” means a resident as defined in section 241 of the Income Tax Act 1976. This means that any person who is resident for income tax purposes will be resident for GST purposes. However, for GST purposes the resi- dence rules are extended to include as a resident any person who carries on a taxable activity or any other activity in New Zealand while having a fixed or perma- nent place in New Zealand relating to that activity. In the case of an unincorporated body such as a partner- ship, that body will be resident in New Zealand if the centre of its administrative management is in New Zealand. Goods Section 11(1)(ba) of the Act provides for the zero- rating of a supply of goods when - (ba)The goods have been supplied in the course of repairing, renovating, modifying, or treating any goods to which subsection (2)(ca) of this section applies and the goods supplied- (i)Are wrought into, affixed to, attached to, or otherwise form part of those other goods; or (ii)Being consumable goods, become unusable or worthless as a direct result of being used in that repair, renovation, modification, or treatment process; Section 11(1)(d) does not allow zero-rating of any goods for which the registered person (or an associated person) has claimed a secondhand goods input tax credit. GST must be charged on the sale of these goods in all cases. This situation is of particular importance to secondhand dealers. For goods to qualify for zero-rating under section 11(1)(ba), the supplier must take steps to ensure that the goods become part of a temporary import. There is no requirement that the supplier personally incorporate those goods into the temporary import in order for the goods to be zero-rated. However, it will not be accept- able to zero-rate the supply of goods merely because the purchaser is a non-resident. The supplier must be able to show that requirements for zero-rating under section 11(1)(ba) are satisfied. As the supplier is seeking to zero-rate a supply of goods and services, he or she must be able to show that the supply met all of these conditions: • it was made to a non-resident • it was in respect of a temporary import • in the case of goods, that the goods were wrought into, affixed to, or attached to or form part of the temporary import, or that they were consumable items that became unusable or worthless as a direct result of being used in the repair, renovation, modification or treatment process. Examples of the type of evidence that Inland Revenue would accept for zero-rating to apply are: • copy of passport • copy of NZ Customs temporary import entry permit • details of the goods supplied and evidence to show that those goods became part of the temporary import. NZ Customs gives temporary import status to a yacht that enters NZ waters. Repairs are undertaken on the vessel. The yachtsperson, a non-resident, buys a new engine and instals it in the vessel. GST treatment (a)The charge made to the visiting yachtsperson for services, e.g. repairs made to the yacht, can be zero-rated. (b)If the supplier has used consumable items such as motor oil in the course of the repairs, the charge to the visiting yachtsperson for these items can be zero-rated provided that the items involved became unusable or worthless as a result of being used in the repairs. (c)If the visiting yachtsperson buys the engine and instals it in the vessel, and the supplier of the engine has kept a copy of the temporary import entry permit, a copy of the passport and docu- ments (e.g. photograph or other evidence) that show that the goods have become part of the temporary import, the supplier can zero-rate that supply. (d)If a registered supplier sells the engine to the yachtsperson, and the yachtsperson engages another registered person to instal the engine into the vessel, this will be treated as two separate supplies. The sale of the engine can be zero-rated only if the supplier maintains records as indicated in (c) above. The charge for the installation can be zero-rated in terms of section 11(2)(ca), because it is a service supplied directly in connection with the temporary import. Adequate records to show that the services are supplied to a non-resident in respect of a temporary import must be kept. If the engine is secondhand, and the supplier claims a secondhand goods input tax credit for it, the sale of the engine to the visiting yachtsperson must include GST at the standard rate (12.5%). This is because section 11(1)(d) provides that zero-rating does not apply when the supplier has deducted the input tax in respect of secondhand goods. Policy Evidential requirements Example 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.3 (September 1994) This item states the Commissioner’s interpretation of the formula for calculating qualifying company election tax (QCET) in cases when factor “b” in that formula is a negative amount. When “b” is negative, unrealised revenue losses are added back when calculating the amount on which QCET is charged when a company becomes a qualifying company. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1976. Any direct quotations from this Act are printed in smaller type. As far as is possible, the qualifying company regime is designed to treat closely held companies and their shareholders as one entity for tax purposes. This is similar to the way in which partnerships are treated. Dividends paid by qualifying companies are either fully imputed or tax exempt. The rules were not intended to apply retrospectively to such distributions, so an entry tax on revenue reserves which existed at the time a company became a qualifying company was introduced. This is qualifying company election tax. A tax practitioner asked if, when factor “b” in the QCET formula was a negative it should be added (subtraction of a negative giving a positive), or a nil amount entered. QCET is defined by the formula in section 393K(2) as: (a + c - b - c/d ) x d In this formula: ais the amount that would be a dividend on winding up (except for a different treatment of 10 year bonus issues which are specifically excluded) bis an amount of assessable income as discussed below cis the aggregate of these amounts: •the balances in the imputation credit and divi- dend withholding payment accounts •tax payable less refunds due •dividend withholding payments payable less refunds due. dis the company tax rate expressed as a decimal. \[Note: These factors are defined in section 393K(2). The above paragraphs use a simplified interpretation of the defined factor to demonstrate the essential features of the qualifying company regime.\] Factor “b” “b” is defined in section 393K(2) as: “the aggregate of the assessable income which would be derived by the company at the relevant time from taking the actions described in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of item “a” of this formula, after deduction of all amounts of expendi- ture or loss incurred in taking such actions that would be deductible under this Act in calculating such assessable income:” The actions referred to are: “(i)the company had disposed of all its tangible and intangible property (other than cash) to an unrelated person at the relevant time for amounts of cash equal to the market value of such property at the relevant time; and “(ii)the company had repaid or otherwise met all of its liabilities at the relevant time (not being income tax payable as a result of the disposition of property or meeting of liabilities) for amounts of cash equal to the market value of such liabilities to a purchaser of such liabilities at the relevant time:” Note that paragraph (iii) of the definition of factor “a” is omitted from the definition of factor “b”. Paragraph (iii) reads: “ (iii) The company had thereupon been wound up and any amounts of cash remaining...distributed to its shareholders... .” Factor “b” is thus an amount which is assessable income to the company if it cashed up but did not wind up. This amount identifies previously unrealised revenue re- serves, and previously unrealised revenue losses. It does not include unrealised capital gains, since such gains would not be assessable income of the company. It will include whatever unrealised revenue gains are in the company. This means that the value of factor “b” can be a positive or a negative amount. Positive amounts of assessable income will include items such as any amount of notional depreciation clawback and any increase in the value of trading stock. Negative amounts will include bad debts, decreases in the value of trading stock, and losses with respect to adjusted tax value on the notional sale of depreciable property. The QCET formula can now be understood as follows: (a + c - b - c/d ) dequals: (a + c - b ) d - cwhich represents (simplified): or further simplified: Qualifying company election tax formula - meaning when factor "b" is negative Summary Ba ckground Analysis 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.3 (September 1994) QCET is thus a tax on the amount (excluding unrealised gains or losses) which would be a dividend taxable in terms of sections 4 and 4A on winding up. This is an amount that can be distributed tax free once the com- pany becomes a qualifying company. Whether QCET is payable depends mainly on a company’s retained earnings from before it became a qualifying company. There is nothing in section 393K to prohibit a literal application of the formula. The simple arithmetical answer to the question raised is that two negatives give a positive and the ordinary rules of arithmetic should be assumed in dealing with calculations required under the Act. The result is that when “b” is negative, unrealised revenue losses are added back in calculating the amount on which QCET is charged when a company becomes a qualifying company. This is consistent with the treat- ment of unrealised gains (when “b” is positive) which are deducted from the amount on which the tax is charged. It is necessary to exclude the amount represented by “b” because it is included in “a” in the formula. If the unrealised gains and losses were not specifically excluded, a company becoming a qualifying company would be taxed on unrealised revenue gains which would later be taxed again when realised, and it would have the benefit of a deduction for unrealised losses which would also be deducted again later when realised, or which might never be realised.

Policy Example 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.3 (September 1994) This article explains the correct treatment of rental losses when calculating income for Family Support purposes. Part XIA of the Income Tax Act 1976 deals with Family Support. Section 374B(1) requires a number of adjust- ments to be made to a taxpayer’s assessable income in order to calculate the income to be used to determine Family Support entitlement. Under section 374B(1)(f), when a taxpayer conducts a business which incurs a loss, the amount of that loss is not to be taken into account. The effect is that the taxpayer’s income (for Family Support purposes) increases, and thus less Family Support is payable. The 1992 FS2B form (Adjustments to Income for Family Support) states on page 2: “\[if\] you have a business or rental loss, you cannot deduct it for Family Support purposes - it is treated as nil when working out your family income.” In certain circumstances this may not be correct. As detailed above, the legislation requires “business” losses to be added back, but not necessarily “rental” losses. For income tax purposes, rental losses are deductible in full. However, a person cannot be said to be in the “business of renting” unless there is an intention of making a profit from the rental activities. Often, the mere holding of property to derive rental income does not constitute a business. Factors to be considered in determining whether a taxpayer is “in the business of renting”, or if the rental activity is of a non-business nature include: • the scale of the operation and the volume of transac- tions. A taxpayer who owns several rental properties is more likely to be “in the business of renting” than a person with only one property. • the commitment of time, money and effort. Compar- ing these with operations normally involved with an operation that has been determined as a “rental business”. • the pattern of activity and the financial results. A profit is not likely to be as important to a person acquiring a property for investment purposes; for example the rental income is used to offset the costs of owning the property, such as rates, insurance etc. A taxpayer borrows a substantial amount of money, and uses it to buy a house for investment as part of a retirement plan. The house is rented at a market rental, but the interest exceeds the rental income earned. The rental loss is deductible for Family Support purposes. The taxpayer is not in the business of renting because the property has been acquired as part of a retirement investment plan, and the commitment of time and effort in collecting the rent, maintaining the property etc. is less than would normally be involved in a “rental business”. A taxpayer owned two houses and a block of five flats. She collected the rents, interviewed tenants, and did some of the maintenance and repair work. The Taxation Review Authority in Case F111(1984) 6 NZTC 60,094 held that the taxpayer was carrying on the business of a landlord. The rental loss is not deductible. For Family Support purposes the loss is treated as nil. It cannot be assumed that a rental activity conducted by a taxpayer is a business. Before that can be determined, the nature of the rental activity needs to be considered. Form FS 2B has been reprinted, and references to rental losses have been removed. If a taxpayer incurs an investment loss from the renting of property, that loss is to be taken into account for Family Support. However, if a taxpayer incurs a business loss from the renting of property, that loss will be excluded. Taxpayers may request that their Family Support entitlement be recalculated to include a rental loss. Each request will be considered on a case by case basis after giving due attention to the nature of the rental activity. A request for recalculation can be made at any Inland Revenue District Office. The request should be made in writing, setting out the reasons for the reassessment. Rental losses and Family Support Intr oduction Comment Example 1 Example 2 Reassessments 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.3 (September 1994) Some New Zealand resident members of overseas-based insurance underwriting syndicates have asked Inland Revenue whether expenditure or losses incurred in respect of those syndicates are deductible. Such ex- penditure or losses are not deductible because the underwriters did not incur them in deriving assessable income. Section 210A of the Income Tax Act 1976 (“the Act”) provides for the taxation of resident non-corporate insurance underwriters. It applies to income derived in the income years commencing from 1 April 1979 onwards. Parliament enacted the section so that income which individual resident insurance underwriters derive from an insurance business (except life insurance) carried on outside New Zealand is not assessable income. Section 210A(2) of the Act states that the assessable income of an underwriter carrying on the business of insurance “shall not include income derived from insurance business carried on out of New Zealand ...”. This exclusion does not apply to any of the underwrit- ers’ income of the kind referred to in paragraphs (e), (f), (g), (h), (k), (l), and (m) of section 243(2) of the Act. This is any income derived from: • ownership of any land in New Zealand • any mortgage of land in New Zealand • shares or debentures issued by a New Zealand com- pany • debentures issued by a local or public authority • debentures or other securities issued by the Govern- ment of New Zealand • selling or disposing of any property situated in New Zealand • interest or a redemption payment from money lent in New Zealand • interest or a redemption payment from money lent outside New Zealand to New Zealand residents, unless this money is used for a business carried on outside New Zealand through a fixed establishment outside New Zealand, • interest or a redemption payment from money lent outside New Zealand to non-residents for use in a business carried on in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand. Section 210A(1) defines “insurance” to mean “insur- ance or guarantee against loss, damage, or risk of any kind whatever except life insurance”. An “underwriter” is a New Zealand resident who is liable under a contract of insurance to pay, or to contribute towards payment wholly or partly of any amount that may become claimable by the person insured under that contract. It does not include a company, or a mutual insurance association incorporated under the Mutual Insurance Act 1955. Section 210A excludes income that individual New Zealand resident insurance underwriters derive from an insurance business carried on outside New Zealand from assessable income (subject to the exceptions listed above). Under section 104, a taxpayer may only deduct expendi- ture or losses if they were incurred in gaining or producing assessable income, or in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income. Income that comes within section 210A is not assessable income. This means any ex- penditure or losses incurred in relation to that income are not deductible because they were not incurred in gaining or producing assessable income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income. The effect of sections 104 and 210A(2) is that indi- vidual New Zealand resident insurance underwriters cannot claim a deduction for expenditure or losses incurred in respect of their insurance business carried on outside New Zealand. This is because they were not incurred in gaining or producing assessable income. This applies whether the taxpayer incurred the expendi- ture or the losses as an individual or as a member of an underwriting syndicate or partnership. NZ resident insurance underwrites - no deductions for overseas business expenses/losses Summary Background Legislation Policy Conclusion 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.3 (September 1994) This item states the Commissioner’s current policy on the assessability of gifts received by volunteer workers in New Zealand. The item shows that there are no firm rules as to whether any particular gift is assessable income. Each gift and each case must be judged on its own merits. There are a number of factors to consider when deciding whether a gift is assessable income. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1976. A gift could potentially be included in the recipient’s assessable income as one or more of these items: • profits or gains derived from any business under section 65(2)(a) • monetary remuneration under section 65(2)(b) • “other” income under section 65(2)(l). If a gift is to be included as assessable income under any of the above provisions, it must have the characteristics of income. The three main characteristics of income were identified in Reid v CIR (1983) 6 NZTC 61,624; (1983) 6 TRNZ 494 as follows: • It comes in • It is periodic, recurring, or regular • Its quality in the hands of the recipient. The first characteristic requires income to “come in”. Income can only come in if it is money or money’s worth. A gift that is not convertible into money or money’s worth is not income. The second characteristic requires income to be peri- odic, recurring, or regular. A gift is unlikely to be income if it is unusual for the recipient to receive gifts. The third characteristic looks at the quality of the receipt in the hands of the recipient. This characteristic tends to be the most important when deciding if a gift is assessable income. It involves taking an overall view of the circumstances of the case to ascertain how and why the gift was made. As a general rule, gifts to a volunteer worker will be assessable income if they are a relevant product of the taxpayer’s activities. A gift will not be income if it is a personal gift made purely as a mark of affection, esteem or respect. G v CIR \[1961\] 1 NZLR 994 is a good example of this rule. In this case, G was an Evangelical Minister. He had been preaching and receiving donations for seven or eight years before the income years in question. He supported himself and his family from the donations he received from Assemblies and individuals. This was his only means of financial support. The Court recognised that higher principles motivated G in his preaching, but considered that G did intend that his work would lead to gifts he would accept and use for his support. Therefore, the Court held that G was carrying on a business for pecuniary profit. The Court considered a number of different classes of gift: • Gifts from Brethren Assemblies (whether or not they held meetings) were income. The gifts were a recogni- tion of G’s activities and were intertwined with his income producing activities. • Gifts from private persons other than relatives were income unless they were purely personal gifts. In most cases the gifts were a recognition of G’s activities and intertwined with his income producing activities. • Christmas and holiday presents are not normally assessable income. However, the size and repetition of these gifts marked them as not normal Christmas or holiday presents. The gifts bore the characteristics of contributions in recognition of G’s activities, and the Court held them to be assessable income unless the gifts were of a purely personal character. • Gifts from persons for whom G performed marriage services were income. The gifts were a recognition of G’s activities and related to his income producing activities. • Presents from relatives were not income. Generally, gifts will be assessable income when they are a product of the taxpayer’s activities. A gift will not be income if it is a personal gift made purely as a mark of affection, esteem or respect. The case of G v CIR shows that there are no firm rules as to whether a particular gift is assessable income. Each gift and each case must be judged on its own merits. While no factor is determinative in itself, the following need to be considered when deciding whether a gift is assessable income: • How and why the gift was made. A gift received by a person in a working capacity in a particular area indicates that the gift is assessable income. Similarly, if a donor is motivated to make a gift because of a person’s work, this is an indication that the gift is assessable income. • Whether the gift is a common incident of the recipi- ent’s occupation or calling. A gift made to a person in an occupation where gifts are commonly received indicates that the gift is assessable income. Assessability of gifts received by volunteer workers in NZ Introduction Background Policy 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.3 (September 1994) • Whether the gift is solicited. A solicited gift tends to indicate that the gift is assessable income. • Whether the gift can be traced to gratitude engen- dered by some service rendered by the recipient to the donor. If the recipient has not been remunerated fully for the service, this tends to indicate the gift is assessable income. • The motives of the donor. A personal gift made purely as a mark of affection, esteem or respect is unlikely to be assessable income. • Whether the recipient relies on the gift for regular maintenance. A reliance on gifts for regular personal maintenance indicates that the gift is assessable income. Hine decides to take a year off from studying at university towards a social work degree to provide her services voluntarily to the IHC. Hine gives home help to parents with intellectually handi- capped children as part of the tasks assigned. Hine often receives gifts from these parents in apprecia- tion of her work and in recognition that she is not paid. Sometimes the parents make donations to IHC and express a preference that the money be passed on to Hine, although the IHC has a discretion to use the money as it wishes. Hine’s parents regularly make gifts to help Hine with her living expenses. The gifts Hine receives from her parents would not be assessable income. They are made out of natural love and affection. The gifts Hine receives directly from the parents of the children she works with should be included as part of her assessable income in the income year she receives the gifts. The money paid by the parents to IHC is assessable income to the extent that the IHC actually passes the money on to Hine. Luke works as a volunteer in a youth counselling service provided by a church. Luke is motivated in his work by his Christian values and his desire to help young people in need. Luke receives gifts from the church and community groups and these gifts are his major source of financial support. Two of Luke’s personal friends regularly give Luke money because of their admiration and respect for what Luke is doing. Luke has also received a sum of money from an aunt to buy a car that he could not otherwise afford because of his low-paid work. Luke should include the gifts received from the church and community groups as part of his assessable income as the gifts are made in relation to Luke’s counselling activities. The gifts received from Luke’s friends are not assessable income. They are made as a personal gift out of affection, esteem or respect. The money received from his aunt is not assessable income. Again, it is a personal gift made out of love and affection. The fact that the gift is made in recognition of Luke’s low-paid work is only a secondary factor in the donor’s motives. Raju travels around New Zealand giving lectures at various environmental interest groups about environmental concerns and issues. Raju nearly always receives voluntary unsolicited gifts of money and other gifts from these groups after giving lectures in recognition of the important work he is doing. Raju does not give these lectures to earn money and receive other gifts, but is genuinely motivated by his concern for the environment and his desire to inform and motivate other people. Raju relies on the gifts to fund his day-to-day expenses. Sometimes Raju’s personal friends and family members attend these meetings and donate gifts. The gifts received from the general public are assessable income and Raju should include them as part of his assessable income. The gifts received from personal friends and family members are also part of Raju’s assessable income, assuming the gifts are primarily given in response to the service provided (i.e. the lecture) rather than because of the personal relationship. For his birthday, Raju receives from his sister a subscription to “New Zealand Green” magazine. This magazine focuses on the protection of New Zealand’s flora and fauna. Although the gift is related to Raju’s work in the environmental field, it is not assessable income. The gift is given purely for personal reasons out of personal love and affection.

It expands on the commentary in TIB Volume Two, No.2 (August 1990) on the then newly- passed legislation, and on the reminder in TIB Volume Five, No.11 (April 1994). When a taxpayer uses a motor vehicle for both business and private purposes (and only the business costs can be claimed as a deduction), the taxpayer must keep a logbook to determine the proportion of business use. However, instead of keeping complete records, a taxpayer can generally keep a logbook for a 90-day test period every three years. The proportion of business use calculated from the 90-day test period is used to appor- tion annual motor vehicle expenses for the remainder of the three year period. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1976. In 1990 the Tax Simplification Consultative Committee recommended a number of tax changes to reduce the compliance costs of business. One of these recommen- dations concerned the requirements for businesses to keep logbooks to determine the proportion of business use of motor vehicles. The Government accepted the recommendation, and enacted specific provisions governing deductions for motor vehicle expenses, which apply from the income year commencing 1 April 1991. The reason for keeping a logbook of motor vehicle use is to determine the proportion of business use when a vehicle is used for both business and private purposes. The deductibility of motor vehicle expenses and the requirements for keeping logbooks are governed by sections 106B to 106E. For income tax purposes it is not necessary for a taxpayer to keep a motor vehicle logbook in any of these situations: • if the taxpayer is a company • if the motor vehicle is used solely for business pur- poses • if the vehicle is used solely for a purpose that consti- tutes a fringe benefit • if the taxpayer’s only income is from salary and wages or other employee remuneration (so the taxpayer will not be entitled to any deduction for motor vehicle expenses). When the supply of a motor vehicle constitutes a fringe benefit, a record must be kept of days on which the vehicle is not available for use or has been used for an emergency call. When a taxpayer has to keep a logbook, he or she can keep it for a 90-day test period, rather than keeping complete records. The proportion of business use calculated from this test period can then be used to apportion annual motor vehicle expenses. This basis of apportionment can continue for the balance of the three year “logbook application period”. Logbook test period requirements A logbook kept for a test period must meet all of these conditions: • it must be kept for a period of not less than 90 days • it must show details of distance and reason for all business trips • it must record the total distance travelled by the vehicle in the test period • it must be kept for a period that is likely to represent the average business and private usage of the vehicle. Logbook application period The proportion of business use established from the logbook kept during the test period can be used for the logbook application period. The logbook application period is not to exceed three years, starting on the latest of these dates: • the first day of the income year in which the taxpayer starts to keep a logbook for the test period • the day on which the vehicle is purchased (unless the vehicle is a replacement vehicle that will be used similarly to the previous vehicle) • the day following of the last day of the preceding logbook application period • a day specified by the taxpayer. A logbook application period will end on the earliest of these dates: • the day on which the vehicle is sold or disposed of (unless it is being replaced with a vehicle that will be used similarly to the previous vehicle) • a day specified by the taxpayer • a day specified by the Commissioner • the day on which the three year period expires. Keeping a logbook for a vehicle used for both business and private purposes Summary Background Application 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.3 (September 1994) With the approval of the Commissioner, a taxpayer may maintain full records over a period when business use is not representative of the average, such as a temporary and unforeseen increase in business activity. The logbook application period should be brought to an early end on the last day of any month in which the business use percentage drops by 20 percent or more, thus making the logbook average no longer representa- tive of actual use. An example of such a situation is when business use drops from 50 percent (the percent- age that was calculated from the logbook test period) to 30 percent. However, if the change in use is of short duration or the taxpayer elects to keep full records for the abnormal period, the enforced ending will not apply. If the Commissioner considers that a logbook is no longer representative of the average business use of a vehicle, he may require another logbook to be kept for a new test period. Alternatively, the Commissioner may deem the taxpayer to have not maintained a logbook at all for the logbook application period. In this situation, the taxpayer will be limited to a maximum claim for business use of 25 percent of total use. When the Commissioner requires a new logbook to be kept, he can determine when the old logbook applica- tion period finished. The Commissioner can determine that the whole of the old logbook application period was invalid and should not apply at all. When a taxpayer has not kept a logbook or full records of the business use of a vehicle, deductions are re- stricted. The maximum proportion of vehicle expenses that can be claimed is limited to the lesser of 25 percent or the actual proportion of business use. If there are no records that can be used to establish actual business use, no deduction will be allowed. John starts business as a sole trader on 1 April 1994 and uses the secondhand car he bought on 13 Janu- ary 1994. He starts keeping a logbook for a test period on 4 April 1994. The test period establishes that the vehicle is used for business use for 60 percent of the total distance travelled. The business does well and John upgrades his car on 25 November 1994. The new car is to be used in exactly the same way as the old one. In early 1995 John realises that he is using his car a lot more for work purposes, so he decides to end the current business use apportionment on 4 February and start another logbook test period. This time the test period shows that the vehicle’s business use is 80 percent. The initial logbook application period will start on 1 April 1994, which is the beginning of the income year in which John started to keep a logbook for a test period and after the vehicle had been pur- chased. Although John changed cars on 25 Novem- ber 1994, the new vehicle was to be used in a similar manner to the old one so the logbook application period can continue. The initial logbook application period will end on 4 February 1995 because John specified this date. The second logbook application period will start on 5 February 1995 and (unless there is any other relevant change in circumstances) will end on 4 February 1998. To calculate the proportion of deductible motor vehicle expenses for the 1994/95 income year, a weighted average of the business use determined in both logbook application periods must be calculated. The calculation should be based on the number of days each logbook application period applied during the income year. The calculation is as follows: The International Finance Agreements Act 1961 provides income tax exemptions for designated officials and employees of several agencies of the United Nations and also the Asian Development Bank. This item discusses how these exemptions apply to New Zealand resident taxpayers. The International Finance Agreements Act 1961 provides for New Zealand’s membership of the follow- ing international bodies: • International Monetary Fund (IMF) • International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the World Bank) continued on page 12 Exceptions If no records are kept Example Tax exemptions for some United Nations and Asian Develo pment Bank salaries Introduction Background 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.3 (September 1994) Salaries and emoluments of officials or employees of the organisations are only exempt from income tax if the official or employee is not a local citizen, local subject or local national of New Zealand. If the person is not resident in New Zealand under the tests in section 241 of the Income Tax Act, he or she will not be subject to New Zealand tax on the salary or emoluments derived. If the person is not subject to New Zealand tax, the question of whether an exemption from New Zealand tax under section 61(50) and the Interna- tional Finance Agreements Act applies is irrelevant (PIB 180 (July 1989) sets out the Commissioner’s policy on residence). If a person is resident in New Zealand under section 241 but is not a local citizen, local subject or local national of New Zealand, the income that person derives from any of the United Nations organisations is exempt from tax in New Zealand. Section 242 of the Act provides that “Subject to this Act...all income derived by any person who is resident in New Zealand...shall be assessable for income tax...” Section 242 is subject to section 61(50). Therefore the exemption provided for by section 61(50) and the International Finance Agreements Act applies to salary and emoluments derived by a person who is not a local citizen, local subject or local national of New Zealand, even if the person is resident in New Zealand. Ms Walker is a New Zealand citizen and she has lived in New Zealand all her life. In July 1993 she travelled to the United States to take up employ- ment with the IMF. In December 1993, her assign- ment finished, she returned to New Zealand. The salary she earned while working in the United States is subject to New Zealand tax. She remained resident in New Zealand. The exemption under section 61(50) and the International Finance Agreements Act does not apply because she is a local citizen, local subject or local national of New Zealand. Mr Runner is a New Zealand citizen but has lived abroad for the last 15 years. He has not returned in that time and has no family here. From July to December 1993 he worked for the IMF in the United States on a temporary assignment. The salary he earned while working in the United States is not subject to New Zealand tax. He is not resident in New Zealand and so he is not subject to New Zealand tax on income earned outside New Zealand. The application of the exemption under section 61(50) and the International Finance Agreements Act is irrelevant. from page 11 • International Finance Corporation (IFC) • International Development Association (IDA) • Asian Development Bank. The first four organisations listed are specialised agencies of the United Nations. The International Finance Agreements Act makes certain articles of the constituting agreements of the organisations binding law in New Zealand. Included amongst these are income tax exemptions for certain officials and employees of the organisations. These exemptions are incorporated into the Income Tax Act 1976 by section 61(50) of that Act. Section 61(50) exempts income that is expressly exempted by any other Act. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1976 unless otherwise stated. The exemption articles contained in the articles of agreement of the IMF, the World Bank, the IFC and the IDA are identical in all substantive respects, and differ from the exemption article in the Asian Development Bank agreement. The following policy is therefore separated into ‘United Nations Agencies’ sourced income and ‘Asian Development Bank’ sourced income. The policy on the United Nations agencies applies only to the four organisations mentioned. United Nations Agencies The IMF, World Bank, IFC, and IDA are specialised agencies of the United Nations. Apart from differences in the terms used to refer to staff (for example; Executive Directors or Directors, officers or officials), the exemption article in each of the organisations’ agreements is worded as follows: No tax shall be levied on or in respect of salaries and emoluments paid by the Fund to Executive Direc- tors, Alternates, officers, or employees of the Fund who are not local citizens, local subjects, or other local nationals. The salaries and emoluments of the designated officials and employees of the organisations are exempt from income tax if the official or employee is not a local citizen, local subject or local national of the country seeking to impose tax on the salary or emoluments. On the other hand, if the official or employee is a local citizen, local subject or local national of the country seeking to impose tax, the salaries or emoluments will not be exempt from tax in that country. This means a local citizen, local subject or local na- tional of New Zealand who receives salary or emolu- ments from one of the United Nations organisations is not exempt from New Zealand tax on that income. Policy Example 1 Example 2 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.3 (September 1994) Ms Campbell is a Argentinian citizen. In August 1993 she came to New Zealand to work on a four month assignment for the World Bank. She has not been to New Zealand before. Ms Campbell’s salary is exempt from New Zealand tax. She is not a local citizen, local subject or local national of New Zealand and so the exemption applies. Mr Bramble, a Thai citizen, comes to New Zealand to work on an assignment for the IMF. He is in New Zealand for 12 months. Income Mr Bramble derives from the IMF is not subject to New Zealand tax. Although he is resident in New Zealand under section 241 of the Income Tax Act, he is not a local citizen, local subject or local national of New Zealand and so the exemption under section 61(50) and the International Finance Agreements Act applies. Asian Development Bank The tax exemption article in the Asian Development Bank agreement is different from the exemptions in the United Nations agencies agreements. The exemption is worded in the following way: No tax shall be levied on or in respect of salaries and emoluments paid by the Bank to Directors, Alter- nates, officers or employees of the Bank, except where a member deposits with its instrument of ratification or acceptance a declaration that such member retains for itself and its political subdivi- sions the right to tax salaries and emoluments paid by the Bank to citizens or nationals of such member. The salaries and emoluments of the various officials are exempt from tax except when the officials are citizens or nationals of a country that has reserved its right to tax its citizens or nationals. New Zealand has not reserved its right to tax New Zealand citizens and nationals. Salaries and emoluments derived by New Zealand residents are therefore exempt from New Zealand tax. Mrs Evans has lived in New Zealand for twenty years. In August 1993 she accepted a three month assignment with the Asian Development Bank in the Philippines. The salary she earned from her assignment is not subject to New Zealand tax. This item discusses the application of section 61(50) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Section 61(50) provides an exemption from income tax for: “Income expressly exempted from income tax by any other Act, to the extent of the exemption so provided”. A number of different statutes other than the Income Tax Act 1976 expressly exempt certain income from income tax. These are some examples of these exemp- tions: 1.Section 5(1) of the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act 1968 exempts the following people from income tax: •Heads of diplomatic missions, members of the staff of the mission who have diplomatic rank, and the members of their families who form part of their households. The exemption does not apply to family members who are New Zealand citizens. •Members of the administrative and technical staff of a diplomatic mission, together with members of their families who form part of their households, provided these members are neither New Zealand citizens nor permanently resident in New Zealand; (In both the above cases, the income tax exemp- tion applies only to mission employment income and income from sources outside New Zealand) •Service staff and private servants of members of the mission, providing these staff are neither New Zealand citizens nor permanently resident in New Zealand. The exemption applies only to mission employment income. 2.Section 4(1)(a) of the Consular Privileges and Immunities Act 1971 provides similar exemptions to those provided under the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act 1968 for consular officers, employ- ees and members of their families. Section 4(1)(a) also exempts the income received by honorary consular officers from the foreign government in respect of the exercise of consular functions. 3.Section 19(1)(b) of the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act 1968 provides for the exemption from income tax for these people: •A representative or officer of the Government of a foreign state or the representative’s or officer’s spouse or dependent child continued on page 14 Example 3 Example 4 Example 5 Exemption from income tax under another Act Introduction Application 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.3 (September 1994) engineers. The Asian Development Bank employed the firm to furnish engineering services. The Court decided that the remuneration received by the firm and, in turn, by the partners was exempt from income tax. Each partner was an expert performing services for the Bank in return for which the Bank paid an emolument. The exemption from income tax extends only to the person who receives the payment. In Walker v CIR (1988) 10 NZTC 5,094, the taxpayer was an econo- mist employed by a firm of accountants. The Asian Development Bank entered into an agreement with the firm so that the Bank could use the services of the taxpayer. The agreement provided for the Bank to pay a fee to the firm and for the firm to release the taxpayer to the Bank for a specified period. The taxpayer claimed a deduction for a portion of his salary representing the period of time his services were utilised by the Bank. The Court disallowed the deduction claim. The exemption from tax under section 61(50) extended only to the person who received the payment. In this case, the taxpayer received no payment from the Bank. 5.A number of governmental or quasi governmental bodies are exempt from tax, usually under their enabling statute. These include the following organisations: •Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Corporation •Broadcasting Standards Authority •Broadcasting Commission •Carter Observatory Board •Earthquake Commission •Export Guarantee Office •Film and Literature Classification Office •Hillary Commission for Sport, Fitness and Leisure •Historic Places Trust •Lotteries Commission •Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa Board •National Library Trustees •New Zealand Council for Educational Research •New Zealand Fire Commission •Pacific Islands Polynesian Education Foundation •Queen Elizabeth the Second Arts Council •Royal New Zealand Foundation for the Blind •Royal Society of New Zealand •Securities Commission •Standards Council •Testing Laboratory Registration Council •Te Taura Whiri I Te Reo Maori (Maori Language Commission) •A member of the representative’s or officer’s official or domestic staff and that staff member’s spouse and dependent children. This exemption does not apply if the staff member is a New Zealand citizen and not a citizen of the country concerned. Further, the exemption applies only if the staff member is resident in New Zealand solely for the purpose of performing his or her duties as a member of the staff. In effect, this provision gives all foreign public servants, parliamentarians, or other accredited representatives of another government who are visiting New Zealand the same exemption as that provided to long-term diplomatic mission staff. The exemption applies only to direct employees or members of overseas governments. It does not apply to: •School teachers on exchange in New Zealand; •Officers of an overseas government who are seconded to work for the New Zealand government (because the New Zealand Government pays their salary and expenses either directly or by reimbursing their overseas employer); •Employees of government-owned corpora- tions or government-sponsored or subsidised institutes. In each of the three above cases, a double tax agreement may exempt or partially exempt from income tax the income of the foreign visitor. 4.Certain international organisations are exempt from tax by either Order In Council under the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act 1968 or the Interna- tional Finance Agreements Act 1961. These organi- sations are: •Specialised agencies of the United Nations (namely the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Finance Corpora- tion and the International Development Associa- tion). •Asian Development Bank •Commonwealth Secretariat. Certain officials and employees of the above organi- sations are also exempt from taxation. The previous article in this TIB discusses the individuals that are exempt from taxation under section 61(50) when they receive payments from agencies of the United Nations or the Asian Development Bank. Emoluments received by private consultants or consulting partnerships from the above international organisations can be exempt from income tax. In Andrews v CIR; Muir v CIR (1979) 4 NZTC 61,443 the taxpayers were partners in a firm of consulting from page 13 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.3 (September 1994) This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked.

Section 56A allows a rebate for donations of $5 or more that are paid during the year to specified organisations. The maximum rebate is $500 or 33 1 / 3 cents in the dollar of the donations made, whichever is less. To claim the rebate the taxpayer must produce receipts, or be able to satisfy Inland Revenue that the payment has been made. The reason for making the donation is not a consideration. Therefore, provided the taxpayer has a receipt (or other proof of payment such as a letter of acknowledgement) the rebate may be claimed. A couple may split the donation between them, and claim half the rebate each, up to the maximum rebate. In these cases, only one receipt need be obtained. The receipt should be included with one return, and a note to that effect should be attached to the other return. As the Cancer Society of New Zealand (Inc.) is a qualifying organisation, subject to proof of payment, the rebate may be claimed. (Note: If you wish to check whether an organisation has been granted donee status for Inland Revenue purposes, contact your local Inland Revenue office.) Questions we've been asked Income Tax Act 1976 Rebate for donations ma de in lieu of sending funeral flowers 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.3 (September 1994) Section 108 - Annual depreciation deduction: The taxpayer is a private com- pany whose shareholder/directors are a married couple. The husband is em- ployed by the company. For some years the company had leased four motor vehicles for use in its business. The shareholder/husband then decided to pur- chase four motor vehicles and lease them (not under a specified lease) to the company at market rates. He has asked if, as a shareholder- employee, he can claim depreciation on the leased vehicles, and if he is considered to be in the business of leasing vehicles. Under section 108, a taxpayer must claim a deduction for depreciation on depreciable property owned during an income year. From the 1993-94 income year, the new depreciation rules (contained in sections 107A to 108O) apply. These rules are set out in TIB Volume Four, No.9 of May 1993. In this case, as the shareholder-employee incurred the depreciation expense as a result of leasing the motor vehicles to the company, the expense is deductible because the property owned is used in gaining or producing assessable income. Although the shareholder is an employee of the company, he is also in the business of leasing motor vehicles. Section 227(7) - Balance dates: A beneficiary of a trust has a 31 March balance date. The trust has a 30 September balance date. The beneficiary wishes to know in which income year to return beneficiary income derived from the trust. Under section 227(7), when a trust has a balance date other than 31 March, any income the trustees derive in a particular year that is also beneficiary income is deemed to be derived by the beneficiary in the same income year as that which corresponds to the balance date of the trustee. In this particular case, if the trust derived beneficiary income in the year ended 30 September 1993, the beneficiary should return that income in a return for the year ended 31 March 1993. Section 336N(1) - Definition of employee: A company representative advised that two years ago the company provided a low interest loan to a senior em- ployee. The loan agreement specified that the loan would run for three years, unless the employee left the company’s employ. In that event, the loan was to be repaid within six months of the termination of employment. The company has paid fringe benefit tax on the loan during the person’s employment, but queries whether FBT is payable for the remaining six months now that the employee has taken other employment. The FBT liability exists until the loan is repaid. The section 336N(1) definition of “employee” states: “employee.... means a person who will receive, receives, or has at any time received ...” Effectively, the former employee remains an employee for FBT purposes whilst in receipt of a continuing benefit. Depreciation deduction on shareholder-employee vehicles When beneficiary should re turn income when balance date different from trust Fringe benefit tax - low interest loan to employee who resigns 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.3 (September 1994) Section 336Z - Specified Superannuation Contribution Withholding Tax (SSCWT): An employer pays a fee to a company for the administration of super- annuation plans. He has asked if this fee should attract SSCWT and fringe benefit tax (FBT). A contribution that an employer makes to a superannuation fund for an employ- ee’s benefit is liable to a withholding tax (SSCWT) at a flat rate of 33 cents in the dollar. In this case the employer is not making a contribution to the fund itself, but rather, paying a fee to a company that administers the fund. The payment is not subject to either SSCWT or FBT. Section 6 - Meaning of term “Taxable Activity”: A partnership is considering the purchase of a homestead and 4 hectares of land that has recently been subdi- vided from a large sheep station. The partners intend to operate the property as a high quality homestay business, and have asked whether they are able to register for GST and claim an input tax credit on the purchase of the property. A taxable activity is defined in section 6 as: “Any activity that is carried on continuously or regularly by any person, whether or not for a pecuniary profit, and involves or is intended to involve, in whole or in part, the supply of goods and services to any other person for a consideration.” The operation of a homestay business would meet this definition. When goods and services are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, the input tax incurred can be reclaimed. In this example, the house has 6 bedrooms, 4 of which will be available for homestays. In addition there is a formal dining room, a formal lounge, library, billiards room and a large kitchen, all of which will be used as part of the homestay business. The outside facilities include a tennis court and swimming pool. The property has been acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, so the purchasers can claim a full input tax credit on the settlement figure, providing the tax invoice requirements are met. Section 20 - Calculation of tax: A GST registered person asked if he could claim, in his GST return, one-ninth of an amount of stamp duty paid when he recently purchased a business property. Stamp duty is defined in section 2 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 as: “includes conveyance duty and lease duty but does not include cheque duty or credit card transaction duty.” Stamp duty is a tax paid directly to the Crown, and is therefore not considera- tion for a supply. As there has been no supply of goods and services, GST will not be payable and no input tax credit may be claimed.

Judge Barber found that there was a tax avoidance ar- rangement and used section 99(3) to adjust each individual objector’s assessable income to include all of the company’s profits. The individual objectors sold their shares in the objector company to a company (“the purchaser”) that belonged to a group of companies with tax losses. The sale occurred in the following way: Legal decisions - case notes Contents Arrangement to avoid income tax Rating: Cases: Act: Keyword: Summary: Facts: 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.3 (September 1994) • The individual objectors advanced a sum equivalent to the purchase price to the purchaser. • The objector company regularly paid its net profits to the purchaser as an administration charge. • The purchaser repaid the loan of the purchase price to the individual objectors out of this charge. • The purchasers offset the administration charge income against the group’s accumulated losses to reduce tax. • The individual objectors treated the loan payments as non-taxable capital receipts. • The individual objectors continued to manage the objector company and had a right to repurchase the objector company’s assets at a nominal value. The objector company claimed a deduction for a consulting fee paid to the purchaser. The consulting services provided related in part to advice about the operation of the sale and purchase scheme and in part to other general commer- cial advice. The primary purpose of the arrangement was to reduce or avoid the tax liability of the objectors. The individual objectors’ purpose was to sell their shares in the objector company for an inflated price and obtain that price from company profits that had been laundered from revenue into capital. The arrangement was always void for tax purposes under section 99 of the Income Tax Act. Judge Barber used section 99(3) to reconstruct the individual objectors’ assess- able income to include the administration charge (including the share of the charge which was kept by the purchaser) in order to counteract any tax advan- tage obtained under the arrangement. The adjustment reflected what the indi- vidual objectors were likely to have received if they had not entered the arrange- ment. The objector company could only deduct the consulting fee that it paid to the purchaser to the extent that the consultation services related to the provision of general commercial advice and did not relate to the tax avoidance scheme. The assessments were not statute barred under section 25 of the Income Tax Act because the objectors had omitted income from a particular source from their returns. The “loan repayments” were always income because the arrangement was void from the beginning. The objectors challenged the assessment process on the grounds of unfairness. Judge Barber said that, although the TRA does not have the judicial review powers of the High Court, administrative law type issues are relevant when determining whether an assessment is incorrect. There was no evidence of unfairness in this case and the objection under this head was dismissed under section 39 of the Inland Revenue Department Act as frivolous and vexatious. The purchaser alleged that certain evidence from an interview was not admissi- ble in accordance with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Judge Barber found that, in this case, the Act did not exclude the evidence. The taxpayer will be appealing this decision. Decision: Comment: 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.3 (September 1994) ••• TRA No 93/115 Income Tax Act 1976 - Section 336B (now section 336D) GRI, surcharge, other income, specified foreign social security pension, superannuation A New Zealand resident who receives a United Kingdom pension is effectively in exactly the same position as a New Zealand superannuitant. The foreign pension cannot be deducted twice under the formula for calculating “other income”. The taxpayer received a United Kingdom pension of $2,032.16, as well as New Zealand superannuation (known then as guaranteed retirement income) of $6,779.24. When added, the two pensions equalled the full New Zealand super- annuation rate ($8,811.40), that any superannuitant in the taxpayer’s circum- stances received. A superannuitant pays a surcharge on the amount by which other income ex- ceeds the specified exemption. Section 336D (previously section 336B) defines “other income” as the amount calculated by the formula, a - b - c, where: a Is the amount of taxable income of the New Zealand superannuitant in respect of the income year, together with one-half of any amount received in the form of a pension from a superannuation fund or any annuity to which section 61(59) of this Act applies, which amount is not otherwise included in the taxable income of the New Zealand superannuitant; and b Is the gross New Zealand superannuation that the New Zealand superannuitant received in the income year; and c Is the amount of any specified foreign social security pension, or as the case may be, the sum of the amounts of every specified foreign social security pension received by the New Zealand superannuitant in the income year. The taxpayer contended that the deduction at “b” was the gross New Zealand superannuation of $8,811.40, and the deduction at “c” was the UK pension of $2,032.16. The Commissioner submitted that the objector, by deducting her UK pension twice, is claiming an advantage over other taxpayers. The Commissioner main- tained that “b” is the New Zealand superannuation only. That is, the sum of $6,779.24 that the New Zealand government contributes, to bring the total pen- sion up to the same amount as other New Zealand superannuitants. The amount at “c” is the UK pension. The TRA found that the gross New Zealand superannuation payable reduces by the amount of the UK pension. In effect, “b” of the formula consists of the reduced New Zealand superannua- tion of $6,779.24. The UK pension ($2,032.16) is deducted as “c”, and cannot also be deducted as “b”. This places recipients of the UK pension in the same position as other New Zealand pensioners, and avoids unfairness. The legislature could not have intended any unfairness or injustice. The taxpayer will not be appealing this decision.

A GST registered taxpayer claimed a secondhand goods input tax credit on the purchase of a farm from a family trust that was not registered for GST. The Commissioner disallowed the input tax credit. He then concluded that the trust should have been registered for GST as the value of the taxable supplies made from leasing the farm before the sale exceeded the GST registration threshold. The Commissioner included rates and accounting fees as well as the rent paid by the tenant as part of the consideration in valuing the taxable supplies. The tax- payer and the trust objected because in their view the consideration should have only included the rent. This would have meant that the value of the supplies made by the trust would have fallen below the GST registration threshold. The main issue was whether the payment of rates by a tenant is “consideration” for a taxable supply. The TRA also had to consider whether accounting fees formed part of that consideration. The TRA stated that it was sufficient if the consideration is in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the sup- ply. The consideration does not have to pass to the supplier. In addition, when a tenant agrees to pay other charges as well as the rent, those charges and the rent are the consideration for GST purposes. On the facts, the TRA found that there was a strong connection between the payment of rates by the tenant and the supply by the trust of the lease. There was no such connection in relation to the accounting fees. The TRA concluded that the consideration should include rates as well as the rent in valuing the taxable supplies provided by the trust. Therefore, the trust was liable to be GST registered as the value of the taxable supplies exceeded the GST registration threshold. Part of the lease supply was exempt due to the supply of a farm dwellinghouse. However, the TRA held that the apportionment for such an exemption would not bring rent plus rates below the registration threshold. The TRA stated that once a person satisfies the test for GST registration that person becomes liable to be registered and is deemed to be registered. When the trust sold the farm it was deemed a registered person. Consequently, the trust must return output tax on the sale of the farm and the purchaser can claim an input tax credit. The taxpayer is appealing this decision.

The issue was whether that expenditure was deductible under the second pro- viso to section 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976 or whether the work constituted reconstruction beyond the ambit of that section. The High Court found that the expenditure came within the second proviso and therefore was deductible. In 1982 Mr Sherlaw (the objector) and some friends purchased a boatshed. Ultimately the objector became the sole owner of the boatshed, after paying approximately $20,000 to secure ownership. Expenditure was required to repair and protect the piles which had deteriorated over the years. In 1985 the objector commenced the business of commercial crab fishing and boat hire from the premises. In 1987 he took advice as to the best method of repairing the piles to the building and strengthening the floor. The advice the objector received was that it was preferable to repile the building with a lesser number of piles than to endeavour to repair the existing piles. As a result the contract was let to repile the building and work was started in 1988. The contractor involved decided that the only practical way of placing the piles was to take sheets of iron off the roof and then place the piles by crane. In 1988 the objector took advice about the roof. As a result a substantial part of the roof structure had to be replaced because it could not be repaired. Part of the roof was slightly higher than before because of the relocation of the floor at a slightly higher level after the new piles were installed. Because the extent of the work that had to be carried out was more than the objector first envisaged, he decided to attend to all deferred maintenance matters at the time. He accepted that a certain amount of this work constituted capital improvement to the boatshed and this was not in dispute. The original cost of repiling and strengthening the floor was $27,250.22 and the ultimate cost of the work overall was $41,100. The objector attributed $34,449 of this total to repairs and maintenance. There was evidence that before work started on the boatshed its value was approximately $22,000, and that after the work its value was $28,700. The objector submitted that the work had to be carried out so that the boatshed remained and he was able to carry on business from it. He submitted that the case was entirely different from cases where there has been a renewal of premises with reconstruction of substantially the whole subject matter under construction. He accepted that as a result of the repiling of the building some reconstruction was necessary. However, he did not accept that there was a renewal of the building. He considered it to be solely a matter of necessary repair either arising from the original condition of the building or as a conse- quence of the repiling operation. The Commissioner submitted that the case was one which came close to com- plete reconstruction of the premises. The Commissioner also submitted that the objector chose to improve the asset rather than repair it. The scale of the work done in proportion to the asset was disproportionate enough to indicate that the Expenditure on repiling a boatshed - whether deductible under the second proviso to section 108 Rating: Case: Act: Keywords: Summary: Facts: 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.3 (September 1994) work done was of a capital nature rather than a revenue nature. The Commis- sioner relied on the cases Auckland Trotting Club (Inc) v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1968) NZLR 967 and Colonial Motor Company Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1994) 16 NZTC, 11,060. Justice Doogue decided that the expenditure incurred by the objector did fall within the second proviso to section 108 of the Act and was therefore deductible. He distinguished Auckland Trotting Club on the basis that in that case the trotting track had to be reconstructed because the original construction was entirely unsatisfactory and dangerous. In this case the building’s piles gradually deterio- rated, and needed to be replaced. Replacing the piles resulted in other work becoming essential. Justice Doogue considered that Colonial Motor Company was concerned with the transformation of an unsound warehouse into a sound commercial building. This was far removed from this case, in which the boatshed retained much the same layout and size as previously. Justice Doogue noted that the Commissioner did not seek to categorise any of the work additional to the original piling and floor work as capital work unless the whole work was so treated. He noted that certain aspects of the alterations may have been capital in nature but that he was not asked to make a ruling of that kind. Inland Revenue is not appealing this decision. •••• CIR v Soma President Textiles Limited AP 152/93 CIR v New Zealand Knitting Mills Limited AP 153/93 Income Tax Act 1976, section 65(2)(a) Derivation of income, loss of profits insurance, timing of assessment of payments based on estimated liability This was an appeal to the High Court by the Commissioner from Case P85 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,564. In that case the Taxation Review Authority held that all pay- ments received under business interruption insurance were assessable in the income year of final settlement. On appeal, the High Court held that interim payments based on reliable estimates, that were unlikely to be refunded, should be assessed on a receipts basis. The taxpayers operated a manufacturing business and owned associated ware- house, factory and office premises. During the material time both taxpayers were insured under a business interruption insurance policy. The policy gave specified indemnity against loss of profits arising from interruption of business caused by damage to certain identified buildings. The cover was for a period of 15 months from the time of damage. On 9 February 1988 a fire damaged a warehouse owned by one of the taxpayers. This resulted in a major loss of stock and affected production capacity. At the time of the fire the taxpayers were planning a move to joint premises in Hast- ings. On 24 November 1988 there was a second fire at the new Hastings premises, again causing severe destruction and interruption of business. The insurer accepted liability for both claims made for loss of profits. However, due to the complex circumstances surrounding the claims and the terms of the policy, the insurer could not immediately determine the amount due. During the period February to October 1989 the insurer made a number of interim liability payments on a without prejudice basis and subject to refund in continued on page 24 Decision: Comment: Timing of assessability of business interruption insurance payments Ra ting: Cases: Act: Keywords: Summary: Facts: 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.3 (September 1994) the event of overpayment. The parties settled the amount of the claims for both fires in November 1990. The insurer made two final payments in December. The parties reached settlement through negotiation and not by any strict application of the formula laid down in the policy. The sums agreed therefore were not calculable or foreseeable before the final settlement. Both taxpayers returned the various insurance payments on a receipts basis. However, the Commissioner assessed the taxpayers on the basis that they should spread the total of the sums received for each fire evenly over each of the respective 15 month indemnity periods. The taxpayers objected to that assessment. The Taxation Review Authority reached a different result than that argued for by either of the parties. It held that the taxpayers should be assessed for the insurance payments in the year the claims were finally settled as it was impossi- ble for the taxpayers to accurately quantify the amount due under the policy until final settlement. The Commissioner appealed the decision, arguing that at the very least the income should be recognised at the time of receipt. The tax- payers argued for the position as determined by the Taxation Review Authority. The High Court held that income from a debt due is not derived until the amount due is accurately quantified. However, when there are reliable estimates and interim payments are made within those estimates, and a refund is highly unlikely, those payments are derived at the time of receipt. In these circum- stances, as a matter of commercial reality, any theoretical liability to repay did not deprive the interim receipts of their income character at the time of receipt. The High Court did not discount the possibility that in certain circumstances it might be appropriate to assess interim payments on an accruals basis, as origi- nally contended by the Commissioner. It considered that an accrual treatment may be justified when reliable estimates have been made and there is a commer- cial likelihood that a final payment will be made within the income year in terms of those estimates. We do not know whether the taxpayers will be appealing this decision. from page 23 In the next few months we’ll be releasing policy statements on these topics in the Tax Information Bulletin: •Spreading of authors’ income for income tax purposes •Payments made by instalments - accounting for GST on a payments basis •Ceasing to satisfy the conditions for using the payments basis when accounting for GST •GST and sales made under the Door to Door Sales Act 1967 •When Inland Revenue can grant relief from payment of tax in cases of financial hardship •Treatment of dividend imputation credits and dividend withholding payment credits in the hands of trustees and beneficiaries •GST and secondhand goods •Meaning of terms “own” and “acquired” for depreciation purposes •Personal sickness and accident and loss of earnings insurance policies •Tax status of bodies corporate We’ll publish these statements as soon as we’ve finished consulting with commentators outside Inland Revenue.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.4 (October 1994) Deducting sponsorship as advertising expenditure Summary This item states the Commissionerís current policy on the deductibility of sponsorship funds as advertising expenses. If a business cannot deduct expenditure in the form of sponsorship as a gift, it may be deductible as advertising expenditure under section 104 of the Income Tax Act 1976 (the general deductibility section). However, to be covered by this section there must be a sufficient relationship between the expenditure and gaining or producing assessable income. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1976. Direct quotations from this Act are printed in smaller type. Background A business may choose to sponsor an event or organisa- tion. In some situations the amount may be a gift, but sometimes sponsorship promotes the business and its products, so it may be advertising. This item discusses when amounts paid for sponsorship are deductible as advertising expenditure. Legislation Deduction Section 104 is the general deductibility section. It states: In calculating the assessable income of any taxpayer, any expenditure or loss to the extent to which it - (a) Is incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year; or (b) Is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year- may, except as otherwise provided in this Act, be deducted from the total income derived by the taxpayer in the income year in which the expenditure or loss is incurred. Under section 106(1)(j) any expenditure or loss is not deductible to the extent that it is of a private or domestic nature. Rebate for donations Section 56A(2) allows income tax rebates for gifts made by individuals. These rebates are limited to gifts made to the general and specific societies, institutions, associations, organisations, trusts or funds listed in section 56A(2). The rebate equals one third of the total amount of all allowable gifts and school fees, limited to $500. Section 147 allows companies to claim a deduction for donations to specified organisations, subject to certain monetary limits. This section applies to companies which are not close companies. Under section 147(2) the deduction is limited to gifts to the societies, institutions, organisations, trusts or funds listed in section 56A(2). The amount of the deduction for all gifts made in the income year to any one donee cannot exceed the greater of one percent of the comp- anyís assessable income, or $4,000. The maximum deduction available for the income year is the greater of $1,000 or five percent of the companyís assessable income. Policy Sponsorship of a third party Businesses may want to sponsor an event or third party which does not fall within the donation criteria in section 56A or 147. Such expenditure may be deductible as advertising expenditure under section 104. The Commissioner will only accept that sponsorship expenditure is deductible if the payment is in fact bona fide advertising expenditure in nature. To determine this, the Commissioner requires: ï a written contract providing that the payment is for advertising. ï that the sponsorship be for a minimum amount of $100. (This threshold is an administrative rule, not a legislative requirement.) ï adequate advertising. The existence of adequate advertising will depend on the particular factual situation. Usually, it would involve the publication of the taxpayerís name, product, and contact details. The advertising must include exposure in one or more of the usual advertising media (newspapers, pamphlets, brochures, television, radio). A simple acknowledg- ment alone would not generally constitute the provi- sion of adequate advertising. ï if the advertising is through pamphlets or brochures, a reasonable distribution of the pamphlets or brochures. Whether or not distribution is reasonable will depend on the facts of each case. Relevant factors may include the number of pamphlets or brochures distributed, the frequency of distribution and the size of the advertis- ing area. Sponsorship of own business Sometimes businesses may choose to enter events themselves in order to advertise the business and the products or services that they offer. Section 106(1)(j) disallows a deduction for any expendi- ture that is of a private or personal nature. Therefore, when considering these deductions, the Commissioner must be satisfied that the expense is on advertising and not private expenditure on a recreational pastime. In Case P16 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,107 the taxpayer was a courier company that raced Group A cars which had the continued on page 2 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.4 (October 1994) ï The decision to enter car racing was inherently logical from a business point of view. ï The campaign was successful. This was not to say that advertising must have good results to be deductible, but if the results are good then this is an important factor in favour of the expenditure being advertising expenditure. (A full commentary on Case P16 is contained in TIB Volume Four, No.7.) The result of this case is unusual in that only one purpose (business) was recognised. When an asset has two purposes, one business and one private, the Com- missioner will continue to apportion the expenditure. When considering deductions for advertising expendi- ture, each situation will be considered on its facts. The Commissioner must be satisfied that there is a sufficient connection with the income earning process of the business, and that the expenditure is not of a private or domestic nature. GST and door to door sales Introduction This item summarises the legislation relating to GST and credit arrangements under the Door to Door Sales Act 1967. Summary Sales of goods and services by door to door salespersons are subject to the provisions of the Door to Door Sales Act 1967. This Act allows a person who purchases goods and services on credit from a door to door salesperson to cancel the transaction within a certain period. The GST Act 1985 (the ìGST Actî) provides a special time of supply rule for door to door sales. This rule recognises that the sale is not confirmed until the expiry of the cancellation period. Legislation When a door to door sale is made, section 5(4) provides that no supply occurs for GST purposes until the purchaserís right of cancellation, allowed under sec- tion†7 of the Door to Door Sales Act, has expired. Section 7(1) of the Door to Door Sales Act allows a purchaser a seven-day cancellation period when the sale has been subject to a written agreement recording certain details. The written agreement must include all of these things: ï a statement advising the purchaserís right to cancel ï the vendorís name and address ï the total cost of credit ï the finance rate and payment details. When there is no written agreement, section 7(3) of that Act allows the purchaser a one-month cancellation period. Section 9 of the GST Act determines the time of supply rules for GST purposes. Section 9(1) provides the general rule and subsections (2) to (7) of section 9 provide specific rules for certain types of supply. It is important to note that these specific rules set the time of supply regardless of whether a supplier or recipient is accounting for GST on an invoice, payments or hybrid basis. Section 9(2)(b) deems a door to door sale to take place on the day after the purchaserís right of cancella- tion expires. Example Door to Door Rugs Ltd sells three rugs to John Smith on 30 June 1994. Door to Door Rugs Ltd accounts for GST on a six-monthly basis, and 30†June 1994 is the last day of its current taxable period. The sale is subject to a written agreement which means that John Smith has seven days to cancel the sale. On the 8 July 1994 John has not cancelled the sale. Door to Door Rugs Ltd must account for GST in the taxable period ending on 31 December 1994. from page 2 companyís logo on them. The taxpayer chose this method of advertising because it believed this would be an ideal way to promote the companyís courier service as the business would be associated with speed and efficiency. Another factor in the decision to use car racing was that one of the major shareholders had an interest in the sport, but he was not involved in the sport at the time. The Court found that the shareholderís interest in motor racing was not the major or dominant factor in the decision. The Court stated that the issue in these cases is whether the expenditure is bona fide advertising expenditure in character, or is wholly or partly expendi- ture in the pursuance of a recreational pastime. If there are two factors, i.e. business and private, it is necessary to determine which is the dominant one and to appor- tion the expenditure if necessary. In this case the Court found that the expenditure was business and not private expenditure. In reaching its decision the Court consid- ered several factors: ï The employer hosted clients and customers (both current and potential) at the event and encouraged them to meet the team. 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.4 (October 1994) Spreading of authors’ income for tax purposes Summary This item sets out the how the legislation on spreading professional authorsí income for tax purposes applies. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1976. Background Section 84 applies when a taxpayer creates a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, and grants or assigns his or her interest in the copyright. Section 84 allows income derived from any grant or assignment to be spread over more than one year. Legislation Section 84(2) provides for the spreading of income where certain criteria are met. These criteria are: (a) A taxpayer, being an author of a literary, dramatic, musical, or artistic work, assigns the copyright therein wholly or partially, or grants any interest in the copyright by licence; and (b) The taxpayer was engaged on the making of the work for a period of more than 12 months. Lump sums Section 84(3) is the first spreading provision for lump sum payments received for assigning or granting an interest in copyright, including an advance on royalties. If an author applies in writing within six years of the end of an income year in which he or she receives a lump sum, the Commissioner may apportion the amount of the payment equally between the year in which the author receives it and: ï the income year immediately preceding that income year (if the work took less than 24 months) ï the two income years immediately preceding that income year (if the time to create the work exceeded 24 months). Other payments Section 84(4) also allows income to be spread when the taxpayer receives payments (other than lump sums) for assigning or granting an interest in copyright within two years of the first publication of the work. To spread such income, the taxpayer must apply in writing to the Commissioner within eight years of the first publica- tion. The Commissioner may then apportion the income equally between the year of receipt and the immediately preceding year. Section 84(6) provides for a spread similar to that for other payments, when authors arrange publication of their own work. Application Authors of literary, dramatic, musical, or artistic works that have taken over 12 months to create may spread income from payments for the whole or partial assign- ment of copyright, or the granting of any interest in the copyright by licence. The author can deduct expenses incurred in writing a book or other work from the total income in the year in which he or she incurs that expenditure. Any income that is spread must still be included in the income year in which it was actually derived, when determining assessable income for Family Support purposes. In applying section 84, the Commissioner has the power to amend any assessment of a taxpayer at any time. Example Elspeth S. Cribbler is a professional author. She was commissioned, on a royalty basis, to write a book exploring the recurring use of the bunny motif in childrenís books. This took three years, and involved the purchase of many childrenís books and travel to Beatrix Potterís birthplace, to undertake research. Elspeth incurred these costs solely to enable her to write the book. These costs are deductible in the year they were incurred. The book - ìHot Cross Bunnies - Lost in the Saharaî - was finally published in January of 1991 and became a runaway best-seller. In February 1991, Elspeth entered and won the Bug Bunny Book of the Year Award, worth $100,000. In the income year ending 31 March 1991, she had also received advance royalties of $43,000. Included in Elspethís income for 1991 were: Book Award $100,000 - (Not able to be appor- tioned, as not consideration for grant or assign- ment of interest in copyright. Taxable as a receipt from the practice of the authorís profes- sion, vocation or business) Royalties $14,333 - ($43,000 spread over three years, as a lump sum for work over 24 months) In the income year ending 31 March 1994, Elspeth sold the film rights for $250,000, and received royalties of $10,000. Her assessable income for the income year ending 31 March 1994 included: Film rights $83,333 - ($250,000 apportioned over three years, as this is a lump sum for work over 24 months) Royalties $10,000 - (Amount received that year - now over two years since first publication of work) 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.4 (October 1994) Ceasing to satisfy the conditions for accounting for GST on payments basis Introduction This item sets out how the legislation applies when a GST registered person who is using the payments basis for GST ceases to satisfy the conditions for using that basis. Background When a registered person no longer satisfies the re- quirements for using the payments basis, the Commis- sioner must direct the registered person to adopt an alternative accounting basis. All legislative references in this item are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Direct quotations from this Act are printed in smaller type. Legislation Section 19A(1) sets out the conditions for accounting for GST on a payments basis. It states that: The Commissioner shall not direct any registered person to account for tax payable on a payments basis under section†19 of this Act unless - (a) The registered person is - (i) A public authority that is appropriated public money otherwise than pursuant to Mode B or Mode C within the meaning of the Public Finance Act 1989; or (ii) A local authority; or (iii)A non-profit body; or (b) In respect of the registered person - (i) At the end of any month, the total value of the personís taxable supplies in the period of 12 months then ending has not exceeded $1,000,000 (or such greater amount as the Governor-General may, from time to time, by Order in Council declare); or (ii) In the period of 12 months beginning on the first day of any month, the total value of the personís taxable supplies is not likely to exceed the amount specified in or under subparagraph (i) of this paragraph; or (c) The Commissioner is satisfied that, due to the nature, volume, and value of taxable supplies made by the registered person and the nature of the accounting system employed by the person, it would be appropriate for the person to furnish returns under this Act on a payments basis. Section 19A(2) states: Where the Commissioner is satisfied (whether by a notifica- tion given by the person under section 53 (cb) of this Act or otherwise) that a registered person who has been directed to account for tax payable on a payments basis has ceased to satisfy the conditions set out in paragraphs (a) to (c) of subsection (1) of this section, the Commissioner shall either- (a) Direct that the registered person account for tax payable on an invoice basis; or (b) If the registered person so requests in writing, direct that the registered person account for tax payable on a hybrid basis. However, under section 19A(3) a registered person will not have to change from the payments basis of account- ing for GST if his or her taxable supplies exceed (or will exceed) $1,000,000 solely because of one of these reasons: ï The person ceased to carry out any taxable activity, or made a substantial and permanent reduction in the size or scale of the taxable activity. ï The person replaced any plant or capital asset used in the taxable activity. Application The Commissioner has no discretion in this matter. When the registered person fails to satisfy the condi- tions, the Commissioner must direct that person to adopt an alternative basis for accounting. Under section 19(4), once the Commissioner has directed a registered person to change the basis of accounting, the change is effective from one of these dates: ï the start of the taxable period immediately following the taxable period in which the direction is given ï the date the person registered for GST, if the Com- missioner gives the direction before the end of the first taxable period following registration ï the start of any other period that the Commissioner considers equitable, if the Commissioner and the person agree. Under section 53(1)(cb), once a GST registered person no longer satisfies the conditions for the payments basis, he or she must give the Commissioner written notice within 21 days. GST registered persons commit an offence under section 62(1)(b) if they do not notify the Commissioner when they cease to satisfy the conditions of section 19A. Section 62(2) provides for a fine of up to $2,000 on the first occasion on which a person is convicted for such an offence or offences, $4,000 on the second occasion, and $6,000 on subsequent occasions. Example Jane and John own a small supermarket in the suburbs. For a number of years their annual sales remained about $520,000. They have always used the payments basis of accounting for GST. 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.4 (October 1994) Recently, a local builder developed a new subdivi- sion in their area, and business boomed. Monthly sales have jumped to around $95,000. The business no longer automatically satisfies the conditions for using the payments basis of accounting, as the total value of taxable supplies is likely to exceed $1,000,000 in the next 12 months. Jane and John are required to notify the Commis- sioner of this in writing within 21 days. They may apply to the Commissioner to continue to use the payments basis. Tax treatment of bodies corporate which are constituted under the Unit Titles Act 1972 Summary This item states the Commissionerís policy on the tax treatment of bodies corporate which are constituted under the Unit Titles Act 1972. It confirms that these bodies corporate are companies, and taxed as mutual associations for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1976. Background In the early 1970s the development of multi-unit buildings on single lots of land became more common. The flat-ownership schemes which existed were not satisfactory because the Land Transfer Act 1952 was unable to give title to each flat owner because titles were typically issued for individual lots of land. The Unit Titles Act 1972 was passed to provide a more secure and suitable method of developing multi-unit buildings. Instead of having only one title for the land and the units that are on it, the Unit Titles Act provides for the subdivision of land into units. The proprietors own the units individually and own the common property as tenants in common. The proprietors of the units also become the body corporate. There is some confusion over how bodies corporate and their income are to be treated for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. This item clarifies the tax status of bodies corporate, and the tax treatment of subscriptions and levies that they receive. Legislation Income Tax Act 1976 Section 2 defines ìcompanyî as: any body corporate or other entity which has a legal personality or existence distinct from those of its members, whether that body corporate or other entity is incorporated or created in New Zealand or elsewhere; and includes anything deemed to be a company for the purposes of this Act by any provision of this Act; but does not include a Maori authority. Under section 61(34), income derived by any association which is not carried on for the purposes of profit or gain and which is prohibited from making any distribution to any proprietor is exempt from tax. This exemption is limited in any income year to $1,000 of the aggregate of that income. Section 199(2) states: Where in any income year an association enters into transactions with its members, or with its members and other persons, any profit or surplus arising in that income year from those transactions which would be included in the profits or gains of the association if the transactions were not of a mutual character shall be deemed to be profits or gains arising from those transactions and, subject to the deduction allowed under subsection (3) of this section, to be assessable income of the association derived in that income year (such an association being referred to in this section as an association to which this section applies). Section 199(3) allows a rebate to the association of the lesser of the amount of rebates paid to the members or the amount of profits attributable to member transactions. Section 199(10)(d) states: Every reference in this section to transactions as being transactions of an association with its members or transactions of members of a association with the association and as being, in either case, transactions that are taken into account in calculating the assessable income of the association shall be taken as a reference to transactions of any one or more of the following classes, namely: ... (d) The supply of services by the association to a member of the association: Unit Titles Act 1972 Section 12(1) states that the registered proprietors of the land to which a unit plan relates shall become a body corporate. Section 15(3) states: The body corporate may, pursuant to a resolution of the proprietors, distribute any money or personal property in its possession and surplus to its current requirements among the proprietors for the time being according to their unit entitlements. continued on page 6 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.4 (October 1994) by section 199. Any profit or surplus which arises from this type of transaction is assessable under section 199(2). However, a deduction is allowed to the body corporate of the lesser of the amount of rebates paid to the members or the amount of profits attributable to member transactions. There is a common misconception that amounts received by bodies corporate are not assessable as income because bodies corporate are non-profit organisations and therefore, any income less than $1,000 is exempt under section 61(34) of the Income Tax Act. Section†61(34) only applies to bodies that are prohibited from making any distributions to any propri- etor, member, or shareholder. Bodies corporate are permitted by section†15(3) of the Unit Titles Act to distribute money and personal property to the proprie- tors. Therefore a body corporateís income is not exempt under this section. Example At 1 April 1993 a body corporate has $15,600. Between 1 April 1993 and 31 March 1994 the body corporate receives and spends the following amounts: Receipts Subscriptions and levies - general$10,000 Subscriptions and levies - specific$10,000 Interest$ 900 Expenses Providing specific services to proprietors$10,000 Of the amounts received for the 1993/1994 year: ï Interest of $900 is assessable. The bank will have deducted resident withholding tax which can be credited against the tax payable on the interest. ï The specific subscriptions and levies of $10,000 are not assessable because $10,000 was fully used to provide specific services during the year. No profit arose so there is no tax to pay under section†199. ï The remaining $10,000 was set aside with the other $15,600 to provide for general services in the future. It is not assessable under the common law mutuality principle. Payments made by instalments - accounting for GST on payments basis Introduction This item sets out how the special time of supply rules apply to payments by instalments, periodic payments, and hire purchase payments. All legislative references in this item are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. Direct quotations from this Act are printed in smaller type. Policy Whether bodies corporate are companies The Commissioner considers that bodies corporate under the Unit Titles Act fall within the definition of a company in the Income Tax Act. The reason for this is that the definition of company for income tax purposes is deliberately wide and is intended to cover many types of entity. A body corporate under the Unit Titles Act is an entity with a separate legal status, and it falls within the wide definition of company in the Income Tax Act. Assessability of subscriptions and levies Most body corporate income comes from subscriptions and levies which the body corporate uses for mainte- nance, repairs, management, and other outgoings on the building. The body corporate levies proprietors to cover existing expenses and also to cover future expenses. Generally, the amount of money levied will be the amount that the body corporate believes is necessary to cover expenses. Because amounts are levied for future expenses, the body corporate holds them until it needs them, so the money may be invested to produce investment income. The Commissioner considers that bodies corporate are mutual associations. As such they are subject either to section 199 of the Income Tax Act or, if that section does not apply, to the common law mutuality principle. (This principle was discussed in TIB Volume Four, No.8 (April 1993)). Profits from the supply of services by a mutual associa- tion to its members are assessable income under section 199. Case 32 (1978) 2 TRNZ 603; 3†NZTC 60,312 discusses the type of transaction with association members that falls within section 199. It holds that levies which are paid in return for general services for the mutual benefit of members are not member transac- tions under the section. These amounts are covered by the common law principle of mutuality, and are not assessable. The Commissioner considers that Case 32 applies to the particular situation where a body corporate levies its proprietors for general amounts for expenses for the current year or following years. These amounts are not subject to section 199, and are not assessable. If the body corporate levies proprietors during the year to pay for a specific service these amounts are covered from page 5 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.4 (October 1994) Background There has been some confusion about how the time of supply rules apply to registered persons who account for GST on instalment payments using the payments basis. Legislation Section 9(1) provides that, for the purposes of the Act: a supply of goods and services shall be deemed to take place at the earlier of the time an invoice is issued by the supplier or the recipient or the time any payment is received by the supplier, in respect of that supply. This is the usual time of supply rule. The Act also provides different rules in certain situations. These rules take priority over the usual time of supply rules. Sections 9(2) and (3) contain the special time of supply rules. Section 9(3) deems when a supply takes place in situations where payments are made by instalments, periodically, or under a hire purchase agreement. In summary, it provides that: ï When goods are supplied under an agreement to hire, or services are supplied under a periodic payment agreement or enactment, for each successive supply the time of supply is the earlier of when a payment is either due or received. ï When goods are supplied progressively or periodically under an agreement or enactment under which payment for the goods is due in instalments or periodically, the time of supply is the earliest of when each payment falls due, when the payment is received, or when an invoice is issued for the progress payment. ï When goods are supplied for a building or engineer- ing work under an agreement or enactment under which payment for the goods is due and payable in instalments or periodically in relation to the progres- sive nature of that building or engineering work, the time of supply is the earliest of when each payment falls due, when the payment is received, or when an invoice is issued for the progress payment. ï When goods are supplied under a hire purchase agreement (as defined by the Hire Purchase Act 1971) section 9(3)(b) of the Goods and Services Tax Act states that the time of supply is the time the parties enter into the agreement. Under the Hire Purchase Act 1971, a ìhire purchase agreementî means: ï an agreement by which the supplier lets or hires goods with an option to purchase; and ï an agreement for the purchase of goods by instalment payments under which the person who agrees to purchase the goods has possession of them before paying the total amount. The definition excludes agreements which are not made at retail, and agreements in which ownership in the goods passes at the time of the agreement or of delivery. Application Accounting for GST on payments basis The time of supply rules dictate when a supply is deemed to be made. Sections 20(3) and (4) specify when a registered person should account for GST on a supply. Generally, a registered person on the payments basis must account for GST on payments when he or she receives them. However, when there is a specific time of supply rule the treatment may differ. Hire purchase agreements Under sections 9(3)(b) and 20(4)(b)(ii), a supplier who accounts for GST on the payments basis must account for output tax on the total cash value of goods and services that he or she supplies under a hire purchase agreement during the taxable period in which the parties enter into the agreement. Under sections 9(3)(b) and 20(3)(b)(iii), a recipient who accounts for GST on the payments basis must account for input tax on the total cash value of goods and services supplied under a hire purchase agreement during the taxable period in which the parties enter into the agreement. Periodic payments or instalments Under sections 9(3)(a) or (aa) and 20(4)(b)(i), a supplier who accounts for GST on the payments basis must account for output tax on supplies he or she makes in the taxable period in which the supply is deemed to take place, to the extent that payment has been received for the supply. Under sections 9(3)(a) or (aa) and 20(3)(b)(i), a recipi- ent who accounts for GST on the payments basis must account for input tax on supplies in the taxable period in which the supply is deemed to have taken place, to the extent that payment has been made for the supply. Example Mary is a registered person for GST purposes and accounts for GST on the payments basis. She buys a steriliser for her hairdressing salon on hire pur- chase. The cash price is $1,000 including GST. The hire purchase price, including interest, is $1,150, divided into 12 monthly payments of $95.83. Mary and the retailer enter into the agreement on 15 January 1994. In her next GST return, Mary claims a GST input credit on the GST component of the total cash price of the steriliser of $111.11 (1/ 9th of the total cash price). The retailer accounts for GST on a payments basis also. He must return $111.11 (1/9th of the total cash price) in his next return. Mary also hires a television set for $45 per month to entertain her clients. She claims GST input tax of $5 (1/9th of the payment) on the amount paid per month to the television hire company. 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.4 (October 1994) Personal sickness or accident insurance policies and loss of earnings insurance policies (individual policies only) Summary This item states the Commissionerís new policy on the income tax treatment of personal sickness or accident (PSA) insurance policies and loss of earnings insurance policies. The policy set out in this item only applies to insurance policies taken out by an individual which provide cover for that individual. A benefit received under a PSA policy is exempt from income tax, and premiums paid for a PSA policy are non-deductible. The Commissionerís view is that PSA policies are policies which provide for payment of a sum(s) which is specified in the insurance policy and which is payable if the insured person is incapacitated as a result of an accident or sickness. Income received under a loss of earnings policy is assessable and the premiums are deductible. The Commissionerís view is that loss of earnings policies are policies which provide for benefits calculated with reference to income lost by the insured as a result of incapacitation. A payment under such a policy may be calculated with reference to lost income even if there is a maximum or minimum amount payable under the policy. This last point is a change from our previous policy. This policy replaces our previous policy on these types of insurance policies published in TIB Volume Two No.5 (December 1990). It applies from the dates shown under the ìapplicationî heading on page 10. Legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1976. Direct quotes from this Act are printed in smaller type. Background Assessable and exempt income PSA policies and loss of earnings policies both provide the insured with benefits in the event that the insured becomes disabled, sick or sustains a loss of earnings or profits as a result of disablement or sickness. Some of these payments are exempt from tax. Section 61(40) exempts: Income derived by any person, in respect of any period of incapacity for work, from any payment received by him by way of a benefit under a personal sickness or accident policy of insurance, not being a payment calculated according to loss of earnings or profits: There are three features of this exemption: ï income is derived from a PSA policy ï the income is derived during a period of incapacity for work ï the payment is not calculated according to loss or earnings or profits. If a payment is calculated according to loss of earnings of profits, it will not be exempt. For tax purposes, a distinction must be made between payments calculated according to earnings and other payments. Deductions Under section 104, expenses can be deducted from assessable income to the extent to which they meet either of these conditions: ï they are incurred in gaining or producing the assess- able income for any income year ï they are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year. We discuss the deductibility of premiums after the discussion on the assessability of amounts received. Policy To discuss the tax treatment, we need to differentiate between three types of policies: ï PSA policies - under which all benefits are exempt ï Loss of earnings policies - under which all benefits are assessable ï Mixed policies - under which some benefits are exempt and some are assessable. This policy statement only applies to insurance policies that provide cover for the person who holds the policy. PSA policies The Commissionerís view is that benefits payable are not calculated according to loss of earnings or profits if they are specified as dollar amounts in the policy. We also consider that payment of hospital costs is a benefit which is not calculated according to earnings. Both of these benefits are exempt from income tax. In this item we refer to an insurance policy which provides for these types of benefit as a PSA policy. If the policy specifies that a certain dollar amount is payable, the amount payable may be a lump sum based on a scale which varies according to the disability suffered by the insured person, or it may be a series of payments payable during a period of incapacity for work. For example, the insured person may receive $10,000 for the loss of a hand, or $500 a week during a period of incapacity for work. The amount payable may be based on the insured personís earnings or profits at the time the policy is taken out. However, if it is, that amount must not vary during the course of the policy in relation to variations in the insured personís actual or expected earnings or profits. A policy will still be an exempt PSA policy if it provides that the amount payable will vary in relation to 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.4 (October 1994) the Consumer Price Index or some other measure which is unrelated to the insured personís income earning process. A policy which provides for benefits payable which are a percentage of the personís earnings at the time of a claim is not an exempt PSA policy. An insurance policy may provide that premiums do not have to be paid during incapacity. The Commissioner considers that this benefit does not have income tax consequences. It is simply a reduction of a private expense and does not give rise to income. Loss of earnings policies The Commissionerís view is that a loss of earnings or profits insurance policy is one under which benefits are calculated with reference to income lost by the insured as a result of incapacitation. Benefits from this type of policy are assessable. In this item these policies are called loss of earnings policies. At the time the insured person makes a claim, the insurance company will require evidence of the amount of earnings or profits lost or expected to be lost, before it will make any payment. The insurance company will only pay out the amount of loss proven, subject to any limitations in the policy. The policy may provide that a maximum or minimum benefit is payable. For example, the policy may say that the maximum amount payable each week is the lesser of earnings lost for that week and $1,000. The Commissionerís former policy, set out in TIB Volume Two No. 5 (December 1990), was that an insurance policy would only be viewed as a loss of earnings policy if the benefits were solely related to the taxpayerís prior income. If the benefits were limited to a maximum or minimum amount, the Commissioner viewed the policies as PSA policies, and the benefits were exempt. This aspect of the Commissionerís policy has changed. There are commercial reasons for limiting the insurerís liability under loss of earnings policies. A limit on the insurerís liability does not necessarily mean that benefits payable under an insurance policy are not calculated according to earnings. Mixed policies Some policies provide for both types of benefits. For example, a policy might provide for an amount based on lost earnings and a lump sum amount payable for permanent disability or hospital benefits. Benefits received will be exempt to the extent to which they are benefits of the type discussed under ìPSA policiesî above. Benefits will be assessable to the extent to which they are benefits of the type discussed under ìLoss of earnings policiesî above. Distinguishing features To determine whether a policy is an exempt PSA policy or an assessable loss of earnings policy, the Commis- sioner will look for the following features: PSA policy ï Benefits payable under the policy will be of any one of these types: - a lump sum or sums based on the severity of disability sustained or sickness contracted - a lump sum or sums based on hospital costs - periodic payments of the amount specified under the policy and payable during the period of incapacity. ï The specified payments may be the same amount that the insured earns at the time the policy is taken out, but if so, this amount cannot rise or fall in line with changes in earnings or profits over the term of the policy. The specified payments may vary in relation to an unrelated source such as the Consumer Price Index. ï The insurer will not require proof of loss of earnings or profits as a condition of payment. ï The policy may require proof of accident or sickness. Loss of earnings policy ï The amount payable under the policy must be calcu- lated with reference to earnings or profits lost by the insured as a result of incapacitation. However, the policy may provide that the insurance company has a maximum or minimum liability, i.e., the benefits payable under the policy may be capped. The cap may be a set figure or a percentage of the insuredís earn- ings or profits in a period before incapacitation. ï The insurer will require proof of loss of earnings or profits. Deductions Premiums are deductible if they are incurred in the course of gaining or producing assessable income. This means they are deductible if they are incurred to main- tain a process which earns assessable income. Premiums paid under a PSA policy are not deductible because they are not incurred to maintain a process which earns assessable income. Premiums paid under a loss of earnings policy are deductible, whether the policy holder is an employee or is self-employed. They are incurred to maintain a process which earns assessable income. Section 105 (which prohibits employees from claiming deductions for expenditure incurred in gaining or producing employment income) does not apply because the premi- ums are not incurred in gaining or producing ëincome from employmentí, as that phrase is defined in sec- tion†105. Premiums paid under most mixed policies must be apportioned on the basis of the benefits payable. Premi- ums will be non-deductible to the extent to which they relate to benefits paid under PSA policies. Premiums continued on page 10 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.4 (October 1994) The lesser of these two amounts: 1. The ìamount of coverî, which is a dollar amount specified in a schedule to his policy 2. Eighty percent of ìaverage weekly incomeî. Average weekly income is the higher of these two amounts: - the weekly average in the 12 months prior to disability - the weekly average in any 12 months in the three years prior to disability. Premiums are not payable during the period he is disabled and claiming under the policy. Under the Commissionerís new policy, this is a loss of earnings policy. Benefits are calculated at the time of claim with reference to earnings. Wiremu is assessable on benefits he receives, and can deduct the premiums he pays. The premium waiver benefit does not give rise to income and has no tax consequences. Note that under the previous policy which applies to insurance policies entered into before 1 November 1994, the policy is an exempt/non-deductible PSA policy because the benefits are capped. Example 3 Robyn Scribbler is a freelance promoter. Under her policy she is entitled to exactly the same benefits as Wiremu in Example 2. If she is partially disabled, those benefits are reduced according to the amount she is able to earn. In that situation, the benefits she receives under the policy are called ìrecovery benefitsî. She is also entitled to a hospitalisation benefit. The hospitalisation benefit covers certain hospital costs for a limited period, if Robyn is hospitalised. Her insurance company have advised her that only one percent of each premium relates to the hospitalisa- tion benefit. All of the benefits except for the hospitalisation benefits are assessable. The recovery benefit is the assessable benefit offset by Robynís earnings when she is only partially disabled. It is assessable because it is calculated according to her lost earn- ings. The hospitalisation benefit is not calculated accord- ing to earnings and is exempt. Robyn can deduct all of her premiums, because only one percent relates to the exempt hospitalisation benefits. Example 4 Ryan Painter, who is a signwriter employed by a company, takes out a policy which provides for a number of different benefits: will be deductible to the extent to which they relate to benefits paid under loss of earnings policies. The Commissioner accepts that under some mixed policies, only a negligible amount of each premium relates to a flat sum benefit and the rest of the premium relates to benefits calculated according to loss of earnings or profits. If the amount of a premium which is paid for flat sum benefits is two percent or less, the whole of each premium can be deducted. Your insurance company should be able to assist in apportioning premiums, and also in identifying those mixed benefit policies where only two percent of each premium is paid for flat sum ëPSAí benefits. Application This policy will apply to all new insurance policies entered into on or following 1 November 1994, and to all existing policies from their first annual renewal date on or following 1 November 1994. This policy replaces our previous policy published in TIB Volume Two No 5 (December 1990) from those dates. If you are unsure about whether a particular policy is exempt you can inquire at your Inland Revenue district office. Example 1 Rachel Graphics is a self-employed commercial designer. She is concerned that she may not be able to meet her outgoings if she is sick or disabled for an extended period. She takes out an insurance policy which has the following terms: ï If she becomes disabled as a result of accident or sickness, she will be entitled to receive the benefits under the policy. ï The benefits are payable after a waiting period of one month from the date of receiving medical advice in respect of the disability. ï The weekly benefits payable are the lesser of $800 and her average weekly profits in the previous six months. ï She will be required to show proof of her earnings in the last six months before benefits are payable. Under the new policy we consider that this is a loss of earnings policy. The benefits payable indemnify Rachel, up to a maximum amount, for the profits she will lose as a result of being disabled. She will have to provide proof of her earnings before she is entitled to any benefits. She can deduct the premiums and must return any benefits as income. Example 2 Wiremu Drawer is an employee in a plumbing business. He takes out a policy which provides for the following benefits. from page 9 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.4 (October 1994) ï Weekly benefits for temporary total incapacity. This benefit is $400 a week for the first 11 weeks of incapacity. ï Weekly benefits for permanent total incapacity. This benefit is the lesser of $600 and a percentage of Ryanís average weekly income in the year prior to incapacity. It is paid after 12 weeks of incapac- ity. ï Hospital expenses. ï Capital benefits for permanent loss. This benefit is a percentage of a lump sum specified in the insurance contract and varies in relation to the physical disability suffered. The weekly benefits for temporary total incapacity are periodic payments of the amount specified under the policy, so they are exempt. The hospital ex- penses benefit and capital benefits for permanent loss are also amounts specified under the policy, so they are also exempt. The weekly benefits for permanent total incapacity are calculated according to earnings, so they are assessable. The premiums are non-deductible to the extent they are paid for the exempt benefits, and deductible to the extent they are paid for the weekly benefits for permanent total incapacity. Ryanís insurance company has advised him of the percentage of each premium which relates to the exempt and assessable benefits. In this example, the portion of premiums which relate to the non-assessable benefits exceed two percent of the total premiums. The portion of premiums which Ryan can claim as deductions must reflect the apportionment advised by the insurance company. Correction: NZ Superannuitants receiving overseas government pensions In TIB Volume Five, No.13 (June 1994), we published an article on overseas pensions received by NZ superannuitants. There was a mathematical error in example 3 on page 2 of that item. The second half of the example should have read as follows: (corrections are underlined) Net NZ superannuation is: a - (b - c) ìaî= $1,000 b = 24% x ($11,000 + $1,000 + $8,000), less low income rebate= $4,365 c = 24% x ($11,000 + $8,000), less low income rebate= $4,085 Net NZ superannuation= $ 720 In this example the surcharge exceeds the net NZ superannuation. The maximum surcharge payable is the amount of the net NZ superannuation - $720. Paying FBT yearly - no change in base interest rate There will be no change to the base rate which is used to calculate interest payable by employers who have elected to pay fringe benefit tax on an annual or income year basis. The base rate will remain at 9% for the 1994 and 1995 income years. If employers elect to pay their FBT only once each year, they are charged interest to compensate the Government for the deferred tax payment caused by paying FBT once rather than four times each year. Section 336TC(4) of the Income Tax Act states that when the base rate of interest is set, the provisional tax use-of-money interest rate must be taken into account. This means that in most circumstances, the FBT base interest rate will be the same as the provisional tax use-of-money interest rate. For more details on how to calculate interest on FBT, see TIB Volume Four, No.11 (June 1993). 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.4 (October 1994) Budget night announcements - legislation passed Tax-related announcements contained in the 1994 Budget have been enacted through the Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1994 and the Stamp and Cheque Duties Amendment Act (No. 2) 1994. These Acts received the Royal assent on 23†September 1994. Family Support - Income Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1994 The Family Support changes announced in the Budget have been enacted through this Amendment Act. From 1 October 1994 the level at which Family Support starts to abate has been increased from $17,500 to $20,000. For the 1994/95 income year a composite rate of $18,750 will apply. The second abatement threshold of $27,000 remains unchanged. The other change contained in this Act relates to the amount of Family Support for second, and subsequent children who are aged 13 and under. The amount has been increased from $24 per week to $27 per week, or $1,404 per annum. This change also came into effect on 1 October 1994. For the 1994/95 income year the composite rate will be $1,326.00. Lease duty on rights to use land - Stamp and Cheque Duties Amendment Act (No.2) 1994 The Stamp and Cheque Duties Amendment Act (No. 2) 1994 gives effect to the Budget announcement that lease duty will no longer be imposed on the granting of rights to use or take profits from land. The Amendment Act repeals paragraph (c) of the definition of ìleaseî in section 8 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. The amendment applies to rights granted on or after 1 July 1994. Paragraph (c) covers any right, privilege or licence which entitles the grantee to enter land, to use land, or to take timber, minerals or other profits from land. In particular, the types of instruments that will not be subject to lease duty will include forestry rights, mineral rights, profits a prendre and licences to use land for, say, hunting purposes. The amendment does not affect lease duty on the granting of leases and easements. Conveyance duty on the conveyance of such rights to use or take profits from land is also not affected. There is a consequential amendment to the definition of rent to take account of the amendment to the definition of lease. International tax regime - booklets available soon Inland Revenueís information booklets on the international tax regime will soon be available. These three booklets will cover the Foreign Investment Fund, Controlled Foreign Company, and Foreign Dividend With- holding Payment rules. We had intended to publish these booklets earlier than this, but the subject matter is extremely complex and we want to ensure that every detail is as accurate as possible. We have incorporated into the booklets legislative changes which have occurred since the international tax regime took effect. In the meantime, this information on the international tax regime is already available in earlier TIBs: ï New FIF rules and attributed repatriation rules, plus changes to the controlled foreign company rules - TIB Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) ï New underlying foreign tax credit rules, and changes to BETA and FDWP rules - TIB Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) ï CFC and FIF disclosure exemptions for the 1994 income year - TIB Volume Five, No.13 (June 1994). The booklet dealing with foreign investment funds will be available within 1-2 weeks of when you receive this TIB, and the other two booklets will be available as soon as possible after that. Inland Revenue has granted an automatic extension of time beyond the 7 July IR†3 return filing date for taxpayers who need the information in these booklets to complete their returns. 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.4 (October 1994) Determination E10: Persons not required to comply with section 104A of the Income Tax Act 1976 Summary This determination sets out circumstances under which persons do not have to make accrual adjustments to deductible expenditure, as required by section 104A. Background Expenditure which is deductible under section 104 must be adjusted for accruals that exist at the end of the income year. This determination specifies the type of expenditure, amount, and the maximum period from balance date when accrual adjustments are not required. The following paragraphs explain the differences between Determination E10 and Determination E9. Application Previous determinations under section 104A(5) have been limited to a single income year. The revised determination applies to the income year starting on 1 April 1994 and to every subsequent income year, until the Commissioner cancels the determination. “Audit fees” The definition of ìaudit feesî is amended by deleting the word ìpayableî and substituting the word ìin- curredî, and by removing the words ì to a Qualified personî where they occurred, and inserting the words ì of a Qualified personî, after the word ìreportî. The amendment brings the definition of audit fees, for the purposes of the determination, into line with the determining provision (3), which refers to expenditure ìincurredî. It removes a potential complication which arises from using the previous term - ìpayableî. “Financial statements” The definition of financial statements is amended by adding paragraphs (d) and (e). These paragraphs widen the definition by including certain further financial statements within the meaning of that expression in sections 8 and 9 of the Financial Reporting Act 1993. “Mandatory accounting costs” The definition of ìmandatory accounting costsî has been amended by adding paragraph (c). As defined in Determination E9, ìmandatory account- ing costsî did not include the costs of meeting a statu- tory requirement to provide information on events or states of affairs other than those occurring in the income year. There is a statutory requirement that reporting entities provide information on certain post-balance date events. The amendment includes the cost of such accounting in the scope of the determination. “Qualified person” The definition of ìqualified personî is updated for the Companies Act 1993. Amounts There has been no alteration to the amounts in the schedule. The determination was made under section 104A(5) of the Act. It was signed by the Director (Rulings) on 12 October 1994. The full determination is printed below. Determination E10: Persons not required to comply with section 104A of the Income Tax Act 1976 1. Reference This determination is made pursuant to section 104A(5) of the Income Tax Act 1976.

We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Income Tax Act 1976 Confirming that an activity is not a business for income tax purposes ......................................... 16 Distributing beneficiary income to private schools ........................................................................... 17 Status of estate’s income when will is being contested .................................................................... 18 Domestic Purposes Beneficiary not eligible for GMFI ...................................................................... 18 Book royalties not subject to withholding tax .................................................................................... 19 Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Tax invoice requested but not received .............................................................................................. 19 Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 Employers: debt priority of Student Loan repayment deductions ................................................. 19 Companies Act 1955 Tax refunds for dissolved companies .................................................................................................. 20 Income Tax Act 1976 Confirming that an activity is not a business for income tax purposes Section 65(2)(a) - business profits: A taxpayer lives on a rural lifestyle block and commutes daily to his urban employment. He has asked if Inland Revenue could confirm in writing that his farming activity was not a business for tax purposes, and if so, what details he should supply with his request for this status. Under section 65(2)(a) “business profits” are assessable income. However, some taxpayers may not be certain whether their activities constitute a business or not. The Commissioner is able to confirm the business/non-business status once all relevant facts have been considered. In determining if someone is in “business”, the taxpayer must meet the defini- tion under section 2, i.e., “includes any profession, trade, manufacture, or under- taking carried on for pecuniary profit”. To determine if the farming activity is a business, the taxpayer must intend to make a profit. If the facts of a particular case show that the taxpayer does not intend to make a profit, Inland Revenue can confirm that the taxpayer’s activity is not a business. In a non-business activity, income tax is not payable on any income, nor are any expenses deductible. In considering the business status of a farming activity, Inland Revenue will often ask the following questions: 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.4 (October 1994) • Do you intend to make the farm profitable, and if so how? • What farming experience do you have? • What activities are being carried out on the farm? • How much time, effort, and money do you contribute to the farm? • Why did you decide on that type of farming? • Do you have a predicted budget? • How is the activity financed? • What is the carrying capacity of the farm, and when is it expected that the farm will meet its full potential? • Do you have anything you might like to add in support of your contentions? Any confirmation that Inland Revenue gives about the status of an activity is dependent upon the information we receive. If details are undisclosed or the activity or intention changes, Inland Revenue may review this decision. Distributing beneficiary income to private schools Section 96 and section 99 - Assignment of income, tax avoidance, and gift duty: Parents of a private school pupil asked about the tax effects of an arrangement whereby they enter into an agreement with the school, under which the school agrees to waive its fees in return for a distribution of beneficiary income of the same amount. The parents would establish a trust which provides for a class of beneficiaries being any educational institution in New Zealand. The trust’s assessable income would be reduced by the distribution of beneficiary income to the school. If the child for whom the fees are payable is also a beneficiary of the trust, the payment to the school may be income of that child as the payment is “for the benefit of the beneficiary” (definition of “Beneficiary income” in section 226(1)). If the child is not a beneficiary the arrangement will shift the tax liability for the income to the school beneficiary. If the school beneficiary is an approved charita- ble organisation, and the arrangement is tax effective, the income will be tax exempt. The parents are likely to execute the scheme by settling property or the right to income on the trust. For such a settlement to be tax effective the parents must comply with sections 96 and 99 of the Income Tax Act 1976. Section 96 provides that a settlement of property or the right to income will not be valid for tax purposes if the parents settle the property or the right to income on the trust for less than seven years and retain ownership of or control over the property during that time. The parents cannot assign the right to income from personal services or a future interest in partnership assets. Section 99(2) states that if tax avoidance is a purpose or effect (not being merely incidental) of an arrangement the arrangement will be void. Tax avoidance occurs when an arrangement alters a person’s tax, relieves a person from paying tax, or avoids, reduces or postpones a person’s tax liability. Unless there is evidence to the contrary, the arrangement described here will be caught under these tax avoidance rules. When a settlement of property or the right to income breaches section 96, or when section 99 applies, the settlor is deemed to derive the income as if he or she had not made the settlement. In other words, the tax liability for the income settled on the trust and distributed to the school reverts to the settlor/parents. continued on page 18 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.4 (October 1994) The settlement of the property or the right to income on the trust will still be legally effective, even though the transfer of tax liability is not. The settlement of the property or right to income on the trust by the parents may constitute a gift to the trust. Section 72 of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 provides an exemption from gift duty when a gift (which is not excessive, having regard to the legal or moral obligation of the donor) is made for the maintenance or education of a relative of the donor. This exemption will only apply to the settlement on the trust if the trust deed only authorises the trustees to distribute the income of the trust for the purposes of the education and main- tenance of relatives of the donor. If the trust deed contains wider purposes for which the trustees can, in their discretion, distribute the trust’s income, the section 72 exemption will not apply. If the section 72 exemption does not apply there will be gift duty liability if either of the parents have donated gifts, to all donees, totalling in excess of $27,000 during a twelve month period. Under section 79(1) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act, each parent must provide a gift statement to the Commissioner if he or she has made dutiable gifts during the year which exceed an aggregate value of $12,000. Status of estate’s income when will is being contested Section 226(1) - Interpretation of “Beneficiary income”: A trustee has asked if income derived by an estate is trustee or beneficiary income when the will of a deceased person is being contested. For trust income to be assessable as beneficiary income, the income must vest absolutely in the beneficiary’s interest during the year in which the trust derives it. Alternatively, the income must be paid or applied to or for the benefit of the beneficiary during the income year in which the trust derived it, or within six months after the end of that year. The income in this case does not satisfy the latter provisions. It is not beneficiary income, therefore it is trustee income. Domestic Purposes Beneficiary not eligible for GMFI Section 374E - Guaranteed Minimum Family Income Credit of Tax: A solo parent worked 20 hours a week in paid employment, and also received a Do- mestic Purposes Benefit from the New Zealand Income Support Service. She asked whether she would be entitled to receive a Guaranteed Minimum Family Income Credit of Tax (GMFI). Section 374E(3) describes the calculation of GMFI for a single person, who is also a “qualifying person” during any specified period. “Qualifying person” is defined in section 374E(1). It means: “in relation to any specified period, means any person where, throughout the specified period, - (a) That person is aged 16 years or over; and (b) That person is the principal caregiver in respect of one or more dependent children; and (c) Either - (i) That person has been both resident and present in New Zealand for a continuous period of 12 months at any time; or from page 17 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.4 (October 1994) (ii) Each of the dependent children referred to in paragraph (b) of this definition is both resident and present in New Zealand;- but does not include any person who, during the specified period, receives an income-tested benefit, a veteran’s pension, or a war widows mother’s allowance.” In this case, the taxpayer received the Domestic Purposes Benefit, which is an income-tested benefit. Accordingly, she is excluded from the definition of a “qualifying person”, so she is not entitled to GMFI. Book royalties not subject to withholding tax Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979: A New Zealand author was about to receive royalties from within New Zealand for a book she had written. She asked if those royalties would be subject to withholding tax. Under section 65(2)(h), all royalties are assessable income. Royalties paid for a book are not covered by the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979, so withholding tax should not be deducted from royalties paid to a New Zealand resident. (Activities which are subject to the Withholding Tax Regulations are listed on the back of the IR 13 Withholding Tax Deduction Certificate.) However, if the author was not a New Zealand tax resident, the payment would be subject to Non-Resident Withholding Tax at a flat rate of 15 percent on the gross payment (unless varied by a Double Taxation Agreement). Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Tax invoice requested but not received Section 24(1) Tax invoice: A taxpayer has asked if Inland Revenue is able to help a purchaser obtain a tax invoice from a supplier. The taxpayer had re- quested a tax invoice from the supplier three weeks earlier, but had not yet received it. Section 24(1) requires a supplier to provide a tax invoice within 28 days of a request from the recipient. A supplier who fails to provide a tax invoice within this time commits an offence under section 62(1)(l), and is liable to a fine of up to $2,000 upon conviction for a first offence. In this case, Inland Revenue was unable to help the purchaser at this stage as the 28-day period had not expired. When the 28-day period does expire, Inland Revenue may exercise its statutory powers to enforce compliance with the legislation. Inland Revenue’s procedures for enforcing section 24(1) are set out on page 4 of TIB Volume Three, No.3 (October 1991). Purchasers who have difficulty in obtaining a tax invoice should contact Tax- payer Services at their local Inland Revenue Office. Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 Employers: Debt priority of student loan repayment deductions Section 90 - Debt ranking of repayment deductions: An employer who has been adjudged bankrupt has made source deductions of student loan repay- ments from employee wages. As these are owed to Inland Revenue, the em- ployer wishes to know the ranking of that debt. continued on page 20 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.4 (October 1994) Section 90 amends the Insolvency Act 1967. It specifies the priority of debt for student loan repayment deductions when an employer is adjudged bankrupt (if an individual) or goes into receivership or liquidation (if a company). In either of these situations, the repayment deduction loan debt is a preferential debt that ranks equal to PAYE. Companies Act 1955 Tax refunds for dissolved companies Section 337 - Property of dissolved company: A company has recently been struck off the company register. The major shareholders have asked if they are able to claim a tax refund that is owing to the former company. If Inland Revenue owes an unclaimed refund to a company which is registered under the Companies Act 1955 but subsequently struck off, under section 337 of the Companies Act we must forward it to the Public Trustee. The refund is issued to the Public Trustee as the company is no longer a legal person and cannot claim any refund from Inland Revenue. Property of a struck-off company becomes the property of the Crown, and the Public Trustee deals with it under section 79(1)(c) of the Public Trust Office Act 1957. Inland Revenue is not required to ascertain who is entitled to the refund, so we advised the shareholders to make their application to the Public Trustee. The company in this question was registered under the Companies Act 1955. The position of a company which is registered under the Companies Act 1993 will be the subject of an item at a later date. from page 19 Income Tax (Deemed Rate of Return 1993-94 Income Year) Regulations 1994 The Income Tax (Deemed Rate of Return 1993-94 Income Year) Regulations 1994 were made on 26†Sep- tember 1994. The regulations prescribe a deemed rate of 10.3% which will be used to calculate foreign invest- ment fund (FIF) income under the deemed rate of return calculation method in the FIF regime. This rate will apply for the 1993-94 income year. Under the FIF regime, any income that a foreign entity earns on behalf of a New Zealand resident will be taxed on a current basis, as long as the New Zealand investor does not have a controlling interest in the entity. The deemed rate of return method is set out in section 245RE of the Income Tax Act 1976. It is one of the four methods for calculating FIF income. Under the deemed rate of return method, FIF income is determined by multiplying the value of a personís FIF interest by a percentage which is prescribed by regula- tion. That percentage is the ìdeemed rate of returnî. The Income Tax (Deemed Rate of Return 1993-94 Income Year) Regulations 1994 prescribe a rate of 10.3% which will apply for all types of FIF investments for which a taxpayer uses the deemed rate of return method. This includes interests in superannuation and life insurance policies. How the deemed rate of return is set The deemed rate of return is set annually by taking the interest rate of five-year Government Stock and adding a margin of 4%. The five-year Government Stock rate is determined by taking the average of the rates on 30†June, 30†September, 31†December and 31†March of each year. If no rate is available on these days, the rate on the next available business day is used. Using the above procedure, the rate for five-year Government Stock for the 1994 income year was 6.3%. This means the deemed rate of return for the 1994 income year is 10.3% (6.3% plus 4%). This procedure will also be used to set the deemed rate of return in future income years. 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.4 (October 1994) Legal decisions - case notes This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council.

The payments were source deduction payments from which the employer was required to make tax deductions. Facts:The employer made lump sum payments to employees who were transferred at its request in the course of employment. The payments were described as capital loss payments and additional mortgage assistance payments. They compensated the employees for any financial disadvantage suffered in having to shift houses as a result of the transfer. The employer treated the payments as reimburse- ments which were not taxable to the employees. It did not make tax deductions from the payments. continued on page 22 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.4 (October 1994) Decision:The Court of Appeal held that the payments were extra emoluments made in respect of or in relation to employment. It said that the words “in respect of or in relation to” had a very wide meaning and were wider than the similar words used in the UK Income Tax Act 1952 (profit arising from employment). The payments were in respect of or in relation to employment because they were paid to an employee only because he or she was an employee. In addition they were paid to compensate for the losses incurred in having to change the employ- ee’s place of residence in order to take up a new position in the company. The Court held that the payments were monetary remuneration, assessable to the employee under section 65(2)(b), and source deduction payments from which the employer was liable to deduct tax. The Court said that different considerations may apply in the case of the reim- bursement of expenses incurred by the employee in the discharge of his or her employment duties (e.g. the reimbursement of removal expenses on transfer), but that this was not such a case. Comment:The taxpayer will not be appealing this decision. Whether a GST input tax credit can be claimed on the purchase of a farm dwelling Rating:••••• Case:Coveney v CIR, Dooley v CIR, Swain & Adams v CIR Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, sections 2(1), 5(14), 10(18), 21 and 36A. Keywords:Test cases, input tax credit, apportionment, principal purpose Summary:The High Court heard these three test cases together. The issue was whether the purchasers can claim input tax on the total price of a farm, or only on the farm- land. The High Court found that the purchase of the farm was one supply, and there is nothing in the Act providing for apportionment of input tax in this situation. The principal purpose of acquiring the property was to make taxable supplies. Facts:Registered taxpayers had each purchased a farm property, including a dwelling, from unregistered sellers. They then claimed an input tax credit calculated on the whole of the purchase price. Section 2 provides that an input tax credit is available when a supply to a registered person is not a taxable supply, and it is of any secondhand goods. The Commissioner disallowed the part of the claim that related to the farm dwelling. The taxpayers objected. Counsel for the Commissioner submitted that: • The Act contemplates apportionment for input tax purposes. This is evident from the wording of the definition of “input tax” and is in accordance with the scheme of the Act. Counsel for the Commissioner also relied on sections 5(14),10(18) and 21 to show that the Act contemplated apportionment. • The principal purpose of acquiring the land and farm buildings was to make taxable supplies and thus an input tax credit is available. The farm dwelling was not acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies and the Commissioner was correct in disallowing input tax credits. • Each transaction involved several supplies and the fact that the property changed hands for one consideration and pursuant to one contract does not help the objectors. from page 21 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.4 (October 1994) Decision:The High Court held that in each case there was one supply, that of the farm as a whole. Because there was only one supply, the proviso to paragraph (c) of the definition of input tax in section 2 could not be used to apportion consideration (and thus input tax credits) between different supplies. Section 2 requires that the principal purpose of acquiring the property is to make taxable supplies. There is a recognition in the definition that there are, or may be, subsidiary purposes that do not include the making of taxable supplies. Section 21 was neutral in this situation. Sections 5(14) and 10(18) deal expressly with taxable supplies, but different rules apply to input tax on secondhand goods. These rules could not be used as a basis for determining that apportionment should apply in other circumstances. The principal purpose of acquiring the properties in question was to make taxable supplies. Therefore, for the reasons outlined, the Commissioner was incorrect in disallowing the input tax credit relating to the dwellings. Comment:Inland Revenue has not decided whether to appeal this decision. Whether life insurance agent’s expenditure is deductible Rating:•• Case:TRA 93/143 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, sections 104, 106(1)(j) Keywords:Deductible expenses, private expenditure Summary:The issue before the Court was the deductibility of various expenses that the objector had incurred. He had been an independent contractor for a life insur- ance company. The expenses fell into three main categories - legal, entertain- ment, and other expenses incurred after the objector had ceased business deal- ings with the insurance company. The Commissioner had disallowed the deduc- tions. The taxpayer objected. Facts:The objector worked as an independent contractor as a life insurance agent for a life insurance company. He was suspended from the company on 6 December 1990. The parties terminated the formal contract on 17 December 1990. The objector claimed deductions for business expenses, but his claims were disal- lowed. The deductions were: $2,004legal fees $12,899entertainment expenses $3,564.09other expenses incurred after the agency with the insurance company was at an end - interest on car, office agency, household expenses, telephone rentals. There was also a dispute over the proportion of interest on a loan for a vehicle which was deductible as a business expense for the period before 17 December 1990. Decision:The TRA found that: • The legal fee was not deductible, as the objector had not shown that it was an expense which was part of the objector’s life insurance agency business. It related to a criminal prosecution, and was a private expense. • A third of the entertainment expenses were deductible as proper business expenditure. continued on page 24 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.4 (October 1994) • The expenses incurred after severance from the insurance company were not incurred in the course of any existing business or income earning activity, so they were not deductible. The TRA considered that the parties could reach agreement on the appropriate adjustment for interest on the loan for a business vehicle. Comments:Inland Revenue is not appealing this decision. Whether penal tax charged was excessive Rating:•• Case:TRA 93/87 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, sections 369 and 423 Keywords:Penal tax Summary:The taxpayer was charged penal tax of 75% of deficient tax deductions for failing to account for PAYE deductions. The issue was whether penal tax was charge- able and if so whether the rate imposed was excessive. The penal tax was re- duced to 25% of deficient tax deductions. Facts:The taxpayer and his father were equal shareholders in a private company which carried on a carrying business from April 1984 until late 1992, when it went into liquidation. Over the period January to December 1991 the company was late every month in accounting for PAYE deductions. Under section 369 of the Income Tax Act 1976 the Commissioner assessed penal tax at the rate of 150% being split evenly between the taxpayer and the company. The objection was to the penal tax charged to the taxpayer, as the company had gone into liquidation. The company had previously been given warnings and had been charged penal tax on previous occasions when it had been late in accounting for tax deductions. Judge Barber took into account the taxpayer’s cash flow prob- lems, his management and accounting inexperience and the fact that there was no real personal profit to the offending. Decision:Judge Barber found that penal tax was chargeable. He also found that the total penal tax should be reduced to 75% of the deficient tax and that the taxpayer, as shareholder and director of the company, should be charged with one third of that, namely 25%. Comments:Inland Revenue is not appealing this decision. Whether penal tax charged was excessive Rating:•• Case:TRA 93/133 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, sections 369 and 423 Keywords:Penal tax Summary:The taxpayer was charged penal tax of 200% of deficient tax deductions for failing to account for PAYE deductions. The issue was whether the penal tax charged was excessive. Judge Barber found that it was excessive and reduced the penal tax to 75% of deficient tax. Facts:The taxpayer was a horse trainer who employed five people. The taxpayer failed to account for PAYE deductions for the months from May 1990 to September 1991. The taxpayer had previously had warnings and had been charged penal tax for failing to account for PAYE deductions by the due date. from page 23 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.4 (October 1994) Judge Barber took into account the taxpayer’s financial difficulties, the fact that the taxpayer believed tax credits were owing to him, his co-operation and lack of deviousness, his payment of various penalties for previous offending and that he had not offended since September 1991. Decision:Judge Barber found that the penal tax charged was excessive and reduced the penal tax to 75% of the deficient tax. Comments:Inland Revenue is not appealing this decision.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.5 (November 1994) GST - the definition of secondhand goods Summary This item states the Commissionerís current policy on the interpretation of the term ìsecondhand goodsî in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The item illustrates the Commissionerís interpretation of this phrase, but it does not discuss the three statutory exclusions to the phrase. The Commissionerís policy is that the term ìsecond- hand goodsî takes its ordinary meaning, namely that the goods have been previously used by someone else. Examples of goods that are not secondhand goods are animals, primary produce, manufactured goods that are supplied for the first time, and trading stock consisting of any of these classes of goods. All legislative references in this item are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Background There has been some uncertainty about when goods are ìsecondhand goodsî for the purposes of the GST Act. There have also been a number of court decisions that confirm the Commissionerís interpretation. Legislation Section 2 provides an exclusive definition of ìsecond- hand goodsî. It reads: ìSecondhand goodsî, does not include- (a) Secondhand goods consisting of any fine metal; or (b) Secondhand goods which are, or to the extent to which they are, manufactured or made from gold, silver, plati- num, or any other substance which, if it were of the required fineness, would be fine metal; or (c) Livestock. Court decisions The courts have considered this issue in these cases: ïCase N16 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,142. ïLR McLean and Co. Ltd & Others v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,100 (High Court). ïLR McLean and Co. Ltd & Others v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,211 (Court of Appeal). In Case N16, the Taxation Review Authority was required to determine whether deer velvet purchased from an unregistered person was ìsecondhand goodsî for the purposes of the Act. The TRA concluded that the deer velvet was not secondhand goods on the basis that primary produce is normally used for consumption. Accordingly, it could not be sold on a secondhand basis when it was purchased from a hunter or farmer, by a manufacturer or distributor. The TRA considered the meaning of the term ìsecond- handî at page 3,147: The word ìsecondhandî as an adjective to ìgoodî or ìgoodsî means, in my view, that in some way or another the item has been used or treated or stored by a previous owner in such a manner that it can no longer be regarded as new. Items in a retail shop are regarded as new, but they have quite possibly passed through a number of hands prior to being available at retail. Items in the shop of a secondhand dealer are regarded as secondhand, because they have been used for their intrinsic purpose by at least one prior owner; and even items which are in new condition will then be regarded as secondhand. In my view, primary produce is not normally referred to as secondhand because its use is that of consumption... I agree with counsel that the concept of secondhand relates to pre-ownership or pre-use. I agree with Mr Brownie that the emphasis is on pre-use. I consider that there is quite some commonsense flexibility in ascertaining whether a good is still new or has become secondhand. I do not regard second ownership as necessarily rendering an item secondhand. Many goods pass from manufacturer to wholesaler to retailer to customer or consumer (with other levels of distributors sometimes also involved), and yet are not regarded as secondhand at the consumer purchase level, even though the item has been used as stock-in-trade at the various distribu- tion levels. The good is not usually regarded as secondhand until it has been used for its intrinsic purpose. The High Court in LR McLean and Co. Ltd & Others v CIR was asked to decide whether wool purchased from unregistered persons was a purchase of secondhand goods for the purposes of the Act. The Court concluded that the scheme and purpose of the legislation did not give the definition of ìsecondhand goodsî a specialised meaning. The Court considered the amendment that introduced the current definition of ìsecondhand goodsî was based on the ordinary meaning of the words, and stated at page 10,105: It is impossible to stretch the definition, as it now is, to include new goods, to include goods which are not in any ordinary sense secondhand goods. The taxpayers appealed this decision. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and reaffirmed the High Courtís decision. The Court of Appeal rejected submissions that the scheme and purpose of the legislation had given the term ìsecondhandî a technical meaning. It concluded that as the definition was only by exclusion the words had to have their ordinary meaning unless the context required otherwise. The Court did not consider the context required a different meaning in this case. In deciding what the ordinary meaning of ìsecondhandî is, the Court adopted Judge Barberís definition of ìsecondhandî as stated in Case N16. Consequently, the term ìsecondhandî was considered capable of referring to both previous ownership and previous use, however, prior ownership did not always make the goods ìsecondhandî. continued on page 2 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.5 (November 1994) original source, and do not fall within the specific statutory exclusions. The following is a list of the goods that the Commis- sioner does not accept as secondhand. It is not exhaus- tive and is only intended as a guide: ï All animals, including progeny (Livestock includes domestic animals generally and any animals kept or dealt in for use or profit) ï Primary produce from farming, e.g., wool, meat, milk ï Any goods which have been manufactured that are being supplied for the first time ï Trading stock that consists of any of the above. Ports cannot zero-rate supplies of storage facilities to non-residents Summary This item states the Commissionerís current policy on zero-rating supplies of storage facilities to non-residents who store goods at New Zealand ports. The Commis- sionerís policy is that port companies will usually be unable to zero-rate supplies of storage facilities to non- residents storing goods at New Zealand ports. All legislative references in this item are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Background As part of the services they provide, ports often have storage facilities available for customers. Non-residents may wish to use these facilities when they have bought New Zealand-produced goods which are to be exported. Inland Revenue has been asked whether section 11(2) (the provision that zero-rates certain supplies of serv- ices) will apply to zero-rate supplies to non-resident customers. Legislation Section 11(2) zero-rates certain supplies of services. In particular it states: Where, but for this section, a supply of services would be charged with tax under section 8 of this Act, any such supply shall be charged at the rate of zero percent where- (a) The services (not being ancillary transport activities such as loading, unloading, and handling) comprise the transport of passengers or goods- (i) From a place outside New Zealand to another place outside New Zealand; or (ii)From a place in New Zealand to a place outside New Zealand; or (iii)From a place outside New Zealand to a place in New Zealand; or ... (ab)The services (including any ancillary transport activities such as loading, unloading, and handling) comprise the transport of goods from a place in New Zealand to another place in New Zealand to the extent that those services are supplied by the same supplier as part of the supply of services to which subparagraph (ii) or subparagraph (iii) of paragraph (a) of this subsection applies; or ... (e) The services are supplied for and to a person who is not resident in New Zealand and who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed, not being services which are supplied directly in connection with- (i) Land or any improvement thereto situated inside New Zealand; or (ii)Moveable personal property (other than choses in action, and other than goods to which paragraph (ca) of this subsection applies) situated inside New Zealand at the time the services are performed;- and not being services which are the acceptance of an obligation to refrain from carrying on any taxable activity, to the extent that the conduct of that activity would have occurred within New Zealand; ... Policy A port companyís supply of storage facilities to non- residents will not qualify for zero-rating under any of the paragraphs of section 11(2). Section 11(2)(a) Section 11(2)(a) allows the zero-rating of supplies of services when the services comprise the transport of passengers or goods between two overseas places, from overseas to New Zealand, or from New Zealand to an overseas destination. This provision will not zero-rate a portís supply of storage services to a non-resident for these two reasons: ï ìStorageî is not ìtransportî. ï Supplies of storage services occur totally within New Zealand and have no international aspect to them. from page 1 Policy The case law supports the Commissionerís current policy on the interpretation of the term ìsecondhand goodsî. The Commissionerís view is that except for the specific exclusions, ìsecondhand goodsî takes its commonly understood meaning. The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary defines ìsecondhandî as: 1. Not original or obtained from the original source; borrowed. 2. Not new, having been previously worn or used by another. The Commissioner has based his policy on this concept, namely that goods are secondhand goods if they have been used or are not new or not obtained from the 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.5 (November 1994) Section 11(2)(ab) Section 11(2)(ab) allows the zero-rating of supplies of services when the services comprise domestic transport of goods (including ancillary transport activities), to the extent that those services are supplied by the person who has undertaken the international transport of goods mentioned in section 11(2)(a). This provision will not zero-rate a portís supply of storage services to a non- resident for these two reasons: ï The port company is usually not the supplier of international transport services. ï Even if the port company is the supplier of interna- tional transport services, ìstorageî is not ìtransportî, nor is it an ìancillary transport activityî as it is not essential or related to the transport of goods. This second point derives support from Auckland Regional Authority v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,080. In ARA the court found that international terminal charges and sewage disposal charges were ancillary transport activities. The terminal charge was a charge for the use of air bridges, carousels, gate lounges and the baggage loading system. These services were akin to loading, unloading and handling rather than storage. The sewage disposal charge was a charge for the airportís service of removing and treating sewage from the plane. This service has more similarities with loading or unloading services than storage. Section 11(2)(e) Section 11(2)(e) allows zero-rating supplies of services to non-residents (if they are outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed) unless the services are supplied directly in connection with either of the following: ï land or any improvements situated in New Zealand ï moveable personal property (other than choses in action and goods to which section 11(2)(ca) applies) situated inside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. This provision will not zero-rate a portís supply of storage services to a non-resident, because the services will be supplied directly in connection with moveable personal property situated inside New Zealand. Example Port of Alexandra has extensive storage facilities for timber processed in the surrounding region. Slash and Burn Limited has an export contract with a Japanese company to supply processed timber. The Japanese company arranges with Port of Alexandra to store the timber at the port until arrival of the ship it has arranged to transport the wood. Port of Alexandra charges the Japanese company $2,000 per week for use of a storage shed. The port should charge GST for this supply. The storage is not transport of the goods and therefore is not zero-rated under section 11(2)(a). The storage is a supply by the port, not by the person who provides the international transport of goods (the Japanese company or its agent or freight forwarder). There- fore, section 11(2)(ab) does not apply. Even if the port was the international transporter, the storage of goods is not transport or an ancillary transport activity. Finally, the goods are in New Zealand at the time the services are supplied and section 11(2)(e) does not apply. Summary This item outlines the provisions of section 167B of the Income Tax Act 1976. Section 167B allows a deduction for payments that a partnership makes to a partner for services performed as a working partner of that partner- ship. Other than these payments, no deduction is allowable for payments of salary, wages, or other remuneration to partners. Legislation Section 167B(1) contains these definitions: ìWorking partnerî, in relation to a partnership and to any period in an income year, means any partner of the partnership who, in that period, personally and actively performs any of the duties required to be performed in the carrying on of the business of the partnership. Salaries and qualifying payments paid to partners in a partnership ìContract of serviceî, in relation to a partnership and to any partner who is a working partner thereof, means a binding agreement in writing, entered into by all the partners, which specifies the terms and conditions under which the partner is to be a working partner of the partnership, including any amount payable to the working partner for services performed by him in the carrying on of the business of the partnership pursuant to that agreement, whether or not - (a) The amount so specified includes any amount, so payable for those services, by way of bonus to the working partner; and (b) There is so payable for those services, by way of bonus to the working partner, an amount additional to the amount so specified: Section 167B(2) provides that Subject to section 97 of this Act, where any payment is made by any partnership to any working partner of the partnership for services performed by him as a working partner of the continued on page 4 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.5 (November 1994) Policy When a salary is paid to a partner under a partnership agreement, but section 167B does not apply to that payment, the salary is not a business expense and the partnership cannot take it into account in determining its business profit or loss. However, the payment is relevant to the allocation of profit or loss between the partners. Example Joyce and Mike are partners. The partnership deed provides for Mike to receive a salary of $40,000 per year (which does not meet the requirements of section 167B), and the residual profits and losses, after taking into account Mikeís salary, are to be shared equally between Joyce and Mike. Case 1 Profit before salary: $70,000 - to be allocated for individual assessment Salary:$40,000 - not deductible from partnership income for tax purposes, but attributed to Mike Profit after salary: $30,000 The partnership income is attributed $55,000 to Mike and $15,000 to Joyce. Mikeís share of the partnership income comprises the salary attribution of $40,000 and a half share of the balance - $15,000. Joyceís share of the partnership income is $15,000, which is half of the balance after attribut- ing Mikeís ìsalaryî. Case 2 Profit before salary: $20,000 - to be allocated for individual assessment Salary:$40,000 - not deductible from partnership income for tax purposes, but attributed to Mike Loss after salary: $10,000 The partnership income is fully attributed to Mike. This is because in terms of the partnership agree- ment he is entitled to the first $40,000 of partner- ship income. Mike will have assessable income from the partnership of $20,000 and Joyce will have nil assessable income from the partnership. FBT - prescribed interest rate increased to 8.4% The prescribed rate of interest used to calculate the fringe benefit value of low interest employment-related loans has been increased to 8.4% for the quarter starting on 1†October 1994. This rate will also apply to all subsequent quarters unless it requires further revision. The new rate reflects increased market interest rates. The prescribed rate was previously 7.9% for the quarter which started on 1†July 1994. from page 3 partnership in any period of any income year (being a period commencing not earlier than the date on which the contract of service in relation to that partner becomes binding, and ending not later than the date on which that contract of service terminates), the amount of that payment shall, to the extent that it does not exceed, as the case may be, - (a) Such amount as, in accordance with the said contract of service, is the amount payable to that partner in respect of that period; or (b) The aggregate of - (i) The amount referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsection; and (ii) The amount (being an amount additional to the said amount payable to that partner in respect of the said period) of any payment of bonus or further bonus made by the partnership to that working partner for the said services performed by him, - be deemed, for purposes of this Act, to be an amount of expenditure of the kind referred to in section 104 (b) of this Act. Section 167B(3) provides that the section does not apply to investment partnerships. Comment Section 167B allows a deduction for payments that a partnership makes to a partner for services performed as a working partner of that partnership. These specific payments require a written contract of service to be in place. No deduction is allowable for any other payments of salary, wages or other remuneration to partners. The reason for this is that a partnership is not a separate legal entity from its partners. Under general law a person cannot employ him/herself and a partnership cannot employ any of its partners. Tax cases that illustrate that salaries paid to partners are not deductible expenses (except as provided for in section 167B) are TRA Case L28 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,172 and TRA Case F123 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,157. When there is an agreement to pay a salary to a partner, it is necessary to consider how the profit attributable to each individual partner is calculated. If a deduction is not available under section 167B, the issue of allocating partnership profits is a matter to be decided by interpret- ing the partnership agreement. 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.5 (November 1994) Resident withholding tax on interest paid to partners Introduction This item explains when a partnership must deduct resident withholding tax (RWT) from interest it pays to its partners on loans that they advance over and above their capital contributions. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1976. Legislation Under section 327C a person who pays interest must deduct RWT from payments of resident withholding income unless certain exceptions apply. ìResident withholding incomeî is defined in section 327B. It includes interest, but excludes interest paid to someone who holds a valid certificate of exemption. (There are also various other exclusions which are not relevant to this item.) There are some exceptions to section 327C. A payer of interest does not have to deduct RWT from a payment of interest if that payer does not have a certificate of exemption, and meets both of these conditions: ï The payer has made payments of interest totalling less than $5,000 in the year preceding the year in which the interest is paid. ï The total of all interest payments (including the payment being made) paid in the year does not exceed $5,000. This means that when a partnership pays interest to a partner, it must consider whether it paid $5,000 or more interest in the previous year, and whether the total amount of interest paid in the current year (including the payment being made) will exceed $5,000. If so, it must deduct RWT from the payment being made. This rule is contained in section†327C(5). Another situation in which RWT does not have to be deducted is when the person paying the interest does not have a presence in New Zealand. Under section 327C(4)(a), a person is only liable to deduct RWT from a payment of interest if the person is: (i) Resident in New Zealand for the purposes of this Act; or (ii)Not resident in New Zealand for the purposes of this Act but carrying on a taxable activity in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand. A partnership will not be resident in New Zealand under the residence tests in section 241, because it is not a separate taxpaying person for the purposes of the Act. (See PIB 180 of June 1989 for the Commissionerís policy on residence.) A partnership carrying on an activity in New Zealand will come under the test in (ii). Although a partnership is not itself taxed on income (the partners are), it may carry on an activity which gives rise to assessable income to the partners. Example Tall Trees Partnership carries on a gardening and landscape design business. On 1 April 1992, Annabel Shrub, one of the partners, lent the part- nership $83,300 at 6% to enable the partnership to purchase some machinery. She advanced the loan for a five-year term. No loans had been advanced to Tall Trees in the preceding year. On 31†March 1993, the partnership paid Annabel $5,000 in interest. This was the only interest paid by the partnership for the 1993 year. On 1 April 1993, Annabel lent the partnership a further $45,000, and Randall Leaf, another partner, also lent the partnership $45,000 at 6% for five years. On 31 March 1994 Tall Trees partnership paid Annabel $7,700 and Randall $2,700 in interest. Tall Trees does not have a certificate of exemption. Annabel and Randall also do not have certificates of exemption. Tall Trees must deduct RWT from all the interest paid to Randall and Annabel on 31 March 1994. Tall Trees paid $5,000 interest in the preceding year (the 1992/93 year) and in the 1993/94 year paid more than $5,000 interest. Tall Trees was not required to deduct RWT in the 1992/93 year because, in terms of the exception discussed above, it did not have a certificate of exemption, did not make interest payments in the preceding year (the 1991/92 year) and payments in the 1992/93 year did not exceed $5,000. 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.5 (November 1994) Shareholder elections under qualifying company rules when shares sold to existing shareholder Summary This item states the Commissionerís current policy on qualifying company (ìQCî) elections when a share- holder in a QC sells his or her shares to another share- holder in the QC. There is generally no need for a further shareholder election by the purchasing share- holder, unless majority shareholder elections are involved. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1976. Background Generally, for a company to be a QC all shareholders who have full legal capacity to deal with their own affairs must elect in writing that the company shall become a QC. When shareholders make an election they elect to be personally liable for their share of any income tax which is not paid by the company for each income year that the election is in force. There is provision for majority shareholders to elect in respect of the minority shareholdersí shareholding in the com- pany. These provisions enable a company to become a QC even though some of the minority shareholders do not elect for it to do so. Legislation Under section 393E(2) a shareholderís election is deemed to be revoked when that shareholder sells or disposes of all of his or her shares in relation to which the election was made, unless the shareholder disposed of the shares to an existing shareholder in the company, for whose shareholding a valid shareholder election is already in effect. When shares are sold, there are two situations in which new elections will be required. Sections 393E(2)(d) and 393E(2)(e) revoke shareholder elections in either of these situations: ï if the purchasing shareholder was formerly a minority shareholder for whom an election had been made by a majority shareholder or shareholders, and the former minority shareholder now has an effective interest in the company of 50% or more ï if as a result of the sale of shares, the effective interest of any majority shareholder or shareholders in the company falls below 50%, and the shareholder or shareholders had made an election in respect of the minority shareholdersí shareholding in the company. Policy When a shareholder sells shares to an existing share- holder of a QC, there is generally no need for a further shareholder election by the purchasing shareholder. However, the Commissionerís policy is that the transfer of shares held by a trustee to a new trustee constitutes a disposal of the shares for the purposes of section 393E, and a new election must be made. Periods of Grace Deemed revocations under section 393E take effect on the first day of the income year in which the event giving rise to the revocation occurred. There is a period of grace of 63 days immediately succeeding the event that gave rise to the deemed revocation. The Commis- sioner may also allow an extended period if the com- pany or any person who may make a shareholder election in respect of the shareholding applies for the extension. Example Mr Smith, Mr Jones, and Ms Black are sharehold- ers in a QC. Their effective interests in the company are: Mr Smith20% Mr Jones40% Ms Black40% Mr Jones and Ms Black have made a majority election on behalf of Mr Smith. Mr Smith then buys a further 30% of the companyís shares from Mr Jones. This gives Mr Smith an effective interest in the company of 50%. An effective interest, if no market value circumstance exists, is the personís voting interest in the company. Their effective interests in the company after the sale are: Mr Smith50% Mr Jones10% Ms Black40% Mr Jones and Ms Black now have a 50% effective interest which is still enough for a majority election but Mr Smith has a 50% effective interest which is no longer a minority interest. Therefore, the election on behalf of Mr Smith is deemed to be revoked. If the company is to remain a QC, Mr Smith has 63 days (or such longer period as the Commissioner may grant) in which to make an election. 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.5 (November 1994) Depreciation rates for Crown Health Enterprise assets - 1993/94 income year Section 108M(2) says that when the Commissioner issues a determination under section 108I(1)(b) of this Act, which applies to a class of taxpayers, he must put a notice in the Gazette that he has issued the determina- tion. The notice must be published within 30 days of when the Commissioner issues the determination, and it must say where taxpayers can get a copy of the determi- nation. A copy of the provisional depreciation determination for the Crown Health Enterprises (CHEs) is reproduced below. This determination sets eighteen new asset classes and depreciation rates for the CHEs, for the 1993/94 income year only. It applies to assets acquired on or after 1 July 1993 and on or before 30 June 1994. Determination of provisional tax depreciation rates for Crown Health Enterprises 1.

Murray McClennan Manager (Rulings - Tax Policy) 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.5 (November 1994) Deductibility of amounts paid for failure to repair and maintain leased land ï The lease requires the taxpayer to maintain the land or to make repairs (including such things as painting and general maintenance) to any improvements on that land. ï The taxpayer has failed to meet that requirement and as a result becomes liable to pay the lessor a sum of money by way of compensation, damages, or indem- nity ï The lessor recovers the sum of money (or any part of it) from the taxpayer. A deduction is allowable to the extent that the amount of money paid or recovered was in respect of repair or maintenance work which would have been deductible if the taxpayer had incurred it during the term of the lease. See page 1 of TIB Volume 5, No. 9 (February 1994) for the Commissionerís view as to what constitutes repairs and maintenance. Spreading the deduction If a taxpayer wishes to spread the deduction over one or more of the three income years immediately preceding the year in which the sum is paid or recovered, the taxpayer must meet the conditions set out above. In addition, the taxpayer must give to the Commissioner written notice of the election to spread the deduction. The notice must state the amount of the deduction to be allocated to each of the three previous income years. The three previous income years must be years in which the taxpayer used the land in the production of assess- able income. The taxpayer cannot revoke the election once it is made. The taxpayer must give this notice to the Commissioner within the time he or she is required to furnish a tax return for the income year in which the amount of money was paid or recovered. However, the Commis- sioner does have a discretion to accept notices outside this time period. Example Lucy has carried on a restaurant business in a leased building for the past 15 years. The lease contained a covenant to repair and maintain the building. In March 1994 Lucy sold the restaurant business and retired. Before new tenants shifted in, the landlord carried out a number of jobs: ï replacing three broken windows ï professionally cleaning the oven and kitchen walls ï painting the restaurant area ï replacing bathroom tiles Lucy admits that she was obliged to carry out these jobs under the lease and in June 1994 she fully Introduction This item sets out the application of section 138 of the Income Tax Act 1976. Under section 138, a taxpayer who is a lessee of land can claim a deduction for amounts paid to a lessor when the taxpayer has failed to observe a lease obligation to maintain the land or to repair improvements on the land. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1976. Background Agreements for the lease of land usually contain a provision under which the lessee must maintain the land or make repairs to any land improvements. Section 138 allows the lessee to claim a deduction for certain amounts paid to a lessor as indemnity, compensation, or damages when the amounts paid relate to a failure to observe the lease obligation to repair and maintain. Section 138 is a corollary to section 70. Section 70 deems the payments made by the lessee to be assessable income in the hands of the lessor. Note that section 104A (which deals with accrual expenditure) does not apply to amounts claimed under section 138. Section 104A ensures that expenditure incurred in an income year that actually relates to a future income year is matched with the assessable income of the future income year. In contrast to this, section 138 is concerned with expenditure incurred in an income year that relates to past income years, i.e. the expenditure relates to repairs and maintenance that the taxpayer should have carried out in earlier years. Application A lessee has two options when claiming a deduction for repairs or maintenance under section 138: ï to claim the deduction in the income year in which the lessor is paid or recovers any amount under the covenant ï to spread the deduction to any one or more of the three income years immediately preceding the year in which the lessor is paid or recovers any amount under the covenant. Claiming the deduction in the year paid or recovered The taxpayer can claim a deduction when all of these conditions are met: ï The taxpayer leases (or once leased) land and the taxpayer uses (or used) the land to produce assessable income. 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.5 (November 1994) compensates the landlord for the expenditure incurred. Lucy asks if she can claim the amount paid as a tax deduction. Her balance date is 31†March. Lucy can claim the sum paid to her former landlord in her 1995 income tax return to the extent that the amount paid was in respect of repairs and mainte- nance. The expenditure incurred would ordinarily be repairs and maintenance. Instead of claiming the deduction in the 1995 year, Lucy may prefer to spread the deduction over earlier years. Lucy can spread the deduction over one or more of the 1992, 1993, or 1994 income years, assuming she used the leased land to produce assessable income in all of these years. (For exam- ple, if the land was used to produce assessable income in the 1991, 1992, and 1994 income years, but not the 1993 income year, the spreading of the deduction should not include the 1993 income year. Instead, the deduction would be spread over the 1991, 1992, and 1994 income years.) Lucy should notify the Commissioner in writing of an election to spread the deduction by 7 July 1995. If Lucyís return is prepared by a tax agent, the election is due by 31 March 1996. Upcoming TIB articles In the next few months we’ll be releasing policy statements on these topics in the Tax Information Bulletin: • Details to be supplied to Inland Revenue when seeking to claim a deduction for pay- ments to spouse • Voluntary payments made to employees • Revocation of qualifying company election and payment of qualifying company election tax • GST and debt collection services • When Inland Revenue can grant relief from payment of tax in cases of financial hardship • Treatment of dividend imputation credits and dividend withholding payment credits in the hands of trustees and beneficiaries • Meaning of terms “own” and “acquired” for depreciation purposes • GST and rates apportionment • Gift duty exemption under section 72 of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 • GST and zero-rating of goods sold to people leaving New Zealand We’ll publish these statements as soon as we’ve finished consulting with commentators outside Inland Revenue. 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.5 (November 1994) Questions we’ve been asked This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Income Tax Act 1976 Interest on qualifying tax in dispute .................................................................................................... 10 Deductibility of forest seedlings ........................................................................................................... 11 Claim for legal expenses incurred in seeking compensation ........................................................... 11 Deduction for stamp duty and legal expenses ................................................................................... 12 Impact on Family Support when LAQC incurs loss ......................................................................... 12 Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 GST incorrectly charged on exported goods ......................................................................................12 GST on services supplied in New Zealand to non-residents ........................................................... 13 Child Support Act 1991 Child Support liability for adopted children ...................................................................................... 13 Income Tax Act 1976 Interest on qualifying tax in dispute Section 34A - Interest on certain excess tax: A taxpayer wrote to Inland Revenue objecting to her 1993 income tax assessment. Enclosed with the letter was a payment of 50 percent of the 1993 tax assessed. During the time the letter was being considered, the taxpayer asked for interest to be paid on the payment she had made. Section 34A allows for interest to be paid or be payable on certain excess tax. The interest entitlement applies if Inland Revenue receives a competent objection, and fully or partly allows it. Under section 34(1), a “competent objection” is an objection made in accordance with section 30. The key points of a competent objection are: • It must be in writing. • It must state clearly the grounds of the objection. • It must give all the facts. • It must be made within the time limits. • It must not be a “non-qualifying” objection, as defined in section 34(1). When a taxpayer makes a competent objection and Inland Revenue disallows all or part of it, the taxpayer may defer payment of up to half the tax in dispute until the final liability is decided. The deferred amount is called “deferrable tax in dispute”, and the half that must be paid by the normal due date or new due date set by Inland Revenue is called “non-deferrable tax in dispute”. 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.5 (November 1994) The non-deferrable tax in dispute is payable by the due date shown on the notice of deferrable tax; it does not have to be paid at the time the objection is filed. If the objection is fully or partly allowed in the taxpayer’s favour, under section 34A(2) Inland Revenue must refund any consequential overpayment and pay interest on the qualifying tax in dispute. The qualifying tax in dispute is the amount of the assessed tax to which the taxpayer has made a competent objec- tion. The taxpayer in this case filed a competent objection that meets section 30 re- quirements. However, interest will not be paid until and unless Inland Revenue wholly or partly allows the objection. Before that time, no interest is payable. For a full explanation of the objection process and when interest is payable on deferrable tax in dispute, see Inland Revenue’s “Objection Procedures” booklet (IR 266). Deductibility of forest seedlings Section 74(15) - Deduction for planting, maintaining trees: A taxpayer who is operating a forestry business has asked if the cost of forest seedlings is a deduct- ible expense. Section 74(15) allows a deduction, for those in the forestry business, of any expenditure incurred in planting or maintaining trees on the land. Such expendi- ture includes the purchase of forestry seedlings, costs of pruning and thinning the trees, etc. Section 74(16) set out the amount of the deduction allowable as: • in the income year commencing 1 April 1987, 90 percent of that expenditure • in the income year commencing 1 April 1988, 75 percent of that expenditure • in the income year commencing 1 April 1989, 55 percent of that expenditure • in the income year commencing 1 April 1990, 30 percent of that expenditure • in the income year commencing 1 April 1991, and any subsequent year, the full amount of that expenditure. As the taxpayer is conducting a forestry business, the cost of the forestry seed- lings is a deductible expense. Claim for legal expenses incurred in seeking compensation Section 105 - Deduction for expenditure or loss incurred in production of income from employment: An employee incurred legal expenses in claiming earnings-related compensation under the Accident Rehabilitation and Compen- sation Insurance Act 1992. He has asked whether these expenses are deductible. Payments of earnings-related compensation are included within the definition of “salary and wages” under section 2 of the Income Tax Act 1976. Under the same section, “salary and wages” are deemed to be income from employment. Section 105 precludes the deduction of expenditure incurred in gaining or pro- ducing income from employment. The legal expenses incurred by the taxpayer are not deductible. 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.5 (November 1994) Deduction for stamp duty and legal expenses Section 106(1)(a) - Capital expenditure: A taxpayer has recently acquired a business property on which she has been assessed for stamp duty. She has asked whether she could claim an income tax deduction for the stamp duty and the legal expenses associated with the assessment of the stamp duty. Under section 106(1)(a) a deduction is not available for expenses incurred in acquiring a capital asset. This includes any stamp duty paid when purchasing a business property, or the fees charged by the solicitor for the preparation, stamping, and registration of the various documents relating to the purchase. The above expenses may be added to the cost of the assets purchased for depre- ciation purposes. Under section 106(1)(fc), the taxpayer is also unable to claim a deduction for any penalties charged by Inland Revenue in respect of stamp duty. Impact on Family Support where LAQC incurs a loss Section 374B(1)(e)(vii) - Loss Attributing Qualifying Company and Family Support Tax Credit: A Loss Attributing Qualifying Company (LAQC) has incurred a loss. A shareholder of that company has asked how the portion of the loss attributed to her is taken into account for Family Support purposes. Section 374B(1)(e)(vii) provides that any loss attributable to a LAQC shareholder under section 393P is not to be included in any calculation for Family Support purposes: • to determine assessable income derived; or • in ascertaining the loss incurred. In determining assessable income for Family Support purposes the loss is to be treated as nil. This is also explained in the Notes for Guidance on Form FS 2B - Adjustments to Income for Family Support. Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 GST incorrectly charged on exported goods Section 11 - Zero-rating: An Australian resident who purchased some computer software from a New Zealand mail order company was charged GST at 12.5 percent on the purchase. She has written to Inland Revenue asking if the GST was correctly charged, since the goods were sent direct to her Australian resi- dence. If the GST should not have been charged, she wanted to know how she could obtain a refund. Under section 11(1), goods exported by a supplier under the Customs Act 1966 are taxed at zero percent. In this case the goods were mailed direct to Australia by the supplier, and so GST should have been charged at zero percent. The overcharging of the tax is a matter between the supplier and the customer. Inland Revenue is unable to refund GST incorrectly charged. Therefore, we advised the person to contact the supplier and ask for a refund of the tax charged in error. 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.5 (November 1994) If the supplier makes this refund to the Australian resident before filing the relevant GST return, the sale could be included with other zero-rated sales in box 6 of the GST return. If the supplier has already filed the GST return and incor- rectly accounted for the GST to Inland Revenue, it is able to have that return reassessed to correct the oversight. GST on services supplied in New Zealand to non-residents Section 11(2) - Zero-rated services: A non-resident businesswoman incurred GST on accommodation, meals, rental cars, and other expenses while travelling in New Zealand. On her return home she wrote to Inland Revenue enclosing receipts for these costs, and asked if the GST portion of that expenditure could be refunded to her. Section 11(2)(e) allows GST to be charged at zero percent on services provided for and to a person who is not resident in New Zealand, and who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. In this case, the services were consumed in New Zealand as the businesswoman was in New Zealand at the time the services were performed. The zero-rating provisions of section 11(2) cannot be applied. Inland Revenue declined the request for the GST refund, and returned the receipts. (The item on page 2 of this TIB is also related to this subject.) Child Support Act 1991 Child Support liability for adopted children Section 7 Meaning of “Parent”: A person asked whether he is liable to pay child support for children he adopted, now that his marriage to the mother of the children has ended. Section 7(1)(c) states that a person is a parent of a child if the person adopted the child under the Adoption Act 1955, or under an adoption to which section 17 of that Act applies (i.e., an adoption taking place in an overseas jurisdiction), and that adoption order has not been discharged. Section 6(1)(a) of the Child Support Act 1991 states that Child Support may be sought from any person who is a parent of the child within the meaning of section 7. In this case the dissolution of the marriage is irrelevant. The person is liable to pay Child Support for the children he adopted, as the Adoption Act 1955 deems him to be the parent of the children, and the Child Support Act 1991 makes the parent liable for Child Support. 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.5 (November 1994) Legal decisions - case notes This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council.

Facts:The appellant, Colonial Motor Company Ltd, appealed to the Court of Appeal from a judgment by Justice Ellis in the High Court reported at (1994) 16 NZTC 11,060. The appellant owned a building in Courtenay Place, Wellington. The building was an earthquake risk and the Wellington City Council required its demolition or strengthening by 1988. The appellant decided to strengthen and refurbish the 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.5 (November 1994) building in 1984. The total expenditure spent on the building between 1984-1988 was $5.7 million. It was divided into 3 categories: (1) Seismic strengthening$1.282 million (2) Repairs$0.942 million (3) Capital $3.476 million $5.7 million As a result of the $5.7 million spent, the building was transformed from a ware- house that was an earthquake risk and had to be demolished, into a sound commercial building with a 50 year life. The deductibility of the repairs and capital costs were not at issue in the case. The appellant sought to deduct the seismic strengthening costs of $1.28 million from its assessable income. In the High Court, Justice Ellis held that the seismic strengthening costs were not deductible. In his view, the work done to the building was not “alterations” and even if the expenditure was “alterations” it increased the capital value of the asset by more than the sums expended. Decision:The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal The appellant’s argument was that under the second proviso to section 108(1), the expenditure on seismic strengthening was for “alterations” which did not increase the value of the asset. The appellant argued that due to the unusual market conditions prevailing over the income years in question, had the com- pany done the seismic strengthening and nothing else year by year, the capital value of the premises at the end of each income year would have not increased at all. The Court rejected this argument. It held that the costs attributable to seismic strengthening could not be hypothetically separated out from the total expendi- ture and viewed as if only that work had been done. The statutory inquiry that was required related to the work that was actually done. If there was one overall construction project, it was the total work involved in relation to the premises which had to constitute “repairs or alterations of any such asset” so as to come within the proviso. The Court found there was a single project and it was essential to consider the total work carried out. The combined effect of the strengthening, repairs and capital had increased the value of the building by more than the expenditure outlaid. The Court did not specifically consider whether the seismic strengthening costs went beyond repairs or alterations. However, it was satisfied that under the second proviso to section 108(1), the alterations increased the capital value of the asset by more than the cost of the alterations. Comment:We do not know if the taxpayer will be appealing this decision. Various life insurance company income tax issues Rating:••• Case:Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Limited (Life Branch) v The Commis- sioner of Inland Revenue AP 214/91 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, sections 106(1)(h) and 150 and former sections 108 and 204 Keywords:Life insurance and reinsurance companies, deduction, subsidised employee superannua- tion scheme, indirect general revenue costs, direct investment revenue costs, direct premium revenue costs, long service leave, incurred, apportionment, depreciation continued on page 16 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.5 (November 1994) Summary:This is a test case for various issues relevant to the income tax treatment of companies carrying on the business of life insurance and reinsurance under the scheme of the former section 204 of the Income Tax Act 1976. Facts:There were six separate issues for determination in relation to the period 1 April 1983 to 31 March 1990. Decision:The High Court considered and decided the following six issues: Superannuation claim The objector argued that contributions to an employee superannuation scheme were deductible under section 150 (the general deduction provision for contribu- tions to employees’ superannuation schemes). The Commissioner argued that such deductions were properly deductible under the former section 204, which provided a separate taxation scheme for life insurance companies. A deduction under section 204 would give a less favourable result to the objector because the apportionment and reduction provisions in sections 204(6) and (9) respectively would also apply. Section 204(6) apportioned certain costs between life insurance business and other business. Section 204(9) reduced income to the extent to which it related to exempt superannuation funds. The Court held that the contributions were deductible under section 204 (Com- missioner’s argument accepted). His Honour noted that section 204 did not intend to give a hybrid status to deductions, so that some but not all conven- tional deductions would fall within section 204. His Honour further noted, that if such contributions were not deductible under section 204, that would result in allowing deductions for expenditure which relates or is deemed to relate to income which has already been removed from the taxpayer’s assessable income. Interest on bank overdraft The objector argued that interest expenditure it incurred in deriving assessable investment income was deductible under the general interest deductibility provision of section 106(1)(h). The Commissioner argued that the interest was deductible under section 204. Again, a deduction under section 204 would give a less favourable result to the objector because the apportionment and reduction provisions in sections 204(6) and (9) would apply. The Court held that the interest expenditure was deductible under section 204 (Commissioner’s argument accepted). Justice Heron noted that the interest deduction logically fell within the formula provided in section 204, and to allow a deduction under section 106(1)(h) would defeat the application of section 204(9), which was to apply after all relevant deductions were made, and not just certain deductions. Interest on overdue premiums The objector argued that the additional charges on overdue premiums are to be treated as further premium income and therefore non-assessable. The Commis- sioner argued that these receipts should be treated as interest received from an investment, and therefore be assessable. The Court held that additional charges on overdue premiums are to be treated as interest payments and not as premium income (Commissioner’s argument accepted). His Honour noted that the objector accepted that the High Court was bound by the Court of Appeal decision in Commissioner of Taxes v AMP Society \[1902\] 22 NZLR 445. Apportionment of property charges The objector argued that property charges it incurred in respect of an investment property that it partly occupied could be apportioned on a floor area basis. The Commissioner argued that apportionment was not possible. If the property from page 15 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.5 (November 1994) charges were apportionable, then the costs attributable to the tenant’s floor area would fall within the definition of “direct investment revenue costs” as defined in section 204(1), resulting in a lower income tax liability for the objector. If they did not, the property charges would fall within the definition of “indirect general revenue costs” as defined in section 204(1). The Court held that the objector was entitled to apportion property charges for the investment property partly occupied by the objector, on a floor area or other equitable basis (objector’s argument accepted). His Honour did not accept the argument that the word “exclusively “ in section 204 prevented the apportion- ment of an item of global expenditure. Long service leave The objector argued that its liability for employees’ long service leave could be deducted under section 204 as an “indirect general revenue cost” at the time the employee first qualified for the long service leave. The Commissioner argued that such a deduction could only be claimed when the leave was actually taken. The Court held that a deduction could be claimed under section 204 when the objector became liable for employees’ long service leave (objector’s argument accepted). Justice Heron considered that the liability was “incurred”, because there was an immediately-identifiable liability which could be calculated exactly. His Honour said the meaning of the term “incurred” was well established in New Zealand Courts and referred to the Court of Appeal decision in CIR v Mitsubishi Motors NZ Ltd \[1994\] 16 NZTC 11,100. Depreciation The objector argued that depreciation deductions under section 108, on adminis- tration assets and buildings that the objector owned and partly occupied, were to be calculated without taking into account the adjustment formulae in section 204. The Commissioner argued that when exercising his discretion under section 108, he was entitled to take into consideration the adjustment formulae found in sections 204(6) and 204(9). The Court held when the Commissioner exercised his discretion under section 108, he could take into account the adjustment formula in section 204(6) because this was a consideration related to the usage of the assets and buildings in the production of assessable income (Commissioner’s argument accepted). How- ever, the Court held that the Commissioner could not take into account the adjustment formula in section 204(9) when exercising his discretion under sec- tion 108. This subsection had the effect of taking into account considerations which were not concerned with the usage of the assets (objector’s argument accepted). Comment:Inland Revenue is still considering whether to appeal the High Court’s decision on apportionment of property charges, long service leave and depreciation. We understand that the objector is also considering whether to appeal the decision. Whether warranty reimbursements liable to GST Rating:••• Case:TRA 93/21 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, sections 8(1), 10(2), 60(1) Keywords:Agent, consideration, supply, value of supply Summary:The objector acquired cars and other products from its overseas parent com- pany. The parent company warranted the condition of the goods to the objector. continued on page 18 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.5 (November 1994) The objector sold the products to dealers who then sold the products to the public. The TRA found that the objector was not required to pay output tax on reimbursement payments made by the objector’s parent company under the warranty for the cost of repairs to the cars and other products. Facts:The objector acquired cars and other products from its overseas parent company (“MC”) who, under the sale and purchase agreement, warranted the condition of the products. The objector sold the products to independent dealers who then sold the products to the public at retail. The dealers sold each vehicle with a warranty provided by the objector. The warranty was separate from the war- ranty agreement between the objector and MC. The dealers agreed to provide certain warranty repair services to the objector under a dealer agreement. Under this agreement, the objector agreed to reim- burse the dealer for any repairs carried out by the dealer to any product sold and covered by the warranty. The dealer accounted for output tax on the reimburse- ment payments and the objector claimed an input tax credit. After the dealer completed the repairs, the objector registered a claim with MC under the warranty provided by MC to the objector. MC then reimbursed the objector under the terms of its agreement. Decision:The main issue under consideration was whether the warranty reimbursements received by the objector were subject to GST. The Commissioner contended that the relationship of principal and agent existed between the objector and the dealers. Section 60(1) deems the objector, as principal, to make the supply of repairs to the customers. The payments received by the objector from MC were consideration for the repairs and the objector was liable for output tax on the consideration received. The payment by the objector to the dealers was not consideration for the supply of repairs but consideration for a separate supply, namely, the supply of agency services. Judge Barber held that the relationship of principal and agent did exist between the objector and the dealers in respect of the repairs. However, Judge Barber held that the reimbursement from MC could not be regarded as consideration for the repairs because this would mean full consideration was paid twice for the same supply. Judge Barber found that full consideration had already been paid by the objector for the repair supplies and the dealer had returned the GST output tax. Comment:Inland Revenue is appealing this decision Ability of taxpayer to use foreign tax credit Rating:••• Case:TRA 94/89 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, sections 293(2) and 304 Keywords:Tax credit, tax paid or payable Summary:A taxpayer can only receive a foreign tax credit when it has New Zealand tax paid or payable on the foreign income. If a taxpayer offsets its entire year’s taxable income by using group losses, it has no tax paid or payable, so it cannot claim a credit or refund for tax paid on foreign income. Facts:The taxpayer company offset its total 1992 taxable income by using the available losses of other group companies. The taxpayer received interest payments from Australian bank deposits. This interest was subject to Australian tax at the rate of 10%. The taxpayer sought a refund in New Zealand of the Australian tax. The Commissioner disallowed the claim. from page 17 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.5 (November 1994) Decision:The relevant sections are sections 293(2) and 304. Section 293(2) allows a New Zealand resident taxpayer a credit for tax paid overseas on foreign sourced income, against New Zealand tax on that same income. Section 304 restricts the credit for foreign tax to the amount of New Zealand tax payable on that income. (In this case section 304 did not apply because the New Zealand tax rate on the income was higher than the Australian tax rate). His Honour found that no credit was available to the taxpayer when no New Zealand tax was payable in an income year. In the 1992 income year the tax- payer had no New Zealand tax to pay, because it had offset its taxable income by using group losses. The taxpayer had claimed that New Zealand tax was payable by it, and that it had paid that tax by utilising losses. His Honour found that when losses in a group are offset against tax that is to be paid, then that tax is not paid or pay- able. There is nothing against which the credit can be applied. His Honour noted that if the taxpayer had offset a lower amount of group losses it could have used the tax credit, and preserved more of its tax losses for future years. Comment:We do not know whether the taxpayer will be appealing this decision. Whether sale of land is a supply in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity Rating:••• Case:TRA No 93/234 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, sections 6 and 8 Keywords:Taxable activity, hobby, farming, grazing, land investment Summary:A taxpayer may buy land but not use it in the course of a taxable activity for which he or she is registered for GST, or in any other business that he or she carries on. However, the sale of the land may still be a supply in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity and subject to GST. Facts:The objector was registered for GST. His main taxable activity was as a solicitor. He purchased two lots of land next to each other. He used one lot (A block) for deer farming. He intended to sell the other lot (B block) but in the meantime he let it out for grazing. He included the income from grazing in his farm accounts and deducted expenses for B block such as rates and interest. When the objector sold B block, Inland Revenue assessed GST output tax on the proceeds of the sale. The issue is whether the sale of B block was a supply for GST purposes made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. Decision:The use of B block was not part of the objector’s deer farming activity. Therefore, the TRA had to consider whether any activity of the objector in relation to B block was a taxable activity. The TRA noted that a taxable activity can be some- thing that is less than a business, but the term does not cover a hobby. To be involved in a taxable activity in B block the objector must carry on an activity that is continuous or regular, whether or not for pecuniary profit, that involves or is intended to involve the supply of goods and services for consideration. The TRA found that the objector continuously or regularly carried on either one or both of the following taxable activities: • Grazing, because he let the land out for that purpose • Land investment, because he bought the land with the intention of selling it. continued on page 20 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.5 (November 1994) The objector was carrying on a commercial activity of either grazing or land investment and not merely a private recreational pursuit or hobby. The sale of B block was on termination of that activity so it is deemed under section 6(2) to be carried out in the furtherance of that taxable activity. It did not matter that the supply was not in the course of the activity for which the objector was regis- tered. Therefore, the sale of B block was a supply by the taxpayer in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity and subject to GST. Comment:We do not know whether the taxpayer will be appealing this decision. Whether penal tax charged was excessive Rating:• Case:TRA No. 88/104 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, section 423(1) Keywords:Penal tax Summary:The Commissioner imposed penal tax at the rate of 100% on a barrister and solicitor for PAYE tax offending. The Commissioner had taken into considera- tion the profession of the taxpayer, previous warnings and a prosecution, and the fact that the prosecution appeared to have been ineffective. The TRA decided to reduce the amount of penal tax from $3,948 to $1,500, or to the amount calcu- lated under paragraph (b) of the proviso to section 423(1) if that exceeds $1,500. Facts:The taxpayer was a barrister and solicitor in a small legal practice. He was late in paying PAYE tax totalling $3,948.65 for the months of October, November, and December 1985. The PAYE was outstanding for those respective periods for two months, three months, and two months. The Commissioner assessed penal tax on the deficient tax at 100%. The taxpayer had a history of non-compliance with PAYE obligations. On 1 November 1984 the taxpayer had been convicted in the District Court for charges under section 368(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976. He was fined and penal tax was assessed at a rate of 50%. The taxpayer wrote to Inland Revenue in July 1986 explaining why he had not paid the PAYE for those months. He explained that he had overlooked to pay the PAYE for October and December due to oversights caused by the after- effects of an overseas trip and taking his children on holiday. He also claimed that he had sent a cheque for the November PAYE but that Inland Revenue had not received it. In the TRA the taxpayer argued that the penal tax imposed by the Commis- sioner was excessive under these circumstances. He pointed out the relatively short periods of offending and small amounts of money concerned. He also argued that: • It was improper to penalise him on the basis of being a “professional person”. • The Commissioner had not taken into account his 26 year record of general compliance, or the penalties that he had paid for his previous offences. The Commissioner argued that the penal tax rate of 100% of the deficient tax was justifiable considering the taxpayer’s previous convictions for failing to pay PAYE, previous warnings and the fact that the taxpayer was a practising profes- sional. from page 19 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.5 (November 1994) Decision:From the facts of the case, Judge Barber concluded that the taxpayer had of- fended due to personal worries and general mismanagement and carelessness. Consequently, he considered that the penal tax rate of 100% was too high and reduced it to $1,500 provided that the calculation in paragraph (b) of the proviso to section 423(1) did not exceed $1,500. In reaching this decision, he took into account the fact that there had been no previous offending since 1985 and the relatively minor amounts and delays that were involved. He also considered that the Commissioner had over-emphasised the fact the taxpayer was a practising professional. Although he recognised that this behaviour was unprofessional conduct, Judge Barber did not consider that the Commissioner should treat a professional person any differently from a business person. Comment:The Commissioner is not appealing this decision. 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.5 (November 1994) List of Inland Revenue booklets This list shows all of Inland Revenue’s information booklets as at the date of this Tax Information Bulletin.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.6 - Company Law Reform (December 1994) Company law tax changes Introduction The tax changes made in Part 1 of the Income Tax Amendment Act have been enacted to accommodate changes made in 1993 to company law. The Companies Act 1993 and changes to the Companies Act 1955 take effect from 1†July 1994. The resulting tax amendments therefore also generally apply from that date. Company law changes From a tax perspective, the most significant aspects of company law reform are as follows: ï Companies registered under the Companies Act 1993 are able to repurchase their shares either directly from all or selected shareholders, or through the stock exchange. ï There are new, administratively simpler rules apply- ing to the amalgamation of companies which should result in an increasing number of amalgamations. ï Many of the concepts applicable to companies regis- tered under the Companies Act 1955 - such as paid up capital, share premium and private and public com- pany - have been abandoned and do not apply to companies registered under the new Act. ï In certain circumstances, distributions made by insolvent companies may be recovered from share- holders. Summary of consequential tax changes The tax changes that have been made to accommodate the reforms referred to above are summarised below and discussed in detail in the following pages. Part 1A relates to share repurchases and dividends, Part 1B provides a commentary on the amalgamation provisions and Part 1C outlines the changes in terminology throughout the Act. In this commentary, section references are to the Income Tax Act, defined terms are in bold type when first used in commentary on an amendment, and reference to the repurchase of shares includes cancellation and redemp- tion of shares unless otherwise stated. Share repurchases ï New rules apply from 1 July 1994 to the cancellation, redemption and repurchase of shares undertaken by a company (whether the company is registered under the 1955 or 1993 Companies Act). ï An ordering rule applies to determine the source of distributions made on a share repurchase. The ordering rule differentiates between repurchases made by a company on the stock exchange (ìon-marketî repurchases) and off-market transactions. On-market repurchases ï All on-market repurchases are funded first from subscribed capital of a company. If the company has insufficient subscribed capital, the company pays tax on the dividend component of the distribution by debiting its imputation credit account. Off-market repurchases ï Broadly, when there is a pro-rata repurchase offer to shareholders resulting in a distribution that exceeds certain thresholds, the distribution is sourced first from the subscribed capital of a company. When the distribution falls below those thresholds, the distribu- tion is a dividend. ï In relation to a repurchase from a selected share- holder, the distribution is funded from subscribed capital if the change in that shareholderís interest in the company resulting from the repurchase and relative to other shareholders exceeds a specified threshold. ï When a distribution exceeds the thresholds referred to in the above two paragraphs, the Commissioner has an overriding discretion to determine that the distri- bution is in lieu of a dividend, in which case the distribution will be treated as a dividend. ï If the distribution is a dividend, the shareholder is liable for tax on the dividend. Revenue account shareholders ï Special rules apply to shareholders who sell shares held on revenue account to the issuing company. Except in limited circumstances, they are effectively taxed as if the shares had been sold to a third party. Treasury stock ï The Companies Act 1993 and the Income Tax Act make provision for treasury stock (that is, shares that are not cancelled upon repurchase). The share repurchase rules are summarised in flow chart form on pages 16 and 17 of this TIB. Amalgamations The Tax Act (in section 191WD) now provides for the tax consequences of an amalgamation. In particular, it provides for the following: ï the transfer of certain property on a concessional tax basis on a qualifying amalgamation ï the transfer of imputation credits and losses on a qualifying amalgamation, provided the continuity and commonality rules in the Act are satisfied. 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.6 - Company Law Reform (December 1994) Terminology changes These changes have been made throughout the Revenue Acts: ï Provisions that have expired and that contain com- pany law terms which are redundant have been repealed. ï References to the Companies Act 1955 have been expanded to include the 1993 Act. ï The term close company has replaced references to ìprivate companyî as the distinction between private and public companies does not exist under the Companies Act 1993. Close company has also replaced the concept of ìproprietary companyî. ï References to liquidation have replaced references to ìwinding upî. ï All references to paid up capital, share premium and nominal capital have been replaced with appropriate terminology. 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.6 - Company Law Reform (December 1994) Part 1A - share repurchases and dividends Definitions - section 2 The following definitions have been inserted into section 2 of the Act. Available subscribed capital per share is the sub- scribed capital paid in on all shares of a class, pro rated across the number of the shares in the class. The expression is used in relation to the definition of non- participating redeemable share (section 4A(3)), redemption of units in a unit trust (section 4A(1)(c)(iv)(A)) and elsewhere in the Act as a replace- ment for paid up and nominal value of a share (sections 194(5), 195(2), 197G(5)(a) and (b), 197H(7)(a) and 245C(4)(a)). A definition of liquidation now appears in section 2. The definition of winding up has been removed. Liquidation includes removal from the register of companies under the 1955 and 1993 Companies Acts, dissolution of a company, or termination of a companyís existence under New Zealand or foreign law . An event occurring ìupon liquidationî (for example, a distribu- tion to which section 4A(1)(ca) applies) refers to an event occurring at any time between the start of liquida- tion proceedings and the dissolution of the company. Bonus issues - section 3 The definition of bonus issue in section 3(1) has been amended as there is no concept of capitalisation under the 1993 Companies Act. Taxable bonus issue A company now makes a taxable bonus issue (other than a bonus issue in lieu) by resolving the amount bonus issued, and notifying the Commissioner of it (section 3(3)). The amount bonus issued is a dividend under sections 4(6)(b) and 4(1)(f). There is no change in the mechanism for making a bonus issue in lieu or calculating the dividend arising on it (see section 4(6)(a)). Non-taxable bonus issue The new definition of non-taxable bonus issue is essentially unchanged. If a company does not make the election described above when it makes a bonus issue, the issue is a non-taxable bonus issue. Non-taxable bonus issues made by companies remaining registered under the 1955 Act will have no tax effect, but they may increase paid up capital in company law. However, as a non-taxable bonus issue has no tax effect and for reregistered companies no longer results in capitalisa- tion of reserves in company law, it will be synonymous with a share split. Ten year bonus issue The term ìten year bonus issueî has been repealed as the Act now refers to such issues only once, by referring to the period in which these issues were made. (See item j(i) of transitional capital amount, under which amounts bonus issued during this period convert to available subscribed capital after 10 years or on liquidation of the company.) Miscellaneous technical dividend amendments Specified payments The reference in section 4(1)(a) to ìspecified paymentsî has been omitted as it is superfluous. ìSpecified pay- mentsî were defined in sections 4(3) and 4A(2) as (in effect) share premium. Distributions of share premium in cash are covered in the general category ìall sums in moneyî. There is no policy change intended by the amendment. Distributions on repurchase of shares Section 4(1)(g) has been expanded to include within the dividend definition amounts distributed on the repur- chase of a share. Certain repurchase distributions are then excluded from the dividend definition under section 4A(1). Group Investment Funds Section 4(2) has been amended to clarify that an investorís interest in a group investment fund is a share for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. Section 4A(1)(h) repealed Section 4A(1)(h) permitted the Commissioner to characterise as paid up capital a distribution on winding up sourced from other reserves in circumstances where paid up capital had previously been reduced by a company writing off losses. As available subscribed capital is now defined for tax purposes, and losses written off will not affect a companyís available sub- scribed capital, paragraph (h) has been repealed. Recovery of distributions by company - section 4(7A) Under section 56 of the Companies Act 1993 a distribu- tion made to a shareholder by an insolvent company may be recovered by the company in certain circum- stances. A new section 4(7A) has been inserted, which effectively reverses the tax consequences arising from the distribution in circumstances in which the distribu- tion is recovered. The provision operates on the assump- tion that the amount recovered from the shareholder will be the net dividend (that is, the dividend less any resident withholding tax deducted). The company will recover any NRWT or RWT on the dividend from the Commissioner. 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.6 - Company Law Reform (December 1994) When the distribution was made on repurchase of a share and sourced from available subscribed capital, the debit to subscribed capital arising on repurchase is in effect reversed on recovery (item c(iv) of available subscribed capital). Revenue account shareholders - section 4(15) Section 4(15) and the new section 85A provide for the tax treatment of shareholders who sell shares held on revenue account to the issuing company. Commentary on both sections appears on pages 13-15. Exclusions from dividend definition - section 4A(1) Section 4A(1) has been substantially amended. New paragraphs (c) to (cd) exclude from the dividend definition certain distributions to shareholders. These paragraphs replace the previous paragraph (c). Paragraph (c) excludes a distribution made on the off- market repurchase of a share in the circumstances outlined. Paragraph (ca) excludes subscribed capital and capital gains distributed on the liquidation of a company. Paragraph (cb) excludes the proceeds of the repurchase of shares treated by a company as treasury stock. Paragraphs (cc) and (cd) exclude the proceeds of sale of shares repurchased by the company through the stock exchange. On-market/off-market distinction The rules set out below distinguish between off-market repurchases (paragraph (c)) and on-market transactions (paragraphs (cc) and (cd)). An on-market acquisition is defined in section 4A(2). An off-market repurchase is any other type of share buy-back. Under the definition of on-market acquisition a transaction qualifies for on-market treatment when it meets both of these conditions: ï The company acquires the share on a recognised exchange (defined in section 8B). ï There is no arrangement between the shareholder and the company prior to repurchase of the share for the company to acquire the share. If such an arrangement exists, the repurchase is treated as an off-market transaction. Off-market share repurchases - section 4A(1)(c) Paragraph (c) excludes from the dividend definition amounts distributed on the cancellation, repurchase or redemption of a share when the repurchase occurs off-market and when certain criteria are satisfied. Non-participating redeemable shares are treated differently to other shares in that on redemption it is not necessary for paragraph (c)(i) to be satisfied. Off-market repurchase: non-participating redeemable shares In order to qualify for the exclusion, redemption of non- participating redeemable shares must meet the conditions set out in subparagraphs (ii) to (iv). In summary, (ii) and (iii) require that the repurchase occur off the share market and that it not be in lieu of a dividend. These paragraphs are discussed further on page 6. The distribution is not a dividend only to the extent of the available subscribed capital per share cancelled (subparagraph (iv)). This is the amount of available subscribed capital that is attributable to the class of shares to which the redeemed share belongs, spread across the shares redeemed. In effect, as long as there is sufficient subscribed capital attributable to the class to cover the redemption proceeds, no dividend will arise on redemption. Non participating redeemable shares - definition Non-participating redeemable share is defined in section 4A(3). It is essentially a share that has certain characteristics of debt. Such a share must meet these conditions: 1. It must be issued on terms under which it is required or permitted to be repaid before the company is liquidated. 2. It must be a redeemable share, a unit in a closely held unit trust, a section 192 or 195 debenture or a share in a co-operative company. 3. It must be a fixed rate share or a share on which the only amount payable by the company on redemption is the available subscribed capital per share (that is, the average subscribed capital per share in a class of shares). A fixed rate share is defined in section 8B. It means a share on which any dividend payable is a fixed percentage of the issue price, or is fixed by reference to a financial index. The effect of extend- ing the definition to include fixed rate shares is that when a fixed rate dividend is payable on redemption of a share, the instrument may nevertheless be a non-participating redeemable share. 4. It must carry only restricted voting rights. Such a share may nevertheless carry full voting rights that meet both of these conditions: ï They are granted only to enable the shareholder to prevent a detrimental alteration to his or her position or for remedying a default of the com- pany ï They arise only in such circumstances. Shares in co-operative companies need not be so limited. 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.6 - Company Law Reform (December 1994) Off-market repurchase: shares other than non-participating redeemable shares A distribution made on the off-market repurchase of other shares must satisfy the criteria in section 4A(1)(c)(i) to (iv) in order to be excluded from the dividend definition. ìBrightlineî tests - paragraph (c)(i) If a distribution on the repurchase of a share is to be sourced from subscribed capital and be excluded from the dividend definition, the distribution must first exceed certain thresholds or ìbrightlinesî set out in subparagraphs (c)(i)(A) to (C). Different thresholds apply depending on whether the distribution occurs in a pro rata cancellation or as a result of a repurchase from selected shareholders. A pro rata cancellation is defined in section 4A(3) as one of these: ï the repurchase of all shares of a class ï a repurchase that does not alter the voting interest (or market value interest) of a person in a class ï a repurchase arising from an offer by the company to all shareholders of a class to acquire shares, when the voting interest (or market value interest) of any shareholder would not alter if every shareholder accepted the offer. For example, if a company offers to repurchase one share for every five held and only certain shareholders accept the offer, the repurchase of those shares occurs as part of a pro rata cancellation. Section 60(2) of the Companies Act allows a company which is making a pro rata offer to include in the offer a power to acquire additional shares from a shareholder to the extent that another shareholder does not accept the offer. If this occurs, for tax purposes the acquisitions are part of a pro rata cancellation. The effect of this is that if some shareholders decline a repurchase offer, the company may approach other shareholders in order to reach the thresholds discussed below. (A) - Pro rata cancellation - return of 15% or more of companyís market value When a share is repurchased in a pro rata cancellation and the company distributes 15% or more of its market value on the repurchase, the distribution is not a dividend (to the extent it also satisfies the criteria in subparagraphs (c)(ii) to (iv)). The threshold is deter- mined on the basis of the amount actually distributed, not the amount that would have been distributed had all shareholders accepted an offer. The 15% threshold is described in subparagraph (A) as a fifteen percent capital reduction. This is defined in section 4A(3). That definition makes it clear that, in calculating the 15% of the market value of all shares in a company, non-participating redeemable shares are excluded. Simultaneous pro rata cancellations for separate classes of shares (except non-participating redeemable shares) may be aggregated in calculating the 15% of market value. Market value is determined at the time the company first notifies shareholders of the repurchase. If there is no advance notification, market value is determined at the time of the repurchase. Example A Co has $100,000 subscribed capital and $200,000 other reserves. It has 100,000 shares owned in equal proportions by 20 shareholders. A Co has surplus funds and offers to repurchase one in every 5 shares for their market value at the time of offer ($3). All shareholders accept the offer and $60,000 is returned to shareholders (20% of the market value of the company). The distribution is funded from available subscribed capital so it is not a dividend. (B) - Pro rata cancellation - return of 10-15% of companyís market value When a share is repurchased as part of a pro rata cancellation and 10% or more, but less than 15%, of the market value of a company is distributed, the distribution is not a dividend (to the extent that subparagraphs (c)(ii) to (iv) are also satisfied) provided that both of these conditions are met: ï The company has informed the Commissioner of the repurchase. ï The Commissioner has notified the company that the Commissioner has no reasonable grounds to conclude that the repurchase is in lieu of a dividend. The threshold applying in subparagraph (B) is referred to as a ten percent capital reduction. This is defined in section 4A(3). Except in relation to the level of the distribution, the definition is identical in scope to the fifteen percent capital reduction described above. (C) - Non pro rata cancellation - 15% interest reduction If a company repurchases shares from selected share- holders (that is, the repurchase is not a pro rata cancellation), the repurchase proceeds are not a divi- dend if each such shareholderís interest in the company before the repurchase and relative to other shareholders has decreased by 15% or more following the repurchase. The exclusion applies only to the extent that subparagraphs (ii) to (iv) are also satisfied. This reduction in a shareholderís relative interest in a company is referred to as a fifteen percent interest reduction. The term is defined in section 4A(3). Interest in a company is determined by the direct voting interests a person holds in the company. If a market value circumstance exists, a shareholderís direct market value interests determine that share- holderís interest in the company. These terms are defined in section 8B and are used to determine interest in a company for several purposes in the Income Tax Act. 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.6 - Company Law Reform (December 1994) The interests of certain associates of a shareholder - such as a spouse or minor child - are aggregated when calculating the relative reduction in that shareholderís interest. Example A Co has 4 non-associated shareholders who each hold 20 shares in the company. Shareholder B wishes to reduce her interest in the company and the company repurchases 50% of her shares. Bís interest in the company before the repurchase relative to other shareholders was 20/80, or 25%. Following the repurchase B has 10/70, or 14.28%. For there to be a fifteen percent interest reduc- tion, B must hold after the repurchase no more than 85% of her pre-repurchase interest - that is, she must hold no more than 21.25% (85% x 25%) of the company. As she holds only 14.28% of the company, the repurchase exceeds the required thresholds so it is not a dividend (if the company also satisfies subparagraphs (ii) to (iv) (described below). Off-market repurchase - paragraph (c)(ii) For a distribution to be excluded from the dividend definition under paragraph (c), the repurchase must not be an on-market acquisition. (This definition is discussed on page 4.) On-market repurchases are excluded under paragraphs (cc) and (cd). Repurchase distribution not in lieu of dividend - paragraph (c)(iii) For repurchase proceeds in relation to all types of share to be excluded from the dividend definition, the Com- missioner must be satisfied that the repurchase was not made in lieu of paying dividends. This captures a repurchase made in lieu of paying dividends on the shares repurchased or any other shares. The Commissioner will have regard to the factors listed in subparagraph (iii) when determining whether the repurchase is in lieu of a dividend. Subparagraph (iii) does not apply when there is a pro rata cancellation in which 10% - 15% of the company is distributed and the Commissioner has notified the company that there are no reasonable grounds on which to conclude that the cancellation is in lieu of paying dividends. Sufficient subscribed capital to fund distribution - paragraph (c)(iv) Paragraph (c)(iv) is the basis of the ordering rule under which repurchase distributions that satisfy the criteria in paragraphs (c)(i) to (iii) are sourced first from sub- scribed capital. A distribution is not a dividend if there is sufficient subscribed capital attributable to the class of share that includes the repurchased share to fund the repurchase. More precisely, repurchase proceeds are excluded from the dividend definition to the extent that the other criteria in paragraph (c) are satisfied and the distribu- tion does not exceed the available subscribed capital per share cancelled. This is defined in section 4A(3) and is in effect the subscribed capital of a class of shares spread across the shares of that class that are cancelled at one point in time. Example A Co has 50 shareholders who each own 10,000 shares (all of one class). It has $500,000 available subscribed capital and $1,000,000 other reserves. The company has funds surplus to its needs and wishes to return them to shareholders. A Co offers to repurchase 20% of each sharehold- erís shares at their market value of $3 per share. Five shareholders wish to increase their relative share of the company and decline the offer. The amount distributed on repurchase of 90,000 shares is therefore $270,000, or 18% of the market value of the company (as determined at the time the shareholders were first notified of the offer). A Co intends to maintain its dividend distribution per share and the Commissioner is satisfied that the repurchase is not in lieu of the payment of divi- dends. The distribution is not a dividend as the conditions in section 4A(1)(c) are satisfied as follows: ï There has been a fifteen percent capital reduc- tion occurring as part of a pro rata cancellation (subparagraph†(i)(A)). ï The repurchase does not occur on-market (subparagraph (ii)). ï The Commissioner is satisfied the distribution is not in lieu of paying dividends (subparagraph (iii)). ï The amount distributed per share ($3) does not exceed the available subscribed capital per share cancelled ($5.55 - that, is $500,000/90,000 shares) (subparagraph (iv)). The available subscribed capital reduces to $230,000 (see item c of the definition of available subscribed capital). Off-market repurchase: unlisted widely held trusts Paragraph (c) treats unlisted widely held unit trusts and group investment funds in a manner that differs in two respects from the treatment of companies. The terms unlisted widely-held trust and widely held trust are defined in section 4A(3). The latter replicates the definition in section 63(2H). In essence, it is a unit trust or group investment fund owned by no fewer than 100 investors, or a lesser number in certain circum- stances. The brightline tests in paragraph (c)(i) do not apply to redemptions of units in unlisted widely held trusts (see section 4A(1)(c)(i)(D)). 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.6 - Company Law Reform (December 1994) The ordering rule under which share repurchase distributions that exceed certain thresholds are sourced from subscribed capital does not apply to redemptions of units in a unit trust and interests in a group investment fund. When units and interests are redeemed, the amount excluded from the dividend definition is the available subscribed capital per share. This is the amount of subscribed capital attributable to units in a class averaged across those units. Example A unit trust issues 500 units each to A and B on 1†December 1994 at $1 per unit - this brings Aís holding to 1,000 units. The unit trust elects to treat the 500 units of A issued on that date as a separate class of units. The available subscribed capital of that class of units is therefore $500. On 31 January, the trust redeems 100 of the units for $1.50 per unit. The available subscribed capital per share is $1 ($500/500 units). $1 is not a dividend; $0.50 is a dividend. Off-market repurchase: non-residents Repurchase by non-resident company from resident shareholder The rules outlined above that enable repurchases to be funded from subscribed capital will apply to a repur- chase by a non-resident company from a resident vendor shareholder only if the shareholder has sufficient information to calculate available subscribed capital per share cancelled. Where the shareholder does not have this information, the company is deemed not to have such funds and the distribution will be a dividend. (See section 4A(4), discussed on page 13.) Repurchase by resident company from non-resident shareholder The rules that determine when repurchase proceeds are funded from subscribed capital apply to distributions to non-resident shareholders in the same way that they do to residents. However, where the distribution is not sourced from subscribed capital and gives rise to a dividend, non-resident withholding tax should be deducted on the dividend. Distributions on liquidation - section 4A(1)(ca) Section 4A(1)(ca) excludes from the dividend definition certain distributions made by a company upon its liquidation. Under the definition of liquidation in section 2, this covers a period beginning with any step legally necessary to achieve liquidation until the liquidation of the company. Distributions from two sources are tax free on liquida- tion - subscribed capital and certain capital gains. More precisely, the available subscribed capital per share cancelled is tax free on liquidation. This is defined as the available subscribed capital of a company on liquidation spread over the shares cancelled upon liquidation. The capital gains distributed per share are referred to in paragraph (ca) as the excess return amount, which is defined in section 4A(3). This definition is simplified with the removal of specific reference to ìshare pre- miumî but is otherwise substantially unchanged. The formula calculates the portion of a companyís reserves (other than subscribed capital) that are capital gains and classifies that portion of the amount distributed per share as a tax free distribution of the capital gain. For example, if capital gains represent 1/5 of the non-capital reserves of a company, 1/5 of the amount distributed per share (excluding capital) is a tax free distribution of that capital gain. Treasury stock - section 4A(1)(cb) and 4A(4A) Section 4A(1)(cb) excludes from the dividend definition amounts distributed by a company on the repurchase of shares that it elects to treat as treasury stock. Shares acquired on-market or off-market may be classified as treasury stock. The treasury stock mecha- nism is discussed below, both generally and as it applies to co-operative companies. General rule The Companies Act 1993 provides that, in general, shares repurchased by a company are cancelled upon acquisition. However, under (new) section 67A(1) of that Act, a company may resolve not to cancel shares on repurchase. It may treat up to 5% of the shares of a class in this manner. Such shares may be onsold by the company or may ultimately be cancelled. A company holding shares as treasury stock is not entitled to exercise voting rights or receive dividends in respect of the shares. Other restrictions on treasury stock are imposed under the Tax Act. Shares that are acquired in a pro rata cancellation cannot be treated as treasury stock. It is envisaged that treasury stock will be used - in particular by companies that have no available subscribed capital remaining - to acquire, bundle together and onsell unmarketable parcels of shares and to buy out minority shareholders who hold up to 5% of shares of a class. When a company elects to treat a share as treasury stock and the company either subsequently cancels the share, or has not sold it to a non-associate within one year, the repurchase is treated as a distribution. To the extent that the company has sufficient available subscribed capital on the first anniversary (or earlier cancellation), the available subscribed capital is reduced by the repurchase proceeds (subsection (4A)(d)). To the extent 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.6 - Company Law Reform (December 1994) the company has insufficient available subscribed capital, a debit calculated under section 394E(1)(ab) arises to the companyís imputation credit account (ICA). The debit arises as at the date the company acquired the shares (subsection (4A)(e)). If this retro- spective debit results in an end of year debit balance in the ICA, no imputation penalty tax (or additional tax on that) will be payable. However, there is still a liability for payment of further income tax under section 394L. As noted earlier, a company must sell treasury stock to a non-associate within one year if the acquisition is not to be treated as a distribution. However, if the company sells the share on the stock exchange and it is coinci- dentally purchased by an associate, the transfer require- ment is satisfied (subsection (4A)(c)(ii)(B)). Profits on the sale of treasury stock are exempt from tax under section 61(66) of the Act and expenditure in- curred in acquiring treasury stock is not deductible. Example B is a shareholder in A Co which has 20 sharehold- ers (each holding 50 shares) and no available subscribed capital. B wishes to retire from the company but finds no suitable purchaser for his shares. On 1†December 1994, the company repur- chases the 50 shares for $10 each, resolving to hold them as treasury stock in the expectation that a purchaser may be found within one year. The company still holds those shares on 1 Decem- ber 1995. The company has no available subscribed capital at that date. A debit of $246.26 ($500 x .33/.67) will therefore arise to A Coís ICA as at 1†December 1994. Co-operative companies The various co-operative companies Acts enable co- operative companies to hold treasury stock up to limits specified in those Acts. Up to 20% of shares can be held as treasury stock by certain companies. These Acts will be consolidated into one Co-operative Companies Act in the foreseeable future. Currently there is no provision for treasury stock in the proposed Bill but this will be reviewed. For the present, for tax purposes the upper limit on treasury stock is that applying to a company under the relevant co-operative companies Act. Because, in practice, co-operative companies frequently retain such treasury stock for periods longer than one year, the restrictions on the time a company may hold treasury stock do not apply to co-operative companies. On-market share repurchases sourced from subscribed capital - section 4A(1)(cc) Section 4A(1)(cc) excludes from the dividend definition proceeds of sale of a share that is repurchased by a company in an on-market acquisition - that is, on the share market - to the extent that the company has sufficient available subscribed capital to fund the distribution. The available subscribed capital is debited on repurchase (item c(iii) of the definition of that term in section 4A(3)). When shares repurchased on the sharemarket are treated as treasury stock there is no on-market acquisi- tion unless the company breaches the 5% threshold or the one year time limit applying to treasury stock (paragraph (c) of the definition of on-market acquisi- tion). The effect of this is that there is no reduction in available subscribed capital and no debit to the imputa- tion credit account of a company when a share is acquired on-market, treated as treasury stock and sold within one year. On-market share repurchases when there is no subscribed capital - section 4A(1)(cd) Section 4A(1)(cd) applies to generally exclude from the term ìdividendî the proceeds of sale of a share that is repurchased by a company through the stock exchange when the company has insufficient subscribed capital to fund the distribution. The vendor of the share therefore receives no dividend on its repurchase. The distribution is nevertheless a dividend for two purposes - debiting the repurchasing companyís imputation credit account and the recovery of a distribution made by an insolvent company. Debit to imputation credit account A company that repurchases a share on-market is liable for the tax payable on any part of the distribution that is not sourced from subscribed capital of the company. The tax is satisfied by a debit to the imputation credit account of the company which is calculated under section 394E(1)(ab). Paragraph (cd) achieves this result by providing that, for the purposes of section 394E(1)(ab) and (2)(ab), a dividend arises on repurchase to the extent that the distribution exceeds a companyís available subscribed capital per share cancelled. Example Shareholder B holds 5000 shares in A Co. He sells 500 of those shares through the stock exchange on 1†December 1994. A Co buys 500 shares for $3 each on that date. A Co has available subscribed capital of $1,000. The following tax consequences arise: ï The sale proceeds are not a dividend to B (section 4A(1)(cc) and (cd) - the available subscribed capital per share cancelled is $2 ($1000/500)). ï The companyís available subscribed capital reduces by $1,000 (being the aggregate of amounts excluded under section 4A(1)(cc) - see item c of the definition of available subscribed capital). 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.6 - Company Law Reform (December 1994) ï Under section 4A(1)(cd) a dividend arises for the purposes of section 394E(1)(ab) to the extent that there is an amount distributed per share that exceeds the available subscribed capital per share cancelled - that is $1 per share. The debit per share is $0.49 ($1 x .33/.67) and the total debit is $245 ($0.49 x 500 shares). The debit arises on 1 December 1994. On-market acquisition by insolvent company Under company law, when an insolvent company makes a distribution, including through an on-market repur- chase, the distribution may be recovered in certain circumstances. Paragraph (cd) deems any distribution made to a shareholder in a repurchase on the stock exchange to be a dividend for the purposes of section 4(7A) to the extent the distribution is not funded from subscribed capital. The effect of this is that, in the very rare circumstance in which a distribution made through an on-market repurchase is recovered, section 4(7A) will apply to reverse any debit to the companyís imputation credit account that arose on the repurchase of the share. On-market acquisition - non-residents Repurchase by non-resident corporate from resident shareholder When a resident shareholder sells shares in a non- resident company through the stock exchange, and the company repurchases the shares, no dividend arises to the resident. This is a result of the combined effect of paragraphs (cc) and (cd). Repurchase by resident corporate from non-resident shareholder There is no difference in treatment between on-market repurchases made from resident and non-resident shareholders. When the repurchasing company is resident and has sufficient available subscribed capital to fund the distribution, no dividend will arise to the non-resident. When the company has insufficient available subscribed capital to fund the distribution, the company debits its imputation credit account by an amount calculated under section 394E(1)(ab). Arrangement for associate to acquire in lieu of on-market repurchase - section 394E(1A) A new section has been inserted into section 394E, to target arrangements between a company and an associ- ate for the associate to purchase shares of the company on-market in lieu of the company repurchasing those shares on-market. When such an arrangement exists, the purchase is treated as an on-market repurchase by the company: the available subscribed capital is debited if the issuing company has sufficient (item c(iii) of that definition), and to the extent that it does not, a debit calculated under section 394E(1)(ab) arises to the companyís imputation credit account. “Shares of the same class” - definition The Amendment Act makes changes to the definition of ìshares of the same classî. This definition is critical in determining the tax treatment of share repurchases as the tax treatment is linked to the level of available subscribed capital (and its variants) held by a com- pany, which is calculated for a class of shares. Shares of the same class must carry the same voting and distribution rights. However, under the previous defini- tion of shares of the same class, a company that could identify particular shares and elected to treat those shares as a separate class could do so if the issue price per share for that separate class differed from the issue price of other shares. Each of the shares in the separate class had to have the same issue price. Paragraph (c) of the definition has been rewritten to introduce more flexibility. In order for shares to be in different classes it is no longer necessary that they have different issue prices. Shares can be treated as in the same class, separate from another class, under para- graph (c) if all of these conditions are met: ï Each of the shares in the class have the same voting and distribution rights. ï The company can distinguish those shares from others in the company. ï The company elects to treat those shares as a separate class. ï The issue price of the shares in the class is the same or the shares are held by the same person. Example 1 A Co is a listed company that has issued shares over many years at different prices. They all have the same rights. The company does not elect to treat any as a separate class under paragraph (c). The shares are therefore all of the same class. The definition of available subscribed capital calcu- lates the aggregate of those issue prices and avail- able subscribed capital per share calculates the average subscribed capital attributable to each share in the class. Example 2 A Co has 3 shareholders, each of whom paid a different issue price for their 100 shares in the company. Shares 1-100 owned by A were issued for $10 each, shares 101-200 owned by B were issued for $20 each and shares 201 - 300 were issued to C for $30 each. All shares have the same rights. However, the company does not wish to average the subscribed capital across all shares but intends to return the subscribed capital paid in on issue of a share to the holder of that share. The company elects to treat the shares as three separate classes. 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.6 - Company Law Reform (December 1994) Example 3 A Co issues to each of shareholders B and C 100 shares at $3.00 each. The shares carry the same rights. It wishes to treat those shareholders as holding shares of different classes because it does not want B to have access to Cís subscribed capital on repurchase of Bís shares. It is able to distinguish the shares held by B and C and elects to treat them as separate classes. Bís shares therefore constitute ìshares of the same classî and Cís shares shares of a different class. Available subscribed capital Under the new Companies Act there is no concept of paid up capital and share premium, and no differentia- tion between different types of reserves. The Tax Act therefore now defines available subscribed capital. This is essentially amounts paid to the company on the issue of shares, less amounts paid out on the repurchase of shares when those amounts are not dividends. Available subscribed capital is calculated in relation to each class of shares in a company. It is calculated according to the formula a + b - c, which is discussed below. Item a - transitional capital amount Item a equals 0 for companies incorporated on or after 1†July 1994. For other companies it is the transitional capital amount. This is itself defined in section 4A(3) and is essentially the paid up capital and share premium attributable to shares of a class on issue at 1 July 1994. In particular, that amount is calculated in terms of the formula in the definition: j + k l x m In this formula: j is the total capital paid up before 1 July 1994 on shares of a class ever issued. However, the following two categories of paid up capital are not to be included. 1.Unexpired ten year bonus issues: for ongoing companies (that is, companies that are not calculating available subscribed capital on liquidation) paid up capital does not include capital arising from a bonus issue that meets all of these conditions: ï It was made between 31 March 1982 and 1†October 1988. ï It was sourced from reserves other than qualifying share premium (defined in section 4A(2)). ï It has been issued for less than 10 years. However, for companies that are liquidating, this restriction does not apply and the amount bonus issued is included in the transitional capital amount. Note that the words ìrelevant timeî in subparagraph (i)(C) of item j refer back to the opening words of subsection 4A(3). 2.Non-taxable bonus issues: paid up capital arising from non-taxable bonus issues sourced from reserves other than qualifying share premium are also not included in item j. k is the aggregate of qualifying share premium that has ever been paid to the company before 1 July 1994. Share premium that has been bonus issued is excluded in order to avoid double counting such amounts - they are included already in item j. l is the number of shares ever issued before 1 July 1994. m Items j, k and l broadly (that is, except for the treatment of certain bonus issued amounts) calculate the amounts that would not be a dividend on cancel- lation of a share before 1 July 1994. This amount is then attributed to shares on issue at 1 July. Example A Co is repurchasing shares on 1 December 1994 and is calculating its available subscribed capital, and therefore its transitional capital amount, to determine how much of the distribution will be tax free to shareholders. Before 1 July 1994 A Co. had issued 500 shares (all of the same class), with paid up capital of $1 per share and share premium of $2 per share. Of those 500, it had cancelled 100 shares before 1 July for $3 per share. The transitional capital amount is $500 + $1,000 500 x 400 = $1,200 Item b - subscriptions from 1 July 1994 Item b is the amount paid to the company on the issue of shares of a class on or after 1 July 1994. Subparagraphs (i) to (iv) clarify the amount that is credited to sub- scribed capital in certain circumstances. Subparagraphs (v) to (xii) list the circumstances in which consideration paid on the issue of shares is excluded from available subscribed capital. Inclusions Bonus issue in lieu - (i) The amount credited to available subscribed capital when there is a bonus issue in lieu is the amount of money offered as an alternative to the bonus issue. Taxable bonus issue - (ii) When a company makes a taxable bonus issue (other than a bonus issue in lieu) the amount credited to 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.6 - Company Law Reform (December 1994) available subscribed capital is the amount of dividend arising from the taxable bonus issue. This is the amount the company elects to be bonus issued under section 3(3) of the Income Tax Act. Debt converted to equity - (iii) When debt is converted to equity (for example, in the case of a convertible note) the amount of the debt claim converted is credited to available subscribed capital. Short form amalgamation of sister companies - (iv) When two companies that are wholly owned by the same parent amalgamate in a short form amalgamation, the amount of available subscribed capital that arises in relation to each class of share in the amalgamated company is the available subscribed capital of all shares of an equivalent class in the amalgamating companies. Crossholdings are not counted. Example A Co and B Co were each incorporated in Decem- ber 1994. A Co issued 1,000 shares for $1 each. B Co issued 2,000 shares for $1 each. All of the shares in A Co and B Co are held by C Co. C Co A Co B Co A Co and B Co amalgamate using the short form amalgamation procedure in section 222(2) of the Companies Act 1993. A Co remains as the amalga- mated company. The available subscribed capital of the amalgamated company will be as follows : a + b - c ìaî = 0 ìbî = 1,000 + 2,000 ìcî = 0 The available subscribed capital of the amalgamated company is therefore $3,000. Item b(iv) is required because, under a short form amalgamation, all shares in the discontinuing amalga- mating company are cancelled without payment or other consideration, including the issuing of shares in the amalgamated company. As item b only includes consid- eration provided for shares issued, a specific provision is required to ensure that the available subscribed capital of the amalgamated company includes an amount equal to the available subscribed capital of the amalgamating company. Exclusions Non-taxable bonus issue - (v) The making of a non-taxable bonus issue does not result in an increase in available subscribed capital. Taxable bonus issue exempt under section 63 - (vi) No increase in a companyís available subscribed capital arises if the company makes a taxable bonus issue to a parent company which is exempt from tax on the bonus issue under section 63. This restriction applies to the extent that the bonus issue is not fully credited - that is, it does not carry imputation credits at the maximum ratio. ìFully creditedî is defined in section†4A(3). Dividend exempt under section 63 - (vii) There is also no increase in a companyís subscribed capital if consideration the company receives on the issue of shares is primarily attributable to a dividend it pays that is exempt from income tax under section 63 and not subject to foreign dividend withholding pay- ment. Example A Co pays a dividend to its parent B Co, which is exempt from tax on the dividend under section 63. B Co uses those funds to subscribe for shares in A Co. This transaction does not result in an increase in A Coís available subscribed capital. Dividend paid by CFC to CFC - (viii) An equivalent restriction to that in subparagraph (vii) applies when consideration received on the issue of shares by a controlled foreign company (CFC) is attributable to a dividend paid by that CFC to another CFC. Share-for-share swaps - (ix) Subparagraph (ix) restricts the amount of available subscribed capital arising in one company on its acqui- sition of shares in another company. It has its basis in the concept of qualifying share premium. The purpose of the rule is to prevent share swaps being used to generate available subscribed capital in excess of that available for distribution before the share swap. The basic rule is that when the consideration provided for the issue of shares in A Co is in the form of shares in B Co the subscribed capital of A Co increases only by the available subscribed capital of those shares in B Co. Example A Co intends to take over B Co. B Co has revenue reserves of $900, available subscribed capital of $100 and a market value of $1,000. Therefore $900 of B Co would be taxable on distribution. A Co buys B Co by issuing shares to B Coís shareholders in return for their shares in B Co. In the absence of the restriction in subparagraph (ix), the shares issued by A Co would have subscribed capital of $1,000, being the market value of B Co. Under subparagraph (ix), the subscribed capital of the A Co shares is limited to $100, being the subscribed capital of B Co. 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.6 - Company Law Reform (December 1994) Anti-avoidance provision The basic rule is strengthened by the requirement to deduct ineligible capital amounts from the available subscribed capital of shares offered in exchange. This is defined in section 4A(3) and is best explained by an example that shows its effect. It is intended to prevent the underlying rule being avoided by an arrangement of the following kind. Example A Co intends to take over B Co. B Co has revenue reserves of $900, available subscribed capital of $100 and a market value of $1,000. A Co buys B Co by offering to issue A Co shares to B Coís share- holders in return for B Co shares. Under the proposed rules the shares issued by A Co will have subscribed capital of $100, being the subscribed capital of B Co. These rules can be undermined if, immediately before the share swap, B Coís shareholders sub- scribed another $900 to B Co. B Co now has subscribed capital of $1,000 and a market value of $1,900. A Co then buys B Co shares for shares worth $1,000 and $900 cash, thus returning the $900 recently subscribed. The issued shares will have subscribed capital of $1,000. The transaction enables the subscribed capital of the A Co shares to be increased by $900. Under the ineligible capital amount definition the $900 subscribed immediately before the share swap is ignored when calculating the available subscribed capital of B Co, so that the subscribed capital of the newly issued shares is limited to the original $100 of subscribed capital. The ineligible capital amount is therefore: ï the available subscribed capital of shares in B†Co that is attributable to shares issued in anticipation of the acquisition ($900); or ï if it is less than the amount above, the amount of available subscribed capital attributable to consideration passing from A Co to B Coís shareholders that is not in the form of shares ($900). Amounts that are fully credited taxable bonus issues are not included in the calculation of ìineligible capital amountî. It is quite legitimate for such bonus issues to be made before a takeover, in order to prevent loss of imputation credits. Share for share swaps on an amalgamation - (x) Subparagraph (x) provides a rule equivalent to subparagraph (ix) above but which applies on amalga- mation of companies. The available subscribed capital of an amalgamated company does not include the amount of any consideration it receives on amalgama- tion to the extent the consideration provided by share- holders of the amalgamating company exceeds the subscribed capital per share of the shares in the amalga- mating company. Example A Co has available subscribed capital of $600 and a market value of $1,000. B Co holds all of the shares in A Co. C†Co has available subscribed capital (consisting of a transitional capital amount) of $300. A Co amalgamates with C Co using the long form amalgamation procedure (section 220 of the Com- panies Act 1993). C Co remains as the amalga- mated company. Shares in A Co are cancelled. Assets and liabilities of A Co are transferred to C Co. B Co receives shares in C Co to the value of $1,000. The available subscribed capital of C Co is calcu- lated as follows : a + b - c ìaî = $300 ìbî = $600 ($1,000 - $400) ìc ì= 0 The available subscribed capital of the amalgamated company is therefore $900. Double counting of transitional capital amount - (xi) Subparagraph (xi) excludes from available subscribed capital any amounts that have already been included under item a - transitional capital amount. Treasury stock - (xii) Subparagraph (xii) clarifies that when a company disposes of a share that has been treated as treasury stock, there is no increase in its available subscribed capital. Item c - debits to available subscribed capital Item c provides for a decrease in available subscribed capital upon the repurchase or cancellation of a share on or after 1 July 1994, if the repurchase proceeds are excluded from the dividend definition because there is sufficient subscribed capital to fund the distribution. When an insolvent company recovers a distribution from subscribed capital from a shareholder under section 56 of the Companies Act 1993, the debit to subscribed capital at the time of the distribution is in effect reversed (subparagraph (iv)). When there is an arrangement of the kind referred to in new section 394E(1A) (described on page 9 above), to the extent that there is sufficient available subscribed capital in the issuing company to cover the deemed repurchase, the purchase proceeds will be deducted from the available subscribed capital of that company. 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.6 - Company Law Reform (December 1994) Section 4A(4) A new section 4A(4) has been inserted, expanding the replaced subsection by adding paragraphs (b) and (c). Paragraph (b) provides that when a shareholder of a non-resident company cannot obtain sufficient informa- tion to calculate the excess return amount (on liquida- tion of the company) or the available subscribed capital per share cancelled on repurchase of a share, that amount is deemed to be nil. These amounts would generally be tax free under section 4A(1)(c) to (cd). Paragraph (c) creates an exception to the above rule. When the non-resident company is an unlisted widely held trust and the shareholder cannot obtain sufficient information to calculate the available subscribed capital per share, that amount is deemed to equal the amount paid to the trust in respect of the issue of the unit. (Note that, in relation to an unlisted widely held unit trust, the available subscribed capital per share and not available subscribed capital per share cancelled calculates the tax free component on redemp- tion of a unit.) Non-taxable bonus issue from capital gains - section 4A(11A) New subsection (11A) provides that when a non-taxable bonus issue is sourced from a capital gain amount, the capital gain amount retains its status so that it is in most circumstances distributable tax free on liquidation. This is consistent with the treatment of non-taxable bonus issues, which are generally ignored for tax purposes. Revenue account shareholders - sections 4(15) and 85A Two new provisions provide for the tax treatment of shareholders who held repurchased shares on revenue account - sections 4(15) and 85A. Section 4(15) pro- vides for the taxation of the repurchase proceeds under the dividend provisions and under section 65, but provides a mechanism to avoid double taxation of the proceeds. Section 85A has two effects. First, when repurchase proceeds are a dividend because the distribution is under the thresholds in section 4A(1)(c)(i) or is in lieu of a dividend, the proceeds are treated as a dividend only - the shares are deemed not to have been sold. Secondly, the section adjusts the cost price of shares that are repurchased at under market value. Taken together, sections 4(15) and 85A provide that if a repurchase fails to meet the conditions in section 4A(1)(c) and is therefore deemed to be in lieu of a dividend, for revenue account shareholders it will be taxed as a dividend and not as a sale. But if the repur- chase is not in lieu of a dividend, any dividend compo- nent of the proceeds will be taxed as a dividend and the remainder will be taxed as a sale. Section 4(15) When a shareholder who holds shares on revenue account sells those shares to the issuing company, the proceeds may be taxed as a dividend. The transaction is also a sale of revenue account property and any profit or loss should be taxable or deductible. Section 4(15)(a) provides that in calculating the amount of assessable income derived on the sale of shares held on revenue account to the issuing company (for example, under section 65(2)(a) or (e)) the sale price is deemed to be reduced by the amount of any dividend arising on sale. The effective result of this calculation is that the shareholder is assessed only on the gain or loss on sale (see example 1 below). Note that if the distribution is a dividend because it is under the thresholds in section 4A(1)(c)(i) or is deemed by the Commissioner to be in lieu of a dividend under section 4A(1)(c)(iii) (rather than because a company has no available subscribed capital), section 85A(e) would generally apply to tax the distribution only as a divi- dend. Section 4(15)(a) would therefore not apply. Example 1 T holds 100 shares in A Co on revenue account. T purchased the shares for $1 each and in December 1994 the company repurchased 75 for their market value of $2.00 per share. The distribution gives rise to a fifteen percent interest reduction and would therefore ordinarily be sourced from subscribed capital. However, A Co has no available sub- scribed capital and the distribution is therefore a dividend. Tís income from the repurchase is: Dividend= $150 Income on sale= Sale price (consideration less dividend) - cost price = ($150 - $150) - $75 = ($75) Total income = $75 ($150 - $75) which equals the gain on sale Note: If A Co had sufficient available subscribed capital to fund the distribution, T would not have received a dividend on the repurchase and the gain or loss on sale would be $75, calculated in the usual way. The reduction in sale price does not apply when divi- dends are exempt under section 63 and when no foreign dividend withholding payment (FDWP) is required to be deducted. Example 2 A Co holds shares in its wholly owned subsidiary B†Co on revenue account. B Co repurchases shares, distributing $100,000 (more than 15% of the market value of B Co). The shares were acquired for $25,000. B Co has no available subscribed capital to fund the distribution. A dividend arises to A Co 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.6 - Company Law Reform (December 1994) but is exempt under section 63. As B Co is resident the dividend is not subject to FDWP. In these circumstances, the dividend is not deducted from the consideration. A Co calculates the gain or loss on sale in the usual way - there is a $75,000 profit on sale. When a foreign company is repurchasing its shares, FDWP may be payable on any dividend arising on the repurchase. When FDWP is paid, (or if a BETA credit balance is used to reduce the amount payable instead), the dividend is deducted from sale proceeds when calculating any gain or loss on sale. To the extent that no FDWP is paid because the distri- bution is covered by underlying foreign tax credits, there is no deduction from sale proceeds when calculat- ing the gain or loss on sale of shares. Section 4(15)(b) Paragraph (b) provides that a revenue account share- holder may be assessed on the proceeds of repurchase of a share even though the proceeds are excluded from the dividend definition. Section 85A Below brightline share repurchase - paragraph (e) When share repurchase proceeds are treated as a dividend because the repurchase either falls below the thresholds in section 4A(1)(c)(i) or is in lieu of a dividend (paragraph (c)(iii)), the shareholder is deemed not to have sold the share. Rather, the distribution is treated solely as a dividend. The cost base of the share sold is not deductible but is transferred to the remaining shares of the class that the shareholder held. This treatment only applies if the shareholder continues to hold shares of the same class, which will generally be the case if a repurchase falls below the brightline. Note that when shares are trading stock that is valued at cost, paragraph (e) will apply in the manner indicated above. However, the provision will not affect trading stock that is valued at market value. Example A purchases 100 shares for $1 each in B Co and holds them on revenue account. The shares are not held as trading stock. B Co makes a pro rata offer to purchase 1 in every 20 shares for their market value of $2.50. The company distributes 5% of its market value and the repurchase proceeds are therefore a dividend. A sells 5 of its shares and therefore receives a $12.50 dividend. A is deemed not to have disposed of the shares. The $5 cost of the repurchased shares is added to the $95 cost of the remaining shares - each remaining share therefore has a cost price of $1.05 per share. Repurchase of share at under market value - paragraph (f) Paragraph (f) applies when there is a repurchase of shares for less than their market value and when the repurchase is treated as a sale (that is, where paragraph (e) does not apply). It provides that, in such circum- stances, only part of the cost of the repurchased shares is deductible. The remainder is added to the cost base of the remaining shares and will be deductible when those shares are sold. This prevents shareholders from deriving artificial losses on sale of shares at below market value to the issuing company. The formula that transfers part of the cost from a share disposed of to the remaining shares is set out in para- graph (f): a - (b x c/d) In this formula: a is the cost of the repurchased share b is the aggregate cost of all the shareholderís shares of the same class before repurchase c is the consideration derived by the shareholder from the company on repurchase of the share. Note that this is always the gross consideration - not the net concept derived by applying section 4(15) d is the market value of all the shareholderís shares in the same class before the repurchase In effect, this formula links the allowable deduction for the cost of shares sold to the percentage of the share- holderís interest that is sold. For example, if a share- holder is disposing of 5% of the value of its interest in a class, a deduction should be permitted for 5% of the cost of shares it holds in that class. This is illustrated below. Example 1 A Co bought 100 shares for $1 each in B Co and holds them on revenue account. They are not trading stock. At 1†December 1994, B Co buys back 25 shares at $0.50 per share. The market value of each share is $2.50. The distribution is not a dividend, but is sourced from subscribed capital as it is a ìfifteen percent interest reductionî. A Co calculates the loss or gain on sale as follows: Cost per share:$1.00 Amount excluded from cost: $1 -= $0.80 ($100 x $0.50) $250 Adjusted cost of share disposed of$0.20 A Co is disposing of $12.50/$250 of its interest, or 5% of the market value of the interest. The aggre- gate allowable cost deducted is $5 ($0.20 x 25), or 5% of the total cost of all the shares. Alternatively, this may be seen as A Co disposing of shares at 20% of their value and being able to claim only 20% of their cost. The gain on sale is therefore $7.50 (sale price ($0.50) - cost ($0.20) = $0.30 per share x 25). The cost price of the remaining shares increases to $1.26 per share ($95/75 shares), or $95 in total. 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.6 - Company Law Reform (December 1994) Example 2 - Shares as trading stock Assume that A Co now treats the shares as trading stock that is valued at cost. Opening balance($100.00) Repurchase of 25 shares at $0-50 each $ 12.50 Closing balance (cost of remaining shares ($75) plus 85A adjustment ($20) (being $0.80 x 25 shares repurchased)) $ 95.00 Net income$ 7.50 Example 3 - repurchase proceeds are a dividend because there is no available subscribed capital Assume that B Co in Example 2 has no available subscribed capital remaining and the $12.50 distributed on repurchase is therefore a dividend. Paragraph (e) does not apply. The tax consequences of the transaction are as follows: Income: dividend$12.50 Loss on sale($ 5.00) Net income$ 7.50 The loss on sale is calculated as follows: Gain/loss on sale per share = sale price - cost price Sale price (under s.4(15))= consideration - dividend = $12.50 - $12.50 = 0 Cost price= cost - 85A adjustment Adjustment($100 x $0.50) per share$250 = $1 - = $0.80 Cost price per share= $0.20 ($1 - $0.80) Loss on sale= 0 - $0.20 = ($0.20) per share x 25 = ($5) Resident withholding tax - section 327C Minor changes have been made to the provisions relating to resident withholding tax on bonus issues. Resident withholding tax on all taxable bonus issues except bonus issues in lieu is to be calculated under section 327C(1)(c) according to the following formula: x b - c a 1 - a () In this formula: a =the rate of resident withholding tax, currently .33 b =the amount of dividend paid c =any foreign withholding tax, imputation or FDWP credits For the purposes of item b of the formula, the dividend paid is the amount that the company elects under section 3(3) (see also section 4(6)). That amount is credited to available subscribed capital (item b(ii) of that definition). Example A Co resolves and elects to make an unimputed taxable bonus issue of $10,000. Resident withhold- ing tax to be paid on the bonus issue is calculated as follows: .33/.67 x $10,000 = $4,925 This results in $4,925 of tax being paid on $14,925 of gross income (being the net dividend of $10,000 and RWT of $4,925). Paragraph (1)(d) has been redrafted as it now applies only to a bonus issue in lieu. 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.6 - Company Law Reform (December 1994) Summary flowcharts - tax treatment of share repurchases Off-market share repurchases Is repurchasing company resident in NZ? 1 Are shares repurchased treasury stock? 1 Is reserve profile known? 1 Does company have available subscribed capital? 1 Are shares re-sold within one year? 1 No gain/loss to be returned on sale, do not adjust available subscribed capital 1 Does company have available subscribed capital? 1 Debit company’s imputation credit account 1 Debit company’s available subscribed capital 1 Is repurchase in lieu of dividend? 1 Are shares non-participating redeemable shares? 1 Is it a pro-rata repurchase? 1 Repurchase is not a dividend to shareholder 1 Is shareholder’s interest reduced by less than 15%? 1 Is the repurchase less than 10% of market value? 1 Is the repurchase less than 15% of market value? 1 Has Commissioner approved repurchase as non-taxable? 1 Repurchase is not a dividend to shareholder 1 Repurchase is a dividend to shareholder 1 Start here 1 YES NO YES NO NO YES NO YES YES NO NO YES YES NO NO YES NO YES YES NO NO YES YES YES NO NO Repurchase is a dividend to shareholder 1 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Six, No.6 - Company Law Reform (December 1994) On-market share repurchases 55 Are repurchased shares treasury stock? 1 Are repurchased shares sold within one year? 1 Does company have available subscribed capital? 1 Debit repurchase proceeds against available subscribed capital 1 Repurchase proceeds taxable to company.
