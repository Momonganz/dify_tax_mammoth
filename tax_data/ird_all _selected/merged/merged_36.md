The document does not comment on or evaluate the content of the feedback or the practicality of any suggestions. 1.2 Most of the feedback received in consultation workshops closely mirrored the views expressed in written submissions. Structure of the document 1.3 The document is arranged in chapters and sections that broadly reflect those in the discussion document. Each chapter begins with a brief introduction and description of the relevant options, and then a summary of feedback and more detailed comments on the options. 1.4 The views expressed in this document are not identified by author. The main reason for this is that some organisations have not specified their membership numbers and so weightings can not be assigned to their views. Attempts to assign weightings across categories of submissions would be imprecise and potentially misleading. Discussion document proposals 1.5 The discussion document, Tax incentives for giving to charities and other non-profit organisations, was released on 16 October 2006 as part of the government’s Confidence and Supply Agreement with United Future, to develop a new tax rebate regime for charities during the current term of Parliament. 1.6 Measures included in the discussion document were: Individual tax rebate for donations • raising the threshold at which the rebate is capped; • increasing the rate of the rebate claim; or • a combination of both. 2 Company deduction for donations • increasing the company deduction limit; and • extending the company deduction to close companies not listed on a recognised stock exchange. Māori authority deduction for donations • increasing the Māori authority deduction limit. A volunteers’ rebate • introducing tax relief for volunteers in the form of a tax rebate to recognise the value of the time given by volunteers to charities registered with the Charities Commission which, like the tax rebate for cash donations, would be subject to limitations; or • as an alternative to the volunteers’ rebate, providing grants directly to charitable organisations. Reimbursement payments to volunteers and honoraria recipients • clarifying the uncertainties in the tax treatment of reimbursement payments to volunteers and honoraria recipients and reducing their compliance costs. 1.7 The discussion document also examined other tax initiatives for encouraging charitable giving such as the United Kingdom’s gift aid scheme, Australia’s prescribed private funds scheme, tax relief for non-cash donations, and work- place giving. 1.8 Feedback was also sought on what further measures could be employed to encourage increased generosity and to support any tax measures that might arise out of this discussion document. Consultation process 1.9 Following the release of the discussion document a series of information workshops were held in the five main centres, Wellington, Christchurch, Dunedin, Hamilton and Auckland. About 300 people including individuals, tax practitioners and representatives from charitable, community and voluntary organisations attended these workshops. 1.10 The purpose of these workshops was to ensure that as many people as possible were well-informed about the content of the discussion document and to mobilise people to make a submission. The workshops were arranged and hosted by local Tangata Whenua, community and voluntary sector groups. 3 1.11 The following people chaired and facilitated the consultation workshops: • Tina Reid, New Zealand Federation of Voluntary Welfare Organisations and Robyn Scott, Philanthropy New Zealand – Wellington. • Sharon Torstonson, Christchurch Council of Social Services – Christchurch. • Sue Russell, Dunedin Council of Social Services – Dunedin. • Dr Bev Gatenby, Trust Waikato – Hamilton. • Jennifer Gill, ASB Community Trust – Auckland. 1.12 Charles Ngaki from Inland Revenue presented an overview of the discussion document and answered questions from the floor. Tina Reid and Robyn Scott provided extra support and facilitation at the workshops. 1.13 A record of the feedback from each of these workshops was taken. Where appropriate this feedback has been reflected in this document. This feedback can be viewed on the New Zealand Federation of Voluntary Welfare Organisations’ website at http://www.nzfvwo.org.nz/ Submissions 1.14 A total of 229 submissions were received. These are listed numerically in Appendix A. 1.15 A wide range of people and organisations made submissions, including individual donors, charities and other non-profit organisations, sector advisors, tax specialists, crown entities and overseas organisations involved in the charitable community. 1.16 Written submissions were from a wide range of people and organisations as shown in Table 1: Table 1 Category of submitter Number Government – Culture and recreation 3 Government – Education and research 1 Government – Social services and emergency/relief 2 Government – Not elsewhere classified 1 Individual 56 4 Tax specialists 4 Advisory organisations to the NFP\* sector (business, legal, financial, communications) 8 NFP – Culture and recreation 13 NFP – Education and research 7 NFP – Health 7 NFP – Social services, and emergency/relief 42 NFP – Environmental / animal protection 4 NFP – Development and housing 12 NFP – Civic and advocacy groups 16 NFP – Philanthropic and other intermediaries 13 NFP - International organisations, aid and relief 7 NFP – Religious congregations and associations 24 NFP – Unions, business and professional associations 5 NFP – not elsewhere classified 0 Overseas – business 2 Overseas – NFP 1 Overseas – individual 1 Total 229 \*NFP – not-for-profit 1.17 The government groups included the New Zealand Police, the Charities Commission, Creative New Zealand and Sport and Recreation New Zealand. 1.18 There were also group submissions presented by: • the 12 community trusts. • the Community Sector Taskforce, which was supported by the New Zealand Federation of Voluntary Welfare Organisations, Volunteering New Zealand, Philanthropy New Zealand, Wellington Māori Service Providers’ Forum and Napier Pilot City Trust. 5 • the New Zealand Federation of Voluntary Welfare Organisations. A number of submitters specifically supported the views of the Federation. CHAPTER 2 Tax rebate for individuals – options 2.1 This chapter summarises feedback on options relating to the current tax rebate for charitable donations discussed in chapter 2 of the discussion document Tax incentives for giving to charities and other non-profit organisations. 2.2 The options being considered are: • raising the donation threshold (currently $1,890) at which the rebate is capped; • increasing the rate (currently 33 1/3 cents in the dollar) of the rebate claim; or • a combination of both. 2.3 The government also sought feedback on whether the tax rebate should be changed to a tax deduction. 2.4 Feedback was also sought on the following matters: • Are the current rebate threshold and rate a constraint on the money that individuals donate? • If the tax rebate is retained, should the government raise the donations threshold, increase the rate, or do both? • What would be an appropriate level for the donations threshold and rate? Summary of feedback 2.5 A total of 188 submitters (or 82 percent) commented on the options relating to the individuals’ tax rebate. 2.6 Table 2 shows the responses received on each option. Table 2 Retain existing rebate Raise threshold Increase rate Combination of both Move to a tax deduction Supported 61 101 70 39 14 Opposed 14\* 1 11 Nil 14 \* The number that supported a tax deduction mechanism 7 2.7 The general themes expressed in feedback on these options were that: • the existing rebate should continue in its present form and not be changed to a tax deduction. The present rebate has the advantage of simplicity and is more beneficial to donors overall; • the current donations threshold and rate are a constraint on the money that individuals donate. Neither the threshold nor the rate provide significant incentive to change behaviour for meaningful gifting. If the rebate is retained, a significant liberalisation of the rebate is needed if it is to have any impact on the level of charitable giving in New Zealand; • there is no principled reason for having a limit on the dollar amount eligible for tax relief. The donations threshold should be removed; • enhancements to the existing rebate should be made immediately and should not be delayed while more complex and radical options are investigated further; and • enhancements to the existing rebate should not be substituted for any personal tax rate reductions or the implementation of the initiatives contained in the Business Tax Review. Option: Retain existing rebate 2.8 A total of 61 submissions (32 percent) who commented on the rebate options preferred retaining the existing rebate arrangement rather than moving to a tax deduction mechanism. They considered that the existing rebate is: • simple and user-friendly – retaining the existing rebate would minimise complexity and compliance costs; and • fair – the value of the donation is the same regardless of the donor’s income level. Option: Raise threshold 2.9 A total of 101 submissions (54 percent) who commented on the rebate options supported raising the threshold. The majority of these indicated that should the removal of the threshold be considered too radical then it should be significantly increased. 2.10 Submissions also supported inflation-proofing and periodical review of the threshold. 2.11 Table 3 shows the specific responses received on this option. Table 3 No amount specified Amount specified Inflation proof Percentage of gross income Comment 34 47 10 10 8 2.12 The suggested thresholds ranged from $2,120 to $20,000, with the most frequently suggested threshold being $5,000. 2.13 One submission considered there should be no change to the threshold. Remove threshold 2.14 Feedback from consultation workshops strongly favoured removing the threshold (cap) altogether. This view came through in written submissions with 107 submissions (57 percent) who commented on the rebate options supporting the removal of the donations threshold. 2.15 The main reasons advanced by participants at the consultation workshops and submitters were. • Encourage greater giving. More people would be encouraged to give (thereby increasing take-up especially by high-wealth individuals) and give more. • Consistency with overseas jurisdictions. Removing the cap would bring New Zealand into line with both the United Kingdom and Australia. There has been a sizable growth in charitable donations in Australia since the move to a “no cap” environment. From 1997 to 2003 giving of money by individuals increased by 58 percent. • Charitable donations should be tax-exempt. Income donated to a charity, like income derived by the charity itself, is income dedicated for charitable purposes and, on that basis, should not be subject to income tax. • Equivalence with trust treatment. The effective non-imposition of income tax on income dedicated to charity after derivation can already be achieved by some taxpayers. For example, the current trust rules allow a family trust to make a distribution as “beneficiary income” to a charity free of tax thereby recognising the charities marginal tax rate of zero. There is no policy reason for distinguishing between the tax treatment of donations made by a trust and those made by an individual. • The focus should be on promoting greater giving. The government should not be any more concerned about misuse or abuse of an uncapped rebate, compared with any other type of tax credit/deduction. First and foremost, the focus should be on recognising and promoting greater contributions to charity. Any concern could be mitigated by the registration rules under the Charities Act 2005 (for charities) and there are practical limitations on the amounts that individuals can donate. • Weakness of the existing rebate. The current individual maximum rebate of $630 is easily reached by people in most income brackets and is recognised as one of the weakest tax incentive schemes in the developed world. 9 Several submissions cited the Centre for Global Development’s report Tax policies to promote private charitable in DAC countries, as providing the strongest analysis of how New Zealand compares with 20 other countries. The report’s key finding was that of the 18 countries that offered a targeted income tax incentive, 15 capped eligible donations and of those, New Zealand’s incentive for giving was considered the weakest. The report commented that low caps almost certainly reduced donations in three countries: Denmark, Norway and New Zealand. In comparing New Zealand against the United States, high income earners claimed only 6 percent of total deductions while in the United States, people with income over $100,000 claimed 54 percent of all charitable donations. The report went on to say that the large difference between the two countries might be as a result of the low maximum rebate offered in New Zealand, which is easily reached by people in many income brackets. Such a low ceiling could flatten the overall distribution and restrict the amount donated by high income earners. The report also calculated the relationship between the presence of tax incentives and the increase in charitable giving. It found that New Zealand’s $630 rebate reduced the value of its tax incentive to 16.7 percent, leading to an increase in giving of only 9.5 percent. Australia, where there is no cap, has increased charitable giving by 39.3 percent. • Support the implementation of a payroll giving scheme. Removing the cap would support a payroll giving scheme and reduce compliance costs for employers as there would be no need to monitor the level of employees’ donations. • Valuing the contribution of the charitable, community and voluntary sector. Removing the cap would show the value of giving to charities and other non-profit organisations. Option: Increase rate 2.16 A total of 70 submissions (37 percent) who commented on the rebate options supported increasing the rebate rate. Just 11 submissions considered that the rate should not be raised. 2.17 Some indicated that increasing the rate was less important than raising the threshold. 2.18 Again, there was a range of opinions on the appropriate rebate rate. The most frequently suggested rates and the reasons for them were: • 39%: This rate would ensure that donors on the top marginal tax rate would receive the full tax benefit of their charitable donations. • 45%: Potential donors are likely to make a psychological leap about “getting almost half back” on a rebateable donation. 10 • 50%: This rate would enhance the value of the tax rebate for individuals at all income levels, particularly for taxpayers on the top marginal tax rate who would have more discretionary income to donate. Option: Deduction mechanism for donations by individuals 2.19 The government also proposed an alternative approach to delivering tax relief for charitable donations made by individuals. The approach was to allow individuals to claim a deduction rather than a rebate similar to that allowed before 1 April 1978. 1 Under a deduction mechanism, charitable donations would be deducted from the donor’s pre-tax income. This would mean that the tax value of charitable donations to donors would be determined by the donor’s marginal tax rate. Support for a deduction mechanism 2.20 A total of 14 submissions (7 percent) who commented on the rebate options supported replacing the existing rebate with a tax deduction mechanism. 2.21 The main reasons for supporting a deduction mechanism were: • Fairer for high marginal tax rate donors. The extent of the incentive would depend upon the marginal tax rate of the donor. This could be viewed as “favouring” donors on high marginal tax rates. However, it could be argued that it is equitable that the incentive should reflect the marginal tax rate of the donor as the tax relief is equivalent to the tax that would otherwise be paid by the donor on the amount donated. • Better for increasing overall donations. Donors on high marginal tax rates would be more responsive to incentives for charitable giving, especially given that their discretionary income is likely to be greater than taxpayers on low marginal tax rates and the aim of increasing overall donations to charity would be best achieved in this manner. • Consistent with overseas experience. Australian experience shows that the deduction mechanism is more effective in encouraging greater giving. • Beneficial for donors. Donors receive the tax benefit immediately and would not have to wait until the end of the financial year to make a rebate claim. Furthermore, the current rebate process is cumbersome and involves high compliance costs. • Supports payroll giving. A tax deduction regime would be compatible with payroll giving. 2.22 One submission supported a tax deduction mechanism with no limit on the annual tax deduction. This would ensure that any donations are effectively untaxed. In supporting an unlimited deduction for charitable donations, the submission cited the reasons outlined in paragraph 2.15. 1 The deduction was allowed as a special exemption against income. See section 58 of the Income Tax Act 1976. 11 2.23 In addition, the submission considered that a tax deduction mechanism need not result in non-filing taxpayers having to file an income tax return. For taxpayers filing a tax return, the deduction could be dealt with in that return. For taxpayers who are otherwise non-filing taxpayers, the deduction could be dealt with in the same way as the current tax rebate through a separate claim process. In effect, the taxpayer would be claiming a “tax rebate” determined by their marginal tax rate. This would generally involve a refund of tax already paid through the PAYE system. Opposed to the deduction mechanism 2.24 Fourteen submissions opposed the deduction mechanism. 2.25 The main reasons for opposing the deduction mechanism were: • Inconsistent with past simplification reforms. A tax deduction mechanism would compromise past efforts to simplify and minimise personal income tax return filing obligations in New Zealand. It could potentially result in increased compliance costs for individuals and administration costs for Inland Revenue. • Inequitable for people on low marginal tax rates. It would be inconsistent with the concept of encouraging generosity within the community regardless of a person’s income – that is, the tax benefit of $1 would have the same monetary value. • Lower donations. Changing the claim process for charitable donations could have a negative impact on the level of donations made. Other suggested options 2.26 Some submissions also suggested alternate options for providing tax relief for charitable donations made by individuals. Hybrid rebate/deduction option 2.27 A rebate should apply to donations up to a certain dollar amount at a set rate. Donations in excess of that dollar amount should be eligible for tax deduction. It was suggested that any tax deductions should be unlimited or, if that was too radical, limited to the taxable income of a donor. A range of thresholds were suggested, from $3,000 to $7,500. 2.28 One submission suggested that tax deductions should be available to those who donate more than $100,000 per year through a medium similar to the prescribed private fund rules in Australia. This proposal is intended to encourage more large-scale giving from wealthy individuals, a trend seen more recently in Australia. The submission also suggested that the existing rebate threshold be increased to $3,030. 2.29 Another variation on this option was that if a deduction mechanism was implemented, donors with marginal tax rates equal to or below 29% should receive a tax rebate on their donations at the highest marginal tax rate 12 (currently 39%). All other donors should receive a tax rebate at the lowest marginal tax rate (currently 19.5%). Return filing option 2.30 Under this option donors should be able to claim: • a rebate on donations at 33 1/3 percent through the existing tax rebate form if there is no obligation to file an income tax return; and • a tax deduction for donations in their income tax return if they are required to file an income tax return. Given that higher income earners are more likely to be filing income tax returns as a result of other tax obligations such as other investments held or claiming income protection insurance, they would benefit from claiming the donation as a deduction in their returns. Also, many of these people already have existing relationships with tax agents, so their likely compliance costs would remain the same. A family-unit based option 2.31 The donations rebate should be based on the income and donations of the family. The simplest solution would be to double the threshold amount for families. This suggestion would not be required if the donations threshold were removed. Tax credit option 2.32 If the rebate rate were raised, consideration should be given to moving to a tax credit system. The current rebate is more akin to a “refundable tax credit”. CHAPTER 3 Tax deductions for donations by companies and Māori authorities 3.1 This chapter summarises feedback received on tax relief options relating to donating companies and Māori authorities. These options were discussed in chapter 2 of the discussion document Tax incentives for giving to charities and other non-profit organisations. 3.2 The options being considered for companies include: • raising the company deduction limit – currently the limit is 5 percent of a company’s net income before deducting any charitable donations; and • extending the company deduction to close companies whose shares are not quoted on any official list of a recognised exchange. 3.3 The option being considered for Māori authorities is to raise the Māori authority deduction limit – currently the limit is 5 percent of a Māori authority’s net income before deducting any charitable donations. 3.4 Views were sought on the following matters, in particular: • Is the current 5 percent limit on donations made by companies and Māori authorities a constraint on their giving and, if so, what would be an appropriate limit to encourage further donations by companies and Māori authorities? • If the company deduction for donations was extended to close companies not listed on a recognised stock exchange, what concerns might need to be dealt with? Summary of feedback 3.5 A total of 133 submissions commented on the company deduction options. The general themes expressed on these options included: • The deduction limit should be removed. Sixty nine percent of submissions (or 92 submissions) who commented on the company deduction options strongly favoured removal of the current deduction limit. • Close companies should be eligible for the company deduction for charitable donations. • While the deduction alone would not instantly make a company want to support a charity it sends a clear message to companies that giving to charities and other non-profit organisations is something that society supports and encourages. 14 • Government support is essential for encouraging greater corporate giving. For example, the UK government has shown an awareness of the need to support smaller companies by reducing compliance costs and rewarding generosity within a simplified tax structure. • These measures are not about providing tax breaks for companies, but rather they recognise that the business sector is a huge source of giving in New Zealand. • Some companies become “sponsors” of charities to get a more tax efficient outcome for “donations” they make to charities. These donations are made in the form of sponsorship or advertising expenditure, which is tax deductible and not subject to any deduction limit. 3.6 A total of 59 submissions commented on the Māori authority deduction option. The general themes expressed in feedback were that: • the treatment of Māori authorities should be consistent with the tax treatment of individuals and companies and that any cap on giving should be removed. Fifty submissions strongly favoured removal of the current limit; and • the system of tax relief for Māori authorities should be simple. 3.7 Table 4 shows the responses received on the each of the options. Table 4 Raise company deduction limit Extend company deduction to close companies Raise Māori authority deduction limit Supported 42 88 15 Opposed 1 1 1 Option: Raise deduction limit for companies 3.8 A total of 42 submissions (32 percent) who commented on the company deduction options supported raising the limit. The majority indicated that should the removal of the limit not be possible, then the threshold should be raised. 3.9 The most common suggested rate was 10 percent. 3.10 Alternative views were that: • the deduction should be changed to a percentage of turnover but the deduction should be disallowed if it creates a loss; 15 • if the government wishes to retain a limit on the deduction, the reference to “net income” should be changed because currently companies in a loss position are not allowed any level of deduction for donations; • the limit should be the amount of the assessed and paid income tax for the previous financial year; and • the limit should not be less than 10 percent of gross income. 3.11 One submission opposed any change in the deduction limit on the grounds that the current limit was sufficient. Remove deduction limit 3.12 Feedback from consultation workshops strongly favoured removing the current limit (cap) on company donations to charities and other non-profit organisations. Ninety two submissions (69 percent) who commented on the company deduction options also supported removing the deduction limit. The main reasons were: • Consistency with overseas regimes. Abolishing the cap would bring New Zealand into line with the United Kingdom and Australia, both of which have been successful in increasing a culture of giving. In particular, Australia has found that since removing the cap on corporate donations companies have changed the way they give – that is, providing “untagged” donations rather than specific sponsorship. • Income dedicated to charity should be exempt. There is no principled reason for having a cap on the amount companies can donate and claim as a deduction. The focus should be on where the donation is going, rather than limiting the tax offset the donor can gain. • Deduction no different than any other. The government should be no more concerned about misuse or abuse of this concessionary deduction, than with any other type of deduction. First and foremost, the focus should be on recognising and promoting greater contributions to charity. • Regulation under the Charities Act 2005 should minimise avoidance concerns. Any compliance concerns are also mitigated by the registration rules under the Charities Act 2005. The deduction could be made available for donations to charities registered under that Act only. (If the deduction is to be available for donations to non-charitable entities, then the registration regime could be expanded to apply to those entities.) • Equivalence with sponsorship treatment. Removal of the cap is required to establish a level tax playing field between the tax treatment of sponsorship payments and donations made to charities and other non-profit organisations. The availability of the concessionary tax deduction for bona fide donations to charity avoids the need to limit corporate contributions to charity to sponsorship or similar expenditure in order to achieve deductibility. Furthermore, adding back an amount that is not deductible because the company is in a loss position is 16 inconsistent with most accounting systems – that is, the donations would have to be separately traced outside the system to ensure they are not inadvertently claimed despite the loss. The cost to charities and other non-profit organisations is much greater in a sponsorship funding arrangement than with philanthropic giving, both in terms of time and resources. Often a sponsor would require brand loyalty and significant promotional opportunities and sponsorship tends to benefit larger organisations rather than smaller ones. Philanthropic giving by companies should be encouraged and made easier through the tax system. • Equivalence with the tax treatment of trusts. Income derived using a company structure should be able to be dedicated to charity in a tax- efficient manner, as in the case of income derived by individual taxpayers, under a tax deduction (or rebate) scheme, and income passed through trusts. For example, a trust can nominate a charity as a beneficiary and can distribute pre-tax income to that charity as beneficiary income, so that no income tax would be paid on that income (unless it is dividends received). • Avoid unnecessary limitations. Natural limits and safeguards already operate, including the constitution of the company, shareholder accountability, criteria for donee organisation status and the profit motive – the need to stay in business. The current unlimited deduction for sponsorship restricts the charitable giving of companies. Removing the cap would widen the range of public benefits that can be supported by companies. Option: Extend company deduction to close companies 3.13 A total of 88 submissions (67 percent) who commented on the company deduction options supported extending the companies deduction to close companies not listed on a recognised stock exchange. The main reasons advanced by submitters were: • Maximising the potential for corporate donations to charity. Close companies are a potentially significant source of financial support for charities and other non-profit organisations given that the majority of New Zealand companies are close companies. This is an untapped area, as there are a number of wealthy individuals and family trusts that use company structures. Furthermore, close companies generally have strong sympathy with the communities in which they operate. Therefore, they are more likely to donate to charities closer to the shareholders’ convictions – for example, helping the arts in Wanganui or establishing a women’s refuge in Timaru. • Current exclusion is discriminatory. There is no principled reason for treating unlisted, close companies differently. Any potential avoidance or compliance concerns are misplaced. 17 • The focus should be on encouraging greater giving. The government should be no more concerned about misuse or abuse of this concessionary deduction compared with any other type of deduction. First and foremost, the focus should be on recognising and promoting greater contributions to charity. An implication of the comment that close companies are not subject to the same degree of public scrutiny as public companies, is that “sweetheart” deals might be made between companies and charities enabling excessive deductions to be claimed by companies. One submission did not accept that reputable charities would enter into arrangements that enabled companies to obtain excessive deductions. The whole provision is one that was first enacted in a different era and one that reflects a paternalistic approach to the deduction of charitable donations by companies. A separate disclosure could be required in the IR 4 return to detect any tax avoidance. • Market regulation. Companies are accountable to shareholders and the market should regulate the amount of deductions that are claimed by companies. 3.14 Other views expressed on this option were that: • there should be a limit on the amount of the deduction for close companies based on net income after adding back shareholders’ salaries. This would in effect raise the donation threshold as families would be able to donate as individuals as well as through their company; and • the normal receipting procedures as required by an individual should be applied, and monitored and audited by Inland Revenue in the normal manner. Any company donations to these charities, cash, shares or employees’ time, should give the company a 1:1 tax break. 3.15 One submission opposed the extension on the basis that close companies are in essence “incorporated individuals” and that it is not appropriate that such individuals gain a tax benefit (both as an individual and by way of their corporate form) that is not available to others. Suggested option: Tax relief for non-cash gifts 3.16 A total of 16 submissions (12 percent) who commented on these options also suggested providing tax relief for non-cash items provided by companies. Specific comments were: • companies receive frequent requests to provide surplus stock, staff time (such as through an Employee Volunteer Programme) and the use of their premises; • companies should be given some form of financial reward (reimbursement rebate) for allowing their staff to volunteer during work hours; 18 • tax incentives for companies which seek to sponsor charities and other non-profit organisations should be explored; and • any compliance concerns are also mitigated by the registration rules under the Charities Act 2005. The deduction could be made available for donations to charities registered under that Act only. If the deduction is to be available for donations to non-charitable entities, then the registration rules could be expanded to apply to those entities. Option: Raise deduction limit for Māori authorities 3.17 A total of 15 submissions (25 percent) who commented on the Māori authority deduction option supported raising the deduction limit. The most common suggested rate was 10 percent. 3.18 One submission opposed any change in the deduction limit but no discernible reason was given. Remove deduction limit 3.19 A total of 50 submissions (85 percent) who commented on this option would support removal of the company deduction limit. CHAPTER 4 Recognising the contribution of volunteers 4.1 This chapter summarises the feedback received on the volunteers’ rebate and the alternative option of a grant, which were discussed in chapter 3 of the discussion document Tax incentives for giving to charities and other non- profit organisations. 4.2 In recognising the vital contribution that volunteers make to New Zealand society, the government sought feedback on the desirability of introducing a tax rebate for individuals who donate their time to charities, in recognition of the value of the time they donate (the volunteers’ rebate). 4.3 Volunteers would be eligible for the rebate if they give their time to a charity registered with the Charities Commission. 2 Volunteers would be able to claim the rebate provided they have a declaration certificate (such as a receipt) from the registered charity to which they have volunteered their time. The declaration certificate would show the number of hours volunteered. 4.4 Like the current tax rebate, the volunteers’ rebate would be subject to limitations. The number of hours a volunteer could claim for the tax rebate would be capped and a nominal hourly rate would be set. The hourly rate would be the same for every volunteer rather than based on factors such as individual expertise. 4.5 The declaration certificate would be used by a volunteer to claim the rebate through the current donations claim process. Like the donations rebate, a volunteers’ rebate would be available only if the volunteer had derived a certain amount of taxable income for the year. 4.6 Instead of providing a rebate to recognise the value of volunteers’ time, the government could direct the funds to charitable organisations. Grants could be made on the same basis as the volunteers’ rebate – that is, based on the number of volunteers in the organisation and the number of hours volunteered, with a cap on the number of hours eligible for the rebate. Alternatively, grants could be given to selected charities that have a high level of volunteering. 4.7 The key difference between providing grants and providing a tax rebate is that government funds would be directed to charities instead of volunteers. 4.8 Feedback was sought on the following matters, in particular: • Should a rebate for recognising volunteers’ time be adopted, even though the rebate may be viewed as inconsistent with the notion of volunteering? 2 The registration requirements for charities are set out in annex B. 20 • If it were adopted, what should the nominal hourly rate be and how should it be set? • Likewise, what should be the limit on the number of hours in a year and how should it be set? • Should the rebate form part of the current donation rebate or be in addition to the current donation tax rebate for individuals? • Should the rebate be limited to volunteers who give their time to charities that are registered with the Charities Commission only? • Should the rebate be limited to specific activities and, if so, what activities should be covered? • Would a grant system be a better alternative to the volunteers’ rebate? Summary of feedback 4.9 A total of 173 submissions commented on the volunteers’ rebate and the grant mechanism. A large number of these submitters neither supported nor opposed the rebate but raised concerns about it. Table 5 illustrates the responses to the options presented. Table 5 Volunteers’ rebate Grant option Support 45 56 Opposed 50 15 4.10 The vast majority of submissions supported some form of acknowledgement of the contribution that volunteers make. Recognising the contribution of volunteers would have a positive impact on the services that can be provided to the community. 4.11 The volunteers’ rebate was generally viewed as a noble idea that sends a clear message that involvement in the community is a valued part of our culture. However, there were numerous concerns raised. 4.12 There is strong feeling among voluntary organisations that the rebate for volunteers’ time would be so small an amount as to be inadequate or possibly offensive, administratively burdensome, potentially inequitable and, some felt, out of step with the spirit of volunteering. These organisations preferred the grant mechanism over the volunteers’ rebate as a way of recognising volunteers’ time. Option: Volunteers’ rebate Support for the volunteers’ rebate 4.13 A total of 45 submissions (26 percent) who commented on the volunteers’ rebate supported the option. 21 4.14 The main reasons advanced were: • The social value of donated time is just as important as the social value of cash donated. • It is a practical way to recognise the vital and tangible difference that volunteers make to the charitable, community and voluntary sectors. • It would remove barriers to volunteering for some people and help encourage voluntary activity among people who do not currently participate. Nominal hourly rate 4.15 A total of 22 submissions (13 percent) who commented on the volunteers’ rebate answered the question of what the nominal hourly rate should be set at. These responses are shown in Table 6. Table 6 Minimum hourly wage rate Low or $5 More than $10 Other Comment 9 9 1 3 Annual limit on rebateable hours 4.16 A total of 25 submissions (14 percent) who commented on the volunteers’ rebate answered the question of what and how the limit on the number of hours in a year should be. The suggested annual limits ranged from 416 hours to no limit. The responses are shown in Table 7. Table 7 52 hours too low 52 hours More than 100 No limit Comment 1 7 14 3 Minimum level of hours 4.17 A total of 8 submissions (5 percent) considered that there should be a minimum number of hours per year that should be receipted before the volunteer is eligible for the rebate. The main reasons given were that there is a minimum amount for cash donations and such a measure would reduce compliance costs for organisations required to verify voluntary time. Accumulation of voluntary hours 4.18 One submission considered that it should be possible for voluntary hours to be accumulated if volunteers serve more than one organisation. 22 Separate rebate 4.19 A total of 20 submissions (11 percent) answered the question of whether the rebate should form part of the current rebate rules or be in addition to the current rebate. The vast majority of responses were that the rebate should be separate as it relates principally to acknowledging the giving of personal time rather than financial support and, in some cases, would be in addition to existing financial donations. 4.20 It was also considered that the volunteers’ rebate and the cash donations rebate should be claimed on the same return, which would avoid an increase in Inland Revenue paperwork, handling returns and refunds. 4.21 One submission considered that the volunteers’ rebate should form part of the current donation rebate. No reason was given for this view. Limit to volunteers serving charities 4.22 A total of 39 submissions (22 percent) answered the question of whether the rebate should be limited to volunteers who give their time to charities that are registered with the Charities Commission only. 4.23 Eighteen submissions agreed that the volunteers’ rebate should be limited to registered charities for ease of administration. Their view was that the charities registration requirement is appropriate as registered charities will be required track volunteers’ hours anyway so their record-keeping should be more accurate than other organisations. 4.24 Twenty-one submissions disagreed with the restriction for reasons of consistency and equity. There are many groups that rely on volunteers, but might not currently be charities, and may be unable to be registered as charities by the Charities Commission. Careful consideration should be given to aligning the rebate for volunteers’ time to the rebate for cash donations, so that rebates would be available to donors and volunteers and to a common range of qualifying organisations. Furthermore, the proposed restriction increases the incentive for organisations to register with the Charities Commission, where they otherwise would have no need to register. Increasing registration numbers would also affect the Charities Commission’s operations and resourcing requirements. Limit rebate to specific activities 4.25 A total of 18 submissions (10 percent) answered the question of whether the rebate should be limited to specific activities and, if so, what activities should be covered. 4.26 One submission considered the rebate should be limited to individuals carrying out the duties of President/Chairperson, Secretary and Treasurer of a donee organisation. Finding volunteers with the skills to carry out these duties is frequently very difficult. Some form of tax incentive might provide encouragement, particularly to people on lower incomes. People on higher incomes could choose to donate the tax saving to the organisation. The 23 donee organisation could provide a certificate to the taxpayer to file with his or her return for verification purposes. 4.27 Another submission considered that the rebate should be limited to fundraising, office administration and social assistance activities only. 4.28 Sixteen submissions opposed limiting the rebate to specific activities on the basis that it would favour certain activities over others, creating a distortion in volunteering towards the more favoured activities. Opposed to the volunteers’ rebate 4.29 A total of 50 submissions (29 percent) that commented on the volunteers’ rebate option opposed the rebate. Concerns with the volunteers’ rebate 4.30 A total of 92 submissions (53 percent) raised concerns with the volunteers’ rebate. These concerns were: • Further consideration and separate review. The rebate should be the subject of a separate review so more time could be devoted to developing and considering the options further. • Inconsistent with the notion of volunteerism. “Volunteering is an activity that is undertaken by one’s own free will, choice or cultural obligation, unpaid, for the betterment of the common good”. The rebate was viewed as downgrading volunteerism and inconsistent with the altruistic nature of most volunteers. There was also concern that the volunteers’ rebate would change the basis of volunteering from “community service” to one “for revenue”. This would have a profound effect on the charitable sector and should be approached very cautiously. • Unfair. The requirement to register with the Charities Commission would mean that many volunteers who give their time to organisations such as Meals on Wheels or the Fire Service would be excluded and therefore not qualify for the rebate. So too would those who volunteer their time informally, such as helping out elderly neighbours. It is essential that there is both clarity and uniformity in the tax treatment of volunteer work and equal recognition and support for those who volunteer, regardless of the way they do so. It was suggested that the rebate should be given to volunteers of those organisations that have donee organisation status. The eligibility criteria should be weighted towards public or community benefit and enable groups of entities that have common rules of association and purpose to be registered collectively. For example, it is estimated that there are approximately 500,000 volunteers in the sport and recreation sector in New Zealand. These volunteers would likely be ineligible, depending on whether the sport organisation was a registered charity. 24 • Administratively burdensome. The rebate would impose significant compliance costs on registered charities as they would be required to record, verify and document the hours given by their volunteers. There could be circumstances where it is difficult to distinguish between participation and volunteering – for example, a person may attend a meeting out of interest, but also make an intellectual contribution in the form of information or advice that contributes to the outcome of the meeting. This is particularly true for kaumatua, who attend many hui. The administration of the rebate would adversely affect smaller voluntary organisations. For example, one submission noted that it could have more than 500 people contributing different amounts of time and energy to a particular project. Keeping a list of who and how many hours they worked would be a huge extra load on an organisation’s administrator(s). Compliance costs would outweigh the benefits. • Creates a low-paid workforce. The rebate blurs the distinction between paid work and volunteering. A rebate is a kind of payment for voluntary work, and is contrary to the idea of volunteerism. One submission asked whether charities would have to treat volunteers as employees for certain purposes such as the payment of ACC levies. • Potential for abuse. The rebate could be open to corruption or abuse and could be hard to monitor and corroborate information on volunteers’ hours. • No income. The volunteers’ rebate discriminates against volunteers who do not have income. Volunteering is a common means of giving for those who have little or no income. It would be disingenuous and discriminatory to recognise only the efforts of those who are taxable. 4.31 Other relevant comments on the volunteers rebate included: • The rebate seems to be a payment for “inputs” rather than the expected “outputs” required by government. • Many volunteers are reluctant to give accurate measures of time spent on their volunteer work, as they see it as downgrading the spirit of generosity. • The rebate is unlikely to increase the time, in aggregate, that volunteers contribute and would be an inappropriate application of government revenue. • Treasurers (and other officers) of charitable entities should be protected from liability in relation to any certificate they provide. One submission suggested that there be an exclusion of liability for an officer that relies on a certificate provided by the volunteer himself or herself. • There is a need to ensure that recognition of volunteers’ contribution to charities and other non-profit organisations do not generate additional compliance costs. There should be some financial support from government to cover operational aspects of reporting. 25 • The benefit of the volunteers’ rebate rests with the volunteer and not the charity or non-profit organisation. Option: A grant 4.32 A total of 22 submissions (13 percent) that commented on the volunteers’ rebate specifically stated that the provision of a grant to the organisation itself would be a better alternative to the volunteers’ rebate. Two submissions disagreed. Support for the grant option 4.33 A total of 56 submissions (32 percent) that commented on the volunteers’ rebate preferred a grant option over the volunteers’ rebate. The main reasons for supporting a grant were: • A grant would allow organisations more flexibility and creativity in how they recompensed or reimbursed volunteers. It would be a positive step away from paying them for their time towards rewarding them for their efforts. • Providing grants to the organisations would be consistent with the notion of volunteerism. • The grant model used in the United Kingdom provides non-profit organisations with small grants to cover the costs incurred by volunteers and the host organisations. It is a simple method that ensures volunteering is not costly to anyone involved. This model could offer useful support to the community and voluntary sector in New Zealand. • The grant should be dedicated to covering the costs of supporting and valuing an organisation’s volunteers. • The grant would involve lower compliance costs than a volunteers’ rebate. Grant applications should account for money received in the previous period. Random audits, with penalties for abuse, might be necessary to ensure compliance. The grant option would address several limitations associated with the volunteers’ rebate. 4.34 Other comments on the grant option were: • Grant recipients should be able to use the grant for any purpose they choose. • A portion of the grant should be dedicated to specified purposes such as to reimburse the costs of volunteers. • A discretionary fund should be established to offer grants to those organisations not registered with the Charities Commission. 26 • The grant should be set at a low level so that charities and other non- profit organisations do not rely on the grant as their main source of income. The grant should also be capped – it was suggested that for a local organisation the grant should be capped at $10,000 and for national organisations $25,000. • The grant system should be added to an existing funding scheme, such as COGS. • The definition of “volunteer” might be problematic. • The grant should be generous enough to justify the costs involved in complying with the grant system. • The proposal to base the grant amount on the number of volunteers serving a particular organisation and the number of hours volunteered is reasonable but it also should take account of the type of voluntary activity. Some involve greater travel and other costs. Such a consideration would ensure that resources are directed to where they are needed and makes organisations accountable for their activities and any volunteers they work with to deliver them. One submission suggested that an average cap of 200 hours per volunteer should be used to compute the grant. • Administration of the grant should be streamlined, simple and accessible. Opposed to the grant option 4.35 A total of 15 submissions (9 percent) who commented on the volunteers’ rebate opposed the grant mechanism. The main reasons were: • The grant would reward the charity rather than the individual volunteer. It would not provide an incentive for people to participate in voluntary work. • The charity or voluntary organisation would be making their own submission on volunteers’ time to receive a direct benefit which could be open to misuse. • There could be potential ethical dilemmas if charities actively sought volunteers to replace paid staff. • The grant would change the basic fundamentals of volunteering and could result in compliance costs for organisations and administration costs for Inland Revenue • The grant would too closely tie the charitable sector to government; it would create “golden handcuffs” constraining the government and the sector. 27 Other ways of recognising volunteers’ contribution 4.36 Submitters put forward other ways of recognising volunteers’ contribution, including: Tax deduction for a volunteers’ time 4.37 A tax deduction for a volunteer’s time, rather than a rebate should be adopted. The amount of the deduction should be calculated using the average hourly wage rate. The deduction should be in addition to the current rebate for cash donations. Charities (voluntary time) rebate 4.38 One submission suggested that charities should be paid a “rebate” based on a percentage of their certified/audited operational expenses. 4.39 Another submission suggested that such a rebate could be claimed by the charity, with an individual limit, similar to the individual tax rebate, per volunteer. The volunteer and the charity would verify the amount through a form filed by the organisation. The rebate would be taxable in the hands of the charity. Recognise volunteer expenses as a rebate 4.40 If expenses are incurred in volunteering and these are not refunded to the volunteer, they should be counted as part of the volunteers’ rebate. Such a rebate could have an upper cap of say $260, applied where a volunteer made a commitment for a full year and attended training, meetings or delivery of volunteer services on a minimum of 26 occasions during a year. Student loans rebate 4.41 Eight submissions suggested that voluntary work should be able to be offset against a person’s student loan balance. While there may be compliance costs, the measure would provide students with valuable work experience, assisting them towards securing employment and an understanding of the nature of charitable organisations and the work they do. One submitter runs an internship programme which promotes the concept of students spending time assisting with submitter’s work during their study year. Students usually give one or two days a week to undertake specific projects and tasks in the submitter’s office or at events. 4.42 An extension to the student loan idea would be to permit registered charities to enter into contractual arrangements with students who have student loans. This would equate to a job equivalent of a contracted sum that would effectively reduce the size of the loan by the amount of the contracted sum. For example, four weeks of physiotherapist work at $12.50 per hour for 37.5 hours per week would reduce the physiotherapist’s student loan by $1,875. 28 Rebate for annual leave taken for voluntary activities 4.43 Three submissions suggested that people who use their annual leave to undertake voluntary activities should be eligible for some form of tax incentive – for example, by allowing a tax deduction equal to the monetary value of the annual leave in the tax calculations of volunteer employees. 4.44 The records required to support this tax incentive would be kept by the volunteer and provided in the event that they were to undergo an Inland Revenue audit of their annual tax calculation. Volunteers would need to keep sufficient details of the organisation they volunteered with, the work carried out and would need to submit a claim to Inland Revenue to have the deduction included in their annual tax calculations. 4.45 As with any benefit granted through the tax system, there is a risk that some participants would take advantage of the system. However, there are natural limitations on employers granting excessive leave to fund volunteer work: labour is in short supply. Community leave 4.46 This option would give employees paid leave to volunteer their services to a non-profit organisation. Rebate for employers who allow volunteers time off work on pay 4.47 Under this option an employer rebate would be provided to employers who release their employees on full pay to deliver volunteer services or undergo volunteer training. The rebate could be calculated on an hourly rate and have an upper cap. Recognise volunteer training and study as a tax rebate 4.48 Tax incentives should be available to the volunteers who undertake training programmes and study towards NZQA programmes. This measure would encourage continued education in the field as well as making the volunteers feel supported and valued in their roles. Overseas volunteer schemes 4.49 Recognition and encouragement of volunteers should not be limited to financial reforms only. Volunteering is recognised as an excellent pathway to new skills and employment and programmes supported by the government are a way to ensure the ongoing wellbeing of the economy as well as that of the voluntary sector. Programmes such as Austria’s Volunteer Passport scheme or the UK’s Millennium Challenge are simple, yet successful models which New Zealand could consider adopting. GST 4.50 Volunteers should be able to claim tax and GST deductions against their overall income in a similar way to any self-employed person. 29 Income support 4.51 Volunteers that work with and on behalf of charities delivering services and carrying out assignments that under normal circumstances would involve paid staff should receive a fixed allowance in keeping with existing provisions applying to recipients of income support. CHAPTER 5 Reimbursement payments to volunteers and honoraria recipients 5.1 This chapter summarises feedback on the options for simplifying the tax obligations for people who receive reimbursement payments and honoraria. These options were discussed in chapter 3 of the discussion document Tax incentives for giving to charities and other non-profit organisations. 5.2 The discussion document indicated that the government is already reviewing the tax treatment of reimbursement payments to volunteers and people who receive honoraria from charitable organisations. The feedback received here will form part of that review. 5.3 The options being considered are: • To allow the payer of honoraria to determine what amounts should be exempt from tax – in other words, the amount of income that the recipient would be able to claim as a tax deduction. • To exempt from income tax reimbursement payments below a specified threshold. Volunteers who receive reimbursement payments below the threshold would not have to file income tax returns in respect of those payments. Reimbursement payments over the set amount would be subject to the current tax rules as to whether they constitute income and, if so, how much of the income would be taxable. In that case, it would be necessary for a volunteer to file an income tax return and produce evidence of amounts claimed as deductions. Tax would be payable when there was an element of “profit”. 5.4 Views were sought on the following matters, in particular: • Should honoraria payments up to a certain level be treated as exempt income and what would be an appropriate threshold level? • What should be the set amount under which reimbursement payments to volunteers are considered exempt income? • Should volunteers who receive reimbursement payments over the set amount be required to file an income tax return for the total amount, or only for that part that is over the set amount? Summary of feedback on the options 5.5 A total of 104 submissions commented on the options relating to the tax treatment of reimbursement payments to volunteers and honoraria recipients. These options also attracted considerable attention at all of the consultation workshops. Table 8 shows the breakdown of support for these options. 31 Table 8 Honoraria Reimbursement payments Supported 50 23 Opposed 9 28 5.6 The tax treatment of honoraria and reimbursement payments for volunteer expenses is a significant issue for the voluntary sector. The difficulty in applying a correct tax treatment in this area is a major concern to many people in the sector. It came as a surprise to many in the consultation workshops to learn that if volunteers were to follow the law, they would be declaring reimbursement payments as income with offsetting expenses in a tax return. 5.7 The feedback called for the government to take urgent action on this matter to ensure that the legal framework and requirements are clarified and simplified. 5.8 The current uncertainty of tax treatment and the costs of complying correctly with the law are potential disincentives for volunteering. 5.9 The review of this area of tax law was considered long overdue. Many organisations are currently unwittingly breaking the law, or putting volunteers in the position of breaking the law, if they do not realise that expense payments and honoraria must be declared as income and receipts provided for expenses. 5.10 One of the main points raised in feedback was that volunteers should not be out-of-pocket for giving their time and expertise. Out-of-pocket expenses of volunteers should be tax-free (no returns and no receipts would be required). This treatment would be consistent with the tax treatment of community taskforce allowances. 5.11 Several submissions considered that a legislative amendment is the best way to achieve a result which is clear for organisations and the volunteers concerned. 5.12 Some submissions specifically questioned Inland Revenue’s interpretation of the current law relating to reimbursement payments to volunteers. They considered that a reimbursing payment is not income at law on the basis that it does not have the quality of income in the hands of the recipient. Option: Honoraria Support for the option 5.13 Fifty submissions supported this option. 32 5.14 Twenty-one submissions specified a threshold level. These amounts varied widely. The most commonly suggested thresholds were between $500 and $5,000. Other suggested thresholds were: • $25 per meeting per trustee; • $500 per year for local organisations and $5,000 for national organisations; • $500 and amounts in excess of that threshold should be subject to PAYE; • $5,000 taxed at 19 percent as a final tax; • Payment by way of honoraria or some similar upper limit but that should be set at a realistic level. Opposed to the option 5.15 Nine submissions opposed this option on the basis that: • honoraria should be subject to withholding tax to reflect the fact that such payments are being made for services without the normal fee being charged. These payments are in the nature of income, albeit at a reduced rate and, therefore, should be subject to withholding tax; • honoraria should be tax-exempt; and • taxpayers should not have to file a return if the honorarium is below a certain level. Any excess should be declared in a tax return but only if tax has been deducted at source at the incorrect rate. Taxpayers could choose to voluntarily file a tax return if they wish to claim for their expenses. It should not be the responsibility of the payer to assess whether the payment should be exempt from tax. 5.16 It is also noted that some submissions who commented on the options in this chapter considered that honoraria should be tax-exempt. These submitters, however, did not specifically indicate their view on the honoraria option. Other comments 5.17 Other relevant comments on this option included: • Some organisations have received tax determinations that allow their volunteers (such as school boards of trustees) to not declare expenses and honoraria payments under certain amounts. It is suggested that such a ruling should be applied universally to volunteers, to simplify processes and avoid volunteers unwittingly breaking the law. • Honoraria for substantiated expenses paid to volunteers should be excluded from their taxable income. Each organisation should be allowed to deal with the level of reimbursement and the level of substantiating detail required, under their constitution. It should not be the subject of legislation. 33 • Honoraria recipients incur considerable compliance costs as they are required to lodge income tax returns. This acts as a disincentive for volunteers to be reimbursed for their expenses. • There should be a reduction in the withholding tax deducted from honoraria. • There is a current compliance issue with the tax declaration form IR 330. • Withholding tax should be deducted from the net amount – honorarium less expenses. • The wording of the provision in the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulation 1979 applying to honoraria, should be amended to ensure that it only applies to work done or services rendered and not reimbursement of costs. The current Inland Revenue treatment of travel from one job to another should be amended, as currently, travel between two places of work is not deductible unless both places of work relate to the same job and the job requires that travel. Option: Other reimbursement payments Support for the reimbursement payment option 5.18 Twenty-three submissions supported setting an amount under which reimbursement payments to volunteers should be considered exempt income. They considered that the amount should be reasonably substantial to minimise compliance costs for volunteers. 5.19 The most commonly suggested threshold amounts were between $250 and $5,000. Other suggested thresholds were: • a minimum hourly rate multiplied by 10 or 20 hours per week; • a cap on local organisations of $500 per year and national organisations $2,000, with no requirement to provide proof of expenses; • $10 per day – the cost of a return public transport fare and a lunch if a person lives a short distance from the locality of the charity is easily more then $10; • mileage reimbursement – 62 cents per km or the AA published mileage rates; meals – breakfast at $20, lunch at $15, and dinner at $35; accommodation – reasonable and actual up to a maximum of $100 per night unless paid directly by the volunteer’s agency; • same level as the unemployment benefit. Declaring any amounts over the set amount in tax return 5.20 Two submissions considered that consistent with recent tax simplification reforms individuals should not be required to file tax returns unless their reimbursement payments exceed the set amount. One submission considered that a separate return should be used for amounts over the threshold and such 34 amounts should be subject to a standard rate of tax (33% or 19.5%). This approach would avoid the need for more taxpayers to complete IR3 returns. Opposed to the reimbursement payment option 5.21 Twenty-eight submissions considered that reimbursements of direct costs (out-of-pocket expenses) incurred or necessarily incurred in the course of volunteering activities, on behalf of the organisation, and if properly receipted, should be exempt from tax. 5.22 Six submitters considered that if reimbursement payments to volunteers were exempt, there would be no need to return such income. However, this would not undermine Inland Revenue’s ability to monitor the application of the exemption, by investigating or auditing charities who make these payments. 5.23 One submission specifically stated that reimbursement payments that relate to time should be included in a person’s income tax return as “taxable income”. Other comments 5.24 Other relevant comments on this option included: • Payments in the nature of a reimbursement for costs incurred on behalf of a charity or voluntary organisation should be exempt from tax on the basis that they are not in the nature of income. If the payment merely reimburses an individual for costs incurred on behalf of the organisation it does not confer an additional benefit on the individual and no PAYE or withholding tax obligation should arise. In contrast, however, payments to individuals over and above what is a reasonable reimbursement for costs incurred on behalf of the charity should be subject to the withholding tax rules. • Volunteers should always be able to be reimbursed tax free for reasonable and actual out-of-pocket expenses, such as travel and child care, provided that documentation is received and kept by the charity to support the payment. They should not be required to complete a tax return solely for this purpose. A clear tax ruling should be made to clarify this issue for charities and volunteers. • Reimbursement payments to volunteers should be treated as exempt income, in the same manner as employee reimbursements. The exemption should be based on the income tax exemption for expenditure on account, and reimbursement, for employees under section CW 13 of the Income Tax Act 2004. The exemption proposal could apply to volunteers serving registered charities only. This would mitigate any compliance concerns with the exemption. If the exemption were available for payments made by non-charitable entities, then the charities registration rules could be expanded to apply to those entities. • The necessary legislative changes should be made at the earliest opportunity. 35 Other suggested options 5.25 A better way to recognise volunteers would be to allow a reimbursement of up to $10 a day for travel and other expenses without this becoming taxable income and without a requirement for proof of expenditure. For example, a person who spends $3.80 on bus fares in a situation where the organisation has a travel compensation of $4 or a person who drives to the volunteering placement but has difficulty demonstrating proof of payment about how much petrol was used. Instituting a reimbursement level which was non- taxable would be a tangible recognition of volunteers’ contribution 5.26 Volunteers should be able to claim volunteering expenses that have not been reimbursed by the charity or voluntary organisation, in their tax return. This submission is made on the basis that many organisations cannot refund all volunteer expenses. CHAPTER 6 Tax incentives used in other countries 6.1 This chapter summarises feedback received on the following options: • United Kingdom’s gift aid scheme; • payroll giving; • tax relief for non-cash donations; and • Australia’s prescribed private funds regime. 6.2 Feedback was sought on whether the government should undertake further investigation of these options and their suitability in the New Zealand environment. Summary of feedback on the options 6.3 Table 9 shows the responses received on the options covered in this chapter. Table 9 United Kingdom’s Gift aid scheme Payroll giving Tax relief for non-cash donations Australia’s prescribed private funds Supported 59 95 81 32 Opposed 8 7 2 3 Option: United Kingdom’s gift aid scheme 6.4 Under the United Kingdom’s gift aid scheme the tax paid by the donor on the amount donated can be reclaimed by a registered charity if the donor has provided the charity with a gift aid declaration and the charity can establish an audit trail. 6.5 The amount of the tax that can be claimed back depends on the amount of tax that has been deducted from the income on which a charity is claiming. To reclaim the tax, the charity returns a schedule for each income year listing the donors, the dates of the donations and the amounts donated. The tax to be reclaimed is calculated on the total amount donated and is at the basic tax rate, which is 22%. This means that a donation of £10 made under the scheme would be worth £12.82 to the charity. (The amount of tax that may be reclaimed is 22/78 multiplied by the dollar value of the donation. In the example, the tax to reclaim would be equal to £2.82.) 37 6.6 Donors who pay tax at a rate higher than the basic rate can claim the difference between the higher rate and the basic rate, not claimed by the charity through their own tax return. Since April 2004, donors have been able to give the difference between the higher rate and basic rate directly to a charity, which means that the original donation could be worth even more to the charity. 6.7 There is no limit on the donations that may be claimed or the tax that may be reclaimed by the charity. 6.8 Views were sought on whether the United Kingdom’s gift aid scheme would be more effective than the existing mechanisms for delivering tax relief on charitable donations. Support for further consideration 6.9 Fifty-nine submissions supported further investigation of the gift aid scheme. The main reasons advanced were: • An innovative idea, worthy of further consideration. • Since its inception in 1990, gift aid has been the fastest growing tax effective scheme in the United Kingdom, causing the government to remove the minimum limit for gifts, simplify the paperwork required and make it accessible by phone and internet. Gift aid donations now account for one-third of total giving to charity and in 2004–2005 the total gross amount going to charities via this scheme was £2.8 billion. • International literature overwhelmingly asserts a strong correlation between the “price” of giving and the level of generosity. By lowering the price of donations through gift aid, the UK government has been extremely successful in increasing generosity. Such success has led to the extension of the gift aid programme to include those means of income for charitable organisations not traditionally perceived of as pure “gifts”, such as entry fees to heritage sites, museums and zoos. • The scheme would reduce compliance costs for donors and empower them in their giving, and result in direct tangible receipts to charitable organisations. • It would also address the growing trend for people not claiming the rebate because of the administrative difficulty in doing so (for example, obtaining and keeping receipts and filing a separate claim form) • This scheme could address the inequity for high-rate taxpayers by providing donors who pay a higher tax rate the option to claim the difference between the net rebate rate and their ambient tax rate. 38 Further comment on the gift aid scheme 6.10 Submissions also raised the following matters: • Paying the tax benefit of the donation to the charity should be the donor’s choice. Alternatively, the donor should be required to opt out of the scheme – that is, the donor must request the refund otherwise it goes directly to the charitable organisation. • Placing the onus on charitable organisations to claim the tax benefit of the donation would mean greater compliance costs for these organisations, but there is a tangible return for this. • This scheme would require charitable organisations to collect the IRD numbers of donors but many donors would not be willing to provide their IRD numbers. • A major factor to be considered with the implementation of such a scheme would be the additional fiscal cost for the government. • This scheme could only operate as an alternative to the donation rebate. • The scheme would need to use a 33 1/3 rate with no cap. • Strong promotion of the scheme would be required. • Consideration should be given to an entry-level threshold. Would the gift aid scheme be more effective? 6.11 Thirteen submissions considered that the gift aid scheme would be more effective in encouraging greater giving than the existing rebate system or the other tax incentives raised in the discussion document. Opposed to a gift aid scheme 6.12 Eight submissions opposed the introduction of a gift aid scheme. These submitters favoured retention of the existing rebate system for simplicity and compliance reasons. Option: Payroll giving 6.13 This scheme would be available to any employee who pays income tax through the PAYE system and who chooses to make charitable gifts through an employer-operated payroll system. The employer deducts the amount of the gift from the employee’s salary before deducting tax. The payment is usually passed on to an approved payroll giving agency, which forwards the money to the chosen charity. 6.14 In the countries where a pre-tax payroll giving scheme has been employed there is no limit on the level of donation that can be made for which tax relief may be claimed under this scheme other than the amount of taxable income derived by the donor. 39 6.15 A pre-tax payroll giving scheme is a simple and convenient way for employees to make regular donations through their pay. Donors receive the tax benefit immediately and do not have to wait until the end of the financial year to claim. The recipient organisation benefits from certainty of donations being received on a regular basis and lower administration costs. 6.16 Views were sought on whether payroll giving would provide a better mechanism for promoting charitable giving in New Zealand. Support further consideration 6.17 Ninety five submissions supported further investigation of a pre-tax payroll giving scheme. The main reasons included: • Payroll giving is a significant development and worthy of further consideration. • Payroll giving is one of the most democratic and simple ways for people to give and offers one of the best solutions to the question of how to provide charities and other non-profit organisations with a sustainable source of “untagged” income. Although a handful of New Zealand companies have entered into payroll giving relationships directly with charities, such programmes are in their infancy here and lack the kind of infrastructure required for their support and encouragement. • A key way in which to increase generosity is to make the donor’s opportunity to give as simple and convenient as possible. Payroll giving offers this. • Payroll giving far outweighs traditional forms of giving terms of efficiency for both the individual donor and the recipient charities. In 2005, payroll giving in Australia alone accounted for almost $11 million of extra income to charities, with the total pool growing at between $1 million and $2 million a year. In the United Kingdom it is estimated that payroll giving has increased as a result of the UK government’s “corporate challenge” from £55 million to £86 million. • Payroll giving would have the benefit of normalising the practice of giving among people who have not seen it as their responsibility until now. 6.18 One submission supported the introduction of a form of payroll giving scheme referred to as “KiwiDonor” for employees, which would allow employees to sacrifice salary (pre-tax income) for contributions to charity. The submission identified the following key issues: • Benefits of the scheme: The principal benefits of a payroll giving scheme would be equivalent to those provided under a tax deduction (or rebate) regime, as discussed above. The added benefit of such a scheme is that it would provide a simple and structured mechanism for employees to make regular contributions to charity. The tax effect is also immediate because tax is not imposed at all on income dedicated 40 to charity, and donations do not need to be paid and then claimed back by the donor. • Additional, not alternative: A payroll giving scheme should be facilitated in addition to tax deductions (or tax rebates) for individuals making donations to charity, not as an alternative. However, if considered necessary, the amount of salary sacrifice and deductible (or “rebateable”) donations could be aggregated for the purpose of applying any overall cap on tax relief for monetary contributions to charity. • Compatibility with tax deduction rules: A payroll giving scheme would be compatible with tax deduction rules. Apart from the timing of tax relief, the tax effect of allowing employees to sacrifice salary for contributions to charity would effectively be the same as allowing that person a tax deduction against their income. • Administration: The administration costs would not be prohibitive; the current payroll system should readily facilitate the introduction of a payroll giving scheme. If an employee wishes to contribute to one or two charities, it would be simple enough for payment directions to be made. • Synergies with KiwiSaver: There could be synergies with the new KiwiSaver scheme to be offered by employers. The salary sacrifice scheme might even be conveniently marketed along the lines of KiwiSaver, for example as a “KiwiDonor” scheme. Further comment on a pre-tax payroll giving 6.19 Submissions also raised the following matters: • A cap on the donations rebate would complicate the effectiveness of payroll giving in New Zealand. For example, it is not clear how employers would be expected to track employee’s levels of giving to ensure that the threshold was not exceeded. The infrastructure implemented with the introduction of KiwiSaver could also be used to support payroll giving in New Zealand. To be effective there should be no cap on donations eligible for tax relief. • While it could mean compliance costs for employers this cost would likely only be the establishment cost. If this option were implemented the government should make a contribution towards the employer’s establishment costs. • There could be complications if a donor worked for multiple employers. • It might be difficult for smaller less well known, charities to receive donations from workplace giving. • Organisations seeking to operate a payroll giving scheme should have a minimum number of employees. • There should be some incentive for employers to offer workplace giving to their employees. 41 • The use of an intermediary agency or clearing house would add security and transparency to the process. Inland Revenue could act as the “payroll giving agency”. • Employers could be encouraged by charities to match or top up donations from employees. • Payroll giving should be additional to, and not replace the current rebate for individuals. • Assuming a rebate threshold remains in New Zealand, donations made through payroll giving would be required to be taken out of post-tax income in a similar manner to social club subscriptions, healthcare premiums and superannuation contributions. The existence of a rebate threshold should not operate as an impediment to the introduction of payroll giving. • It is critical that some investment is made by the government even if it is to create an infrastructure that the companies and charities can use if they decided to enter such a relationship. • It is more acceptable to follow the model employed in Australia rather than the United Kingdom. The Australian model is simpler in its structure and more palatable to New Zealand citizens with philanthropic ideas. Would payroll giving be a better mechanism? 6.20 Forty submissions agreed that payroll giving would provide a better mechanism for promoting charitable giving in New Zealand. Payroll giving was considered: • administratively simple for both donors and charitable organisations; • a safe and efficient way for employees to donate and engage with their local community; • a co-ordinated response to numerous unsolicited fundraising calls; and • a stable source of funding that is free of administrative and fundraising costs. Opposed to payroll giving 6.21 Seven submissions opposed the introduction of payroll giving because: • the act of giving should be a conscious decision reaffirmed every time a gift is made; and • it would add to the compliance costs for employers. 42 Option: Tax relief for non-cash donations 6.22 Some countries offer tax relief for non-cash donations. In general, an amount equal to the market value of the non-cash donations (plus miscellaneous costs) is permitted as a deduction against the donor’s gross income. 6.23 Views were sought on whether it would be a good idea to allow non-cash donations to be deductible for tax purposes. Support further consideration 6.24 Eighty-one submissions supported further investigation of tax relief for non- cash donations. The main reasons advanced included: • There are three scenarios where the ability to claim a deduction for non-cash donations would be very favourable: - the donor might not have any readily available cash; - the donor might not be in a financial position to give cash; and - the donor might be able to create something of particular value to the charity. • Businesses would make greater contributions to charitable organisations if gifts in kind were eligible for tax relief. • Overseas experience suggests that valuations of non-cash donations such as land, shares and equipment can be undertaken. One submission considered it would not be difficult to find experts who are competent in valuing non-cash assets. When estate duty was payable in New Zealand some years ago there was no difficulty in securing valuations for assets in deceased estates. In the submitter’s case, one of its major donors donated shares in a company that owned land in the Coromandel area. When the land was sold the submitter benefited to the extent of $3.54 million and the donor, who was a US citizen, was able to secure a deduction of this amount in the United States. Without the benefit of this deduction the gift would probably not have been made. Further comment on tax relief for non-cash donations 6.25 Other comments on this option included: • Any definition of a “non-cash donation” should include the lending of an asset to a charity or non-profit organisation. It was acknowledged that each asset loaned would require a monetary value to be placed on the benefit foregone by the donor before a deduction could be claimed. In practical terms, it would be the responsibility of the donor claiming the deduction to obtain an independent valuation of the loaned asset. The valuation could be attached to the receipt from the recipient charity acknowledging the gift, which is then filed with the donor’s tax return. 43 While there may be some further avoidance matters to consider, it is noted that these have already been adequately dealt with in Australia and the United Kingdom. It is preferable to adopt specific avoidance prevention legislation rather than allow the possibility of avoidance behaviour to prevent the policy being adopted at all. • Further exploration on how other countries handle non-cash donations should be undertaken. This is a definite option for the future. A separate discussion document on this issue should be prepared during the current parliamentary term for public consideration. • Clear guidelines are required for valuing non-cash donations. Tax relief should apply to new goods or to goods with a provable cost price valuation, an invoice, stock record or the like or, in the case of a service, proven costs based on standard rates of service. (Other views supported valuations at recommended retail price, wholesale price or current market value.) • There should be some way of allowing firms who do pro bono work for charities (either providing free services or resources) to benefit from tax rebates or deductibility. This would encourage greater contribution by businesses to the charitable sector. • Administrative costs of this would be high. It would be time- consuming and expensive to value some assets, and could be open to abuse. • Gifts of property that have been held by the donor for more than 12 months, and valued by the Commissioner at more than $5,000, should be tax deductible. Environmental and heritage property donated to approved organisations could also be included. Since 2001, Australian taxpayers have been able to make a deduction for gifts of property held for more than 12 months and valued in excess of $5,000. From 2002 these deductions can be spread over five years. • Publicly listed securities should be tax deductible. Deloitte and Touche, in a report on gifts of publicly listed securities in Canada in 2000, commented that the results showed gifts of publicly listed securities are an important part of most charities’ revenues and tax incentives stimulate donations and are considered to be an essential tool by many. Given the relatively small amount of marketing that is being done around this incentive to giving (except among the very large organisations), there is an opportunity to increase awareness of the incentive and to educate donors of the benefits of this type of giving. • Non-cash donations should be rebateable up to a maximum of 50 percent of their value. Large donations over $5,000 should be subject to a valuation (the cost to be borne by the donee) and rebateable at 50 percent of value. • A deduction limit should apply. There should be a minimum threshold of $1,000 for gifts in kind. This is to avoid claims for perishable items such as food which would be too difficult to value. 44 • Under the proposed financial reporting standards a charity is required to put a dollar value on non-cash donations and record it in their books in the same manner as cash donations. Such donations should have a receipt issued and the donor should receive the appropriate tax rebate on the value of the donation. Would it be a good idea to allow tax relief for non-cash donations? 6.26 Twenty-three submissions agreed that it would be a good idea to allow tax relief for non-cash donations. Opposed to tax relief for non-cash donations 6.27 Two submissions considered that providing tax relief for non-cash donations could incur high administrative costs and would be time-consuming and expensive to value some assets, and could be open to abuse. Option: Australia’s prescribed private funds regime 6.28 Australia’s prescribed private funds regime were introduced in 1999. They enable individuals, families and businesses to establish their own private trusts for philanthropic purposes. Donations made to these trusts are deductible to the donor. There is no limit on the donations that may be eligible for tax deduction by the donor. The trusts must disburse their funds for charitable purposes. These trusts provide a planned formal mechanism for giving, which offers greater control for donors. 6.29 Applications for prescribed private fund status are made to the Australian Tax Office (ATO). Limits apply to the accumulation of money within these trusts, such that investment income can be accumulated only at a rate equal to the Consumer Price Index, with the rest disbursed for charitable purposes. A simple annual return is filed with the ATO outlining the source of the funds and the payment of funds to various gift deductible recipients (charitable organisations) as well as the extent and recipients of management fees. 6.30 Views were sought on whether it would be a good idea to adopt Australia’s prescribed private funds regime. Support further consideration 6.31 Thirty-two submissions encouraged further investigation a prescribed private funds regime. The main reasons advanced were: • The regime has been very successful in Australia. One submitter has already held discussions with the Australian Prime Minister’s community business partnership on the merits of the regime. This group was instrumental in advocating a suite of tax-related initiatives (including the private charitable trust regime) to enhance philanthropy in Australia. 45 • Changes to the limits imposed on individuals, companies and Māori authorities would improve contributions to private trusts. • High-wealth individuals with a philanthropic nature would be more likely to donate more if there are associated tax breaks with the increase in donations being more than the tax break resulting in a net benefit to New Zealand. Would it be a good idea to adopt the regime? 6.32 Six submissions agreed that it would be a good idea to adopt a prescribed private fund regime. One submission opposed any restriction on capital accumulation. Opposed the prescribed private funds regime 6.33 Three submissions opposed the introduction of a prescribed private funds regime because New Zealand has its own structure for charitable trusts. Suggested tax incentives for encouraging giving 6.34 A number of other tax incentives for encouraging giving were suggested in submissions. These are outlined below. Simplicity of administration and generous 6.35 Any tax incentives adopted must be simple and at a level that motivates people to give generously. Share giving scheme operating in New Zealand 6.36 In 2006, the Robin Hood Foundation collaborated with Goldman Sachs JBWere to launch “Shares for good” in New Zealand. Inspired by the share gift programme in the United Kingdom, the Robin Hood Foundation is a recipient of unwanted shares, particularly those that would cost more to sell than they are worth. Goldman Sachs JBWere provides all brokerage fees free of charge. Giving by high-wealth individuals 6.37 Seven submissions considered that more investigation is required on how best to encourage high-wealth individuals to give. Endowments 6.38 More endowment funding should be encouraged. Endowment funds ensure a steady revenue stream while maintaining the capital component of the endowment. 46 A cultural gifts programme 6.39 Six submissions considered that the government should investigate the feasibility of implementing a scheme similar to the Australian cultural gifts programme with the aim of increasing the donation of significant objects and art works to cultural institutions for the benefit and enjoyment of all New Zealanders. 6.40 The tax incentives provided by the Australian programme include: the market value of the gift is fully tax deductible (with some exceptions), gifts are exempt from capital gains tax, donors can elect to spread the deduction over up to five income years, donors can also claim a tax deduction for the costs of obtaining valuations specifically for the programme. 6.41 A tax deduction of 150 percent of the value of the donated item was suggested. This type of scheme would cost only the value of the tax deduction or rebate at 33 1/3 percent, rather than the full cost of the item itself. Safeguards would need to be put in place to ensure the system is not abused. Measures to reduce risks could include the appointment of approved valuers and the establishment of a body to which non-profit organisations apply for approval to accept such gifts. Reference to other jurisdictions 6.42 The government’s consideration of overseas jurisdictions should not be limited to different forms of tax incentives and to the United Kingdom and Australia only. Other overseas examples might be useful, not only in relation to different forms of tax incentives, but also in relation to the core tax incentives for charitable giving. For example, the United States offers generous tax deductions for charitable contributions. Employee volunteers 6.43 The review should be broadened to allow businesses to receive tax relief for non-monetary donations of services to remove the bias towards monetary donations. This would allow businesses to make and charities to request, the type of donation that they would most benefit from, be consistent with the government policy on volunteering and obtain the same benefits and not artificially distinguish between volunteers who are donating their own time and those who are donating a business’s time. For employee volunteers, businesses should be able to claim a fixed amount which reflects a reasonable value for the donated time. It might also encourage more businesses to allow their staff to volunteer. 47 CHAPTER 7 Other ways of promoting charitable giving 7.1 This chapter summarises feedback on what further initiatives can be employed to encourage increased generosity in New Zealand and to support any tax measures that may arise out of this discussion document. 7.2 Sixty-seven submissions provided their views on further initiatives to reinforce and encourage giving to charities and other non-profit organisations. Detailed comments are outlined below. Government’s role in promoting charitable giving 7.3 Nineteen submissions considered that the government has a lead role to play in promoting generosity and giving in New Zealand, not just through the taxation system but also through education and promotion. 7.4 Many submissions supported a government-funded strategic marketing campaign that would seek to lift public appreciation and understanding of the value of philanthropic giving and to create a culture in which benefaction and donations are encouraged. 7.5 One submission considered that New Zealand is lagging well behind other Commonwealth countries in promoting a culture of giving. A range of other initiatives that encourage, enhance and sustain a culture of giving in New Zealand should be explored. The United Kingdom, Australia and Canada have been particularly successful in increasing generosity within their populations. The government in these countries has been the main driving force behind the development and implementation of new philanthropic initiatives and has borne the majority of the associated costs. It is suggested that the success of any comparative New Zealand programme should be similarly linked to government involvement. 7.6 The countries which have been most successful in increasing generosity among their citizens have been those where there has been an active partnership between the community and voluntary sector and the government. A recent example of this partnership approach can be seen in the United Kingdom. The Carnegie UK Trust in partnership with the UK government established the Scottish Executive and Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) as the United Kingdom’s first centre of excellence for research into charitable giving and philanthropy. Education campaign 7.7 Six submissions considered that any government tax initiatives aimed at promoting greater giving to charities and other non-profit organisations should be combined with an education campaign to help people understand 48 the value of the work of charities and how their donations help those charities to make New Zealand a better society. 7.8 Any amendment to the existing tax incentives should be supported by an in- depth public education campaign to raise awareness of the issues involved. To date it has been disappointing that so little is known about the current tax treatment of donations to charities. 7.9 Social marketing campaigns to both promote generosity and inform citizens how they can donate efficiently and effectively should be undertaken. Tax is not the whole answer – pluralistic approach is required 7.10 Eight submissions considered that a range of initiatives are required to persuade a person to give for the first time and to encourage existing donors to continue giving. However, relying exclusively on tax to promote giving is not the answer. When comparing New Zealand tax structures for giving to other countries’ tax incentives, it is important to be mindful that there could be other not so obvious factors that contribute to their level of generosity. Research and discussion needs to continue before finding a model that would work best in New Zealand. 7.11 Increasing a culture of generosity is most likely to be achieved by the co- ordinated use of several approaches – both fiscal and other tools. Research and evaluation 7.12 The government should invest in statistics-gathering and research initiatives for the charitable, community and voluntary sectors either as part of current government practice or in collaboration with third parties. 7.13 More research should be commissioned to identify the barriers and opportunities to the creation of more family philanthropies, especially for high-wealth individuals to create charitable trusts. 7.14 A significant aspect of the New Zealand context involving Māori and their giving, along with other cultural and ethnic forms of giving need to be researched. 7.15 As part of Cheers Volunteers, SPARC recently completed the first New Zealand-based study on the motivations of volunteers in the sport and recreation sector. This research provides an understanding of what motivates people to volunteer in sport and recreation and identifies factors that prevent them from volunteering. At the heart of volunteering in sport and recreation are four drivers or values that characterise all volunteering and volunteers in the sport and recreation sector. The core values are: generosity, love of sport, social connection, and appreciation. These core values may differ to those that compel New Zealanders to give their money, skills and time, to charities and other non-profit organisations. 49 Achieving a strong philanthropic culture 7.16 The United States is regarded as the recognised leader in seeking philanthropic support for higher education, with a very successful 350-year history to draw on. There is also a far greater incidence of “naming” as a public reward for donations; plaques honouring donors are prominent on the walls of hospitals and universities in the United States. Americans often support charities from which they benefit personally, such as orchestras, museums, top universities or organisations promoting the interests of their own ethnic or religious group. 7.17 More recently the United Kingdom has begun challenging its universities to start raising more money. Part of that challenge has been examining why they have not been able to raise the same level of money as their American counterparts. One of the reasons is an ingrained culture of giving in the United States compared with a great reluctance in the United Kingdom to ask for funds. Fundraising should be regarded as a central part of their activities, cultivating prospective donors, asking for support, thanking, recognising and stewarding donors and serving as proud and faithful custodians of their gifts. E-Philanthropy 7.18 An online charitable-giving portal is argued to be the most cost-effective form of fundraising and has the added benefit of being one of the least intrusive. It is considered that internet-based philanthropy programmes have real potential for both increasing the generosity of New Zealanders and making the process more accessible. 7.19 UK GUIDESTAR – according to a new report from Network for Good, the Internet’s largest non-profit giving portal, the typical online donor is generous, significantly younger than the average offline donor, and not new to giving. Based on analysis of $100 million in giving that came through the Network for Good site from its inception on 19 November 2001 to 3 September 2006 – the report, “The Young and the Generous”, found that the median age of the typical online donor was 38, that 96 percent of all online donors had given to charity before, and that their average gift size was $163 – significantly more than offline donors give on average. 7.20 The report also found that equal numbers of men and women donate online, and that their main reason for doing so was convenience. There was a steady increase in giving in the last five years, from $17.1 million in 2002 to $32.3 million in 2005. The increase in the number of donors grew from 41,138 in 2002 to 180,794 in 2005. The data collection carried out with the establishment of the Charities Commission could make such a resource a possibility for New Zealand in the near future, and this suggests that a similar portal to GUIDESTAR could be of tremendous value to the community and voluntary sector in New Zealand. 50 Engaging youth in philanthropic giving 7.21 The government should explore possible philanthropic pathways which take into account the unique needs and circumstances of New Zealand’s young people. 7.22 Encouraging generosity in schools as part of civics education is another strand of a co-ordinated approach. Ongoing policy work and sector involvement 7.23 Eight submissions expressly indicated that they would like to be involved in ongoing policy work relating to the charitable and not-for-profit sector. Rebate claim process 7.24 Simplifying the claims process would go a significant way to encouraging more donations from the New Zealand public. Advertise the rebate claim process 7.25 Ten submissions considered that Inland Revenue should be more active in promoting the existing rebate claim process. Send rebate claim form to all taxpayers 7.26 Eighteen submissions supported sending the rebate claim form to all taxpayers. Option on the rebate form for giving directly to a charitable organisation 7.27 Six submissions considered there should be an option on the rebate claim form to enable the donor to direct his or her rebate to the charity. Evidence of donations 7.28 The current rules require donation receipts to be furnished with a rebate claim. It then allows tax agents to make a claim on behalf of a client as long as they have seen the receipt and retain it for four years. This has lead to fraudulent claims being made by tax agents. The submission suggests that this provision should be removed, or limited to tax agents who are members of an approved professional body that has a code of conduct and disciplinary procedures, with an accompanying carve-out to section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to enable the Commissioner to forward cases involving fraudulent claims to that membership body. 51 CHAPTER 8 Other issues Refundability of imputation credits 8.1 Forty nine submissions were strongly in favour of imputation credits being refunded to charities. (See Appendix B for feedback.) Submission date 8.2 One submission recommended for time to make a submission. Ten others sought and received extensions of time to make their submissions. Removing the tax restriction on charities’ overseas operations 8.3 A number of people at the consultation workshops voiced their concerns on this issue, with sixteen submissions providing written comments. 8.4 Currently, New Zealand charities’ income is only exempt to the extent that their charitable operations are exercised in New Zealand. Thus any charity that wishes to support an event overseas or promote something overseas must bear an additional taxation burden over the cost of the actual expense incurred. Feedback considered that this restriction prevents charities from gaining valuable exposure overseas, which can lead to benefits such as increased skills for the charity’s personnel, assistance from other organisations and additional donor support. 8.5 This issue is best illustrated in relation to donations to faith-based organisations carrying out missionary work overseas. In general, donations to these organisations do not qualify for the current tax rebate. Submissions strongly recommended that such organisations should be eligible for donee status and that donors are eligible for tax rebate and deductions for the donations they make to such organisations. 8.6 Churches, and New Zealand-based agencies operated by them that have charitable purposes overseas mainly send out medical personnel, teachers, agriculturalists and the like (all “missionaries”) to work alongside and under the jurisdiction of indigenous people. Very often this assistance is sought by the government of the country concerned. Such work is aimed at assisting third world countries at grass-roots level. This is to the benefit of the country concerned and is more effective than inter-government aid (with all the risks of unauthorised diversion that can occur there). Organisations working overseas seeking donee status face a cumbersome process involving approval of their donee status by Cabinet. 52 8.7 Charities applying their funds overseas should be eligible for donee status on the same basis as charities applying their funds within New Zealand. Alternatively, donee status for charities that apply their funds overseas should be approved on the same basis as other charities. This would avoid the need for Cabinet approval. 8.8 The distinction presently drawn between humanitarian and religious charities is not an appropriate one. The submission recommended that the government give consideration to widening the availability of tax rebates for money given overseas beyond the 64 organisations listed in section KC 5 of the Income Tax Act 2004. Section KC 5 (1) should be amended to remove the current exclusion for charities that apply their funds overseas. 8.9 The charities excluded under section 5(1) of the Charities Act 2005 are mainly religious charities. Many of the religious charities that are penalised under the Income Tax Act 2004 are being penalised in spite of them meeting the definition of a “charitable entity” as set in section 5(10) of the Charities Act 2005. Reciprocal arrangements with other countries 8.10 Four submissions commented on this issue. 8.11 Residents in the United States and the United Kingdom are eligible for tax deductions for donations they make to New Zealand charities so long as the charity in question has established a charitable entity in the country of residence. One submitter has established charitable trusts in both countries. This has proved to be very successful as a funding tool for alumni in those countries. The submitter has received substantial donations from US residents who were able to claim tax deductions through this mechanism. The submitter suggests that the government should consider amending the New Zealand tax law to allow residents in New Zealand to make donations on the same basis as in the United States and United Kingdom. 8.12 Another submission suggested that New Zealand should enter into a reciprocal arrangement with Australia to allow tax relief for donations made by each other’s citizens to charitable organisations in each country. The submitter was approached by a company in Australia which employed large numbers of New Zealand ex-pats. The company wanted to donate proceeds from a corporate event to the submitter but as the sponsors could not get a tax deduction from New Zealand, they decided to give the proceeds to an Australian charity. The submitter also has a large number of donors in the US and they would be more inclined to give more if they received tax deductions for their donations. GST issues 8.13 Registered charities should be allowed to claim back GST without earning GST taxable income. 53 8.14 Seven submissions considered that non-profit organisations should be exempt from GST. 8.15 One submission noted that any grant received by a charity from a government agency such as COGS, the Lottery Board, TEC or local government is charged with GST. The submitter suggested that all grants from central and local government should be GST exempt. Charities Commission and registration issues 8.16 The Charities Commission is unnecessary and has created unwarranted tension in the philanthropy sector. Organisations should be reimbursed for direct expenses incurred in registering with the Commission. 8.17 Charities should not be made to reapply for their charitable status if they have already gone to the effort of having their status confirmed with Inland Revenue. This is potentially a considerable cost to the voluntary sector. Registration should be automatic. Definition of “charitable purpose” 8.18 The definition of “charitable purpose” should be reviewed. 8.19 “Caring for the environment” should be listed as a charitable purpose. Remove the requirement to file annual accounts from the Incorporated Societies Act if it is included in the Charities Commission Act – to minimise paperwork. 8.20 One submission contended that sport organisations are not generally eligible for charitable status unless their stated purposes include a public benefit such as education. The submission recommended that sport and recreation organisations should be eligible for any tax incentive to encourage charitable giving, as the vast majority of sport and recreation organisations inherently provide public benefits by encouraging people to be physically active, by providing infrastructure and services, and by strengthening communities. Universal basic income 8.21 A universal basic income should be introduced as this would give people a form of financial security so that they can undertake voluntary work. 54 Tax review of issues relating to school boards of trustees 8.22 An across-government review should be undertaken on the range of tax and other incentives and disincentives relating to boards of trustees and other volunteers in school. The Ministry of Social Development treats the honoraria paid to members of school boards of trustees as “income” for the purposes of benefits while Inland Revenue does not. Even within the tax regime there are anomalies; state schools are exempt from income tax but have to pay GST and FBT. Rebate splitting 8.23 The current possibility of transferring any donations exceeding the maximum amount to a spouse who has not used the full maximum threshold should continue to be available. Section 41A(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should continue to apply. The rebate claim process should not be changed. Personal income tax exemptions for employees of charities and other non-profit organisations 8.24 Ten submissions suggested tax reductions for all personnel employed by registered charities. 8.25 A portion of the salary of employees of registered charities or non-profit organisations should be exempt from income tax as charities and not-for- profits find it difficult to compete with the salaries paid in the open market. One submission suggested that the first $16,000 of an employee’s salary should be exempt from income tax. Gift duty exemptions for gifts made to and from local authorities 8.26 A gift-duty exemption should be established for gifts made by a person to a local authority for either the benefit of the community or where there is a gift simpliciter. These gifts should be eligible for the tax rebate if made by an individual or a tax deduction if made by a company. 8.27 Where a local authority makes a “gift” to a not-for-profit body or other local authority, such a gift should be exempt from gift duty. Local authorities 8.28 Section DB 32(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004 should be amended to clarify that: • Local authorities can obtain an income tax deduction for contributions to local organisations within the area of that local authority where that local organisation would otherwise qualify under section DB 32. 55 • Where income received by a local authority is held in trust beneficially to be used for the community, then that income qualifies for the local authority exemption. • If funds are held by a local authority on behalf of a third part, which is not using those funds for purposes beneficial to the community, then the income arising from those funds does not qualify for the local authority exemption. Fringe benefit tax 8.29 Six submissions commented on this issue. There should be better FBT treatment for charities, including special salary packaging provisions for the community and voluntary sector. More government funding 8.30 The government should provide appropriate levels of direct funding to organisations providing essential services. One submission considered it inappropriate that organisations providing essential community services have to seek philanthropic-sector funding to provide these services. Services identified as critical should be appropriately funded by government, not just given grant contributions. 8.31 Currently, charitable causes such as St John’s Ambulance, the Child Cancer Foundation, the Cancer Society and Plunket must ask the private purse to fund public good activities that are reasonably the responsibility of a forward-thinking government. The services these organisations provide are pivotal to the development and success of our community. As long as necessary healthcare-related charities remain unfunded by government, there cannot be a level playing field for other charitable causes and not-for-profit organisations. It is difficult to justify giving to a cultural cause when core healthcare causes remain dependent on private and corporate donations. Thus, a key issue for government to consider is who should be in the pool for public fundraising and whose needs can be most effectively met through a direct government grant system. Definition of “donee organisation” 8.32 Donee organisations should be defined as “those organisations registered under the Charities Act 2005”. Equivalence of tax relief for individuals, trusts, companies and partnerships 8.33 A tax deduction for charitable donations should be available to all forms of business ownership, irrespective of whether the entity is a company, widely held or listed on a recognised stock exchange. This would enable alternative forms of business ownership such as sole traders, partnerships and trusts to claim a full deduction for all donations made. Disallowing a tax deduction 56 for donations made by these entities his inequitable and acts as an impediment to charitable giving. Criteria for assessing the discussion document options 8.34 The criteria for assessing options should be expanded to include a further sentence at paragraph 1.23 of the discussion document Tax incentives for giving to charities and other non-profit organisations that “In considering costs and benefits, regard shall be had to the need to promote public trust and confidence in the charitable sector, and to enable the effective use of charitable resources.” Art galleries and museums 8.35 Many public art galleries and museums rely heavily on private-sector philanthropy and gifts to supplement the limited funding they receive from local and central government to develop and acquire for their collections. (See Strategy for the Museum Sector in 2005. 3 ) Future review 8.36 The government should commit to a review five years after implementation of the proposed options. The review should aim not only to assess the impact of changes made but also seek to establish additional or extended strategies to further improve the return for donors and volunteers in a manner which benefits charitable organisations. Insufficient coverage of donor group 8.37 The discussion document and consultation workshops targeted charities and other non-profit organisations and not specifically donors. IFRS standards 8.38 There is concern at the significant compliance costs that could arise from an accounting and reporting point of view if complex rebate mechanisms are put into place to recognise volunteer effort. To meet IFRS reporting requirements, charitable bodies must meet minimum reporting requirements for audit purposes. This means they must have records and systems in place to accurately report such matters. There is no ability to use differential reporting and hence apply a lesser level of compliance. 8.39 Officials have been asked to consider not only the tax effectiveness of the mechanisms but also the flow-on additional costs which an organisation may 3 Museums Aotearoa, a strategy for the museum sector in New Zealand, 2005. Downloadable at www.museums- aotearoa.org.nz/site/publications. 57 necessarily incur in order to meet the accounting disclosures in respect of those tax measures. Loans to charities 8.40 One submission suggested the creation of a special class of bonds or loans for registered charities. Charities often require loans to fund capital works, or initiate projects for which supporting income will come in later years. There would be a benefit in being able to raise money via debentures or loans which are cost-effective for the charity but do not involve the provider losing purchasing power of their capital. A possibility would be for a special class of bonds which pay interest at a rate of say, two-thirds of the Government 10-year bond rate (reflecting the after-tax rate the holder would receive). The income would be exempt to the holder, and no withholding tax would be deducted by the registered charity issuing the bonds. This would provide charities with cost effective funding, and protect the lender from erosion of their capital. Reporting requirement for charities 8.41 Charities should report publicly on the amount of funds spent on administration and promotion compared with the programme. Rebate for EFTPOS transactions 8.42 A rebate on EFTPOS transactions should be available to charities and other non-profit organisations. Bank charges should not apply to these organisations. 58 APPENDIX A List of submissions Submission Number Name of submitter 0001 David Stewart 0002 Stephen Bayldon 0003 The Australian Charities Fund

NZ 0228 Community Solutions 66 Submission Number Name of submitter 0229 Coastguard Gisborne 67 APPENDIX B Refundability of imputation credits There have been many calls from the charitable sector for the government to deal with the question of whether imputation credits to charities should be refundable for tax purposes. The government acknowledges the importance of this issue to the charitable sector. For this reason, it will be examined separately as part of a wider review of imputation credits, and who should be entitled to use those credits. The review is expected to take place in 2007. The issue Currently companies are able to make donations to a charity from pre-tax income, but a charity holding shares in that same company and receiving a dividend equal to the donation will have a tax burden. Donations Shares Company pre-tax income 100,000 100,000 Company donations 5,000 - Company taxable profit 95,000 100,000 Tax paid by company 31,350 33,000 Distribution of retained earnings: Gross dividend 5,000 Imputation credits attached 1,650 Net dividend 3,350 Charity net benefit 5,000 3,350 The end result is that charities are actively discouraged from investing in shares. The Australian government has recognised this issue and dealt with it appropriately and so the submitter feels that New Zealand should follow their lead. Feedback from submissions Forty nine submissions were strongly in favour of imputation credits being refunded to charities. The specific comments raised in submissions were: • One submission noted that if imputation credits were refundable that it would be able to contribute up to 50% more per year to charities. 68 • The current rules make it more advantageous for charities to invest overseas than in New Zealand as overseas shareholders are entitled to a supplementary dividend from the company in which they hold shares. • Priority should be given to addressing the issue of the inconsistency around the imputation credits: either by allowing the charity a tax refund equal to the imputation credits or by a mechanism where the benefit is paid by the company to the charity, and the tax refund is then paid to the taxpaying company. • The inability for charitable organisations to be refunded imputation credits is contrary to the concept of being “tax-exempt”. Currently for commercial reasons a charity may chose to invest in, or separate its activity into, a corporate structure. This comes at a tax cost, which would be overcome if imputation credits received by the charity could be refunded in cash. This has been an ongoing issue since the introduction of imputation credits and is long overdue for a complete review. • One submission considered that the effect of the delay in resolving this matter is that a conceptual error in the design of the imputation system would be allowed to continue. That error is that tax-exempt shareholders do not benefit from the overall purpose of imputation of taxing income from companies at the tax rate of the shareholder. The submitter wished to record its view that the time for correcting the error is well overdue. The error is of considerable importance to the charitable sector as a whole. • In contrast, if a charity invests in fixed interest investments, it would be exempt from tax on any interest earned and would be able to claim a refund for any resident withholding tax that was deducted at source. This is consistent with the policy of tax-free status of charities. • Three submissions contended that charities in Australia have benefited enormously by being able to use imputation credits. In the case of one submitter, a donor gifted two million shares in a listed company. These shares are being held on trust for the benefit of the submitter and already more than $20,000 of available funds has been lost due to the inability of being able to use the imputation credits. The submitter suggested two ways of addressing this issue: (i) allow charities to claim the tax paid from the Inland Revenue Department; (ii) allow charities to receive a supplementary dividend from the companies paying the dividend.

SPEECH NOTES

### Tuesday 22 May 2007 address to the Not-for-Profit Special Interest Group (Wellington Branch), New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants

Budget 2007 announced a number of positive developments for the charities sector, all aimed at laying a stronger foundation for charitable giving in New Zealand.

The changes recognise the importance of charitable giving to our social, cultural, environmental and economic wellbeing in New Zealand, and the important role charitable organisations play in delivering the services we need to make a positive difference in our communities.

As you know, the changes are the result of the Confidence and Supply agreement between United Future and Labour, which called for the development of a new rebate scheme for charities. I am delighted we have this opportunity to make a significant contribution to the charitable, community and voluntary sectors in New Zealand.

To recap briefly, the main points announced in the Budget and which are included in the May tax bill now before Parliament are:

*   Removal of the current caps on the dollar amount of charitable donations that are eligible for tax relief. This means that individuals, companies and Māori authorities will be able to claim rebates and a deduction for charitable donations up to the level of their annual net income.
*   Individuals will no longer be restricted by the $1,890 limit for tax rebates, which will encourage those who are already donating substantial amounts to donate even more generously. For the same reason, the 5 percent limit for tax deductions for companies and Māori authorities is also being removed; and
*   The company deduction is also being extended to unlisted companies with five or fewer shareholders.

Once enacted, the changes will come into effect from 1 April next year.

As a package, they represent a significant and radical departure from the previous policy approach for developing tax incentives for promoting charitable giving in New Zealand.

That approach was based on incremental changes to existing tax incentives for donations, while at the same time, maintaining limits on eligibility.

However, we recognise that charitable giving is not just about removing the rebate limits. It's about making it easier for people to give both their time and their money – and there are several ways we can approach this.

A number of different approaches were advanced in submissions following the release last October of the government discussion document, _Tax incentives for giving to charities and other non-profit organisations_.

As you may recall, the discussion document was supported by a series of consultation workshops held around the country and attended by 300 participants.

*   A total of 229 written submissions, from a wide range of people and organisations, were received on that discussion document.
*   Those submissions, and the views expressed during the consultation workshops have been summarised in a 70-page document which will be available on Inland Revenue's Tax Policy Division's website from today.
*   Feedback from this round of consultation strongly supported substantially increasing the current tax relief available for charitable donations and introducing other mechanisms for delivering tax relief.

One possible approach put forward is the concept of payroll giving.

*   Payroll giving is well accepted in other countries – such as Australia – for its simplicity, convenience and effectiveness in promoting charitable giving; and
*   It has the potential to increase donation levels and establish partnerships between government, employers and charitable organisations.

However, before introducing payroll giving in New Zealand, detailed consultation is required to ensure that this approach does not raise excessive costs for employers and is easy to administer.

For this reason, a discussion document is planned for release in November this year, which will look at the implications of introducing payroll giving, and seek the views of all those concerned.

Feedback from the discussion document released last year also indicated that while tax incentives may not be the complete answer to encouraging people to donate generously, a tax system that is generally supportive of philanthropy is viewed as beneficial.

For that reason – and in recognition of the substantial contribution that charities and other non-profit organisations make to the community – further work will be done to streamline the tax treatment of volunteers' reimbursement payments and honoraria.

Feedback from consultation highlighted this issue as a longstanding problem that should be addressed as a matter of priority.

I hope to be able to include any resulting changes in a taxation bill to be introduced in November.

Further work will also be carried out on a range of other mechanisms for delivering tax relief on charitable donations, including:

*   the deductibility of non-monetary donations; and
*   the possibility of a gift aid-type scheme where the tax benefit goes directly to the charitable organisation rather than to the donor.

I am aware that the issue of refunding imputation credits to charities is of particular interest to this group.

As noted in the 2006 discussion document, this issue is being examined separately as part of a wider review of imputation credits, and who should be entitled to use those credits.

With the immediate Budget work now behind us, the government will be putting together its tax policy work programme for the coming year, and it is anticipated that this issue will be up for further consideration.

Thank you.

Speech - tax policy update
==========================

In a speech delivered in Wellington today, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne reviewed the business tax reform package announced in Budget 2007 and updated the audience on work in other areas of tax reform - including the government's review of New Zealand's international tax rules, the review of the taxation of life insurance, and forthcoming consultation on the proposal to introduce payroll giving as a means of making charitable donations. He also outlined the background to the liberalisation of tax penalties that features in the taxation bill currently before Parliament.

SPEECH

### Speech to Deloitte's client seminar

**Update on tax policy**

I am very pleased to be here today to address your client seminar.

As you will know, with Budget 2007 still a relatively fresh memory for most of us, a lot has been happening in tax policy – and that is expected to continue over the next year or so.

Much of the Budget was devoted to tax-related changes, many of them the most substantial business tax changes to be announced since the late 1980s.

I want to take this opportunity to update you on policy developments, covering as well a number of areas that may have been somewhat overshadowed by other Budget announcements.

The big items in the Budget, from a tax and business perspective, were the announcements of:

*   additional incentives to save with KiwiSaver,
*   the business tax reform package,
*   tax incentives to encourage charitable giving,
*   and the proposed introduction of an active income exemption for New Zealand-controlled foreign companies.

Two taxation bills tabled in the course of the Budget debate introduced many of these measures, as well as other tax reforms.

One of the bills gave effect to urgent Budget announcements such as the reduced company tax rate, the associated reduction in the tax rate for certain savings vehicles, and the new member tax credit for people who contribute to KiwiSaver schemes. That bill was passed under urgency.

The other bill received its first reading and was referred to the Finance and Expenditure Committee for consideration. I will return to that bill and some of its other contents later.

First, however, I want first to touch upon the Budget announcements.

Transformation of New Zealand's savings culture was a major theme of the Budget.

The past few years have seen important reforms aimed both at making it easier for people to save and at improving the tax treatment of savings through collective investment vehicles. Legislation enacted last year paved the way for the introduction of KiwiSaver in July this year.

Further legislation last year brought in new tax rules on investment income, including the new portfolio investment entity – or PIE – rules, which come into effect in October.

A key role of the new PIE rules is to prevent the over-taxation of lower income people who invest through managed funds, which are the first investment choice of many ordinary New Zealanders. And they and similar funds are the vehicles through which KiwiSaver will operate.

This continuing tax reform of the savings environment took a giant step forward with the Budget announcements of the introduction of additional incentives to save with KiwiSaver.

These new incentives include:

*   a member tax credit of up to $20 a week,
*   compulsory matching contributions by employers of up to 4 per cent of employees' gross salary or wages – to be phased in over four years,
*   and a tax credit for employers of up to $20 a week per employee to reimburse them for their contributions.

These changes are designed to boost incentives for people to join the savings scheme and to continue to make contributions throughout their working lives, ensuring that all New Zealanders have a decent standard of living in retirement.

Another, very important group of Budget announcements related to business tax reforms have resulted from the Business Tax Review. The review itself was a direct result of policies stipulated in the Confidence and Supply Agreement between United Future and Labour and between New Zealand First and Labour.

Our requirement was for, and I quote:

"…..a review of the current business taxation regimes, with the view of ensuring the system works to give better incentives for productivity gains and improved competitiveness with Australia."

The resulting Business Tax Review set out to do just that. The first step was the release last year of a discussion document that canvassed views on possible tax initiatives aimed at increasing productivity and making us more competitive internationally.

Amongst the options canvassed were reducing the company tax rate from 33% to 30% and introducing targeted tax credits.

The discussion document was followed by further extensive consultation and policy development that resulted in the business tax reform package announced in the Budget.

Top of the list of business tax reform measures was the reduction of the company tax rate, from 33% to 30%, from the 2008-09 income year.

That measure, which has now been passed into law, aligns our rate with Australia's company tax rate. It thus improves our competitiveness with our largest export market as well making New Zealand a more attractive country from which to do business.

The new company tax rate brings with it a number of transitional and consequential changes to income tax law, most of which concern imputation credit handling in the two-year transitional period.

Without this transitional period, some companies might not be able to fully distribute the profits and associated tax credits they derived before the new rate comes into effect. These transitional changes are part of the tax bill that is before the select committee.

An associated tax rate change announced in the Budget, another to emerge from the Business Tax Review, is the reduction in the tax rate for certain savings vehicles from 33% to 30%, from the beginning of their 2008-09 income year.

As a result, people who save through entities such as unit trusts and widely held superannuation funds will benefit from the new 30% rate applying to those funds.

Likewise, many people who invest in managed funds that elect into the new portfolio investment entity tax rules will benefit from the reduction in the top tax rate from 33% to 30%.

The introduction of a tax credit for eligible R&D expenditure is a further measure to result from the Business Tax Review.

In the course of the review we also looked at the possibility of introducing tax credits for other activities besides R&D. In the end, however, we concluded that tax credits would be less cost-effective than existing mechanisms for funding areas such as export market development and skills training.

On the other hand, there is a significant and growing body of evidence that tax incentives have been effective at boosting business R&D.

The tax credit for R&D expenditure will help to bring New Zealand more into line with what happens in other OECD countries, about three-quarters of which offer R&D tax incentives.

The aim of the new tax credit is to help raise the rate of private sector R&D investment in New Zealand, which is currently only a third of the OECD average. Increased R&D investment is expected to have wider benefits for the economy and help to boost productivity and international competitiveness.

New Zealand businesses that conduct R&D in New Zealand will be eligible for a credit of 15 percent of allowable expenditure. For purposes of the tax credit, R&D is defined relatively widely, in line with the definition that Australia uses for its R&D tax incentives.

An important feature of the credit is that it will be paid out in cash to loss-making businesses such as start-ups.

The new tax credit will have built-in safeguards, to ensure that it is as effective as possible. For example, the requirement for R&D to be undertaken predominantly in New Zealand by New Zealand businesses is there because the spill-over benefits to other New Zealand firms are likely to be largest in those circumstances.

The R&D tax credit is also part of the tax bill that has been referred to the select committee.

The Budget announcement relating to the review of New Zealand's international tax rules – and specifically that the government will proceed with the introduction of a tax exemption for the active income of New Zealand's controlled foreign companies – did not get much press at the time. That is understandable, perhaps, given that the resulting changes will not come into effect immediately.

Even so, in my view, the changes that will ensue from this review will prove to have a long-term, systemic importance to New Zealand's economy.

As you may know, the review officially began with the release in December last year of the discussion document New Zealand's International Tax Review: a direction for change. It outlined the government's intention to introduce an exemption for offshore active income into New Zealand's international tax rules.

Rather than make concrete proposals for the implementation of the exemption, the discussion document canvassed the various approaches taken in other countries and indicated the broad direction and approach of the proposed reform.

Officials then engaged in an extensive consultation process with businesses.

The feedback on this consultation has been invaluable in enabling us to assemble a balanced package of reforms that suits New Zealand.

The introduction of the active income exemption will constitute a major policy change, since the offshore active income of New Zealand-controlled businesses will no longer be taxed as it is earned. Instead it will be exempt from tax in New Zealand.

At present, New Zealand is pretty much out on its own in the way it taxes all income earned by foreign companies that are controlled by our residents.

Many other countries distinguish between the active and the passive income of their controlled foreign companies. They distinguish, for example, between income from manufacturing and income from investment such as interest, dividends and royalties. And they either delay taxing offshore active income until dividends are paid or exempt it altogether.

The introduction into New Zealand of an active income exemption is intended to encourage our businesses that have international operations to compete more effectively in foreign markets. It should also reduce incentives for our companies to move overseas.

For those of you who want to know more about the international review – where it's at, where it's going and what still needs deciding – I recommend an update paper that Dr Cullen and I released as part of the Budget documents. You can find the update on the website of Inland Revenue's Policy Advice Division.

Over the next few months, as part of the continuing consultation on the international reforms, tax policy officials will be releasing a series of technical papers that cover in greater depth the topics that require further consultation and analysis

Another key plank in the United Future-Labour Confidence and Supply Agreement was for the development of a new tax rebate regime for charities.

Direct results of this commitment, as well, were announced in the Budget.

People, companies and Maori authorities will be able claim rebates and deductions for charitable donations up to the level of their annual net income, and will no longer be restricted by the present caps.

Furthermore, the deduction claimable for donations made by companies will be extended to close companies that are not listed on a recognised stock exchange.

These changes, which are also contained in the tax bill that has been referred to the select committee, are designed to provide greater incentives for charitable giving. That in turn will benefit charitable organisations and the communities they serve.

To this end, the government is also looking at the concept of payroll giving – enabling employees to make charitable donations through deductions from their wages or salaries.

Payroll giving is well accepted in Australia and other countries for its simplicity, convenience and effectiveness in promoting charitable giving. It also has the potential to increase donation levels and establish partnerships between government, employers and charitable organisations.

However, before we decide to introduce the measure, detailed consultation is necessary to ensure that it would not raise excessive costs for employers and it would be easy to administer.

For this reason, a discussion document planned for release in November will look at the implications of introducing payroll giving, and seek the views of all those concerned.

The taxation of life insurers is a further area that has been under review since last year, as you may know.

The current tax rules came into force in the late 1980s and are now out of date. The result is that many life insurers are under-taxed in relation to their profits on term insurance products. On the other hand, some policyholders are overtaxed in relation to life insurance savings products, although changes proposed in the taxation bill will reduce this over-taxation in respect of some products.

The purpose of the review is to ensure that all aspects of a life insurer's business are taxed fairly - and in a manner that is consistent with the way that other business taxpayers are taxed.

Two officials' issues papers on the review have been released for purposes of consultation with the industry, in keeping with the generic tax policy process that applies to most major tax reforms.

The suggested changes aim to tax life insurers on their actual risk insurance profits in a manner that is consistent with the taxation of general insurance. Policyholders' savings income is to be integrated, as far as is practical, within the PIE rules.

Consultation to date has shown an encouraging degree of support for the general direction of the review, with many industry representatives keen to work with officials on the detail of the changes.

As with any tax change, however, the changes under discussion have not met with unanimous approval, and my officials are eager to discuss matters with those who disagree with the reforms.

This is a very difficult tax area, but the aim is to find a solution that is commercially sensible, practical and has general industry buy-in.

I want to turn briefly to another reform introduced in the tax bill that is currently before Parliament.

That is the proposed liberalisation of tax penalties, to promote voluntary compliance, a reform that has been the subject of extensive consultation and has met with wide approval.

The compliance and penalty rules in the Tax Administration Act came into force in 1997. They were designed to promote effective and fairer enforcement of the Inland Revenue Acts by providing better incentives for taxpayers to comply voluntarily with their tax obligations.

Extensive consultation last year identified several areas in the law where those rules could be improved, and the resulting changes appear in the bill.

The bill effectively relaxes a whole range of tax penalties, such as that for taking an unacceptable tax position, so that penalties reflect the seriousness of the tax offence.

The reason for taking this approach is that people comply more willingly with the law when they see it as reasonable and fair, as is generally acknowledged.

Our current system of tax penalties does not always distinguish between people who try to do the right thing but fail, and people who have no intention of doing the right thing. That is a very important distinction.

There are also several areas in the law where the rules about what behaviour attracts a penalty could be clearer, more consistent and better targeted at making people want to do the right thing.

One of the most important of the changes proposed in the bill is the reduction in the number of penalties faced by people who have a tax shortfall if they make a voluntary disclosure before being advised that they are to be audited.

If they make a voluntary disclosure to Inland Revenue, they will not attract a penalty for not having taken reasonable care or for having adopted an unacceptable tax position. Once enacted, that change will take effect from 17 May, the date of introduction of the bill.

Related changes involve not penalising taxpayers who occasionally pay late, and updating the definition of "tax agent".

To conclude, we have a very full tax reform agenda that will provide many opportunities for businesses, individuals and professional organisations to have their say on proposed reforms – whether it takes the form of responding to ideas set out in a discussion document, making a submission on a bill that is before a select committee, or perhaps responding to informal requests from policy officials for your views on specific issues.

These contributions are an essential part of the development of good tax policy and law, and they are valued.

Thank you and I wish you a very successful seminar.

Govt moves on overseas asset lease schemes
==========================================

The government announced today that it is introducing legislation to shut down tax schemes involving leases on overseas assets that result in a loss to the New Zealand revenue. Under the schemes in question, New Zealand parties claim depreciation deductions for assets in which they have no economic interest that are leased to parties overseas who are not subject to New Zealand tax rules.

### Tax changes to stop overseas asset lease schemes

The government is moving to shut down tax schemes involving leases on overseas assets that result in a loss to the New Zealand revenue, Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne announced today.

"The arrangements in question enable New Zealand parties to claim depreciation deductions for assets in which they have no economic interest that are leased to parties overseas who are not subject to New Zealand tax rules," they said.

"Under these schemes, the New Zealand party purchases the overseas asset and leases it back to the original owner, who continues to use it and to bear all the economic risks of ownership.

"The only economic benefits of the transaction are the tax deductions, which are shared between the two parties. This is against the intent of the law.

"In these transactions the leases are structured in such a way that they are classified as operating leases for tax purposes, even though they are, in substance, finance leases, which have different tax rules. Under an operating lease the New Zealand lessor can claim the deductions, whereas under a finance lease it is the lessee who claims the deductions.

"We understand that these arrangements are being marketed in New Zealand and could become more widespread unless action is taken to prevent them.

"Therefore the government is proposing changes to the law that, once enacted, will have immediate effect from today.

"The finance lease tax rules will be widened to include leases for which the lease asset is located overseas, the lessee’s income from use of the asset is not completely assessable in New Zealand, and the economic risks and benefits of ownership have been transferred to the lessee.

"New leases that come within the scope of these changes will be treated as finance leases for tax purposes from today.

"Existing operating leases that come within the scope of these changes will be reclassified as finance leases from the beginning of the next income year, and will be subject to tax on the difference between the net income recognised under the operating lease and the net income that would have been recognised under a finance lease.

"The changes to the finance lease rules will be added to the taxation bill that is currently before Parliament by means of a Supplementary Order Paper. That will ensure an early enactment of the change.

"The government is making these changes to protect its fiscal position in relation to leases to parties overseas. We will consider wider changes to the finance lease rules, if necessary, to prevent further arrangements of this type arising in relation to domestic arrangements and, of course, the changes will not preclude Inland Revenue considering compliance action in relation to arrangements of this nature that it has identified," the Ministers said.

### New tax rules for limited and general partnerships

Legislation is being introduced to provide new tax rules for limited partnerships and update the tax rules on general partnerships, Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said today.

The changes are part of the Limited Partnerships Bill, tabled today, which introduces new regulatory rules for limited partnerships that will make it easier for New Zealand firms to have access to investment capital.

"Limited partnerships are commonly used in many other countries as a vehicle for venture capital investment into other countries, so it makes sense to have New Zealand tax rules that facilitate this kind of investment here," said the Ministers.

"The tax rules proposed in this bill are investment-friendly and will enable New Zealand to be more competitive in attracting venture capital. At the same time, the bill clarifies and modernises the tax rules on partnerships generally.

"Limited partnerships will not be taxed at the partnership level. Instead, each partner will be taxed individually, in proportion to his or her share of the partnership income, in the same way that income from general partnerships is taxed. Limited partners' tax losses in any given year will be restricted to the level of their economic loss in that year.

"The new rules also cover tax aspects of entering and leaving all partnerships, whether general or limited. They include requiring exiting partners to account for tax in certain circumstances and clarifying the extent to which selling partners must realise gains on underlying partnership assets.

"Partners will be required to account for tax on exiting a partnership only if the amount of the disposal proceeds from the partnership interest exceeds the total net tax book value of their share of the partnership property by more than $50,000. Last year's discussion document on the subject suggested that the cut-off point should be $20,000, but submissions on the proposal convinced us that $50,000 would be a more realistic threshold.

"We welcome these proposed changes, which will bring clarity and certainty to New Zealand's tax rules on partnerships generally," they said.

A commentary on the tax changes is available at www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz.

### New bill encourages venture capital investment

New Zealand firms will have easier access to investment capital under a bill to establish new regime of limited partnerships tabled in parliament today by Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel.

Limited partnerships are an internationally preferred structure for investing in venture capital.

"Venture capital provides a valuable source of funding for new companies and early stage expansion capital, but the absence of an internationally recognised legal and tax structure is an impediment to foreign venture capital investment here," Lianne Dalziel said.

"In a highly competitive international venture capital market, New Zealand is disadvantaged by size and distance. This makes it particularly important that we adopt a limited partnership structure that is consistent with international norms and that provides the form of legal and tax structure that is recognised and accepted by investors. This bill provides such a structure and encourages the development of the venture capital industry in New Zealand," Lianne Dalziel said.

The key regulatory features of the bill include:

*   "General" partners who are liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership;
*   "Limited" partners whose liability is limited to the amount of their investment, so long as they do not take part in the management of the partnership;
*   Provision for 'safe harbour' activities so that limited partners are able to participate in strategic activities without this affecting their liability; and
*   Providing a separate legal personality for limited partnerships.

"While limited partnerships can encourage venture capital investment, they are not exclusively designed for that, and may be used as a flexible alternative to a company or other legal form," Lianne Dalziel said.

The limited partnership will receive "flow through" tax treatment, meaning the partnership itself is not taxed. Instead each partner is taxed individually at that partner's personal tax rate. The addition of a separate legal personality requires changes to tax rules to enable limited partnerships to receive "flow through" tax treatment rather than being treated as a company, and this would be done concurrently, Lianne Dalziel said.

Joint Statement

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Greater protection for savers in super schemes

The government is proposing further changes to super schemes in line with its aim of encouraging greater savings, Finance Minister Michael Cullen, Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel, State Services Minister Annette King and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne announced today.

"The amendments we propose will give those in super schemes that comply with KiwiSaver rules more protection and allow savers better access to their funds in retirement," the Ministers said.

"It is important that existing schemes which wish to become KiwiSaver-complying face the same rules as KiwiSaver schemes."

The Ministers said the changes were a small but significant fine-tuning of proposed KiwiSaver legislation.

"The ideal time to make these adjustments is now, while a Bill dealing with KiwiSaver legislation is before Parliament."

The changes include:

*   **Requiring complying funds as well as KiwiSaver funds to lodge employer participation agreements with the Government Actuary.** Employer participation agreements set out conditions under which employees are scheme members. This measure will give greater protection to employees, by ensuring there is government oversight of employers' involvement in these funds.
*   **Allowing benefits in complying superannuation funds to be withdrawn as a lump sum.** This will give members of complying schemes the choice of taking a lump sum or buying an annuity when they are eligible to access their savings, a provision which already applies to KiwiSaver schemes. As legislation stands, members of complying superannuation funds may be forced to buy annuities at extra cost.
*   **Avoiding "double-dipping".** Members of some existing superannuation schemes in the State sector already receive a contribution from the Crown as their employer. This will continue unchanged. However the legislation will be amended to provide extra assurance that if these people also join KiwiSaver they will not be able to receive additional employer contributions.

As well, as previously announced, the legislation will be amended to make sure that people receive the member tax credit of up to $20 a week from the time they join KiwiSaver. As the legislation is currently worded, some KiwiSaver members would not become eligible for the tax credit until several weeks after they began making contributions.

Under the proposed law change, the member tax credit will apply from the first of the month in which the contribution is made, so that, for example, all contributions that begin in July will be matched by a tax credit from 1 July.

"We are confident these changes will further strengthen KiwiSaver, and make it a more attractive proposition for New Zealanders wishing to secure a more comfortable retirement," said the Ministers.

The changes will be added to the Taxation (Annual Rates, Business Taxation, KiwiSaver and Remedial Matters) Bill, which is currently before Parliament.

SPEECH NOTES

### The role of tax in transforming the economy

Speech notes for address to Ernst & Young Tax Partners/Managers Breakfast, Clearwater Resort, Christchurch

Thank you for the opportunity to talk to your Partner/Manager Tax Conference.

I've been given a number of searching questions about current issues in tax to address with you. I'd like to address those directly. First, by way of background, I'll outline the economic environment and the context of our recent changes in tax and savings.

The government's vision for our economy is for a high-skill, high-value and innovative economy, well-connected to global markets. Reforms we have made this year to business tax are carefully designed to help realise our vision.

The only way to increase our real prosperity in the long term is to increase our productivity. High productivity is a matter of getting a lot of things right - from our skills and investment in knowledge and innovation, to capital markets and global connections.

The tax environment has a crucial influence on many of these. The government announced a $3.4 billion package of business tax reform this year. It's the biggest change to business taxation in twenty years. The aim of the package is to develop a more innovative and dynamic economy.

The business tax reforms will help our businesses to grow and compete in the global economy. The headline corporate rate was cut, and the tax treatment of savings vehicles brought into line. Market development assistance and skills training were expanded in the package.

The proposed tax exemption for active income from a controlled foreign company will also bring New Zealand into line with international norms.

New Zealand needs to prepare for a global economy that is becoming increasingly borderless. We need to be able to attract and retain capital and our businesses need to be able to compete effectively in foreign markets.

The international tax changes help to boost our competitiveness as a place in which globally connected firms can locate and expand.

Rising productivity also depends on innovation, and innovation comes from research and development. That's why the business tax reform package included the tax credit of fifteen per cent of allowable research and development expenditure. It will encourage more businesses to invest in more R&D.

You asked whether I anticipate an influx of R&D investment into New Zealand from countries with a less generous jurisdiction. I certainly hope so. If we attract more world class R&D that can only add to our knowledge base and stimulate more innovation.

Most countries offer some incentive, so our changes make New Zealand more competitive.

The case for locating greater R&D here is now more compelling. International companies will now look much more positively at this country, weighing up our existing clusters of R&D and world class universities where they can leverage off academic research.

The more international R&D we encourage to relocate, the better it will be too for home grown R&D. A greater pool of R&D should improve the rewards from research and help to retain our brightest researchers.

There is no doubt our new regime is far more generous than many other countries, including our close rival and friend, Australia. After the Business Tax Reform package was announced the Australian Financial Review began its story by saying,

_"New Zealand is luring businesses across the Tasman..."_

A senior tax partner quoted in the paper's story said,

_"There are companies which in the past have relocated R&D facilities from New Zealand to Australia. This may well reverse that trend."_

The Australian Financial Review thinks the New Zealand R&D regime is an improvement on Australia's. That's even allowing for changes made in the Australian budget this year, which made it easier for some multinational businesses to claim R&D concessions across the Tasman.

The Australian Financial Review reported that rules governing who could apply for the tax credit here are less restrictive than the rules concerning who could apply for an Australian credit.

To sum up our business tax package, the paper said,

_"R&D investment could flow back across the Tasman."_

It's not surprising, then, you asked my view of whether there is likely to be any policy intervention if R&D claims are significantly higher than forecast.

The government believes about two and a half thousand businesses could start claiming the credit. Their activity should help to lift our growth rate. More research and development spending will also lift the maximum speed at which our economy can sustainably grow - because R&D will help to make our processes more efficient and so our products more competitive. More R&D will therefore benefit the economy more widely.

Academic research is quite clear that, while wider economic benefits from R&D are difficult to observe, so called "spillover" benefits exist, might be quite large and may be even larger than the direct returns to the person doing the R&D.

That's the central point about the business tax reform package: there are widespread economic benefits from the sorts of activities the package encourages, namely increased investment from the lower corporate rate and increased innovation from the R & D tax credit.

This is ultimately all about lifting the sustainable rate of growth of the economy.

You've also asked for my comments on issues connected to the housing market and monetary policy - and the relationship between them and productivity in the economy.

The strength of the housing market has been undoubtedly fuelling inflation, the one factor continually noted by the Reserve Bank as its major concern. Recent data shows some flattening in activity though it is too early to say this is a trend.

There is no doubt rising housing prices are proving challenging for many, and we should be concerned. Home ownership is important because it strengthens social bonds and creates a sense of community belonging. The Labour-led government has long recognised this (unlike the Opposition which has only recently discovered the issue) which is why KiwiSaver provides considerable help for first home buyers. There is additional work underway by my colleague Housing Minister Chris Carter.

It's clear that the investment property boom is having some influence on keeping house prices rising at the rates they have been recently. Some concern has been expressed about the impact of the tax system on speculative activity. Under current law, trading in housing with the intention of making a capital gain is taxable. The government moved in the budget to underline the significance of the current tax position and to send a clear message to housing investors. An extra $14.6 million is being provided to Inland Revenue to strengthen its ability to audit property transactions.

A select committee is considering the topic of housing affordability at the moment.

Another committee is also looking at monetary policy. The finance and expenditure committee is examining what additional measures could support monetary policy in New Zealand.

The accepted consensus has been that our monetary policy framework doesn't have an impact on long run growth. In other words, monetary policy helps keep the economy stable by moderating economic cycles, without impacting on the sustainable rate of growth of the economy.

My overriding concern is that this view no longer holds. Despite the fall over the last week, the dollar is still well above a position justified by medium-term fundamentals and has been for a long time - much longer than in previous economic cycles. That can have an effect on how people see the long run returns to exporting and there's a risk that people decide that exporting or investing in exporting is simply not worth the effort.

I have to say I'm impressed at the resilience our exporting sector overall is showing. For example, the July National Bank Business Outlook showed that a net 15 per cent of exporters expect to increase export volumes in the next year. In times where the dollar has been reaching post-float highs, this could be much worse. But of course, the story differs between sectors, and exporters are wider than just dairy farmers.

So I think we need to look seriously at the monetary policy framework and whether it can be made more effective at curing the inflation disease without killing the patient in the process.

We should not be afraid of exploring new ideas and openly debating them.

It is useful to remember that the government has done its bit to support monetary policy.

The fiscal surpluses the government has run in recent years help to lean against domestic demand, and therefore against inflationary pressure. When you add up government spending and subtract taxation, and the investment we are making in the New Zealand Superannuation Fund, the government is removing demand from the economy. As I said in Parliament last week, we run the tightest fiscal policy of any political party.

Early indications are that the cash surplus for the last financial year is likely to be higher than forecast at Budget time, reinforcing the fact that the government has not been fuelling inflation.

KiwiSaver will also reduce pressure on monetary policy by removing demand from the economy. If we save more, we consume less.

You have asked me to comment on the Trans-Tasman effect of changes to savings habits here, through KiwiSaver and the Superannuation Fund.

Saving builds the wealth of New Zealanders and helps build the pool of assets needed for business investment.

Australians have been reaping the benefit of their compulsory superannuation scheme for some time. Every time an Australian private equity firm crosses the Tasman to invest in one of our innovative and growing enterprises, they are doing so with a trillion dollar deep pool of savings created by superannuation contributions.

As the size of our current account deficit shows we have been reliant on overseas savers rather than our own for a large proportion of the capital our businesses need. As KiwiSaver grows, I look forward to more of our own firms crossing back the other way.

The early signs of take-up rates for KiwiSaver are encouraging. Last week I announced that just five weeks after the KiwiSaver launch IRD has received 92,000 enrolments and just three thousand opt-outs. The most heartening aspect has been the number of workers – 80,000 – who have actively chosen KiwiSaver.

These savings will help our businesses by making more kiwi capital available.

It will also take some of the pressure off monetary policy. Saving more, instead of spending more, will help to ease inflationary pressure, taking pressure off interest rates and the exchange rate.

These concerns are relevant to the final point you asked me to comment on - my view of where personal tax rates are likely to head in future.

The room for changes to personal tax rates has been constrained by fiscal and economic conditions. In recent years there were considerations about our priorities for government expenditure; then, as the economy continued to grow strongly, we have had to be careful not to exacerbate imbalances that have built up.

In the seven and a half years since the Labour government was elected, we have invested heavily in priorities such as infrastructure and restoring the health system. Within the tax environment, the priority was to lift struggling families out of poverty - the Working for Families package, which came into full effect this year, made a very significant difference to families that needed it most. A recent OECD study showed that a family on the average wage with two children pays one of the lowest tax wedges in the developed world.

The Business Tax Reform Package, building on other business tax reform, was the next priority, because we need to lock in higher productivity and stronger economic growth.

For those who criticise the government for not cutting taxes, they should remember that tax relief since Budget 2004 – from business tax changes, Working for Families and KiwiSaver – totals $2.8 billion this year, rising to $4.5 billion in 2010/11.

As I noted in the Budget, if we had also attempted to cut personal tax rates this year the pressure on monetary policy would have been very serious. The Reserve Bank would certainly have responded with interest rate increases that would remove most of the value of any tax cut, and our exchange rate would have risen even higher.

As we look ahead we can expect some of those economic pressures to begin to ease as a rebalancing takes place between our strong domestic demand and the external sector. I have indicated previously that by the budget next year I expect to be able to outline the long term programme around taxation.

The priority will be to ensure that we continue to grow our economy, prepare for the challenges ahead of us and provide for our highest priority needs today.

I am confident that changes in the tax environment this year will help to prepare New Zealand to be a dynamic, connected economy able to meet those challenges.

Govt to close PIE tax loopholes
===============================

The government announced today that it will close loopholes in the tax rules on portfolio investment entities (PIEs) to prevent their use by land-owning companies seeking tax advantages for their shareholders. The changes will be made effective from 1 October 2007, when the PIE rules come into force.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Government to close PIE tax loopholes

The government will close loopholes in the tax rules on portfolio investment entities (PIEs) to prevent their use by land-owning companies seeking tax advantages for their shareholders, Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne announced today.

The PIE rules coming into force on 1 October 2007 prevent lower-income people being over-taxed on their earnings through passive savings vehicles such as managed funds. Investors in savings vehicles that choose to become PIEs and whose personal tax rates are 33 per cent or 39 per cent will have their earnings taxed at a final rate of 33 per cent until the beginning of the 2008-09 income year, when it will drop to 30 per cent. Investors on lower income tax rates will be taxed at 19.5 per cent.

"To ensure that these tax rate benefits are not clawed back, dividends paid by companies qualifying as PIEs are not taxed – unless the shareholder elects that they are. This make PIEs an attractive form for companies that earn some non-taxable income that they want to distribute to shareholders," the Ministers said.

"It appears that, because PIEs can invest in land, some land-owning companies that run active businesses are contemplating using a gap in the new rules to structure the land part of their business as a PIE, to reduce final tax on shareholder earnings. That is against the policy intent of the PIE rules. The government will introduce legislation at the earliest opportunity to prevent it occurring, allowing sufficient time for consultation.

"A second recently identified gap in the new rules concerns the requirement that income earned by PIEs must be passive in nature. An error in the legislation, however, means that requirement does not apply to PIE subsidiaries, which it should. That error will be corrected as soon as possible," the Ministers said.

The signalled changes will be made effective from 1 October 2007.

A set of broad guidelines \[below\] were also released today to help land-owning companies that are contemplating becoming PIES to determine whether such a move would be consistent with the policy rationale of the rules.

### PIE guidelines for land-owning companies

The portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules were introduced last year to reduce barriers for people who invest through savings vehicles. The policy intent of the rules is that PIEs should be passive investment vehicles, such as managed funds.

**Can land-owning companies be PIEs?**

PIEs are able to hold land, as well as shares and debt investments, since prudent investment management principles generally require portfolio investments to be diversified.

Widely held companies can be PIEs if their main activity is to lease land and buildings to people who run businesses on those premises, since passive income includes rent from leases (but not payments from licenses to occupy). Listed property trusts that own commercial buildings would generally fall into this category.

The PIE rules were not, however, designed for active businesses that hold most of their assets in land – such as airports, hotels and rest homes.

**Gaps in the legislation**

Gaps in the current law allow companies to qualify technically as PIEs by using the following arrangements, contrary to the policy intent:

_Stapled securities_

While the rules ensure that companies with active operations cannot be PIEs, the land and active business parts of a company can be divided into separate companies. The company with the land qualifies as a PIE in its own right. The shares in both companies are "stapled" so they can only be bought and sold as a package. This means that the land part of a land-rich business can qualify for the PIE rules, even though the land and the active business remain part of the same economic unit.

_Leasing land to an associated company_

Another way of achieving the same effect as stapled securities is within a group of companies. Under this structure, a land-owning company leases land and buildings to an operating company, which is an associate of the investor. The land company qualifies as a PIE. As long as the operating company is worth no more than 10 per cent of the group, the group could operate as a PIE.

_PIE subsidiaries_

The law requires income from PIEs to be passive in nature. An error in the legislation, however, means that this requirement does not apply to land-owning subsidiaries of PIEs. As a result, a land-owning company's active business could be put into a subsidiary, thereby allowing it to earn active income without jeopardising its PIE status.

Emissions trading scheme tax issues
===================================

The tax consequences of the government's proposed emissions trading scheme are the subject of an officials' issues paper released today for public consultation. It seeks feedback on suggestions for dealing with emerging tax issues such as the tax treatment of emissions obligations, the consequences of free allocation of emissions units and the timing of recognition of income and expenditure. It also deals with tax issues relating specifically to the forestry sector, which is expected to be the first to enter the proposed scheme. The closing date for submissions relating to the forestry industry is 28 October, and for submissions on general tax issues it is 30 November.

### Tax side of emissions trading scheme under consideration

The tax consequences of the government's proposed emissions trading scheme are the subject of an officials' issues paper released today for public consultation.

"Introduction of the proposed emissions trading scheme will have income tax and GST implications for participants," Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said today.

"Core tax issues that will have to be dealt with include the general tax treatment of emissions obligations, the consequences of free allocation of emissions units, and the timing of recognition of income and expenditure.

"There are also tax issues relating specifically to the forestry sector, which is expected to be the first to enter the proposed scheme.

"The issues paper is the first step towards the progressive development of an approach to the taxation of income and expenditure arising from the emissions trading scheme.

"As part of the government's tax policy consultative process, officials are seeking feedback on suggestions for dealing with the emerging tax issues, inviting the views of interested parties. That feedback will be taken into account in determining the degree of tax legislative change that will be necessary.

"The preliminary stance taken by the issues paper is that for sectors other than forestry, expenditure associated with meeting emissions trading scheme obligations should be a tax-deductible expense and recognised on an accruals or emerging basis over time.

"In a similar vein, income from the allocation of free emissions trading units should be recognised as taxable income on an emerging basis over time.

"In relation to forests planted before 1990, the paper suggests that the receipt of free emissions trading units should be non-taxable, and expenditure associated with a change in land use should be non-deductible.

"In relation to forests planted after 1989, the paper suggests that income derived from the receipt of emissions trading units should be taxable, although there will be problems associated with the recognition and timing of income and expenditure.

"The paper suggests that emissions trading units should attract GST in the same way that any other good or service supplied by a register person is subject to the tax.

"These are all important tax questions for participants in the scheme and their tax and financial advisers. We therefore urge all interested parties to take the opportunity to express their views on the ideas set out in the paper.

"The closing date for submissions on tax matters relating to the forestry industry is 28 October, and for submissions on general tax issues it is 30 November," they said.

EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 1 Please quote reference: IG3162 ALLOWANCES AND PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES – EXEMPTION UNDER SECTION CW 13 OF THE INCOME TAX ACT 2004 Summary 1. Unless otherwise stated, all legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2004. 2. Generally allowances paid to employees in connection with employment or service are income of the employee. However, the allowance may represent a payment from the employer relating to expenditure incurred by the employee. These type of allowances and/or payments are income of the employee unless excluded because they are exempt, or the payment is reimbursing the employee for expenditure that is actually the employer’s liability. 3. For an amount paid to be exempt income, the expenditure for which the payment is made must be such that it would be an allowable deduction to the employee, if the employment limitation did not exist. 4. Where an employee is reimbursed by their employer for expenditure paid in connection with their employment or service where that expenditure is actually the liability of their employer, that amount reimbursed is not income. However the employer may still need to consider whether there has been a benefit provided to the employee (to which the liability related) which is subject to fringe benefit tax. This Interpretation Guideline sets out the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s view on the interpretation of section CW 13 of the Income Tax Act 2004. It sets out the general principles in applying section CW 13 in respect of a number of allowances or payments made to employees that could be seen to be of a private or domestic nature, or capital nature. In October 2006 the Commissioner issued a draft “Question we’ve been asked” item (QB00056) dealing with the treatment of amounts paid by an employer, in connection with the relocation of new employees. Submissions received in response to QB00056 have been taken into account in the development of this Interpretation Guideline. If this Interpretation Guideline is finalised in its current form, it will supersede any prior statement made by the Commissioner in relation to the type of allowances or payments discussed in the Guideline, including an item titled “Relocation Expenses — Section 73 of the Income Tax Act 1976” in Public Information Bulletin No. 171 (March 1988). It is also anticipated that QB00056 will not be finalised as this wider statement covers the exemption of allowances and payments made to the relocation of new employees. The application date, and any transitional issues will also be considered before this Interpretation Guideline is finalised. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 2 5. This Interpretation Guideline provides general guidance on how the Commissioner interprets and applies the provisions that exclude or exempt these types of payments being income of the employee. This Interpretation Guideline focuses on the treatment of the payment in the hands of the employee and does not consider issues of deductibility and fringe benefit tax for the employer. 6. Section CW 13 sets out when a payment to an employee will be exempt from income tax when the expenditure for which the allowance or payment is made could be seen to be of a private or domestic nature, or capital nature. 7. The Commissioner has considered three Court of Appeal cases dealing with the deductibility of employment-related expenditure under the former section 105 and the Fourth Schedule of the Income Tax Act 1976 (1976 Act). While these cases were decided under legislation that has now been repealed, they deal with the issue of what is expenditure of a private or domestic nature and are, therefore, still helpful in determining whether or not such expenditure will be deductible under the current legislation and exempt from tax under section CW 13, which is the focus of this Interpretation Guideline. From these cases the Commissioner has developed a set of questions that will assist in determining whether an expenditure, of the type under consideration, will qualify for exemption under section CW 13. The application of these questions is illustrated in relation to some of the more commonly paid allowances that could be seen to be of a private or domestic nature such as meal and clothing allowances and reimbursing payments made in respect of employee relocation expenses. This Interpretation Guideline also considers the treatment under section CW 13 of a payment or allowance to an employee which represents a payment or reimbursement for capital expenditure. 8. The Commissioner considers that for an allowance or a payment (not being an allowance or a payment made to the employee in respect of capital expenditure incurred by the employee) to be exempt from income tax under section CW 13, all the following three questions must be answered in the affirmative: (i) Was the employee performing an obligation under the contract of service at the time the expenditure was incurred? (ii) Did the obligation serve the purpose of the income-earning process of deriving income from employment? (iii) Was the expenditure incurred by the employee necessary as a practical requirement of the performance of the obligation? 9. These questions were not expressly formulated by the courts in relation to the legislation under which the Court of Appeal cases were decided. However, the cases are the most relevant in the area of the tax deductibility of employment-related expenditure. From these cases, the Commissioner has formed the above set of questions he considers most applicable to the current EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 3 legislation. If the three questions are answered in the affirmative, it is the Commissioner’s view that the exemptions in section CW 13 would apply. \[However, this would be subject to the other limitations in section DA 2 not applying and in particular the capital limitation in section DA 2(1).\] 10. This Interpretation Guideline concludes that some allowances or payments made to employees that could be seen to be of a private or domestic nature, or capital nature, and may have been treated as exempt from income tax in the past will no longer qualify for exemption under the current legislation. 11. In considering the issues in this Interpretation Guideline, the Commissioner has applied the current legislation to three of the more common types of allowances or reimbursements paid to employees (that could be seen to be of a private or domestic nature, or capital nature), namely payments in respect of meals, clothing and home relocation. The Commissioner has determined that the exemption of those payments will be limited to the following: Meal allowances or reimbursements 12. The Commissioner considers that the following payments by an employer to an employee for the reimbursement of meal costs (whether actual reimbursement or an allowance paid to cover such costs), where the employee pays the cost of the meal, will only qualify for exemption under section CW 13 where: • meals are taken as part of business or work meetings; or • meals are taken as part of entertaining business clients; or • meals are taken by the employee when absent from his or her home for attending a business conference or meeting where such absence necessitates the employee being absent from home overnight. Clothing allowances or reimbursements 13. The Commissioner considers the following allowances or reimbursement of clothing costs, where the employee pays for the costs of the clothing, will only qualify for exemption under section CW 13 where: • the expenditure is in respect of protective clothing or footwear; or • the expenditure is in respect of a uniform or special clothing in the nature of a uniform; or • the employee incurs abnormal expenditure on conventional clothing due to excessive wear and tear or the need for a greater quantity of conventional clothing. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 4 Home relocation allowances or reimbursements 14. The Commissioner considers that employer paid allowances or reimbursements of relocation costs will qualify for exemption under section CW 13 when the relocation costs relate to a requirement in the employment contract that the employee transfers at the request of the employer at any time and the employee is relocated in the same job and moves home to the new location. It is also relevant to note that some costs associated with employee relocation may not be exempt because they are of a capital nature. 15. Attached in an appendix to this Interpretation Guideline are three flow charts that will provide guidance in determining whether a payment made by an employer to an employee is: • exempt from income tax under section CW 13; • subject to income tax; • within the fringe benefit tax provisions; • not treated as income of the employee. Background 16. Section CE 1 lists items that are income derived by a person in connection with their employment or service. Amounts paid as allowances and amounts paid as expenditure on account of an employee are listed in section CE 1. However these amounts can qualify for exemption under section CW 13 or be excluded from income under section CE 5(3)(c). 17. For an amount paid to be exempt income under section CW 13, the amount must be in respect of expenditure that would be an allowable deduction to the employee, if the employment limitation in section DA 2(4) did not exist. This section prohibits deductions for expenditure or loss incurred in gaining or producing income from employment (the “employment limitation”). Certain deductions are not allowed when calculating assessable income. The relevant ones in relation to allowances and payments made to employees are deductions for private and domestic expenditure (the “private limitation”) and capital expenditure (the “capital limitation”). 18. For an amount to be excluded under section CE 5(3)(c), the reimbursement by the employer must be for expenditure paid by the employee in connection with their employment or service where that expenditure is actually the liability of the employer. The employer will still need to consider whether there has been a benefit provided to the employee which is subject to fringe benefit tax. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 5 Legislation 19. Sections BD 2, CE 1, CE 5(1)–(3)(c), CW 13, CW 14, and DA 2(1)–(4) and (7) are as follows: BD 2 Deductions An amount is a deduction of a person if they are allowed a deduction for the amount under Part D (Deductions) CE 1 Amounts derived in connection with employment The following amounts derived by a person in connection with their employment or service are income of the person: (a) salary or wages or an allowance, bonus, extra pay, or gratuity: (b) expenditure on account of an employee that is expenditure on account of the person: (c) the market value of board that the person receives in connection with their employment or service: (d) a benefit received under a share purchase agreement: (e) directors’ fees: (f) compensation for loss of employment or service: (g) any other benefit in money.

This rule is called the employment limitation. Relationship of general limitations to general permission (5) Each of the general limitations in this section overrides the general permission. 20. The following definitions in section OB 1 are relevant to the discussion on sections CW 13 and CW 14: amount— (a) includes an amount in money’s worth: (b) ... deduction, for a person, means a deduction of the person under section BD 2 (Deductions) EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 8 employee— (a) means a person who receives or is entitled to receive a source deduction payment: (b) in sections CW 13 (Expenditure on account, and reimbursement, of employees) and CW 14 (Allowance for additional transport costs),— (i) means a person who receives or is entitled to receive a source deduction payment; and (ii) includes a person to whom section OB 2(2) (Meaning of source deduction payment: shareholder-employees of close companies) applies: ... employer— (a) means a person who pays or is liable to pay a source deduction payment: (b) ... employment limitation is defined in section DA 2(4) (General limitations) expenditure on account of an employee is defined in section CE 5 (Meaning of expenditure on account of an employee) source deduction payment is defined in section OB 2(1) (Meaning of source deduction payment: shareholder-employees of close companies) 21. Section OB 2(1) states: OB 2 Meaning of source deduction payment: shareholder-employees of close companies (1) In this Act, except as provided in subsection (2), source deduction payment means a payment by way of salary or wages, an extra pay, or a withholding payment, but does not include an amount attributed in accordance with section GC 14D. Application of the Legislation 22. Section CW 13 operates to exempt allowances and payments that are expenditure on account of an employee that would otherwise be income derived in connection with the employee’s employment or service under section CE 1. 23. “Employee” is defined in section OB 1 to mean for the purposes of section CW 13 a person who receives or is entitled to receive a source deduction payment. “Employer” is also defined in section OB 1 to mean a person who pays or is liable to pay a source deduction payment. “Source deduction payment” is defined in section OB 2(1) to mean a payment by way of salary or wages, an extra pay, or a withholding payment. A person receiving a withholding payment is an employee for the purposes of section CW 13. This means a person in receipt of a withholding payment could qualify for an exemption for an allowance paid in addition to the withholding payment. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 9 24. The reference to “employee” in this Interpretation Guideline also includes (where appropriate) a person in receipt of withholding payments. The meaning of “in connection with” in section CE 1 25. The phrase “in connection with” in section CE 1 replaced the phrase “in respect of or in relation to” used in the corresponding provision, the definition of “monetary remuneration”, in the Income Tax Act 1994 (1994 Act). Section YA 3(3) provides that provisions in the 2004 Act are intended to have the same effect as the corresponding provisions in the 1994 Act, although they have been rewritten. The exception is, pursuant to section YA 3(5), where an "identified policy change", as specified in schedule 22A, exists. 26. In this instance no identified policy change has been specified in schedule 22A. Therefore, the presumption is that the adoption of the term "in connection with" was not intended to give rise to an interpretation that differs from that which would apply if the term "in respect of or in relation to", as used in the definition of "monetary remuneration" under the 1994 Act, still applied. It is therefore relevant to consider the meaning of the phrase "in respect of or in relation to" in the interpretation of the phrase "in connection with" in this situation. 27. The Concise Oxford Dictionary (Oxford University Press, 11 th ed. Revised 2006) defines “connection” as a link or relationship between people or things. 28. The courts have considered the meaning of “in respect of or in relation to” on several occasions (State Government Insurance v Rees (1979) 144 CLR 549, Nowegijick v R (1983) 144 DLR (3d) 193, Smith v FCT 19 ATR 27, FCT v Rowe (1995) 95 ATC 4,691, Shell New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303 and CIR v Fraser (1996) 18 NZTC 12,607). In summary, these cases explain the meaning of the phrase as follows: • The words “in respect of or in relation to” have a very wide meaning. • There must be a sufficient connection between the subjects according to the context in which the words are used. There must be a sufficient or material relationship between the benefit and the employment. Therefore, the phrase “in connection with” has the same wide meaning as the former phrase “in respect of or in relation to”. 29. It is acknowledged that not all payments by an employer to an employee will be considered as being amounts derived in connection with employment or service: see e.g. Public Ruling BR Pub 06/06: Employment Court Awards for Lost Wages or Other Remuneration - Employers' Liability to Make Tax Deductions. However, when an employer makes a payment to an employee, it will generally be taken to be “in connection with” the employee’s employment or service, unless the parties can establish that the particular facts are otherwise. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 10 30. In considering whether such a connection exists in the context of the definition of the former phrase “monetary remuneration”, the courts have focused on whether the payment is a consequence of the employment or service (Smith v FCT, FCT v Rowe, CIR v Fraser, and Shell New Zealand Ltd v CIR ). 31. Taxation Review Authority (TRA) decisions on the former legislation also illustrate the wide meaning that may be attributed to the words “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer”. In Case L92 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,530, Barber DJ considered the term “monetary remuneration” in relation to a payment of compensation for unjustified dismissal under the Industrial Relations Act 1973. The compensation was calculated on the basis of the personal hurt and procedural unfairness suffered by the objector. Barber DJ found that, even though the payment was compensatory in nature, it was money received in respect of the objector’s employment. He stated that the words “compensation for loss of office or employment”, “emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money” and “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer” have a wide embrace and go beyond the narrower concept of “salary, wage, allowance, bonus gratuity, extra salary” which precede them. On the particular facts of this case he held that “monetary remuneration”, interpreted widely, covered the payment in issue. 32. Some examples of a court holding the payment to be a consequence of the employment relationship are as follows: • An employee incurred costs when complying with the employer’s request to transfer (Shell New Zealand Ltd v CIR). • An employee received a lump sum payment from a new employer to compensate the employee for a possible loss of a capital gain on share options in the employee’s former employer company (Pickford v FC of T 98 ATC 2,268). The Administrative Appeals Tribunal found that the $20,000 payment was an inducement to enter into the employment of the new employer and its source was in the service to be rendered by the taxpayer. The payment was an incident of the taxpayer’s income-earning activities as an employee. • An employee received payments for successfully completing a course of study that was related to the employee’s employment (Smith v FCT). • A soccer player received a payment from the player’s current club to transfer to another club. The transfer fee was deemed to be “an emolument from employment” (Shilton v Wilmshurst (Inspector of Taxes) \[1991\] 3 All ER 148 (HL)). 33. Two examples of a court holding that a payment to an employee had not arisen as a consequence of an employment relationship are as follows: EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 11 • A payment made in respect of a debt owed to the employee for paying accounts that were the employer’s liability. In such circumstances, the true relationship between the employer and employee in respect of the payment is not that of employer–employee, but of creditor–debtor (TRA Case M23 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,124). • A payment to compensate for the giving up of a vocation as a television current affairs presenter (CIR v Fraser). 34. It is the Commissioner’s view, supported by relevant case law, that for the purposes of section CE 1 a payment made “in connection with ... employment or service” has a very wide meaning and would include payments made in respect of future, present, or past employment or service provided there is a link between the payment and the recipient that arises from the employment or service relationship. The nature of the payment is critical in order to determine whether it is salary or wages, an allowance, a bonus, extra salary, or other benefit in money, or a payment on account of an employee (as described immediately below), thereby being amounts derived in connection with the employment or service of the person. Expenditure on account of an employee 35. Section CE 1 sets out certain items that will be the income of employees in relation to their employment or service. One item (under paragraph (b)) is “expenditure on account of an employee”, which is defined in section CE 5. 36. Section CE 5(1) and (3)(a)–(c) states: (1) Expenditure on account of an employee means a payment made by an employer relating to expenditure incurred by an employee. ... (3) Expenditure on account of an employee does not include— (a) expenditure for the benefit of the employee, or a payment made to reimburse an employee, under section CW 13 (Expenditure on account, and reimbursement, of employees): (b) an allowance for additional transport costs under section CW 14 (Allowance for additional transport costs): (c) expenses that an employee pays in connection with their employment or service to the extent to which the expenditure is their employer’s liability, if the employee undertakes to discharge the liability in consideration of the making of the payment by the employee: 37. In order to be income under CE 1, section CE 5(1) requires a payment by the employer relating to expenditure incurred by an employee. Certain payments are excluded from the definition of “expenditure on account of an employee” under subsection (3) of section CE 5. These include: • expenditure that qualifies for exemption under section CW 13: EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 12 • payment of an allowance for additional transport costs under section CW 14: • a payment that is reimbursing the employee for expenditure that is actually the employer’s liability under section CE 5(3)(c). The focus of this Interpretation Guideline is the exemption provided in section CW 13. The exclusions provided in sections CE 5(3)(b) and CE 5(3)(c) are discussed further below. Amounts exempt under section CW 13 38. Section CW 13 exempts from income tax the following types of payments to (or on behalf of) employees: 39. Payments that are expenditure on account of an employee and for which the employee would be entitled to a deduction (from income from employment) if the employment limitation did not exist (subsection (1)). 40. Payments that reimburse the employee to the extent they reimburse the employee for expenditure for which the employee would be allowed a deduction (from income from employment) if the employment limitation did not exist (subsection (2)). 41. Section CW 13, therefore, provides for the exemption of payments made to employees when the expenditure that the payment is made in respect of, would be a deductible expense (from that income from employment) if the employment limitation did not exist. In effect section CW 13 provides that employees are entitled to an exemption for expenditure on the same basis that deductibility of expenditure applies to all taxpayers. As with all classes of taxpayer, expenditure of a private or domestic or capital nature is not tax deductible. This means any payment or reimbursement to an employee that is of a private or domestic or capital nature cannot be exempt from income tax in the hands of the employee. 42. This Interpretation Guideline looks at these types of payments and reimbursement in the context of the exemption of payments to employees that could be seen to be of a private or domestic or capital nature. This statement focuses, initially, on reimbursement payments that come within section CW 13(2). 43. Section CW13 (1) has similar tests to section CW 13 (2) but additional issues must be considered which are discussed in more detail later in this Interpretation Guideline. Reimbursing payments: section CW 13(2) 44. For a payment to qualify as an exemption under section CW 13(2), it must satisfy all of the following three tests: EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 13 (i) The payment must be made to the employee in connection with the employee’s employment or service. (ii) The payment must reimburse the employee. (iii) The reimbursement must be for expenditure for which the employee would have been able to claim a deduction were it not for the employment limitation. Test 1: The payment must be made to an employee in connection with the employee’s employment or service 45. The first test involves the consideration of two factors: • Is the recipient an employee? • Is the payment made in connection with the employee’s employment or service? Is the recipient an employee? 46. The recipient of the payment must be an employee. The definition of employee has been discussed earlier in this Interpretation Guideline. An employee is a person who receives or is entitled to receive a source deduction payment. 47. Any person who is not an “employee” is outside the scope of section CW 13, so any payment the person receives that may otherwise be income cannot be exempted from tax under the section. Is the payment made in connection with the employee’s employment or service? 48. The payment must also be in connection with the employee’s employment or service. This means a necessary relationship must exist between the payment the employee receives and the employee’s employment or service. As discussed above, a payment in connection with employment or service has a very wide meaning and can include payments received before, during, and after the employee has actually commenced or finished the employment or service relationship with a particular employer. Where there is a relevant employment or service relationship, the Commissioner considers that the payment will have the necessary connection with the employee’s employment or service unless it can be established otherwise. Test 2: The payment must reimburse the employee 49. Section CW 13(2) applies to exempt an amount paid only to the extent the payment reimburses (or is an allowance that reimburses) the employee. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 14 50. A payment will constitute a reimbursement of the employee’s expenditure when it reimburses expenditure paid by the employee (Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v FCT 93 ATC 4,508, TRA Case E37 (1981) 5 NZTC 59,241, and TRA Case E82 (1981) 5 NZTC 59,434). See also TRA Case K15 (1988) 10 NZTC 196 where Bathgate DJ (at page 204) stated: For a payment to constitute a reimbursement I think there would have to be first proved a disbursement, an expenditure paid, before that could be reimbursed. The employee must have incurred (or be likely to incur) some expenditure in order that a reimbursement by the employer can attract the exemption provided by the section. 51. It is not necessary that the reimbursement is the actual amount the employee has expended. Section CW 13(3) covers the employer’s estimation of an amount of expenditure an employee is likely to incur for which a “reimbursement allowance is payable”. Section CW 13(3) states: (3) For the purposes of subsection (2),— (a) the employer may make, for a relevant period, a reasonable estimate of the amount of expenditure likely to be incurred by the employee or a group of employees for which reimbursement is payable, and (b) the amount estimated is treated as if it were the amount incurred during the period to which the estimate relates. Therefore, in section CW 13(2) the word “amount” will include not only actual reimbursements made to employees but also “reimbursing allowances” made to cover estimated expenditure. 52. A travel allowance paid to a travelling sales representative who is an employee is an example of a reimbursing allowance that could meet the requirements for estimation under section CW 13(2). 53. Amounts paid or allowances given to compensate the employee for the nature of the employee’s work that do not require any outlay by the employee (so there is nothing for the employer to reimburse) will not qualify for exemption. Non-qualifying payments could include allowances such as dirt money or height money or other allowances paid to compensate the employee for working in unpleasant or demanding conditions, rather than to compensate the employee for any expenditure incurred. 54. Section CW 13(3) provides that an employer may estimate the amount of expenditure likely to be incurred by an employee or a group of employees for which a reimbursing allowance is payable. However, to “reimburse” an employee, as contemplated by the section, there must be specific actual or future expenditure to reimburse. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 15 Test 3: The reimbursement must be for expenditure for which the employee would have been able to claim a deduction were it not for the employment limitation 55. Under section CW 13(2), for an amount to be exempt the payment must reimburse the employee for expenditure the employee would have been entitled to deduct if it were not prohibited by the employment limitation. Statutory limitations 56. In the context of this Interpretation Guideline, statutory limitations affect the deductibility of expenditure incurred by taxpayers deriving income from employment. Subpart DA sets out the general rules relating to the deductibility of expenditure. Section DA 1 is the “general permission” section that permits a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent it is incurred by the person in deriving their assessable income. 57. However, the employment limitation in section DA 2(4) denies a person a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent it is incurred in deriving income from employment. This employment limitation is, however, ignored when deciding whether an amount (an allowance or a reimbursement) paid by an employer to an employee is exempt from tax under section CW 13. 58. Also relevant are sections DA 2(1) (capital limitation) and DA 2(2) (private limitation). These subsections prevent a taxpayer from claiming a deduction for expenditure of a capital nature or of a private or domestic nature. This requires an analysis of what constitutes expenditure of a “private or domestic” or “capital” nature. Private or domestic expenditure 59. To be exempt under section CW 13(2), the expenditure the reimbursement from the employer is intended to cover must, if it were not for the employment limitation, be an allowable deduction to the employee. Therefore, deductibility needs to be considered in accordance with section DA 1, that is, the expenditure must “be incurred ... in deriving ... assessable income”. 60. One of the additional tests for deductibility is that the expenditure must not fall within the exclusion of the private limitation; that is, it must not be expenditure of “a private or domestic nature”. \[The other relevant additional test for deductibility is that the expenditure must not fall within the exclusion of the capital limitation; that is, it must not be expenditure of “capital nature”. This test is discussed later in this Interpretation Guideline.\] 61. What constitutes private or domestic expenditure in an income tax context has been discussed by the courts in New Zealand and overseas on numerous occasions. Inevitably, the conclusions reached by the courts have been based on the particular facts of each case. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 16 62. In New Zealand, the Court of Appeal has dealt with three cases that considered the deductibility of expenditure by employees where that expenditure was considered by the Commissioner to be of a private or domestic nature (CIR v Haenga (1985) 7 NZTC 5,198, CIR v Belcher (1988) 10 NZTC 5,164, and Hunter v CIR (1990) 12 NZTC 7,169). These cases were considered under sections 104, 105 and 106 and the Fourth Schedule of the 1976 Act (all now repealed). 63. The court considered that under the 1976 Act, section 105 (deductibility of expenditure from income from employment) was a substitution for the main deductibility provision of section 104. Section 104 had virtually the same wording as section BD 2(1) of the 1994 Act, which had the same effect as section DA 1(1) of the 2004 Act. Therefore, the principles in relation to whether expenditure is private or domestic from those decisions are likely to be appropriate when considering deductibility under the current legislation. The cases 64. The taxpayers in the three Court of Appeal cases (Haenga, Belcher, and Hunter) were salary and wage earners (employees). When the cases were decided a specific regime in the 1976 Act dealt with the deductibility of expenditure for salary and wage earners. The legislative regime was as follows: 101 Deductions unless expressly provided Except as expressly provided in this Act, no deduction shall be made in respect of any expenditure or loss of any kind for the purpose of calculating the assessable income of any taxpayer. 104 Expenditure or loss incurred in production of assessable income In calculating the assessable income of any taxpayer any expenditure or loss to the extent which it— (a) Is incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income in any income year; or (b) Is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year— may, except as otherwise provided in this Act, be deducted from the total income derived by the taxpayer in the income year in which the expenditure or loss is incurred. 105 Deduction for expenditure or loss incurred in production of income from employment (1) ... (2) For the purposes of section 104 of this Act, and notwithstanding the proviso to section 106(1)(d) of this Act, every taxpayer who in any income year derives assessable income that consists of income from employment shall be deemed to have incurred an amount of expenditure or loss in gaining or producing that income from employment equal to the greater of— (a) ... EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 17 (b) An amount equal to the smaller of— (i) The aggregate of the amounts of the expenditure and losses (being expenditure and losses incurred by the taxpayer in gaining or producing that assessable income) of any of the kinds specified in the Fourth Schedule to this Act, reduced by every amount received (whether before or after the incurring of that expenditure and those losses), by or on behalf of the taxpayer, in respect of or in relation to that expenditure and those losses: ... 106 Certain deductions not permitted (1) Notwithstanding anything in section 104 of this Act, in calculating the assessable income derived by any person from any source, no deduction shall, except as expressly provided in this Act, be made in respect of any of the following sums or matters: (a) ... (j) Any expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature; ... Fourth Schedule Items of expenditure or loss deductible in respect of income from employment: ...... 8. Expenditure incurred by the taxpayer for the purposes of, and as a condition of, his employment, and not being expenditure of any of the kinds referred to in any of the foregoing provisions of this Schedule. 65. In summary, the sections had the following effect: • Section 104 was the general source of tax deductibility, but it was subject to the restrictions in section 106 (for the purposes of this discussion, the prohibition in section 106(1)(j) on expenditure of a “private or domestic nature” is the most relevant). • Section 105 provided for employment-related expenditure to be deemed to satisfy section 104, but did not exclude the application (in particular) of section 106(1)(j). • Section 105 deemed expenditure of the kinds specified in the Fourth Schedule to be incurred in deriving income from employment. • The section 106(1)(j) prohibition applied equally to sections 104 and 105. • For expenditure covered by clause 8 of the Fourth Schedule a further test was that the expenditure must have been “for the purpose of, and a condition of” the employment. • Because of the link from section 105 and the Fourth Schedule to section 104, and the link from section 106 to section 104, a claim for EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 18 expenditure under clause 8 was still subject to the private or domestic prohibition in section 106. 66. Therefore, section 104 was still the source of deductibility and section 106(1)(j) did not exclude section 105(2) expenditure. However, section 106(1)(j) did override section 104 (which included section 105(2) expenditure). This is consistent with the following extracts from Haenga (at page 5,203): 26 The final point about the statutory deduction framework that needs to be noticed is that s 106 bars certain deductions “notwithstanding anything in section 104”. Deductibility in terms of s 105(2) is “For the purposes of section 104” and it follows that deductions in respect of income from employment must meet the requirements of s 106 as well as those imposed directly under s 105(2) and the material provisions of the Fourth Schedule. In that regard s 106(1)(j) bars deduction of “Any expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature” 27 Applying that statutory scheme to the present case three requirements must be satisfied in order for these contributions to be deductible as such for income tax purposes: 1. they must have been “incurred by the taxpayer for the purposes of, and as a condition of, his employment ...” (Fourth Schedule para 8); 2. they must have been incurred by the taxpayer in gaining or producing that assessable income (s 105(2)(b)); and 3. they must not have been of “a private or domestic nature” (s 106(1)(j)). 67. The above sections and schedule of the 1976 Act were interrelated and provided a separate and distinct code of deductibility for salary and wage earners. This “regime” has since been repealed, and so, to determine whether the cases are still relevant to the exemption of salary and wage earners’ allowances, it is necessary to consider the judgements in those decisions in detail. Also, these decisions dealt with items of expenditure that in the ordinary course might appear not to be deductible because of their private or domestic nature. 68. The facts of the three cases are as follows: • Haenga: The taxpayer was an employee of the NZ Railways Corporation and during the 1982 income year claimed a deduction against his employment income for contributions he was required to make by statute to an employee welfare scheme. The welfare scheme was designed, like most similar schemes, to provide certain benefits to employees and their families mainly in respect of health care. Evidence before the Court indicated that membership to the welfare society “resulted in improved work performance and attendance” due to the security and relief afforded to members. This latter aspect appears to have been a significant factor in the Court’s finding for the taxpayer. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 19 • Belcher: Belcher was a senior university lecturer who undertook research work in the United Kingdom during her sabbatical leave and sought to claim a deduction against her employment income for travel to, from and about London and accommodation in London while conducting her research work. The Court heard that she was expected under her conditions of employment to “engage actively in research and to assist in promoting research”. During the 1980 income year the taxpayer applied for, and was granted, special overseas leave to be spent mainly in London. The Court considered that in her circumstances she was contractually required to undertake the work for which the leave was approved. The Court noted that the type of research undertaken could have been carried out only in the United Kingdom; it was not possible to conduct that research in New Zealand. • Hunter: The taxpayer was a police officer who applied for, and gained promotion to, a more senior position in another city. Because of this, he was required to transfer from Christchurch to Lower Hutt. In so doing he incurred expenses in moving over and above the amount reimbursed to him by the New Zealand Police and he sought to claim a deduction against his employment income for legal fees, land agent's charges and other costs arising from the sale of his family home and the purchase of a replacement property. A critical point in this case was the specific transfer requirements included in the New Zealand Police’s General Instructions on Transfer. These instructions laid down strict conditions as to when an officer and his or her family could transfer; for example, it was not possible for the officer to take up his new position until he had established a home in the new city and moved his family with him. The Court saw this in contrast to other (state sector) employees on transfer who had options such as when they moved and whether their families moved with them. In other words, other employees had choices where police officers did not. Case decisions Commissioner’s contention 69. In Haenga and Hunter the Commissioner’s arguments were that the expenditures were of a private or domestic nature, and so were not deductible because of the application of section 106(1)(j) of the 1976 Act. 70. In Belcher the Commissioner first raised the private and domestic argument in the Court of Appeal. The Court rejected this late argument on the basis that it had not been raised in the lower court. Nevertheless, Richardson J went on to consider the argument and expressed the view that the expenditure in Belcher was not of a private or domestic nature. Applicable law EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 20 71. All three cases were held to fall within the provisions of section 105 and clause 8 of the Fourth Schedule of the 1976 Act. (In Belcher there was some discussion as to whether some expenditure was more correctly deductible under clause 6, but this aspect of the case is not material to this discussion.) The court ruled that in each case the expenditure was “for the purpose of, and as a condition of” each taxpayer’s respective employment. Substituted code for deductibility for salary and wage earners 72. The Court of Appeal considered the legislative framework and decided that section 105 and the Fourth Schedule of the 1976 Act was a substitute code of deductibility for section 104 of the 1976 Act, which applied when the taxpayer derived income from employment. 73. In Hunter Richardson J stated (at page 7,171): 6 It was noted in Haenga (NZTC p 5,207; NZLR p 128 \[TRNZ p 50\]) that the exclusion of expenditure made on private matters comes from the requirement of the first limb of s 104 (and s 105(2)(b)) which limits deductions to expenditure incurred in gaining assessable income, and the express inclusion in s 106(1)(j) may be regarded as having been inserted by way of precaution or emphasis. That links tests (1) and (3). 7 ... And where that test is met the expenses are properly characterised as work related expenses: they are of an employment not a private or domestic character and deductibility in terms of s 105(2)(b) and the Fourth Schedule cl 8 involves a finding that deduction is not barred under s 106(1)(j) (Belcher NZTC p 5,171 NZLR p 717 \[TRNZ p 120\]). 74. It can be taken from the above that the Court determined that when the necessary connection existed between the expenditure and the income-earning process the expenditure had the “necessary nexus” to the income-earning process, and so could not be classified as being of a private or domestic nature. The nexus test: purpose and condition of employment 75. The critical issue in all three cases was whether the expenditure came within the “purpose of, and a condition of, employment” test of clause 8 of the Fourth Schedule. If a sufficient nexus existed between the expenditure and condition of employment, and that expenditure was for the purpose of that employment, the expenditure was deductible. 76. In Haenga, the Court found that the expenditure had the necessary nexus to the income-earning process (the welfare society contributions were for the purpose, and a condition, of employment under the Fourth Schedule), so were not of a private or domestic nature. Richardson J said (at page 5,207): It is overly simplistic to brand these contributions to this welfare society as inherently of a private rather than an employment character. On the contrary, in the very unusual circumstances of this case I have come to the conclusion, not without hesitation, that the EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 21 required nexus exists between the expenditure in question and the gaining of the employment income. 77. In Belcher, Richardson J considered that the costs associated with the taxpayer’s overseas research had the necessary nexus to the derivation of income from the university. He said (at page 5,169): An expenditure does not exist in a vacuum. It is necessary to consider to what activity it relates. What is it for? If the taxpayer is performing a condition of employment, any expenditure appropriately incurred in doing so must I think be characterised as an expenditure incurred as a condition of employment. To put it another way, a condition that the employee do research necessarily extends to outlays required for that research. The first step is to determine whether the subject matter of the expenditure is a condition of the employment and, if so, the second is to determine whether there is a sufficient relationship between the expenditure and the income earning activity in respect of which it is incurred to warrant the conclusion that it was incurred as a condition of employment. 78. In Belcher, Richardson J noted that the adherence to CIR v VH Farnsworth Ltd (1984) 6 NZTC 61,770 precluded the Commissioner from raising the private and domestic argument as a new point having not been relied upon previously to support the assessment. He nonetheless stated (at page 5,171), consistent with Haenga: In any event there is no substance in the new point. As earlier noted the Authority held that all the expenditure was incurred by the taxpayer in gaining or producing her assessable income from the university within s 105(2)(b). That finding has not been challenged. And the finding under cl 6 is that the travel costs were incurred in the course of the taxpayer’s employment and under cl 8 it is that other research expenses were incurred as a condition of and for the purposes of the employment. On that analysis these were work related expenses. They were of an employment, not a private and domestic character. As in (Haenga) the finding of deductibility under those provisions involves a finding that deduction is not debarred under s 106(1)(j). Richardson J concluded that, in this case, the costs met the requirements of clause 8. 79. Similarly, in Hunter the Court concluded that the necessary nexus existed between the expenditure and derivation of the taxpayer’s employment income. Private and domestic argument 80. The Commissioner’s main argument in each case was that the expenditure (the welfare society fees, cost of overseas travel and accommodation, and costs of moving home) was all of a private or domestic nature. However, the Court considered that if the necessary nexus existed and that expenditure was for the purpose, and a condition, of employment, then the expenditure could not be of a private or domestic nature (that is, section 106(1)(j) would not apply if the purpose/condition test was satisfied). 81. In Haenga Richardson J concluded his judgment, by saying (at page 5,207): Mr Jenkins \[for the Commissioner\] argued in the alternative that the outgoings in this case were of a private or domestic nature and therefore were not deductible under sec 106(1)(j). In some cases sec 105(2)(b) and section 106(1)(j) may raise different EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 22 considerations but as has been foreshadowed the approach which I have taken to deductibility under the earlier provision parallels the yardstick expressly directed under the latter and any personal satisfaction derived from membership of the welfare society and the availability of benefits is only an incidental effect of the expenditure. The finding of deductibility under sec 105(2)(b) involves a finding that deduction is not barred under sec 106(1)(j). \[Emphasis added.\] 82. This theme was continued in Hunter, where his Honour said (at page 7,171): It was noted in Haenga ... that the exclusion of expenditure made on private matters comes from the requirement of the first limb of s 104 (and s 105(2)(b) which limits deductions to expenditure incurred in gaining assessable income, and the express inclusion in s 106(1)(j) may be regarded as having been inserted by way of precaution or emphasis. 83. That the taxpayer in Hunter was a “special case” in comparison with most other taxpayers, because of the special conditions of his employment, was noted by Casey J when he commented (at page 7,175): For these reasons the appellant was in a situation which was essentially different from that facing the generality of employees undertaking a transfer in the course of their work. They can normally make their own choice about the timing of their family move (if they decide the family should shift) and the type of accommodation. Here, these matters are prescribed and are so closely tied to the new appointment that I am satisfied that the appellant’s expenditure in complying must be regarded as other than of a private and domestic nature, even though it is also associated with the continued existence of his domestic establishment. Having reached this conclusion, for the same reasons I have no difficulty in finding that the expenses were incurred for the purpose of and as a condition of employment, and were deductible under s 104. 84. As a point of difference, in Belcher, reference was made to an earlier High Court case (C of IR v Mathieson (1984) 6 NZTC 61,838) which had very similar facts to Belcher. In Mathieson the taxpayer was also a university lecturer who travelled to England to undertake research while employed by the university. Similarly, the taxpayer claimed accommodation costs over and above the reimbursement from the University, but the High Court agreed with the Commissioner’s decision to disallow the claim. The distinguishing feature between these two cases was that in Mathieson the High Court judge determined that the research in England was not a “condition of his employment” – the taxpayer could have done the research anywhere – it was his personal choice to do the research in England. This being the case, the cost of accommodation did not meet the requirements of clause 8 of the Fourth Schedule, and the expenditure was of a private or domestic nature. 85. In Belcher the Court concluded (at page 5,171 per Richardson J) that: On that analysis these were work related expenses. They were of an employment, not a private and domestic character. As in \[Haenga\] the finding of deductibility under those provisions involves a finding that deduction is not debarred under s 106(1)(j). This illustrates the point that when an expense has the necessary nexus to the derivation of the employee’s income from employment, it is not of a private or domestic nature. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 23 Current legislation 86. With the repeal of section 105 and the Fourth Schedule of the 1976 Act, the clause 8 requirement that the expenditure had to be for the purpose, and condition, of employment is no longer part of the legislative wording. However, as noted earlier, these Court of Appeal cases dealt with the deductibility of employment related expenditure which, under the 2004 Act, is now the test for deciding exemption under section CW 13 for these types of payments and allowances. Despite the legislative change, the cases are still useful in providing guidance for determining whether or not expenditure is of a private or domestic nature as that aspect was a critical factor which the Courts had to decide in each case. 87. The current legislation in relation to the exemption of such allowances and reimbursing payments is as follows: • Section CW 13 exempts amounts paid by an employer in connection with that employee’s employment or service when the expenditure: – was a payment of expenditure on account of the employee; and/or – reimbursed the employee for that expenditure; and – in either case (if it were not for the employment limitation) would be an allowable deduction to the employee. • The employment limitation prohibits a taxpayer earning “income from employment” from claiming as a deduction any expenditure incurred in deriving that income. However, the operation of section CW 13 ignores the employment limitation in considering the exemption of allowances and reimbursing payments. • Without the employment limitation, therefore, a taxpayer earning “income from employment” would have to rely on the general deductibility provisions of the 2004 Act for a deduction. • The general deductibility provision in the 2004 Act is section DA 1. This section permits a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent that it is incurred by the taxpayer in deriving the taxpayer’s assessable income. • However, this section is subject to a number of limitations in section DA 2 including the private limitation that excludes from deductibility any expenditure to the extent it is “of a private or domestic nature”. Interpretation of section CW 13 EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 24 88. A requirement that must be satisfied before an employee allowance or payment can be exempt income under section CW 13 is that the expenditure incurred by the employee must be an allowable deduction to the employee but for the employment limitation. 89. In considering the application of the deductibility provisions that would apply to employee expenditure that may be seen as serving both private purposes and income earning, the applicable provisions are sections DA 1 and DA 2(2). 90. In the three cases (Haenga, Belcher, and Hunter), the Court of Appeal determined that if the expenditure was for the purpose, and a condition, of the income-earning process, the “sufficient nexus” test was met. This meant the expenditure was tax deductible and not of a private or domestic nature. Therefore, the same interpretation can apply equally to the current legislation because it involves such a nexus test and also requires determining whether expenditure is of a private or domestic nature. 91. To be deductible under section DA 1(1)(a) the expenditure, or the advantage sought by it, must be linked to the actual income-earning operations or activities. It is a matter of degree and so a question of fact to determine whether there is sufficient nexus. 92. The first step is to ascertain whether the expenditure has the required type of relationship to the operations and activities that constitute the income-earning process; that is, what did the employee do to earn income from employment? 93. The Commissioner considers that the case law discussed above gives useful guidance as to the circumstances in which expenditure should be considered to be deductible against employment-related income under section DA 1(1)(a) (if it were not for the private limitation). It follows that, if such expenditure meets these requirements, then that expenditure (if reimbursed by an employer), could qualify as exempt under section CW 13. 94. The essence of the Court of Appeal decisions can be encapsulated as being that a deduction will be permitted where the expenditure is in discharge of an obligation directly or indirectly imposed by the contract of service and, objectively, the obligation serves the purposes of the income-earning process. When these tests are met, deductibility extends to expenditure that is necessary as a practical requirement of the discharge of the obligation. 95. Consequently, the Commissioner has formulated the following three questions that, it is considered, will assist in determining the exemption of allowances and payments under the current legislation. 96. The questions are: (i) Was the employee performing an obligation under the contract of service at the time the expenditure was incurred? EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 25 (ii) Did the obligation serve the purpose of the income-earning process of deriving income from employment? (iii) Was the expenditure incurred by the employee necessary as a practical requirement of the performance of the obligation? If all three questions are answered in the affirmative, it is the Commissioner’s view that the section CW 13 exemption would apply provided the expenditure for which the reimbursement is made is not of a capital nature (this capital exclusion is discussed later in the Interpretation Guideline). 97. As noted earlier, the courts did not expressly formulate these questions in relation to the legislation under which the three cases were decided. However, the cases are the most recent leading decisions in the area of the tax deductibility of employment-related expenditure and from them the Commissioner has formulated this set of questions that he considers compatible with the current legislation. Practical application of section CW 13(2) 98. To illustrate the application of the three questions formulated above, they are applied to the following situation. Motor vehicle mileage allowance paid to a travelling salesperson 99. A salesperson uses her own vehicle for travelling from town to town in the course of her employment. Her employer pays her a motor vehicle mileage allowance based on IRD approved mileage rates and a reasonable estimate of the average distance travelled each week on business as agreed between the parties. The result of applying the three questions to the salesperson’s example is as follows. Question 1: Was the employee performing an obligation under the contract of service at the time the expenditure was incurred? 100. Yes. In this case the obligation is to perform the travelling sales’ duties in terms of the employment contract. Question 2: Did the obligation serve the purpose of the income-earning process of deriving income from employment? 101. Yes. In undertaking the travelling sales’ duties the salesperson receives salary or wages, so the work is part of the income-earning process. Question 3: Was the expenditure incurred by the employee necessary as a practical requirement of the performance of the obligation? EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 26 102. Yes. To undertake the duties of a salesperson, a motor vehicle is required and is not supplied by the employer. Costs associated with using the vehicle for business use (and for which the allowance is paid) flows from that need. The use of the motor vehicle is necessary as a practical requirement of the salesperson’s occupation. Conclusion 103. Having answered all three questions in the affirmative, the motor vehicle mileage allowance would be exempt from tax under section CW 13 subject to the expenditure not being of a capital nature. It is clear from the case law that this type of allowance is exempt because the expenditure incurred by the employee is deductible (were it not for the employment limitation) as being expenditure incurred “in the course of employment” (that is, while doing the work). Therefore, it was incurred in producing the employee’s income. Allowances or Reimbursements that could be seen to be of a Private or Domestic Nature 104. There are other allowances or reimbursements paid to employees where it may be more difficult to apply the three questions because, at least initially, the allowances or reimbursements could be seen to be of a private or domestic nature. As noted earlier, this Interpretation Guideline now considers some of the more common types of allowance or reimbursement, namely payments in respect of meals, clothing, and home relocation. Meal allowances and reimbursements 105. Case law, both in New Zealand and overseas, generally supports the proposition the expenditure on meals is of a private or domestic nature, and so is not an expense necessarily incurred in deriving income. Meal costs are regarded as a normal part of living rather than as being necessary in the production of income. As far as employees are concerned, the courts have consistently rejected meal expenditure generally on the basis that such costs are not incurred “in the course of employment”. 106. In normal situations the employee is not deriving income while eating a meal. However, in some particular situations the courts have determined that a meal cost was deductible. In these situations there was found to be a direct nexus between the cost of the meal and the income-earning process. 107. The following examples consider scenarios relating to the payment of meal allowances or the reimbursement of meal costs. Example A: overtime meal allowance 1 - standard overtime. 1 For the purposes of the following discussion, “overtime meal allowance” includes any meal allowance paid during a period an employee is paid penal rates, night rates, or shift work rates. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 27 108. Employee A is a motor mechanic who is required as part of the terms of the employment contract (that is, it is not a choice) to work overtime until 8 pm on a particular day. The employee’s normal finishing time is 4.35 pm and the employee is paid at overtime rates for the period worked up to 8 pm. The employee works until 5 pm before taking a half-hour meal break. A $14 meal allowance is paid to the employee who may use it to purchase an evening meal. 109. In these situations it is generally not a requirement of the employer that the employee actually spend any of the allowance on a meal during the half-hour break. The employee could just as easily bring food from home to eat or delay the consumption of the evening meal until he or she returns home after the overtime. It is the employee’s personal choice. Question 1: Was the employee performing an obligation under the contract of service at the time the expenditure was incurred? 110. Yes. Employee A is doing the work that he is contracted to do (that is, repairing motors). The employee, in working during the overtime period, is carrying out an obligation under his employment contract. Question 2: Did the obligation serve the purpose of the income-earning process of deriving income from employment? 111. Yes. The overtime will have generated income that is assessable income. Therefore, working the overtime, as requested, served the purpose of the income-earning process. . Question 3: Was the expenditure incurred by the employee necessary as a practical requirement of the performance of the obligation? 112. No. The employer paid the employee an overtime meal allowance of $14, as provided for in the employment contract, for the purpose of purchasing the employee’s evening meal. This is because, generally, it is impractical for an employee to go home for the usual evening meal in the time provided. It is arguable that the employee would have had to have a meal whether he or she worked overtime or not. The expenditure on the meal would not be incurred “in the course of employment” in the sense that while having the meal the taxpayer would not be deriving income. Case law 113. In F v Commissioner of Taxes (1943) 3 MCD 277 (the only New Zealand case that specifically deals with a deduction for “overtime meals”) a waterside worker claimed the cost for meals taken when he was required to work overtime. 114. The meal was taken between the time the taxpayer ceased normal work hours and before overtime work commenced. The taxpayer’s ordinary hours of work EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 28 were 8 am to 5 pm. He was obliged to work overtime when called to do so. The taxpayer did not receive notice to work the overtime on any day until about 3.45 pm. Therefore, he was unable to notify his wife that he would not be home for his usual evening meal. This necessitated the purchase of a meal in town by the taxpayer. 115. The Magistrate disallowed the claim because he determined that the taxpayer was not engaged “in the course of employment” when he ate his evening meal. The court ruled that a taxpayer must prove that the expenditure was incurred in the course of something done in the course of his employment. The court held (at page 280) that “as a rule” you cannot “eat or sleep” in the course of performing duties. 116. The Magistrate also noted that a factor necessitating the purchase of the meal was the distance between the taxpayer’s home and his place of work. The Magistrate said (at page 279): I also find as a fact that the necessity to purchase the evening meal would not have arisen but for the location of the appellant’s home. The distance between his place of work and his residence precluded him from having his evening meal at home in the ordinary way. His travelling-time alone would have exceeded the time allowed for the meal. While this case is now dated, it was cited with approval in Taxation Review Authority (TRA) case (TRA Case A12 (1974) 1 NZTC 60,088). 117. In TRA Case A12 the taxpayer was a part-time polytechnic tutor who purchased meals between finishing his full time job as an accountant and commencing work at a polytechnic, because he did not have enough time in the intervening period to travel home for his usual evening meal. 118. The TRA disallowed the claim as the meals were not a necessary expenditure to enable him to earn income and constituted expenditure of a private nature. As the meals were consumed after the completion of one job but before the commencement of the other they were not incurred “in the course of” either of the two jobs. 119. In the United Kingdom case of Sanderson v Durbridge \[1955\] 3 All ER 154 the taxpayer was employed by a local authority. His duties included evening attendances at council committee meetings and he had to buy an evening meal at a restaurant between the time he finished his normal duties and the start of the evening meetings. 120. The court disallowed the claim for the cost of the meals as the taxpayer “could not be said to be engaged in the performance of his duties when he was having his dinner”. Wynn-Parry J said (at page160), “I can see no difference for myself in principle between the nature of the interval for lunch and the interval for tea or the interval for dinner”. 121. In TRA Case L38 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,234 an employee incurred costs for meals in between business meetings and on the way to the airport to fly to business destinations. The TRA disallowed the deductions on the basis that EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 29 they were of a private or domestic nature. Barber DJ commented (at page 1,237): I have explained in a number of other cases over the past year that, generally, expenditure for a person’s own meal is of a private rather than business character because, as human beings, we need food intake in order to live. I cannot be satisfied from the evidence of the objector that this item is business-related. 122. These cases clearly indicate that the courts and tribunals will not accept as an allowable deduction costs in respect of meals taken by salary and wage earners between the end of normal work hours and the commencement of overtime or between two jobs or, as in the circumstances of TRA Case L38, costs incurred by an employee on meals between business engagements and while in the course of travelling to business engagements. 123. It is implicit in these cases that, while the courts saw the distance the taxpayer lived away from work contributed to the need to purchase meals because there was insufficient time for the taxpayers to go home for their normal meals, that aspect did not alter the private nature of the expenditure. Conclusion 124. It is the Commissioner’s view that the overtime meal allowance paid in example A is not related to expenditure that is “necessary as a practical requirement” in undertaking the overtime work in the relevant sense. As noted by the courts the expenditure was not incurred in the course of deriving the income. Therefore, as question 3 cannot be answered in the affirmative, the overtime meal allowance will not be exempt from income tax under section CW 13(2). Example B: overtime meal allowance – non-standard overtime. 125. Employee B is a motor mechanic who is not required to work overtime by his employer. There is no mention of overtime in employee B’s employment contract. However, a customer of the employer needs work on a motor car completed urgently. The employer asks employee B to stay behind after normal hours to do the job. The employer agrees that during the overtime period the employee may take a meal break and will be paid a meal allowance to purchase the meal in town. 126. The three questions applied to employee A apply equally to employee B. The employee is doing the work required under the employment contract. In doing that work the employee is receiving salary or wages that form part of his income. However, the eating of the meal during the work break is again not “necessary as a practical requirement” to the work employee B is doing in deriving the income from working the overtime. Conclusion 127. The cost of the meal reimbursed by the employer to employee B will not be exempt from tax in the hands of the employee. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 30 Example C: meals while entertaining business clients 128. Employee C is a salaried sales representative for an engineer consultancy company. During a visit by clients from another city she is asked by her employer to entertain the clients at a nearby restaurant with drinks and food before the clients catch a flight back to their home city. Employee C paid the restaurant account with her credit card and the following morning submitted an expense claim to the employer (as earlier agreed by the employer) who subsequently reimbursed Employee C for the total amount of the restaurant account. Question 1: Was the employee performing an obligation under the contract of service at the time the expenditure was incurred? 129. Employee C was carrying out the duties of a sales representative as required by her employer. It is not necessary that an employment contract specifically states every duty or task an employee may be required to perform. When an employer and employee agree that additional duties will be carried out, and those duties serve the purposes of deriving assessable income, then this requirement will be met. Question 2: Did the performance of the obligation serve the purpose of the income-earning process of deriving income from employment? 130. By performing the duties of a sales representative, which includes when required entertaining the employer’s clients, employee C derived income subject to income tax. Question 3: Was the expenditure incurred by the employee necessary as a practical requirement of the performance of the obligation? 131. Employee C was eating a meal while, and as part of, performing her employment duties as directed by her employer. The Commissioner considers that the cost associated with the entertainment of the business’s clients, in this case, is necessary as a practical requirement relating to the derivation of the employee’s income. The meal was not part of the ordinary living expenses of a private individual. \[Note the above example deals specifically with the application of section CW 13(2). It does not consider any limitation under the entertainment expenditure regime in subpart DD which may limit the exemption to the employee to 50% of the amount reimbursed.\] Case law 132. In TRA Case L38 some of the claims related to discussions with business colleagues or entertaining business clients. Judge Barber allowed such claims on the basis that they were “business related”, so the reimbursement payments EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 31 for the cost of these meals were exempt in the hands of the employee taxpayer. Conclusion 133. It is Commissioner’s view that the expenditure on meals while entertaining business clients (as incurred in example C) would be deductible to the employee if it were not for the employment limitation. Therefore, the reimbursement by the employer to the employee would be exempt from tax under section CW 13. Example D: meals taken in association with accommodation while absent from home 134. Employee D is required by his employer to attend a two-day annual industry conference in a city other than the employee’s home town. The employee is required to travel to the conference the day before the conference starts, because the conference starts early on its first day. The employee books into a hotel for two nights and has all his meals over the ensuing two days at the hotel. He pays the hotel invoice on checking out. The employer reimburses the employee for the total cost of the hotel on the employee’s return to work. Question 1: Was the employee performing an obligation under the contract of service at the time the expenditure was incurred? 135. Employee D was carrying out the duties as required by the employer, which included attending the conference. Question 2: Did the performance of the obligation serve the purpose of the income-earning process of deriving income from employment? 136. By attending the conference the employee was undertaking the obligation and duties for which he derived his income from employment. Question 3: Was the expenditure incurred by the employee necessary as a practical requirement of the performance of the obligation? 137. The Commissioner considers the hotel costs in this case were necessary as a practical requirement in deriving the income from employment. The expenditure was incurred during the course of the employee’s employment, which extends from the time he departed the town in which he worked and resided until his return to the town after the conference. Case law 138. In Watkis (HMIT) v Ashford Sparkes & Harward \[1985\] 2 All ER 916 the Court considered a variety of meal situations. This case concerned the meal and accommodation costs of partners in a firm of solicitors. The claim related to three categories of expenditure: EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 32 (a) Refreshments for the partners at the lunchtime local office meetings, at weekly or fortnightly intervals, attended by the partners who operated at the offices concerned. (b) Meals at “plenary evening meetings” of which there were six in 1979, attended by all the partners. (c) The firm’s annual conference which was held at the Marine Hotel on Saturday and Sunday, and which was attended by partners together with their families. The expenditure in items (a) and (b) were disallowed. The Court noted (at page 927) that “lunchtime and evening meals were provided at times that the partners would have normally eaten lunch or dinner anyway ... The taxpayers need food or drink irrespective of whether they are engaged on a business activity”. 139. The meals and accommodation for the partners at the annual conference held at a hotel were determined to be allowable as income tax deductions. In relation to the conference the Court said (at page 933): I do not think that the cost of accommodation can necessarily be said to have been expenditure which meets the needs of the taxpayers as human beings. They did not need it for that purpose because they had their own homes where they could have spent the night. The reason why they needed it was so they could continue their discussions of the particularly important topics informally between the formal sessions on the Saturday afternoon and the Sunday morning. If they had to break up and go home after dinner on the Saturday evening and come back on the Sunday morning, that continuity, which was of considerable importance and value, would have been broken or at least seriously damaged ... In my view there is no distinction between the cost of overnight accommodation on the one hand and food and drink on the other. Notwithstanding that this case involved partners in a firm rather than employees, it is relevant to note the distinction the Court drew between the conference related meals and accommodation, and the meals taken by the partners at lunch time, local office meetings and plenary evening meetings. 140. It is clear that the Court saw the meals at the lunch time and evening meetings as being a replacement for the meals the partners would have to take in any event, being meals “to meet the needs of the taxpayers as human beings”. At the annual conference, when the partners were staying away from home, the meals were linked to, and were part of, the cost of the accommodation. In this respect, the decision to allow the claim is consistent with the substantial majority of decisions by the courts that have permitted deductions for meals taken as part of accommodation while the taxpayer is away from home overnight. Extra costs of meals 141. The extra cost of a taxpayer’s meals was considered in Caillebotte (HMIT) v Quinn (1971–1977) 50 TC 222. The taxpayer in this case was a EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 33 subcontracting carpenter who worked at various sites within a 40-mile radius of his home. The taxpayer maintained he could not go home for lunch when working at these sites and claimed a deduction against income for the extra cost of the meals taken away from home against the estimated cost of meals that he would have incurred if he had had the meal at home. The court disallowed the claim on the basis that no part of the cost of the lunches was exclusively expended for the purposes of the taxpayer’s business. 142. On the question of apportionment of meal costs (the difference between what the taxpayer spent on lunches away from home and what he would have spent had he been able to eat at home) the Court said (at page 227): This attempt to apportion discloses the duality of purposes that is fatal under sec. 130. It is not possible to divide up a meal or the expenses of a meal so that the first sandwiches or the first 10p. are attributable to Mr Quinn and the residue to his business. Nor do I accept the logic of the suggested method of apportionment. No one has a divine right to work and eat at home, or to eat at his place of business, or to measure the cost of his appetite by the cheapest method which would have been available to him if he had chosen to conduct his business in some other fashion than that which he in fact chooses. When discussing the apportionment of such costs as travel and the cost of the use of a room for business purposes, Templeman J noted (at page 227): But it is not possible to apportion a meal. Thus in Bentleys, Stokes & Lowless v Beeson (1952) 33 TC 491 all the costs incurred by solicitors in entertaining clients were allowed when it was shown that the only purpose of the entertainment was to promote the business of the solicitors. 143. Therefore, it is not possible to deduct for tax purposes the additional costs of meals when compared with the cost of a meal taken at home. Where the meal costs have been correctly determined as being deductible, the taxpayer can claim the full cost of the meal without any adjustment for the notional cost of a meal taken at home. Conclusion 144. The general weight of the authorities on the deductibility of meal costs leads the Commissioner to the conclusion that, in general, meal costs will be of a private or domestic nature. Only when the meal is taken as part of some business activity such as entertaining clients or business associates or in association with accommodation while the taxpayer is absent from home on business, will the Commissioner agree to allowances or reimbursements being exempt from income tax under section CW 13. 145. In summary, the Commissioner considers that the following reimbursements of meal costs, where the employee pays the cost of the meal, will only qualify for exemption under section CW 13 where: • Meals are taken as part of business or work meetings. • Meals are taken as part of the entertainment of business clients. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 34 • Meals are taken by the employee when absent from his or her normal home for attending a business conference or meeting where that absence necessitates the employee being absent from home overnight. Longer term absences from home 146. Sometimes an employee will be absent from his or her home (and usual workplace) for extended periods, such as when on secondment to another branch of the employer’s company. In these situations the employee may receive allowances or reimbursing payments to cover the additional costs he or she incurs when living away from home. 147. It is clear that such allowances or reimbursements form part of the employee’s income. The definition of “salary and wages” in section OB 1 includes the market value of the benefit of employer-provided “board or lodging, or the use of house or quarters”. 148. This raises the issue of whether these allowances or reimbursements should also be exempt from tax on the basis of the legal authorities on meals and accommodation in the context of short-term absences from home. 149. As already noted, the costs of everyday living, food, and shelter are of a private and domestic nature, so not deductible for income tax purposes. However, the courts have made it clear that costs associated with accommodation and meals when the employee is absent from home, on work, for relatively short periods can qualify as being tax deductible. 150. When the absence from home is longer (for example, when an employee is on a long-term secondment), do the same rules apply to exempt any payments made to the employee to meet additional costs? It is the Commissioner’s view that in the extended absence situation (for example, a long-term secondment) the issue can be answered according to whether the employee has shifted his or her home base. “Home base” in the context of this discussion is the place where, for the time being, the employee has established a new home and from where the employee travels to and from to the new workplace. If the employee has shifted his or her home base, the costs of food and accommodation incurred by the employee will form part of the employee’s income under the definition of salary and wages and will not be exempt from tax. 151. Whether an employee has changed his or her home base (in relation to the new workplace) will determine if the associated costs are considered to be necessary as a practical requirement to the performance of the employee’s obligations under the employment contract, or should instead be regarded as private or domestic expenditure. 152. Each case needs to be considered on its facts, but the following factors may be relevant in determining whether the employee has established a new home base from where they attend (on a daily basis) the new workplace: EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 35 • The length of time the employee is absent from the employee’s usual workplace. • Whether the employee has moved his or her family to the new work location. • Whether the employee has severed ties with his or her former home base (that is, whether the home has been sold or let during the secondment). 153. The Commissioner considers this approach is consistent with the tenor of several court decisions (discussed above) and with the view expressed in TRA Case M128 (1990) 12 NCTC 2,825. In that case the TRA rejected a taxpayer’s claim for the costs of rent and food while living away from his normal home for work purposes. Barber DJ said (at page 2,837): However, the rental and associated expenses which the objector incurred, do not have a sufficient connection with his employment process to achieve deductibility. The employer merely required that he perform his job in the cities in question. Such aspects as to where he lived, or where his family lived, were quite unrelated to the operation of the employment work. I am in no doubt that all these expenses were of a private or domestic nature. To use the words of Richardson J in Haenga p 5,207 ... they were of a private nature because they are “exclusively referable to living as an individual member of society” and domestic expenses are “those relating to the household or family unit”. 154. The following examples set out how the Commissioner would approach various situations in this context. It should be noted that the conclusions reached are only indicative of the Commissioner’s view. As noted earlier each case will need to be considered on its own facts. Example E: temporary transfer Situation 155. A married employee is temporarily transferred to another branch of his employer for 2 months. His family stays in its present location in the family home. Comment 156. Because of the employee’s relatively short time absent from home, it is more than likely that the employee has not moved home. His home base remains at the location where his family lives. Taxation consequences 157. Allowances or reimbursements of a reasonable amount paid to the employee in respect of accommodation and food in respect of the employee’s stay in the away location will not be subject to tax. Example F: long-term secondment EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 36 Situation 158. An employee is seconded to a new location with the same employer for 2 years. Her family moves to the new location with her and has temporarily rented out the family home. Her employer pays her an allowance so the employee and her family can rent a house at the new location where they live for the secondment’s duration. Comment 159. Because of the length of the secondment, it is likely that the employee has re- established her home base to the new location from where she travels each day to the new work site. Taxation consequences 160. The allowance the employee receives from her employer will be subject to tax. Example G: change of home base Situation 161. An employee is a single person who usually lives at home with her parents. The employee is seconded with the same employer to another city for 4 months and accommodated in a motel unit, the cost of which is recompensed by the employer. Comment 162. The employee has most likely re-established her home base to the new location for the secondment’s duration. Taxation consequences 163. The amount the employer pays to the employee for the motel accommodation, together with any allowances in respect of food and incidentals will be assessable income to the employee (and not exempt from tax). 164. As intimated in the above examples, the question of assessability or exemption of allowances or reimbursements made in these circumstances will need to be considered on their own facts. The above examples are intended to give some guidance in this area. Clothing expenditure 165. Expenditure on clothing is another area where it may need to be determined whether an allowance paid to an employee is exempt from tax under section CW 13. Expenditure incurred in the purchase, maintenance, or repair of clothing is generally not deductible as the expenditure is normally considered to be of a private nature. However, clothing expenditure may be allowed in certain circumstances. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 37 166. Broadly, allowable clothing expenditure, in the context of this Interpretation Guideline, can be separated into three types that the courts have considered for deductibility purposes: • expenditure on protective clothing or footwear; • expenditure on a uniform or special clothing in the nature of a uniform; and • abnormal expenditure on conventional clothing. 167. The deductibility of the first two types of clothing expenditure is reasonably well recognized by the courts as being employment related, so these types are not considered in any detail. Protective clothing 168. Generally, clothing or footwear that is purchased for protective reasons and worn (generally) over or in addition to conventional clothing has been regarded as deductible for income tax purposes (in the absence of the employment limitation), and so any allowance paid to an employee to cover the cost of such protective clothing items will qualify for exemption in terms of section CW 13. Uniform or special clothing in the nature of a uniform 169. Similarly, the purchase and maintenance of a uniform, or special clothing in the nature of a uniform, has been accepted as prima facie deductible for tax purposes. However, the courts have generally rejected claims for conventional items of clothing (such as ordinary white shirts, socks and shoes) worn in conjunction with a uniform. 170. In the Australian case Case 54 (1957) 7 CTBR (NS) 419 involving an Australian naval officer, the taxpayer was allowed a deduction for expenditure on his tropical wear uniform of shorts, shirts, white shoes, etc., but not on the white shirts, black shoes, socks, etc., that comprised his non-tropical uniform. These items were no different from normal menswear. 171. In Case C30 (1978) 3 NZTC 60,283 a policeman had to purchase black lace- up shoes of a style suitable for wearing with his uniform. It was held that even though the shoes formed part of the uniform, they were conventional in that they could be worn with civilian clothing. Abnormal expenditure on conventional clothing 172. The courts have also on occasions allowed deductions for conventional clothing when the taxpayer has incurred abnormal expenditure on conventional clothing, because of the taxpayer’s occupation. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 38 173. The “abnormal expenditure on conventional clothing” test has been considered under two distinct headings: • “abnormal wear and tear on clothing”; and • a need for a “greater quantity” of clothing. Case law 174. The “abnormal wear and tear on clothing” situation occurred in Beckett v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,078. In this case a plain-clothes police officer, working on the waterfront, was allowed a deduction for additional suits and dry cleaning because of the particular dirty and hazardous conditions under which he was employed. 175. Additional clothing costs, because of a need for a “greater quantity” of clothing, were allowed in Case 31/93 93 ATC 359. In that case the personal assistant to the wife of a high-ranking government official was permitted a deduction for the increased cost of her conventional clothing, because she needed clothing to complement that worn by her employer to official functions. 176. The above is consistent with the general weight of case law on clothing costs. For example, in Hillyer v Leeke (HM Inspector of Taxes) (1973-1978) 51 TC 90 the court found against the taxpayer who was required by his employer to wear a suit when visiting the employer’s clients. The Court determined that the cost of a suit or suits was not “ wholly and exclusively laid out for the purpose of trade, profession or vocation” (the wording of the United Kingdom legislation). 177. In New Zealand, Barber DJ set out the tests for determining deductibility of conventional clothing expenditure in TRA Case F46 (1983) 6 NZTC 59,792. This case allowed a band member’s claim for the cost of clothing he purchased specifically to wear when performing with the band. The TRA noted that the clothing was conventional “female clothing” that the male band member wore only on stage. Barber DJ stated (at page 59,797): ... The expenditure in question must have the required statutory connection with the income earning activity and yet not be of a private nature — refer Case K2 78 ATC 13. Accordingly counsel for R submitted, whether those hurdles can be successfully negotiated by O depends upon whether his particular circumstances fall within either of the two recognised tests which have evolved from the Australian cases. In this latter respect counsel for R referred me to Case A45 69 ATC 270 which, as he so rightly said, is worth reading to refresh one’s memory on the law relative to this issue. The first test is the “necessary and peculiar” principle where expenditure is on clothing necessary and peculiar to an occupation. The second test is where the taxpayer, by virtue of his occupation, has been required to incur “abnormal expenditure on conventional clothing”. 178. In Case A45 (referred to above) the second test was described in more detail as: EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 39 a deduction may be allowable in respect of expenditure on clothing where in his occupation a taxpayer is under a recognised obligation to provide himself with a wardrobe of conventional clothing which is quantitatively in excess of what might be regarded as normal everyday requirements, or where the exigencies of the particular occupation require replacement of conventional clothing more frequently than would be regarded as normal. This test may be shortly described as “the abnormal expenditure on conventional clothing” test. \[Emphasis added.\] Example H: Clothing costs 179. A taxpayer is employed as a policy analyst by a government department. Part of his duties requires him to meet with the relevant Minister of the Crown to discuss policy issues. A requirement of his employment conditions is that he must wear a suit to work, and when meeting with the Minister. Question 1: Was the employee performing an obligation under the employment contract at the time the expenditure was incurred? 180. Employee H was employed as a policy analyst in accordance with the employment contract. Question 2: Did the performance of the obligation serve the purpose of the income-earning process of deriving income from employment? 181. The employee derived income from performing his duties as a policy analyst with the government department. Question 3: Was the expenditure incurred by the employee necessary as a practical requirement to the performance of the obligation? 182. Employee H’s duties required him to undertake policy work under the employment contract. He was paid to do that work and the requirement to wear a suit (conventional clothing) does not affect his ability to do that work. The cost associated with wearing a suit to work is not necessary as a practical requirement in deriving assessable income as the employment need does not go beyond reasonable normal work clothing requirements. Therefore, any allowance or amount paid by the employer to the employee in respect of these conventional clothing costs would not be exempt under section CW 13. 183. It is clear that the employee in example H has not incurred expenditure “quantitatively in excess” of what is generally accepted as being the normal attire for a person working in the same or similar occupations. There is unlikely to be any excessive wear and tear on the employee’s clothing as in Beckett. The employee in example H would not be entitled to an exemption in respect of any allowance paid by the employer in respect of the clothing requirements. Conclusion EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 40 184. Based on the above analysis, the Commissioner considers that the following allowances or reimbursements of clothing costs, where the employee pays for the cost of the clothing, will only qualify for exemption under section CW 13 where: • the expenditure is in respect of protective clothing or footwear; or • the expenditure is in respect of a uniform or special clothing in the nature of a uniform; or • the employee incurs abnormal expenditure on conventional clothing due to excessive wear and tear or the need for a greater quantity of conventional clothing. Employee relocation reimbursements 185. Relocation can involve the transfer of existing employees within an organisation and the relocation of a new employee to be near the new work site. Existing employee relocation takes place for several reasons, varying from the employer’s operational requirements to the employee’s personal preferences. Typically, the employer reimburses the employee for the costs of selling and buying the family home and moving to the new location. Individual costs incurred in these moves may include real estate agents’ commissions in selling an employee’s home and purchasing a new home, solicitors’ fees associated with the selling and the buying of the homes, the costs of moving the family furniture and effects, the costs of travel by the taxpayer and family to the new location, and (in some cases) the cost of temporary accommodation in the new location while the family is waiting to move into their new home. This raises the question as to whether such expenditure or employer reimbursements are exempt from tax under section CW 13 as, essentially, this type of expenditure or reimbursements could be seen to be of a private or domestic nature. It also raises the question as to whether such expenditure could be seen to be of a capital nature. This is discussed later in this Interpretation Guideline. Case law 186. Two cases decided by the TRA considered the deductibility of costs associated with employees taking up employment at a new location and both were decided in favour of the Commissioner, who sought to disallow the costs claimed as deductions. 187. TRA Case E49 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,289 concerned an employee of a local body in one city (DN), resigning from that position to take up a job with another local body in another city (HL). In his 1980 income tax return the taxpayer relied on clause 8 of the Fourth Schedule of the 1976 Act to claim a deduction for the legal costs and estate agent’s commission paid in relation to selling the former home and buying a new home near the new work location. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 41 188. While this case focused on whether the requirement of the employee to move residences was a “condition” of his new employment as required by clause 8, Barber DJ did determine, that in terms of section 104, he could not find “sufficient nexus in this case between the expenditure and income”. The judge cited Richardson J in CIR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236 at page 59,292: \[that to qualify for a deduction the taxpayer must show that the expenditure was\] incurred in gaining or producing \[assessable income\] ... There must be the statutory nexus between the particular expenditure and the assessable income of the taxpayer claiming the deduction. His Honour concluded (at page 59,292): I find that O’s expenditure ... was not incurred in gaining or producing assessable income for any income year. It was private or domestic expenditure in terms of sec. 106(1)(j) to enable O to live in an area from which he could readily travel to his place of work on a day-to-day basis. My overall rationale then is that while the costs on the DN sale and the HL purchase may have been “expenditure ... for the purposes of ... employment” they were not a “condition” of employment; there is no sufficient nexus between the expenditure and the gaining of income; and in any case the expenditure is of a “private and domestic nature” under sec. 106(1)(j). 189. TRA Case F99 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,045 also concerned a claim for transfer expenses by an employee resigning a position in Wellington and taking up a new job with a new employer in Auckland. Barber DJ concluded that the taxpayer’s expenditure was not incurred in gaining or producing assessable income. The expenditure was made for the purpose of getting to work rather than in the course of employment, so was not deductible. A point in this case was that the taxpayer did not sell his Wellington home and buy another in Auckland until some time after he had taken up employment in Auckland. This supports the contention that the timing of the move is not critical in these cases. It is whether the expenditure is incurred in the course of the employment that is relevant when considering the deductibility of an employee’s transferring expenses. 190. Expenditure incurred before the commencement of the income-earning process is not incurred “in the course of employment”. A further point (see TRA Case E49) is that the expenditure is of a private or domestic nature, so is debarred from deduction against income from employment (if it were not for the employment limitation). 191. In examples I, J, and K, below, the three questions developed earlier in this Interpretation Guideline are applied to three home relocation situations. Example I: home relocation – new employer 192. Employee I is an office manager who takes up employment with a new employer. The employee moves home to the new work location and incurs expenditure in relocating the home to the new work location. The new employer offers to reimburse the new employee for actual (or estimated) costs associated with the relocation. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 42 193. When the employee taxpayer finds employment with a new employer in a locality different from that in which he or she lives, and the taking up of that employment requires the employee to move residences, will the costs of an employee moving to a new employment in a new location have the necessary nexus to the gaining of income from employment? In order to answer this it is necessary to consider the three questions formulated in this Interpretation Guideline. Question 1: Was the employee performing an obligation under the contract of service at the time the expenditure was incurred? 194. The obligations to be performed by the employee, under the new employment contract, consist of the work the employee is employed to do in relation to the new job. These are the obligations that relate to the employee’s income- earning process. That is, the actual work the employee does to earn his or her income from salary and wages. The employee will not be performing these obligations (in this example, management duties), until the day he or she shows up at work at the new location and commences earning income. Therefore, any actions (for example, shifting home and any expenditure incurred in relation to those actions) taken by the employee before starting work are in relation to getting to work rather than performing the obligations related to the new job. Conclusion 195. Having concluded that the first of the three questions has not been answered in the affirmative, it is not necessary to enquire further. For the second and third questions to apply, the first question must be answered affirmatively. Therefore, the reimbursements or amounts made to the employee will not be exempt from tax under section CW 13. Example J: home relocation - under the terms of the employee’s contract 196. Employee J’s employment contract requires employee J to transfer at the employer’s request at any time. Employee J is posted to another location in the same job (that is, as an office manager) and relocates her home to the new work location. The employee is doing the same job before and after the transfer. The employer offers to reimburse employee J for actual (or estimated) costs associated with the transfer. Question 1: Was the employee performing an obligation under the contract of service at the time the expenditure was incurred? 197. Employee J was, under the employment contract, performing management duties at the new location when and where directed. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 43 Question 2: Did the obligation serve the purposes of the income-earning process of deriving income from employment? 198. The requirement to move locations on the employer’s direction directly related to the continuation of an income stream – the derivation of salary and wages for employee J – the transfer served the purpose of the income-earning process. Question 3: Was the expenditure incurred by the employee necessary as a practical requirement of the performance of the obligation? 199. On the basis that it is a contractual requirement under the employment contract to undertake management work where directed, and the performance of the obligation of the job requires the transfer, it seems more likely that the costs of transfer will have the necessary nexus to the employee’s income- producing process. It is considered that this result is consistent with the decision in Belcher where the employee was required to carry out certain research that could be done only in the United Kingdom. In this example it was necessary for the employee as a practical requirement (to incur the relocation costs) in the performance of the obligations under the employment contract to move to the new location when directed. Conclusion 200. In this situation it is considered that affirmative answers can be given to all three questions to arrive at the conclusion that any reimbursements made to employee J to cover costs relevant to the relocation would be exempt from tax. This is subject, of course, to the expenditure for which the reimbursement is made not being of a capital nature. Whether any such expenditure is of a capital nature is discussed in more detail later. Example K: home relocation – for a new job with the same employer 201. Employee K applies for a new job at another branch of his existing employer’s organisation. Employee K will be covered by a new employment contract with his existing employer if he is successful in his application for the new job. The purpose of applying for the new job is to enhance the employee’s prospects within the employer’s organisation by putting the employee in a more favourable position for future promotion and ultimately higher income. Employee K is appointed to the new job. Employee K relocates his home to the new location. The employer offers to reimburse employee K for actual (or estimated) costs associated with the relocation. Question 1: Was the employee performing an obligation under the contract of service at the time the expenditure was incurred? 202. The obligations and duties performed by employee K, under both employment contracts with the same employer, consist of the work the employee is EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 44 employed to do in the jobs at the old and new locations. These are the obligations that relate to the employee’s income-earning process. The employee will not be performing these obligations in relation to the old job because the relationship with the old job has ended. In relation to the new job any actions (for example, relocating his home) taken by the employee before starting work at the new location are in relation to getting to work, rather than performing the obligations related to the employee’s new job. 203. Example K would appear to be analogous to the situation in Hunter where the Court of Appeal allowed a deduction for some of the costs associated with the transfer of a police officer. However, the Court noted that the situation in Hunter was essentially different from that facing the “generality of employees”. Casey J stated at page 7,175: In the ordinary course of human affairs the sale of one family home and the purchase of another, and the associated expenditure on solicitors and land agents, will generally be regarded as private or domestic transactions, whether or not they are motivated by employment considerations. But the cost of relocating a taxpayer's domestic establishment may call for separate analysis if, as contended here, it was incurred as a requirement of his employment and at his employer's direction. (I use the words “employment” and “employer” as aptly describing the relationship between the appellant and the Police Department.) The Authority found that he was required to transfer in the course of his duties as a police officer. The Department's memorandum advising of his appointment and promotion stated: 3. A Police residence, if available, will be allocated to the member by the District Commander, Wellington. 4. If there is no Police residence available at Wellington for the member's occupation he will be required to make immediate application for an allocation of a pool house or alternatively make his own accommodation arrangements. 5. The member's transfer and the removal of his household and effects are not to be actioned until he has arranged suitable accommodation at Wellington which is vacant and ready for his occupation. 6. The member is not to transfer ahead of his family without approval from this office. These requirements indicate a direct involvement by the Department in the appellant's housing arrangements, carried to the extent of a flat prohibition against his transfer until suitable vacant accommodation was available; nor was he to transfer ahead of his wife and family. In effect, before he could take up his new appointment, he was required virtually then and there to occupy an available police house or failing that, find one himself. The employer's concern about housing is reflected in its obligation under Departmental regulations to reimburse him up to the prescribed limit, the evident intention being that all his relocation costs would be met. Its reasons for that concern can be readily understood. It must be very much to the advantage of the police force to have its members on transfer in suitable accommodation with their families as quickly as possible. For these reasons the appellant was in a situation which was essentially different from that facing the generality of employees undertaking a transfer in the course of their work. They can normally make their own choice about the timing of their family move (if they decide the family should shift) and the type of accommodation. Here, these matters are prescribed and are so closely tied to the new appointment that I am satisfied the appellant's expenditure in complying must be regarded as other than of a private or domestic nature, even though it is also associated with the continued existence of his domestic establishment.\[Emphasis added\] EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 45 204. It is clear from the above that the Court of Appeal considered Hunter was a special case and relied heavily on the special conditions promulgated in the Police Department’s regulations relating to the transfer of police officers in deciding that the expenditure was deductible. The Court noted that ordinarily the sale and purchase of a family home is of a private and domestic nature. 205. In Shell New Zealand Ltd v CIR, the Court of Appeal concluded that lump sum payments made to employees to compensate them for capital loss on the sale of their properties and for mortgage interest assistance was taxable. In that case McKay J commented that “the simple reimbursement of removal expenses incurred by the employee ......on transfer” may require “different considerations” (implying that in some circumstances such costs would have been deductible to an employee). The Commissioner considers that this comment was obiter, and that drawing such an implication would be contrary to the general weight of authorities which suggests in these situations that relocation costs incurred by employees are of a private and domestic nature. 206. On the basis of the above, it is considered that as the first of the three questions has not been answered in the affirmative in respect of Example K, it is not necessary to consider the other two questions. The expenditure incurred by employee K would not qualify for exemption under section CW 13. Overall conclusion on relocation expenditure 207. The Commissioner considers that employer reimbursements of relocation costs will qualify for exemption under section CW 13 (subject to the capital limitation not applying) only when the relocation costs relate to a requirement in the employment contract that the employee transfers at the request of the employer at any time and the employee is relocated in the same job and moves home to the new location . Capital expenditure 208. Another exclusion from the general deductibility provision is the capital limitation provided for by section DA 2(1). This section denies a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent it is of a capital nature. Therefore, if a payment or allowance reimburses an employee for capital expenditure it cannot be exempt under section CW 13. 209. Of the three examples of reimbursements and allowances (meal, clothing and relocation) discussed in this Interpretation Guideline, employee relocation reimbursements or allowances are most likely to involve expenditure of a capital nature. Home relocation costs may be capital expenditure 210. Even when the necessary nexus exists between the expenditure incurred and the home relocation cost (such as in example J), when the transfer is with an existing employer there is still the question of whether the expenditure is of a EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 46 revenue or capital nature. It is now appropriate to consider whether some costs associated with the transferring of employees, especially the costs of selling an existing home and buying a new home, are of a capital nature. 211. The courts have applied several tests to assist in determining whether an expense is of a capital nature. The two that appear to be the most applicable for this discussion are: • the identifiable asset test; and • the enduring benefit test. 212. The above capital/revenue tests deal with the deductibility of business expenses by taxpayers involved in a business or trade. In the situation of reimbursements of relocation costs to employees, the employees are not business people or traders, so the cases dealing with the revenue/capital distinction do not fit neatly with the expenditure concerned. However, the cases do not exclude the type of expenditure under consideration. The capital/revenue tests are now considered in relation to transfer expenses of employees. Identifiable asset test: transfer expenses 213. Expenditure will meet the identifiable asset test (and be on capital account) when the asset or an advantage has been acquired by the expenditure incurred. The identifiable asset test was clearly enunciated in Tucker (Inspector of Taxes) v Granada Motorway Services Ltd \[1979\] 2 All ER where Lord Wilberforce said (at page 804): I think that the key to the present case is to be found in those cases which have sought to identify an asset. In them it seems reasonably logical to start with the assumption that money spent on the acquisition of the asset should be regarded as capital expenditure. 214. This case was cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in CIR v McKenzies New Zealand Limited (1988) 10 NZTC 5,233). Enduring benefit test: transfer expenses 215. With the enduring benefit test the focus is on whether the particular payment is not entirely “once and for all” but is made for an asset or advantage that gives rise to an enduring benefit to the business in the sense that a benefit endures in the way that a fixed asset endures (British Insulated and Helsby Cables Ltd v Atherton \[1925\] All ER Rep 623). As their Lordships stated, expenditure is generally capital in nature if it is made: ...not only once and for all, but with a view to bringing into existence an asset or advantage for the enduring benefit of trade. 216. This case was cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in Poverty Bay Electric Power Board v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,001. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 47 Employee transfer reimbursements – dwelling related expenses 217. Employee transfer reimbursements may include real estate commissions and solicitors’ fees. In such situations it is arguable that the home acquired on transfer is an “identifiable asset”. It is also arguable that the employee receives an enduring benefit from the purchase of the home in the sense that the employee has received a long-term benefit that enhances his or her career opportunities. These two aspects suggest that any expenditure associated with the sale and purchase of a house (real estate agents’ commissions and solicitors’ fees) must assume the same capital character as the underlying assets. Therefore the costs reimbursed to an employee for relocation are arguably of a capital nature. 218. In considering the exemption from tax in the hands of the employee (not the employer, who would generally be entitled to a deduction of the amounts reimbursed), the types of expenditure under consideration here (real estate agents’ commissions and solicitors’ fees) are of a capital nature. As such, this type of expenditure would not be deductible to the employee (if it were not for the employment limitation) because of the capital limitation under section DA 2(1). The expenditure, therefore, would not qualify for exemption in terms of section CW 13. 219. Other types of expenditure associated with transferring (such as transport costs and temporary accommodation), however, may qualify for exemption, provided there is the necessary nexus to the derivation of income. This is determined by applying the three requirements discussed above. Conclusion Capital Expenditure 220. The Commissioner considers that the conclusions reached above are supported by the case law cited, although some of the cases were considered under now repealed legislation. When a sufficient nexus exists between the relocation expenditure and the derivation of income (such as in example J) some of the costs that could be exempt from tax as having the necessary nexus to the derivation of income may be excluded from that exemption because they are of a capital nature. Exemption in respect of “expenditure on account of an employee”: section CW 13(1) 221. As mentioned earlier, section CE 1 (Amounts derived in connection with employment or service) includes the term “expenditure on account of an employee”. Section CW 13 provides exemption from income tax of certain payments that come within this term. Section CW 13(2), as discussed above, deals with the exemption of “amounts” paid to employees (i.e reimbursements). This covers payments to the employee made in money. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 48 222. A further exemption is provided by subsection (1), which covers situations where, rather than the employee being recompensed in money, the employer pays, on the employee’s behalf, expenditure that is legally the employee’s liability. 223. “Expenditure on account of an employee” is defined in section CE 5 as “a payment made by an employer relating to expenditure incurred by an employee”. Any payment coming within this definition (subject to the exclusions in section CE 5(3)) will be assessable income to the employee. However, section CE 5(3)(a) and (c) lists various exclusions from the definition. These are: (a) expenditure for the benefit of an employee, or a payment made to reimburse an employee under section CW 13 (b) .... (c) expenses that an employee pays in connection with their employment or service to the extent to which the expenditure is their employer’s liability, if the employee undertakes to discharge the liability in consideration of the making of the payment by the employer: 224. The definition, therefore, has two specific exclusions that are relevant to this discussion. Firstly, paragraph (a) of the definition excludes payments that would be exempt from tax in terms of section CW 13(2). Section CW 13(2), as already discussed, concerns the exemption of amounts paid (in money) that reimburse the employee for employment-related expenditure. 225. The second exclusion from the definition of “expenditure on account of an employee” is paragraph (c). This exclusion has been discussed earlier but, to reiterate, the exemption will apply when the expenditure meets the following requirements: • The expenditure has been paid by the employee. • The expenditure was paid by the employee “in connection with the employee’s employment or service” (there has to be a nexus to the derivation of the employee’s income). • “To the extent” to which the expenditure is the employer’s liability and not the employee’s (the liability must be that of the employer). • The undertaking by the employee to pay the employer’s liability was the reason for the reimbursement being made to the employee. Application of the exclusion in the definition of “expenditure on account of an employee”. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 49 226. The four requirements listed above are applied, as an illustration, to the reimbursement of solicitors’ fees and real estate agents’ commissions paid to relocating employees in the following scenario: • An employee incurs the cost of selling their home in the old location and buying in the new location and both fees and commission are taken into account in the final settlement statement which is paid for by the employee. The fees and commission are the employee’s liability. • The employee makes a employee expense claim for the fees and commissions and is reimbursed by the employer. 227. In this situation the liability is that of the employee, so the second exclusion in the definition of “expenditure on account of an employee” will not apply. The reimbursement is an amount derived in connection with employment (expenditure on account of an employee) and the employee will have to rely on section CW 13(2) to exclude the payment from assessable income. This, as already discussed, requires the taxpayer to meet the deductibility requirements of section DA 2 (especially the private and capital limitations). 228. Another important point is that when a payment meets the exclusion by way of section CE 5(3)(c) (“expenditure on account of an employee”) there is no need to determine whether that payment is of a revenue or capital nature. The exclusion does not make a distinction between revenue and capital payments. 229. The appendix to this Interpretation Guideline contains three flow charts to assist in determining how any reimbursement or other payment (other than salary and wages) made by an employer to an employee is to be treated for income tax purposes. Additional transport costs: section CW 14 230. Another income tax exemption in respect of income from employment is contained in section CW 14. This exemption is in respect of allowances or payments made to employees in respect of “additional transport costs”. This is a defined term and the exemption applies to specific factors listed in section CW 14(3). 231. Subsection (3) is not linked, as is section CW 13 (discussed above), to the requirement that to qualify for deductibility, and therefore an income tax exemption, it must meet the general deductibility tests of section DA 1, if it were not for the employment limitation. Therefore, there is not the same denial of exemption for allowances that cover private or domestic or capital expenditure, apart from the fact that such expenditure, travelling between home and work, is generally regarded as being of a private nature. However, to qualify for exemption these transport allowances must meet the strict requirements set out in the factors listed in section CW 14(3). Estimated expenditure of employees: section CW 13(3) EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 50 232. As noted earlier section CW 13(3) provides that the employer may make a “reasonable estimate” of the amount of expenditure likely to be incurred by an employee or a group of employees for which a reimbursement is made. When groups of employees are concerned, the Commissioner will accept a reasonable estimate for each group or part of a group depending on the particulars of each case. 233. To arrive at a reasonable estimate the Commissioner would expect the employer to survey the employees in a group to determine the average amount each employee incurs. Such an estimation is treated as though it is the amount incurred during the period to which the estimation relates. General comment 234. This Interpretation Guideline concludes that some allowances or payments made to employees that may have been treated as exempt from income tax in the past will no longer qualify for exemption under the current legislation. 235. The principal reason for this change of position relates to the 1995 legislative amendment to section CB 12 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (1994 Act) (the forerunner to section CW 13 of the current Act). One of the intentions of the 1995 amendment was to explicitly exclude from exemption payments or allowances made to employees to reimburse them for expenditure of a capital nature. This was done by importing, into section CB 12 the general deductibility tests of section BD 2(2) (1994 Act). 236. While the amended section CB 12 achieved that aim, in relation to allowances of a capital nature, the same amendment also affected the treatment of some allowances or payments made to employees which could be seen to be of a private or domestic nature. This Interpretation Guideline sets out the Commissioner’s considered view on the interpretation of the currently worded section CW 13. Flow Charts to assist in applying the section CW 13 requirements 237. The flow charts in the appendix provide guidance in determining where an amount is an “amount derived in connection with employment or service”, whether it is exempt from tax in the hands of the employee, or is subject to fringe benefit tax, by illustrating the steps that are required when applying the legislation. The flow charts include the private and domestic versus necessary nexus tests (through the application of the “three questions”) and whether the expenditure under consideration is of a capital nature. 238. In determining whether any allowance or reimbursement will qualify for exemption under the present legislative regime it will be necessary to look at the specific terms of the employment contract entered into (whether written or implied). Each case will need to be considered on its own facts. This EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 51 Interpretation Guideline, including the flow charts, is designed to assist in the decision-making process. Conclusions 239. The conclusions reached in this Interpretation Guideline can be summarised as follows: • Generally allowances paid to employees and amounts paid as expenditure on account of an employee are income of the employee under section CE 1. However, these amounts can qualify for exemption under section CW 13 or be excluded from income under section CE 5(3)(c). • For an amount paid to be exempt income under section CW 13, the expenditure for which the payment is made must be such that it would be an allowable deduction to the employee, if the employment limitation did not exist. Application of the three questions in determining exemption under section CW 13 240. In order for the exemption in section CW 13 to apply to exempt an allowance or reimbursing payment (not being an allowance or a payment made to the employee in respect of capital expenditure employed by the employee), the following three questions must be answered in the affirmative: (i) Was the employee performing an obligation under the contract of service at the time the expenditure was incurred? (ii) Did the obligation serve the purpose of the income-earning process of deriving income from employment? (iii) Was the expenditure incurred by the employee necessary as a practical requirement of the performance of the obligation? 241. Care needs to be taken in applying these questions to fact situations. It is important that the obligation under the employment contract (question 1) is correctly identified. For example, in Belcher the obligation was not to live overseas or to spend money on accommodation, but to do the research. In performing this “obligation”, from which the taxpayer derived gross income, the need for the accommodation flowed. 242. The first question must be answered in the affirmative before the second question is asked, and the second question must be answered in the affirmative before the third question is asked. If the first and second questions are met, then, under the third question, the expenditure must result as being necessary as a practical requirement of meeting the employment obligation. Generally, this requirement relies on case law, as demonstrated in the application of all three questions to the examples above. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 52 243. However, any allowance or reimbursement paid to cover an employee’s capital expenditure will not qualify for an exemption under CW 13. For example, a weekly allowance paid to an employee to cover (over a period) the purchase price of a computer that was installed in the employee’s home, at the employer’s request, so the employee could deal with work-related overnight email and so on, would not qualify for exemption. Exemption of “expenditure on account of an employee” under section CE 5(3) 244. Where an employee is reimbursed by their employer for expenditure paid in connection with their employment where that expenditure is the liability of their employer, the amount reimbursed is excluded from income. However, the employer may still need to consider whether there has been a benefit provided to the employee (to which the liability related) which is subject to fringe benefit tax. Draft items produced by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel represent the preliminary, though considered, views of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. In draft form these items may not be relied on by taxation officers, taxpayers, and practitioners. Only finalised items represent authoritative statements by Inland Revenue of its stance on the particular issues covered.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Law change to ensure tax-free relocation payments and overtime meal allowances

The government will introduce legislation to ensure that employer payments for employee relocation expenses and overtime meal allowances are tax-free, Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said today.

The government's announcement corresponds with Inland Revenue's release today of a draft guideline to the interpretation of the law that sees payments for relocation expenses and overtime meal allowances as taxable to employees, under the current wording of the legislation.

"Over recent years there has been a great deal of uncertainty over the tax treatment of payments for relocation and overtime meal allowances, and whether or not they constitute income that is taxable to the employees who receive them," Dr Cullen and Mr Dunne said.

"The law relating to these payments needs to be clarified and simplified, so that employers can get on with running their businesses, and not have to devote valuable resources to determining the tax status of these payments.

"Changing the law accordingly will also reduce the likelihood of employers having to dispute the matter with Inland Revenue, and possibly ending up in court, thus saving time and money for everyone.

"We will therefore introduce amendments to the Income Tax Act to make relocation payments and overtime meal allowances clearly exempt from income tax and, where relevant, exempt from fringe benefit tax. The changes will be subject to clear limitations to prevent their use for purposes of salary substitution.

"The government has decided to make these payments and allowances tax-free because they are of small private benefit to the employee concerned, hard to measure and not readily substitutable for salary and wages.

"To further reduce uncertainty, the changes will apply to payments made over the past four years, as well as to future payments.

"We expect the changes to be included in the first taxation bill to be introduced next year. In the meantime, officials will be consulting with interested parties over the details of the proposed policy, such as the definition of "overtime meal allowance" and a list of eligible relocation expenses. An issues paper seeking public feedback on these details is planned for release within a few weeks.

"The proposed legislative changes should be sufficient to deal with uncertainty about the tax treatment of these reimbursements and allowances. However, people who can make a strong case for introducing legislative certainty for similar reimbursements and allowances will be able to do so by sending a submission in response to the issues paper when it is released," the Ministers said.

Govt explores further tax incentives for charitable donations
=============================================================

The government is to explore further ways to make it easier for people to donate to charity. In a speech today to the Association of Development and Alumni Professionals in Education, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said two discussion documents would be released over the coming months. One would look at the possibility of people donating to charities by having voluntary deductions made from their salary, similar to the payroll giving schemes in the UK and Australia. The second paper would explore several options for reforming the tax treatment of reimbursements and honoraria paid to volunteers.

### Speech to the Association of Development and Alumni Professionals in Education Conference

### Samuel Marsden School, Karori, Wellington

### Hon Peter Dunne, Minister of Revenue

Thank you for inviting me here today to update you on the government's programme to foster a stronger culture of charitable giving in New Zealand.

This programme arises because of the Confidence and Supply agreement between UnitedFuture and Labour.

It recognises the significant contribution made by the charitable and non-profit sectors to the social, cultural and economic well-being of our communities.

My party is strongly committed to the voluntary and community sector and hugely supportive of the work sector does and the contribution to our national wellbeing, and we want to encourage and promote it at every turn.

Before I tell you about the latest developments on the charitable giving front, let me recap briefly what we have achieved to date.

As you know, Budget 2007 kick-started a number of positive developments for the non-profit sector.

These developments included a number of tax incentives to encourage greater generosity in donating to non-profit causes.

Under the new incentives, the current caps on the dollar amount of charitable donations that are eligible for tax relief have been removed.

This means that individuals will no longer be restricted by the current $1,890 donation limit for tax rebates.

The clear intention of this change is to encourage those who are already donating substantial amounts to non-profit causes to donate even more generously.

For the same reason, the 5 percent limit for tax deductions on donations made by companies and Mâori authorities is being removed, and also extended to unlisted companies with five or fewer shareholders.

These changes are included in the tax bill currently before Parliament, which once enacted, will bring the new incentives into effect from 1 April next year.

Together, they represent a significant first step towards recognising the importance of charitable giving in helping to deliver the services we need to make a positive difference in our communities.

Our next step is to look at how we can make it easier for people to donate their time and money for the benefit of others.

There are several ways we could approach this.

In the coming weeks, the government will be releasing two papers for public consultation, which describe how we might remove some of the current obstacles for people who want to donate their time or money for charitable purposes.

The first paper, which is due for release at the end of this month, looks at a number of possible solutions to the long-standing problem of taxing honoraria and volunteer reimbursements.

Following the release of last year's discussion document, _Tax incentives for giving to charities and other non-profit organisations_, significant concerns were raised about the tax treatment of reimbursements and honoraria paid to volunteers.

As the law now stands, volunteers and charitable organisations are often unclear about their tax obligations relating to reimbursement payments for volunteers.

Ultimately, this adds to the compliance costs faced by non-profit organisations and can act as a deterrent to people offering their time to these organisations.

Specifically, the paper seeks feedback on a number of suggestions for clarifying the law and new options for the tax treatment of volunteer reimbursements and honoraria.

The over-arching consideration for the government is to make it easier for the estimated 437,000 volunteers and more than 90,000 organisations that make up the charitable sector to comply with their tax obligations so they can get on with their primary functions.

The second set of proposals for further developing a more generous culture of giving are contained in a discussion document due for release in mid-November.

This second paper looks at how we might introduce a payroll-giving scheme to New Zealand.

Payroll-giving schemes have been well-received in a number of other countries, including Australia and the United Kingdom, for their simplicity, convenience and effectiveness in facilitating charitable giving.

Payroll-giving schemes also have the potential to increase donation levels and establish genuine partnerships between businesses and the community, while supporting employees' community activities.

The discussion document puts forward a number of suggestions for implementing an appropriate payroll scheme that would balance the needs of New Zealand employers with the expectations of employees wishing to participate in this type of scheme.

However, before any changes can be made, detailed consultation is required to ensure that any new approach is easy to administer and does not raise excessive costs for employers.

On that subject, I want to emphasise the important role that consultation plays in this process.

Feedback to the first discussion document, _Tax incentives for giving to charities and other non-profit organisations_, continues to be instrumental in helping to shape the government's response to the whole question of charitable giving.

For example, feedback on the government's initial proposal for increasing tax relief on donations suggested the measure did not go far enough in its intention to give greater incentives for people to make charitable donations.

The government agreed, and adjusted the proposed policy accordingly.

Given the quality of feedback on our programme of reforms for strengthening charitable giving so far, I am confident of a similarly constructive response to the second round of proposals on payroll giving and the treatment of reimbursements for volunteers and honoraria.

We will also be looking at other mechanisms for delivering tax relief for charitable donations. Among the measures under consideration are gift aid schemes, similar to that in the United Kingdom, which makes it possible to claim tax deductions for non-monetary donations.

Finally, I want to make a brief comment on some recent ill-founded political speculation that charities stand to lose their tax-exempt status if they are not formally registered under the new Charities Act by July 1 next year.

This claim is simply untrue, and I hope it was based on ignorance rather than mischief making.

The position is simply this – charities who have submitted a valid application for registration by July 1 next year will retain their tax exempt status, even though their application my not have been approved by that time.

I hope you have a successful conference, and look forward to your continued contribution to our work in reforming the tax rules on charitable giving for the benefit of everyone involved.

Thank you.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Govt announces new tax policy work programme

Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne today announced the government's tax policy work programme to the end of next year.

"It will be another big year for tax policy," the Ministers said, "with several large reforms continuing and some new projects entering the arena.

"The Business Tax Review, the reform of New Zealand's international tax rules, measures to increase personal savings, and tax changes to increase our international competitiveness have all been carried over from the previous work programme and will continue to be a major focus over the next few months.

"They will be joined by a review of the imputation rules, which will soon get under way. The review will look at issues such as who can use imputation credits and the refunding of imputation credits to charities.

"A discussion document seeking feedback on proposals emerging from the review is planned for release early next year.

"Several other consultative documents on proposed changes will be released for public comment over the next few weeks.

"The next round of consultation on the reform of our international tax rules will take place through the release of an issues paper that looks at the treatment of foreign dividends received by New Zealand residents, as well as transitional and consequential issues – such as the repeal of the conduit rules.

"Other pre-Christmas consultative documents will cover areas such as the taxation of life insurers, further tax incentives to promote charitable giving, details of the proposed exemption for relocation payments and overtime meal allowances, and – as announced in Budget 2007 – further simplification measures aimed at small and medium-sized businesses.

"A discussion document on income splitting is planned for release in April, a project specified in the confidence and supply agreement between the UnitedFuture and the Labour-led government.

"The discussion document will explore the idea of making income splitting available to couples with children, as a way of making it a more viable option for one partner to stay at home, or to work part-time, in order to care for children.

"An omnibus taxation bill scheduled for introduction in May next year is expected to include a number of reforms that are under way, with a focus on changes to the international tax rules," they said.

### Speech to NZICA 2007 Tax Conference

### SKYCITY Convention Centre, Auckland

### Hon Peter Dunne, Minister of Revenue

I am very pleased to have the opportunity to address your conference today.

This morning the Minister of Finance and I are releasing an updated tax policy programme.

The previous update took place in March last year, when we announced an interim work programme for the period of time until the resource and policy requirements of the Business Tax Review were clearer.

The main features of the previous work programme were the Business Tax Review, tax measures to increase productivity and growth, fundamental changes to savings policy, and the review of New Zealand's international tax rules.

Those projects have been carried over to the new work programme and form the bulk of it.

My speech today will be something of a stock-take of progress on some of the reforms that feature on both work programmes, concluding with a few observations about what is coming up next year.

The Business Tax Review is one of several projects that owe their presence on the work programme to the Confidence and Supply Agreement signed between UnitedFuture and the Labour-led government.

A key plank of that agreement was to have a comprehensive review of our business tax rules, for the purpose of ensuring that the system works to give New Zealand businesses better incentives for productivity gains and improved competitiveness.

I will begin my stock-take with a progress report on those projects that are nearing completion.

**Business Tax Review**

I take pleasure in the fact that several changes resulting from the Business Tax Review will soon be a reality.

A cut in the company tax rate to 30%, an associated cut in the tax rate for certain savings vehicles and a new 15% tax credit for R&D were prominent features of Budget 2007 that resulted from the Business Tax Review.

The two tax rate cuts were enacted in legislation introduced under urgency on Budget day.

The R&D tax credit is part of the taxation bill that is being considered by the Finance and Expenditure Committee and is expected to be passed by the end of the year.

Inevitably, the new tax credit will need finessing, given the complexity and scope of the rules governing it, and given that it is new to New Zealand.

It will also be necessary to ensure that the tax credits work as intended and are sustainable – meaning that they increase spill-over benefits from R&D, therefore making New Zealand businesses more competitive internationally, and do not merely subsidise normal business expenditure.

The government will evaluate the success of the tax credit in three years' time, once the credit has had time to bed in and we can see what the country is getting for its money.

**Savings**

We are also near the end of implementing major reforms designed to encourage personal savings and to improve the way they are used.

Those reforms involved introducing KiwiSaver, relieving the over-taxation of people who save through New Zealand-managed funds, and applying consistent tax rules to offshore portfolio investments in shares.

Many aspects of those reforms have been enacted progressively since last year, and the remainder are contained in the taxation bill currently before Parliament.

As announced earlier this month, the KiwiSaver enrolment figures broke through the 200,000 mark in the first three months of the scheme's operation.

That is an excellent start, and it is encouraging that so many people have decided to join.

These early figures confirm the scheme's wide appeal.

My thinking is that KiwiSaver is here to stay.

If take-up continues at this rate it might be easier to make the scheme compulsory, thereby removing the employer compliance costs associated with people opting out.

Past attempts at having a compulsory government superannuation scheme have failed, in my view, because they took a top-down approach, with governments telling people they had to join.

On the other hand, if people are choosing to join KiwiSaver they are clearly doing it because they want to, which is a very different matter.

I stress that these are my personal views, and are not reflective of government policy at this stage.  
However, I do not think this issue will be able to be ignored if Kiwisaver continues to be so successful.

**Rewrite**

The historic, 15-year rewrite of the Income Tax Act is expected to be enacted by the end of this month.

The very large Income Tax Bill passed through its final stages in Parliament yesterday and is awaiting Royal assent.

I understand work on preparing the assent copy began some weeks ago, so it may be ready for the Governor-General's signature sometime in November.

Given the sheer size of the bill, which is nearly 3,000 pages long, the various printings required as it progresses through Parliament has made its progress through the legislative process much more cumbersome than that of other bills.

The purpose of rewriting the Act is to reduce the compliance costs of those who use it, by producing tax law that is clear, written in plain language and is structurally consistent.

It is vital that users can find what they need in the Act and then understand it.

That strengthens voluntary compliance, upon which the effectiveness of our entire tax system depends.

Enactment of the new Act will be a massive achievement for the many people from both the public and private sectors who have been involved in the rewrite over the years.

In particular, I would like to acknowledge the outstanding contribution of the Rewrite Advisory Panel and its chairman, Sir Ivor Richardson, in steering the project through to conclusion.

The panel will continue its work of examining any unintended changes in the law that may arise from the rewrite of the legislation.

**International tax review**

To turn to major reforms that are part-way there, the continuing review of New Zealand's international tax rules will be a major focus for the government over the next year.

The emerging reform represents a fundamental change in how we tax the offshore income of our controlled foreign companies.

We are moving from a system of taxing offshore income as it is earned, to exempting active offshore income from tax.

That is a fundamental change that will put an end to our lonely position of being the only country that taxes its businesses in this way, and it will bring us into line with the practice of other countries.

More importantly, the reform will put New Zealand businesses on a better footing internationally by freeing them from a tax cost that the controlled foreign companies of other countries do not face.

The government is working hard to design a system that is simple for businesses to work with and, at the same time, preserves the integrity of our tax system.

Achieving these twin goals is something of a balancing act that involves trade-offs.

We are examining features that make it easier for active businesses to take advantage of offshore activities – such as exempting active income and repatriated dividends, and a simple test that will relieve active businesses from any further tax payment or calculation.

Base protection will be achieved through reasonably relaxed thin capitalisation rules, a targeted definition of "passive income" to be subject to continued attribution, and technical rules designed to inhibit tax arbitrage.

We have taken as much care as possible to avoid application of these rules to ordinary business transactions.

Most of the New Zealand businesses that were consulted will not be affected by these rules because they will be below the thresholds set for their application.

To ensure that the new system takes into account the realities of the New Zealand business environment, my officials consulted extensively with individual companies last year, following the release of the government discussion document that set out the broad direction of the reform.

Following on from the announcement in Budget 2007 that the government will proceed with the development of an active income exemption for New Zealand-controlled foreign companies, an issues paper released earlier this month seeks feedback on suggested details of the exemption.

The consultation process will continue next month, with the release of a second issues paper.

It will look at the treatment of foreign dividends received by New Zealand residents, as well as transitional and consequential issues such as the repeal of the conduit rules.

The reform will be a central feature of the taxation bill planned for introduction in May next year and will come into effect from the 2009-10 income year.

In principle, there is a strong case for applying the active income exemption to non-portfolio foreign investment funds and branches.

For this to be achieved, however, a number of potential concerns will have to be carefully considered.

The government's first priority has to be the successful implementation of the core policy – an active income exemption for controlled foreign companies.

Work on extending the exemption will therefore form the next stage of the reform process.

Consultation on that second stage will take place next year, with a view to introducing proposed legislation in 2009, with effect from the 2010-11 income year.

**Life insurance**

We are also mid-way through a comprehensive review of the life insurance tax rules.

The current rules date back to 1990 and, clearly, much has changed since then, in both the life insurance industry and in the commercial environment in which it operates.

As new products and ways of doing business have developed, anomalies and inequities in the rules have emerged.

In many cases, term insurance profits are under-taxed, with profitable business often leading to tax losses.

On the other hand, aspects of policyholders' life insurance savings income are over-taxed.

So far the review has involved fairly intensive consultation that has included the release of two issues papers, the second seeking the industry's views on a range of possible changes.

The next step will be the release of a government discussion document that sets out formal proposals for legislative change, with the aim of including the changes in next May's taxation bill.

**Tax incentives to promote charitable giving**

The development of a new rebate system for charities was another major plank in the confidence and supply agreement between United Future and the Labour-led government.

The reason for making it part of the confidence and supply agreement is my belief that giving to charitable organisations, whether of time or money, makes a huge contribution to our well being.

I also believe that it should be recognised, rewarded and encouraged – and that some of that can be achieved through the tax system.

The first step towards providing tax incentives to strengthen charitable giving was taken in Budget 2007, which announced the removal of limits on the amount that individuals, companies and Maori authorities can donate and still qualify for the associated tax rebates and deductions.

Those changes, which laid the foundation, are part of the taxation bill before Parliament and will take effect from April 1 next year.

I am aware that your institute has questioned whether removal of the tax caps can increase charitable giving, and I accept that there is no clear consensus on whether tax incentives can increase philanthropy.

The international experience is that tax incentives alone are unlikely to make a big difference to philanthropic attitudes or behaviours.

However, they have a greater chance of working if combined with other measures, such as better publicity for the charitable sector and other promotional activities.

I see removal of the caps as the first of many measures that can be employed to strengthen our culture of charitable giving.

The next step is to make charitable giving easier.

One possible way of doing that is to introduce a system of making charitable donations through payroll deductions, as is done in Australia and the United Kingdom.

If we did adopt payroll giving, and it is just an idea at this point, we would have to ensure that it would not raise undue costs for employers and that it would be easy to administer.

If adopted, payroll giving would be voluntary on employers.

A discussion document exploring the idea will be released next month.

As part of the move towards simplification, another issues paper planned to go out shortly will look at the legislative uncertainty about how reimbursement payments made to volunteers should be taxed.

It will also look at similar problems relating to payments of honoraria.

These are longstanding problems, and resolving them once and for all will make a big difference to non-profit organisations and their volunteers.

We will also be looking at other mechanisms for delivering tax relief for charitable donations.

Among the measures under consideration are gift aid schemes, similar to that in the United Kingdom, which makes it possible to claim tax deductions for non-monetary donations.  
My party has a strong commitment to the voluntary and community sector, and the contribution it makes to our overall national wellbeing, which is why we have promoted such a comprehensive approach.

**Associated persons**

I see that one of the topics on your conference agenda is the officials' issues paper on possible changes to the definitions of "associated persons" in the Income Tax Act, which was published earlier this year.

The paper looked at tightening the current general definition of associated persons as well as the definition used for land sales.

The suggested changes relating to land sales attracted considerable attention in submissions, many of which argued that the changes would prevent developers from holding non-taxable investment portfolios.

At this point, it is important to note that Parliament decided in 1973, when it enacted the current land sale tax rules, that land dealers, developers and builders cannot generally hold land on capital account.

This means that gains on properties sold by developers within ten years of acquisition are generally taxed.

That was a deliberate decision, and Parliament meant what it said.

The issues paper highlighted how the rules can be circumvented by some relatively simple structures and suggested that the law be amended to prevent that.

I understand that tax policy officials will be discussing possible refinements to the suggested changes in two sessions to be held at this conference, so those interested can explore the matter in depth there.

Officials are finalising their analysis of submissions on the issues paper and are expected to report to Ministers shortly, with recommendations for legislative changes to be included in the next taxation bill.

**Continued simplification**

The government also remains committed to simplifying the tax system as far as possible.

This is a continuing process and one that will never be completed, I suspect.

Recent years have seen the introduction of a great many tax changes, large and small, aimed at tax simplification, reducing compliance costs and making it easier to run a business.

As announced in Budget 2007, a discussion document to be released over the next few weeks will explore further tax simplification measures aimed at small and medium-sized businesses, such as raising a number of business tax thresholds.

These will not be major reforms, but they will have an important role to play, nevertheless.

In a similar vein, the government announced this week that it would introduce legislation to ensure that employer payments for employee relocation expenses and overtime meal allowances are not taxable to employees.

The announcement corresponded with the release of a draft interpretation by Inland Revenue that saw these payments as taxable under the current wording of the legislation.

The government is taking a pragmatic approach here, moving to clarify the legislation to remove uncertainty about the matter and to enable employers to get on with running their businesses.

An issues paper seeking feedback on the details of the proposed clarification will be released shortly.

**Limited Partnerships Bill**

As you may know, the Limited Partnerships Bill is under consideration by Parliament's Commerce Committee.

The bill has been generally welcomed by the public. It creates a new limited partnership entity, codifies tax rules applying to general partnerships and adds new tax rules for limited partnerships.

The new rules on limited partnerships are intended to increase our international competitiveness and should help to attract venture capital investment to New Zealand, as well as be a useful entity structure for many other businesses.

I expect the bill to be reported back in time to be enacted by the end of the year.

I would like to turn now to some forthcoming policy developments.

**Income splitting**

In April, the government will release a discussion document on income splitting, another project to emerge from the confidence and supply agreement between UnitedFuture and the Labour-led government.

Income splitting for tax purposes is allowed in a number of other countries and takes a variety of forms.  
In most countries, income splitting is a matter of allowing couples to lower their total tax liability by allocating some of the higher earning partner's income to the lower earning partner, thus mitigating the effects of the progressive nature of tax rates.

My focus, however, is on families with dependent children, and I see income splitting limited to them.

It is a possible way of making it viable for one spouse to stay at home, or to work part-time, in order to care for the children of the family.

The discussion document will set out how an income splitting system might work in New Zealand, and it will consider whether income splitting is the best way to achieve this goal, or whether there are better means of doing that.

**Imputation review**

The government's review of the imputation rules gets under way in earnest soon.

It was listed on the previous work programme as well but was one of several projects that had – temporarily – lower priority than the changes resulting from the Business Tax Review.

The present rules on who can use imputation credits are the subject of frequent debate, which may indicate that the law needs to be clearer.

It may also indicate that it is time to conduct a first-principles review of what imputation credits are intended to do and whether current law achieves that.

A review is timely, since the law must keep up with and allow for normal commercial practice – for example, the growing use around the world of private equity.

The main focus of the review will be on revisiting the policy on who can use the imputation credits.

Matters that will be considered include whether it is appropriate for companies to be able to stream imputation credits to particular shareholders. The review will also cover the refunding of imputation credits to charities, their use by trusts and the impact of pending changes to the international tax rules.

A discussion document seeking feedback on proposals emanating from the review is planned for release in the first part of next year.

**Non-disclosure right**

To turn briefly to a piece of legislation enacted in 2005, I am aware that a number of accountancy firms would like the non-disclosure right to be extended to discovery in litigation proceedings.

The non-disclosure right is a right not to disclose documents providing confidential tax advice that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has requested under his statutory powers to obtain information.

It was enacted to provide a degree of consistency for tax advice with the current privilege enjoyed by lawyers.

However, it does not apply to discovery.

While, in principle, I support extending non-disclosure to discovery, before any decisions can be made on the matter, there are practical issues that require further consultation – for example, its interaction with the High Court rules.

I have instructed my officials to consult with interested parties.

Ministers will then be in a position to consider the matter fully.

**Tax cuts, Budget**

Also coming up next year, of course, is the Budget, which leads on to the subject of tax cuts, which are very likely to be a major theme in the lead-up to the general election.

My colleague the Minister of Finance has stated on several occasions that personal tax cuts will be considered in the context of Budget 2008.

I have long advocated a 30/30/30 approach to tax rates.

That would see the top personal tax rate and the trust tax rate reduced to 30%, in line with the new 30% company tax rate, itself a direct result of the Business Tax Review.

We are half there already as a result of this year's Budget with the changes to business tax rates, and the tax treatment of certain savings vehicles.

In my view, personal tax cuts are long overdue, and I believe there is scope to include them in next year's Budget.

Most New Zealanders are in favour of tax cuts, and you can rest assured I will continue to push for lowering personal rates.

In conclusion, I would like to repeat my appreciation of the role that NZICA and the tax community generally play in the development of tax policy.

I know that you sometimes groan under the sheer weight of the consultative exercises that appear before you, and that your participation in them consumes precious resources.

On the other hand, your participation is vital to the development of effective tax law that works in the real world – hence the need for your views and experience.

We are fortunate to be a small country where it is possible to communicate easily with each other about tax concerns, and to have the infrastructure for doing that.

I wish you all the best for your conference.

Thank you.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Payroll giving - making it easier to donate to a good cause

The government is looking at ways to make it easier for people to donate to their favourite charities and other non-profit causes.

A discussion document released today by Finance Minister Dr Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne explores the possibility of introducing a voluntary payroll-giving scheme that would make it easier for people to donate money to their chosen charity.

"Payroll giving allows people to have donations deducted automatically from their pay and forwarded to their chosen charity by their employer. In return, people who make donations in this way receive immediate, real-time, tax relief reflected in their normal pay, based on the amount they donate," the Ministers said.

"Based on overseas experience, payroll giving has the potential to increase donation levels and establish genuine partnerships between businesses and the community.

"For payroll giving to be a truly winning formula, however, we recognise that it must also be easy for employers to administer.

"In particular, we want to ensure that such a scheme does not raise undue costs and is easy to administer for employers who choose to offer payroll giving. This was a key concern raised during our earlier consultation with representatives of charities and donor and employer groups.

"For employees, a payroll-giving scheme offers a convenient and simple way to donate without their having to retain receipts and request and file a rebate claim form at the end of the year. All they need to do is choose their charity, set the amount of their donation and ask their employer to deduct their donation each payday.

"For charities, it is an efficient, low-cost way to raise funds and delivers the regular income support they need, while for employers, payroll-giving schemes can provide a low-cost and administratively simple way to build employee morale by supporting their efforts for charity, and raising the business's profile in the community.

"The foundation for building a culture of charitable giving in New Zealand was laid in Budget 2007, which announced the removal of limits on the current tax relief on charitable donations made by individuals, companies and Māori authorities.

"Our next step is to make it easier for people to donate to their chosen charities," the ministers said. "This discussion document looks at one of the ways we might achieve this.

"The type of payroll giving described in the discussion document has been introduced successfully in a number of other countries, including Australia and the United Kingdom, and looks at two options for this type of charitable giving. We are now seeking the views of employees, employers and charities on what type of scheme might work best for New Zealand.

"We already know that New Zealanders are generous people. In fact, according to a 2005 study by BERL, New Zealanders gave some $1.27 billion to philanthropic and charitable causes that year.

"This proposal recognises the importance of charitable giving to New Zealanders. It also acknowledges the significant role charitable organisations play in delivering many services that make a positive difference in our communities," the ministers said.

"The initiative is part of the government's commitment to fostering a culture of charitable giving in New Zealand and is a direct result of the confidence and supply agreement between United Future and the Labour-led government."

### Questions and Answers

**Q: What is payroll giving?**

Payroll giving enables employees to make regular charitable donations from their pay. The employer forwards their donations either directly to a charitable organisation or to an intermediary.

**Q: What does payroll giving mean for charities, employers and employees?**

*   For charities, payroll giving is an efficient, low-cost way to raise funds and delivers the regular income they need.
*   For employers, payroll giving provides a low-cost and administratively simple way to support employees' involvement in the community. Employers can also raise their business profile and promote themselves to their employees and customers through payroll giving.
*   For employees, payroll giving provides a convenient and simple way to give to their favourite charity. All employees need to do is choose their charity, set the amount of their donation and ask their employer to deduct their donation each payday. In return, employees receive an immediate tax benefit on their charitable donations on each payday, without the need to collect receipts or wait until the end of the year to claim a rebate.

**Q: How does payroll giving work?**

The payroll-giving scheme envisaged for New Zealand would be a voluntary scheme for employers and employees. It would provide an alternative way for people to give to charitable organisations while receiving an immediate (real time) tax benefit on their donations on each payday. People would not have to wait until the end of the tax year to claim their tax relief.

Two options for delivering tax relief through a before-tax payroll-giving scheme are proposed in the discussion document.

**_Option 1 – tax deduction mechanism_**

Under this option, donations would be deducted from an employee's before-tax pay, and PAYE would be levied on the remaining pay. The employee receives immediate tax relief by way of a reduction in the amount of PAYE required to be paid. The tax benefit would be at the employee's marginal tax rate – 19.5%, 33% or 39%. However, under this option calculations of child support liabilities, student loan repayments, and Working for Families tax credits would be affected because those calculations are based on the employee's before-tax pay.

**_Option 2 – PAYE credit mechanism_**

Under this option, employers would calculate a "PAYE credit" of 33 1/3% on the amount of the donation made each payday. The credit would be offset against the PAYE calculated on the employee's before-tax pay. All employees who make payroll donations would receive the same tax benefit regardless of their marginal tax rate. Under this option, child support liabilities, student loan repayments, and Working for Families tax credits would not be affected.

**Q: How does payroll giving work in other countries?**

Other countries, such as Australia and the United Kingdom, have introduced before-tax payroll-giving schemes. Their experiences suggest that payroll giving is a simple, convenient and effective way of supporting charitable giving. These countries have also found that payroll giving enables businesses to connect with their communities in a way that benefits everyone involved.

In the United Kingdom, charitable donations are deducted from an employee's pay by employers and forwarded to an intermediary (who then passes the donations on to charitable causes). In Australia, however, payroll donations go directly to the chosen charities. Australia also has the Australian Charities Fund, which helps employers with the initial set-up of payroll-giving schemes and provides on-going support.

**Q: How would employers set up a payroll-giving scheme?**

Generally, employers would invite their staff to participate in a payroll-giving scheme. Employers and employees would need to decide on the charities and other non-profit organisations they wish to support. Employees would then specify the amount they wish to donate. The donation amount is deducted each payday by their employer and paid directly to the chosen charity or to an intermediary.

**Q: What support is available to employers?**

The discussion document suggests possible measures to help employers ease the costs associated with a payroll-giving scheme, and make it easier for them to offer the scheme to their employees.

In particular, the discussion document explores the use of intermediaries and information resources to help employers who wish to offer a payroll-giving scheme to their employees.

**Q: Who would be responsible for ensuring donations are given to legitimate donee organisations?**

Employers would need to ensure that the donations are made to a legitimate charity or non-profit organisation by making sure the organisation is included in the "donee organisations" list on Inland Revenue's website.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Reducing SME tax compliance costs focus of discussion document

The government is inviting feedback on ideas for reducing tax-related compliance costs for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

The ideas are set out in a discussion document released today by Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne.

"Although tax compliance costs are a fact of business, SMEs, which make up the bulk of New Zealand businesses, bear a disproportionate burden of these costs," Dr Cullen and Peter Dunne said today.

"We know already that New Zealand has one of the simplest business tax systems in the world. The World Bank has ranked New Zealand ninth out of 178 nations for the ease of paying taxes – that's ahead of Australia, the US, the UK, and Canada.

"It makes sense to reduce tax compliance costs so that smaller businesses can devote more of their resources to their core business activities, which can help to boost productivity and competitiveness – as noted by the recent Business Tax Review.

"Tax compliance costs can be reduced in a number of ways, ranging from large, comprehensive reforms to smaller, less dramatic changes. Each individual change may make only a small difference, but there could be a significant reduction in compliance costs overall if a number of changes apply to the same business.

"The government has already introduced a number of big changes designed to reduce costs for SMEs in relation to GST, provisional tax and PAYE.

"Many of the potential changes presented in the discussion document have to do with raising business tax thresholds. That can mean, for example, reducing the number of tax returns a business has to file, the data it must supply, or the calculations it must make. In short, raising thresholds may mean fewer tax matters for a business to deal with.

"The discussion document also looks at ways of simplifying the law for certain expenses – such as entertainment and legal expenses. It also looks at the vexed issue of fringe benefit tax on motor vehicles, as well as simplifying GST invoices.

"The government welcomes the views of business operators and their tax advisors on whether these ideas would help to reduce their tax compliance costs on a long-term basis. If so, we ask them to prioritise the ones that will help, so the focus is on the most useful initiatives.

"We have set two closing dates for submissions: 31 January 2008 for submissions on raising thresholds, so that resulting changes can be included in the taxation bill planned for introduction in May; and 29 February 2008 for submissions on all other matters, many of which will need more detailed consideration and may be included in a future taxation bill,” the Ministers said.

Finance lease amendments added to bill
======================================

The government has modified proposed changes to the finance lease tax rules and added them to the taxation bill currently before Parliament. The changes are intended to prevent people entering tax schemes involving depreciation deductions related to leases on overseas assets that result in a loss to the New Zealand revenue. Announced on 20 June, the changes were added to the bill but later withdrawn to allow the government more time to consider the treatment of affected leases entered into before 20 June. The modified proposal announced today reduces allowable depreciation deductions over the whole term of those leases by one-sixth but does not require them to be reclassified as 'finance leases'.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### New finance lease amendments return to Parliament

New changes to the finance lease tax rules in the Income Tax Act have been added to the taxation bill currently before Parliament, the government announced today.

The proposed legislation is intended to shut down tax schemes relating to leases on overseas assets that result in a loss to the New Zealand revenue. The schemes involve New Zealand parties claiming depreciation deductions for assets in which they have no economic interests that are leased to parties overseas who are not subject to New Zealand tax law.

"The government has listened to concerns about the proposed changes and has come up with a new treatment for leases entered into before 20 June 2007, when the changes were announced," Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said today.

"Our modifications to the transitional arrangements represent a pragmatic compromise that deters aggressive tax minimisation schemes and recovers some lost revenue while limiting the negative effects on existing commercial arrangements.

"As originally conceived, the changes would have required all operating leases entered into before 20 June 2007 that met the amended definition of 'finance lease' to be reclassified as such from the beginning of the next income year. Parties who had entered into the affected leases would have had to pay back excess depreciation they had previously claimed for the assets involved.

"The modification announced today reduces allowable depreciation deductions over the whole term of affected leases by one-sixth. That means the parties involved will have to pay back one-sixth of the depreciation they claim for the life of the leases.

"In the government's view, this transitional arrangement achieves a balance between the need to recognise that some of the affected schemes are commercial realities that involve more than one party and the necessity of deterring people from entering other tax-driven schemes.

"We are also recommending four minor modifications to the proposed legislation to ensure it is correctly targeted and prevent unintended consequences.

"We are confident that these modifications to the proposed legislation will allow a less disruptive transition to the new rules for parties involved in leases that existed before 20 June, while allowing the previously announced changes to achieve their intended purpose," the Ministers said.

Announced on 20 June 2007, the proposed changes to the finance lease tax rules were later withdrawn from the taxation bill to allow the government more time to consider transitional concerns that had been raised in submissions to the Finance and Expenditure Committee.

The modified proposals have been re-introduced to the bill by means of supplementary order paper No. 167, which was released today.

Govt introduces redundancy payment rebate
=========================================

The government is introducing a redundancy payment rebate to make the taxation of redundancy payments fairer to people who find themselves in a higher tax bracket as a result of receiving a lump sum redundancy payout. Calculation of the rebate will be based on the flat rate of six cents per dollar of redundancy payment, up to a maximum payment of $60,000 per redundancy. The rebate will apply to redundancy payments received from 1 December 2006, and can be claimed from 1 April 2008. The change, contained in a supplementary order paper released today, is one of several added to the taxation bill currently before Parliament.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Govt introduces fairer taxation of redundancy pay

The government today introduced legislation to make the taxation of redundancy payments fairer to people who are pushed into a higher tax bracket when they receive the lump sum payments.

"Under current tax law, lower and middle-income people can be over-taxed when their redundancy pay pushes them into a higher tax bracket," Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said today.

"Redundancy payments are employment income, and it is fair that they are taxed. However, taxing these payments at a higher rate of tax without taking into consideration the recipient's personal tax rates before and after redundancy has led to many cases of over-taxation. When that happens it can come at what is already a very difficult time for most people.

"To resolve the problem, and to keep complexity and compliance costs to a minimum, the government is introducing a simple tax rebate that will apply to redundancy payments made on or after 1 December 2006.

"Calculation of the rebate will be based on the flat rate of six cents per dollar, up to $60,000 per redundancy. That means, for example, that someone who receives a redundancy payment of $20,000 will be able to claim a $1,200 rebate. Someone who receives a $60,000 payout can claim a rebate of $3,600.

"Because the maximum redundancy payout that qualifies for a rebate is $60,000, the rebate itself is capped at $3,600, so someone who receives a payout larger than $60,000 will be eligible for a $3,600 rebate.

"The process for obtaining a rebate will be straightforward. Once the system is in place, from 1 April next year, recipients will be able to claim a rebate immediately after receiving their redundancy payout by completing an Inland Revenue form. Over time an automated system will be developed to reduce compliance costs further.

"The government is pleased to have found a solution to a complex tax problem that has been of concern to workers and unions for some time. The changes announced today will make help to make the taxation of redundancy pay fairer to all concerned," the Ministers said.

The changes are being added to the taxation bill currently before Parliament by means of supplementary order paper No. 167, which was released today.

**Examples of different redundancy payment rebates**

The redundancy payment rebate is a flat 6 cents in the dollar for every dollar of redundancy payment, up to a cap of $60,000 of payments received in relation to each redundancy.

_Examples_

1\. Jill receives a redundancy payment of $20,000. Her redundancy payment rebate claim will be $1,200 ($0.06 x $20,000).

2\. Simon receives a redundancy payment of $80,000. His redundancy payment rebate is capped at the maximum of $60,000, giving a rebate of $3,600 ($0.06 x $60,000).

3\. Sue is made redundant and receives her redundancy compensation of $100,000 in two instalments – the first payment is $30,000 and the second payment is $70,000. She can claim only the maximum rebate of $3,600 because total redundancy payments in relation to the one redundancy are capped at $60,000. Note that it is the total amount of redundancy payments in relation to each redundancy that is relevant. Note also that Sue could claim the rebate for the first payment of $30,000 – a rebate of $1,800 ($0.06 x $30,000) and then make a second claim for the remainder, up to the cap amount – another claim for $1,800 ($0.06 x $30,000).

4\. Josh is made redundant twice in a 12-month period by separate employers. For the first redundancy, he receives $70,000. For the second redundancy he receives $5,000. He can claim the maximum $3,600 in relation to the first redundancy (the $60,000 cap applies). He can also claim for the second redundancy – $300 ($0.06 x $5,000). It is the individual redundancy that is relevant.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Govt welcomes passage of omnibus tax legislation

Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne have welcomed the passage today of legislation giving effect to a range of major tax reforms, including the new R&D tax credit and employer-related KiwiSaver enhancements announced in Budget 2007.

The legislation was introduced in May in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Business Taxation, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Bill, which was split into three bills at the Committee stage of proceedings.

"The 15% R&D tax credit has been introduced to encourage New Zealand businesses to invest more in research and development, which will generate wider benefits for all businesses," Dr Cullen and Mr Dunne said.

"It is part of the $3.4 billion investment and innovation package announced in Budget 2007, which also included the recently enacted reduction in the company tax rate from 33% to 30% from the 2008-09 income year.

"The present legislation introduces a number of transitional and consequential amendments resulting from the new company tax rate, most of which concern imputation credit handling in the two-year transitional period.

"Another major focus of the new legislation is to strengthen incentives to save for retirement through joining KiwiSaver or a complying superannuation scheme. It requires employers to match their employees' contributions up to 4 percent of their gross salary or wages – phased in over four years. That measure is accompanied by a new employer tax credit of up to $20 a week to help offset the costs to employers.

"These changes complement KiwiSaver incentives enacted in May in the form of a new tax credit to match member contributions of up to $20 a week, which means that members who save $20 a week will receive an extra $1,040 in their accounts.

"The new legislation relaxes a whole range of tax penalties, such as the penalty for taking an unacceptable tax position, to promote voluntary compliance. The aim of the changes is for penalties to better reflect the seriousness of the offence to which they pertain – so they distinguish between people who try to do the right thing and fail, and those who have no intention of doing the right thing.

"The new legislation also increases tax incentives for making donations to charitable organisations, as announced in Budget 2007. The changes include removing the rebate threshold on donations made by individuals, and removing the deduction limit on charitable donations made by companies and Maori authorities.

"These are the main changes in the wide-ranging legislation that results from the three bills that passed through their final stages in Parliament today. We welcome the passage of this very important legislation,” the Ministers said.

Other reforms in the new legislation include:

**Child support information matching**  
The new legislation introduces information matching between Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Customs Service. That will enable Inland Revenue to identify when people with outstanding child support debt enter and leave New Zealand, so that it can take steps to recover that debt before they leave the country.

**Redundancy payments**  
A new redundancy payment rebate will make the taxation of redundancy payments fairer to people who find themselves in a higher tax bracket as a result of receiving a lump sum redundancy payout. Calculation of the rebate will be based on the flat rate of six cents per dollar of redundancy payment, up to a maximum payout of $60,000 per redundancy.

**Finance lease amendments**  
Changes to the finance lease tax rules are intended to prevent people entering tax schemes involving depreciation deductions for leases on overseas assets that result in a loss to the New Zealand Revenue.

**Further savings measures**  
Several technical improvements have been made to the new portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules, which alleviate a number of long-standing problems associated with the taxation of managed funds. Other changes allow policyholders in unit-linked life insurance products to access some of the benefits of the new PIE rules. Certain contributions to retirement schemes will be subject to withholding tax rather than income tax, meaning that contributions will not be taken into account for social assistance measures.

**Adoption of IFRS**  
Changes have been made to the financial arrangement tax rules so that the timing of income and expenditure from financial arrangements follows their accounting treatment under IFRS. Consequential changes have been made to incorporate the adoption of IFRS into the trading stock and R&D expenditure tax rules.

**Annual income tax rates**  
The annual income tax rates for the 2007-08 year have been set.

Reform of life insurance tax rules proposed
===========================================

A government discussion document released today seeks feedback on proposals for updating the life insurance tax rules. To reduce the over-taxation of people who save through life insurance policies, it proposes extending more of the tax benefits of the PIE rules to those products. To reduce the under-taxation of term insurance business, it proposes taxing life insurers on their actual profits rather than on the basis of the formulas contained in present law.

### Govt proposes fairer tax rules for the life insurance business

A government discussion document released today sets out proposals for fairer taxation of the life insurance business.

"The current rules for taxing life insurance profits, enacted 17 years ago, are seriously out of date," Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said today.

"As a result, people who save through life insurance products such as traditional participating policies are over-taxed on their investment income relative to people who invest directly in shares or through managed funds that offer the benefits of the new portfolio investment entity rules.

"At the same time, profits from term insurance, which provides a payment on the death of the policyholder, are now significantly under-taxed. Moreover, in many cases, profitable term insurance business can generate artificial tax losses for insurers, which effectively gives them concessions that are not available to other industries.

"The government is therefore proposing an integrated reform of the life insurance tax rules, to resolve these and other tax problems relating to life insurance.

"To deal with the problem of the over-taxation of people who save through life insurance products, the government proposes to extend more of the tax benefits of the portfolio investment entity rules to those products. These investor-friendly changes are the only changes relating to individual life insurance policyholders that are proposed.

"The main change proposed for term insurance is to tax the business on actual profits rather than on the basis of the artificial formulas contained in present law.

"That will mean life insurance companies will be taxed on their profits in the same way that other businesses are taxed on their profits. After all, tax is a cost of doing business and, in our view, efficient life insurance companies should continue to prosper under the proposed changes.

"These proposals have emerged from a comprehensive review of the life insurance industry tax rules announced in August last year, a review that has involved extensive consultation with the industry.

"The discussion document proposes a five-year transition period for term insurance products sold before 1 April 2009, which means profits from them will be taxed under the present rules for a period of up to five income years, and for the duration of the policy for some single premium and level term products. The new rules will fully apply to policies taken out from 1 April 2009.

"These are important changes that will significantly update the way the life insurance business is taxed, putting it on a par with the taxation of other industries. The government invites all interested parties to make their views known on any aspect of the proposed changes.

"The aim of the proposals is for life insurance companies to pay no less and no more tax on their profits than would any other business, and to remove tax disadvantages for individuals who hold life insurance savings policies,” the Ministers said.

The discussion document, "Taxation of the life insurance business: proposed new rules", is published at [www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz](https://www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz)
. The closing date for submissions is 12 February.

The key features of the enhancements are: • A tax credit to members that matches their contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme, or a complying superannuation fund, up to a maximum of $20 per week ($1,042.86 a year). The legislation giving effect to the member tax credit is included in the Taxation (KiwiSaver and Company Tax Rate Amendments) Bill and applies to contributions made from 1 July 2007. • A compulsory employer contribution when an employee contributes to a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying superannuation fund will be phased in over four years, starting at 1 percent and reaching 4 percent of gross salary or wages from 1 April 2011. This will apply from 1 April 2008. • An employer tax credit which will reimburse employers for contributions they will be required to make into their employees’ KiwiSaver scheme or complying superannuation fund up to a maximum of $20 a week for each employee. This will apply to employer contributions made from 1 April 2008. Compulsory employer contributions (Clauses 144(2)(b), 197 to 199, 201, 212, 215, 216, 217, 218(2), 219, 220, 222, 225, 227, 231 and 237) Summary of proposed amendments New subpart 3A of Part 3 will be added to the KiwiSaver Act 2006 to require an employer to make an employer contribution for each employee who has deductions for KiwiSaver (or a complying superannuation fund) contributions made from his or her gross salary or wages. This requirement will be phased in as follows: From Employer compulsory contribution rate as a percentage of gross salary or wages 1 April 2008 1% 1 April 2009 2% 1 April 2010 3% 1 April 2011 4% This proposal will increase the incentive for employees to contribute to a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying superannuation fund. The measure is supported by an employer tax credit, which will reimburse employers for matching contributions at the rate of 100 percent, up to a maximum of $20 a week. 4 Employer contributions to an existing registered superannuation scheme will count towards the compulsory amount in limited existing circumstances. To integrate compulsory matching employer contributions into the design of KiwiSaver, the following changes will be made: • All employer contributions (whether compulsory or voluntary) to a KiwiSaver scheme will be required to be paid to Inland Revenue at the same time as the employee contributions are paid 1 . • An employer’s contribution will not count towards an employee’s contribution rate from 1 April 2008. A transitional rule will apply for employees who choose to have an employer’s contribution count towards their contribution rate during the period from 1 July 2007 to 31 March 2008. Application date The compulsory matching employer contribution provisions will apply to KiwiSaver or complying superannuation fund contributions deducted from an employee’s gross salary or wages on or after 1 April 2008. The provisions that allow the Government Actuary to notify the Commissioner of an amount of unpaid compulsory employer contributions payable to a complying superannuation fund come into force on 1 April 2009. Key features Compulsory contributions The bill introduces the rules relating to compulsory employer contributions. The rules require employers to make an employer contribution for individual employees who have deductions for KiwiSaver (or a complying superannuation fund) contributions deducted from their gross salary or wages. The amount of the employer contribution will be phased in as follows: From Employer compulsory contribution rate as a percentage of gross salary or wages 1 April 2008 1% 1 April 2009 2% 1 April 2010 3% 1 April 2011 4% 1 The amendment to require all employer contributions to be paid to Inland Revenue is included in the Taxation (KiwiSaver and Company Tax Rate Amendments) Bill. 5 The effect of the phasing-in of compulsory employer contributions is shown in Table 1. It assumes that an employee is making a contribution at the minimum rate of 4 percent and the employer contribution does not count towards the employee’s contribution rate 2 : Table 1 From Employee contribution rate as a percentage of salary or wages Employer compulsory contribution rate as a percentage of gross salary or wages Total employee and employer contribution as a percentage of gross salary or wages 1 April 2008 4% 1% 5% 1 April 2009 4% 2% 6% 1 April 2010 4% 3% 7% 1 April 2011 4% 4% 8% Employers will be required to make contributions at the prescribed contribution rate for a pay period if: • KiwiSaver contributions are deducted or required to be deducted from an employee’s gross salary or wages under Part 3 of the KiwiSaver Act; and • contributions are deducted from an employee’s gross salary or wages for payment to the complying fund rules’ section of a complying superannuation fund. This requirement will apply to employers that are tax-resident or that carry on a business from a fixed establishment in New Zealand (see section 6(2) of the KiwiSaver Act). Furthermore, it will apply only to contributions made for employees who are over 18 years of age and under the age of eligibility to withdraw their KiwiSaver or complying superannuation fund member funds – that is, the age of eligibility for New Zealand superannuation (currently 65 years of age) or five years of membership, whichever occurs later. There will be no requirement for ACC or Inland Revenue to make compulsory employer contributions if a person is having KiwiSaver contributions deducted from his or her ACC weekly compensation or paid parental leave (paid under Part 7A of the Parental Leave and Employment Act 1987). New section 101G of the KiwiSaver Act provides that compulsory employer contributions will vest in the employee immediately. Employers may impose vesting requirements on any contributions over the compulsory amount. 2 Under section 64 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006, the minimum contribution rate is 4 percent of the employee’s gross salary or wages. Under paragraph (i) of the definition of “complying fund rules” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004, an employee is required to contribute at least 4 percent of their annual gross salary or wages as amended by clause 144(2)(b). 6 Existing superannuation schemes New section 101D of the KiwiSaver Act provides that employer contributions to an existing registered superannuation scheme will count towards the employer compulsory contribution rate in the following circumstances: • The employer provides access to a registered superannuation scheme on 17 May 2007 (the date of announcement). • The employer contributions are for employees who are members of that scheme before 1 April 2008 (the start-date for compulsory employer contributions) or, in the case of existing employees (employed before 1 April 2008), the employment contract provides access to that scheme. • The employer contributions must be for employees who are employed before 1 April 2008. This rule is to prevent this provision being applied to new employees (those employed from 1 April 2008) who satisfy the above rules. The contributions that count towards the compulsory employer contribution must vest immediately in the employee. This provision is to mitigate the risk of wind-up of existing schemes if employers were required to contribute 4 percent of the employee’s salary or wages to KiwiSaver in addition to contributing to an existing scheme. It will apply to defined contribution and defined benefit schemes regardless of whether the contributions are subject to complying fund rules. An employer with an existing superannuation scheme will be required to make compulsory employer contributions in certain circumstances. This would apply, if an employer is a member of a KiwiSaver scheme and the employer contributions to an existing scheme that count towards the compulsory contributions are less than the compulsory contribution rate. In this situation, the amount of the compulsory contribution will be the difference between the compulsory contribution rate and the employer contributions to the existing scheme that count. Example Employer A has an existing superannuation scheme that provides a matching 2 percent employer contribution. Employee B contributes 2 percent of his or her gross salary or wages to this superannuation scheme. Both the scheme and employee B satisfy the rules governing whether employer contributions to an existing scheme count towards the compulsory employer contribution. To take advantage of the KiwiSaver enhancements, employee B joins a KiwiSaver scheme from 1 April 2008 and contributes to both schemes. The following table shows both B’s and employer A’s contributions: 7 Contributions to existing scheme Contributions to KiwiSaver From Employer Employee Compulsory employer contribution Employee 1 April 2008 2% 2% Nil 4% 1 April 2009 2% 2% Nil 4% 1 April 2010 2% 2% 1% 4% 1 April 2011 2% 2% 2% 4% Employer contributions counting towards the employee contribution rate At present, section 66 of the KiwiSaver Act allows employer contributions to count towards the employee’s contribution rate (at the election of the employee). From 1 April 2008, an employee, who has not used this provision before that date will be required to contribute a minimum 4 percent of his or her salary or wages to a KiwiSaver scheme. The new rules provide a transitional mechanism for employees who have chosen to have employer contributions count towards their contribution rate during the period 1 July 2007 and 31 March 2008. This transitional mechanism will apply, if: • the employee is employed by the employer on 1 April 2008; • the employee is a member of KiwiSaver on 1 April 2008; and • the employer agreed before 1 April 2008 with the employee to make employer contributions. If this new rule applies to an employee, the amount of the contribution to be deducted from the employee’s salary or wages is the greater of: • the minimum employee contribution rate specified in clause 1 of Schedule 4; and • the amount equal to the transitional contribution rate specified in clause 2 of Schedule 4, minus the gross amount of the employer contribution paid in respect of the payment of salary or wages specified in clause 3 of Schedule 4. The purpose of these rules is to increase the employee’s contribution rate incrementally from 2 percent to 4 percent over four years. The replacement paragraph (i) in the definition of complying fund rules in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 allows these rules to apply in relation to complying superannuation funds if employer contributions count towards the requirement for the employee to contribute 4 percent of their gross salary or wages. 8 Enforcement of the payment of compulsory employer contributions to KiwiSaver schemes At present, under the KiwiSaver Act the payment of employer contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme via Inland Revenue is optional. From 1 July 2007, a provision in the Taxation (KiwiSaver and Company Tax Rates Amendments) Bill will mandate that all employer contributions (both compulsory and voluntary employer contributions) be paid via Inland Revenue using the PAYE processes. This provides a mechanism to allow Inland Revenue to police the payment by employers of the compulsory employer contribution. Non-payment of compulsory employer contributions will be subject to the current compliance and enforcements practices and penalties that apply for tax. The definition of tax in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will be amended to include compulsory employer contributions. This will allow the Commissioner to impose penalties and use existing collection powers. As a consequence, section 216 of the KiwiSaver Act which imposes a penalty on an employer for failure to deduct or for incorrectly deducting employee KiwiSaver contributions will be repealed. Enforcement of the payment of compulsory employer contributions to complying superannuation funds In relation to complying superannuation funds, employee contributions and compulsory employer contributions will be paid by the employer directly to the fund provider. The payment must be no later than one month after the payment of salary or wages to which the contributions relate. In keeping with current practice, it will be the responsibility of the provider to ensure that employer contributions are paid. Section 101H requires providers to take reasonable steps to recover unpaid compulsory employer contributions from an employer. If these amounts remain unpaid and total more than $500 per employer, the provider is required to notify the Government Actuary that the employer has failed to pay the contributions. New section 101I specifies that once a notification has been received, the Government Actuary must determine the amount of any short payment. The Government Actuary can use existing powers under the KiwiSaver Act to investigate the matter and determine the amount outstanding. Once the Government Actuary has determined the amount of any short payment, the employer will be notified of the amount and will have 28 days to pay or dispute the amount. If the amount remains unpaid and no objection has been received, the amount will be transferred to Inland Revenue for collection. The amount will be due and payable to the Commissioner 20 working days after the Commissioner receives the notice. The definition of tax in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will be amended to include compulsory employer contributions to a complying superannuation fund. This will allow the Commissioner to impose penalties and use existing collection powers. 9 Section 120B of the Tax Administration Act will be amended to ensure that the use- of-money interest rules do not apply to unpaid compulsory employer contributions. Withdrawal of compulsory employer contributions Currently, the KiwiSaver Act allows a member to withdraw employer contributions that have vested in an employee in the following situations: • to assist with purchase of the member’s first home; • for significant financial hardship; • for serious illness; • on permanent emigration from New Zealand; • on the death of the member; • as required by any statute such as an order made under section 31 of the Property (Relationships) Act 1976; and • upon the age of eligibility of New Zealand superannuation or five years of membership, whichever is the later. As compulsory employer contributions will vest immediately in the member, the contributions can continue to be withdrawn under the above situations. The KiwiSaver Act prevents employer contributions being diverted under a mortgage diversion facility and this will continue to apply for compulsory employer contributions. Background The government, as part of Budget 2007, announced a package of measures to improve the rate of private savings. As part of that package it will be compulsory for employers to match employee contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying superannuation fund, if the employee’s contribution is deducted from his or her salary or wages. This will increase the incentive for employees to contribute to such schemes. The measure is supported by the employer tax credit, which will reimburse employers for matching contributions at rate of 100 percent, up to a maximum of $20 a week. 10 Employer tax credit for employer contributions to a KiwiSaver or a complying fund scheme (Clauses 142, 143, 144(3), (4), (5) and (6)) Summary of proposed amendment A new subpart KJ of the Income Tax Act 2004 provides a tax credit to employers to help offset the costs of making matching compulsory employer contributions to an employee’s KiwiSaver scheme or complying superannuation fund. 3 The tax credit will be equal to the lesser of the employer’s contribution or $20 a week for each employee. To minimise compliance cost and cash-flow implications of the compulsory employer contributions, payment of the tax credit will be integrated into the PAYE remittance process. Application date The employer tax credit will apply to employer contributions made to a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying superannuation fund from 1 April 2008. Key features New subpart KJ of the Income Tax Act allows an employer a tax credit for contributions (both compulsory and voluntary) that the employer makes to an employee’s KiwiSaver scheme or complying superannuation fund. The tax credit for each employee per week is the lesser of: • the amount of the employer contribution paid for that employer for that week; and • $20 a week. The tax credit will be available to employers that are tax-resident or who carry on a business from a fixed establishment in New Zealand (section 6(2) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006). Furthermore, it will apply only to contributions made for employees who are 18 years of age and over, and under the age of eligibility to withdraw from their KiwiSaver or a complying superannuation fund member funds. That is, up to the age of eligibility for New Zealand Superannuation (currently 65 years of age) or five years of membership, whichever occurs later. The tax credit will apply to employer contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme or contributions that are subject to complying fund rules. The employer tax credit will be integrated into the PAYE remittance process so that the value of the tax credit is given to employers at the same time the employer is required to remit the contributions to providers or to Inland Revenue. 3 A complying superannuation fund is a section within a registered superannuation scheme that has been approved by the Government Actuary has having met certain criteria, such as KiwiSaver lock-in rules and portability. 11 For employer contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme the tax credit will be offset against the amount of the contribution that the employer is required to remit to the Commissioner as part of the PAYE remittance process. The employer will remit the difference between the employer contribution and the amount of the tax credit claimable. If the amount of credit exceeds the employer contributions, the credit will be used against other PAYE liabilities (including PAYE, child support, and student loan repayments) payable by the employer for that PAYE period. 4 Inland Revenue will on-pay the employer’s contributions to the employee’s KiwiSaver provider at the same time it pays the employee’s contributions. If an employer does not remit the employer contributions or short pays, Inland Revenue will still on-pay the value of the employer tax credit to the provider. For employer contributions to a complying superannuation fund, the tax credit will be offset against the PAYE liabilities payable by the employer for the PAYE period, as the employer will pay the employer contributions and the employee contributions directly to the complying superannuation fund, as it does now. The employer will be required only to remit to Inland Revenue the difference between amount of PAYE payable and the value of the tax credits for each PAYE period. If the amount of the tax credit is greater than the PAYE liability for the PAYE period, the tax credit will be offset against any other taxes owing by the employer or be refunded. From 1 April 2009, new section 101I of the KiwiSaver Act will require the Government Actuary to send a notice to the Commissioner detailing the amount of compulsory employer contributions to a complying superannuation fund that is owed by an employer. When the Commissioner receives the notice, section KJ 4 of the Income Tax Act will allow the employer tax credits claimed or claimable to be used to meet the amount owing. When this occurs, the amount of PAYE liability that the tax credit was offset against originally will become a debt payable to the Commissioner. New section KJ 7 of the Income Tax Act specifies that if an employee is employed by a number of employers who are associated for tax purposes, the associated employers will be considered as one employer for the purposes of claiming the tax credit. This is to prevent associated employers claiming more than one credit for the same employee. Under section DC 6 of the Income Tax Act 2006, an employer is allowed a deduction for contributions to an employee’s superannuation scheme. This section will be amended to limit the amount of the deduction for these contributions to the amount for which there is no tax credit. The effect will be that the tax deduction for these contributions will be limited to contributions over $20 a week. In addition, the tax credit will be treated as excluded income for income tax purposes, which enables expenses associated with claiming the credit to be deducted. The tax credit will be treated as a non-taxable grant or subsidy for the purposes of the GST Act, to ensure that the tax credits are not subject to GST in the hands of employers. 4 If a credit still remains after this offset, the amount will be offset against any arrears owed by the employer or refunded. 12 If a tax credit is claimed for contributions which are to be refunded because an employee has opted out, the credit amount will be repayable to the Commissioner. Background As part of Budget 2007, the government announced a package of measures to improve private savings. As part of that package, employers will be entitled to a tax credit to help offset the impact of compulsory employer contributions.

Application date The provisions come into force on 1 April 2008. Key features Restriction on transactions Under the current KiwiSaver rules, there are no rules governing the number of members a KiwiSaver scheme may have. While section 196 of the KiwiSaver Act prevents a member’s interest being assigned or charged, it does not prevent transactions between the trustee and member which allow the member access or use of their interest – for example, loaning money to the member as an investment. 13 New section 117B of the KiwiSaver Act will impose investment restrictions on KiwiSaver schemes with fewer than 20 members. For the purposes of determining the number of members, a person associated with a member under section OD 8(3) of the Income Tax Act will be treated as one person. This provision will: • require a transaction between the scheme provider and a person associated with either the provider or a member to be at market value; • limit to 5% of the scheme’s assets, investments related to or managed by the provider (other than in their capacity as a provider), a member, or a person associated with a provider or member; and • prevent a provider from lending money or providing financial assistance to a member or a person associated with the provider or member. Age limitation on joining a complying superannuation fund At present there is no age restriction on a person becoming a member of a complying superannuation fund. To be consistent with KiwiSaver, paragraph (j) in the definition of complying fund rules will be replaced to prevent a person over the age of eligibility for New Zealand Superannuation from being able to join a complying fund section of an existing superannuation scheme. The proposed amendment will not prevent a person from joining the non-complying fund section of an existing scheme if the trust deed permits. Background The government, as part of Budget 2007, announced a number of measures to enhance KiwiSaver. The amendment is consistent with the changes announced in the Budget. 15 Company tax rate 17 COMPANY TAX RATE REDUCTION – CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL AMENDMENTS (Clauses 9, 80, 92, 93, 97 to 99, 108(1), (2) and (4), 109, 110, 112 to 116, 117(2), 119(2), 121 to 128, 130, 134, 135(30) and (35) and 178 to 181) Summary of proposed amendments Following the reduction in the company tax rate and the tax rate for widely held savings vehicles and the top rate for portfolio investment entities (PIEs) from 33% to 30%, the bill introduces a number of mainly transitional amendments to the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 in relation to imputation and dividend withholding payment (DWP) credit ratios, qualifying company election tax (QCET), branch equivalent and conduit memorandum accounts, and foreign investor tax credits (FITC). Application date Most of the amendments apply from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. The main exceptions are: • the amendments that relate to a portfolio tax rate entity that does not choose to be subject to section HL 22, which will apply on and after 1 April 2008; and • the amendments that relate to QCET, which will apply from the date of introduction. Key features Imputation and DWP credit ratios A reduction in the company tax rate to 30% will automatically cause the maximum imputation credit ratio and the DWP ratio (“the tax credit ratio”) to fall to 30/70 credits to cash. To ensure that shareholders are not disadvantaged by this, a transitional period is proposed. During this period, a company will be able to allocate imputation and DWP credits at a maximum tax credit ratio of 33/67 in respect of profits that have been taxed at 33%. The transitional period will run from the beginning of a company’s 2008–09 income year to the end of its 2009–10 imputation year (being 31 March 2010). When the 33/67 tax credit ratio is used during the transitional period, the amount of imputation and/or DWP credits included as a credit against shareholder companies and widely held savings vehicles income tax liability will be capped, applying the 30/70 tax credit ratio. 18 QCET Following the reduction in the corporate tax rate, the rate of QCET will automatically fall to 30%. This could increase incentives for companies that are contemplating winding up to convert to qualifying company status in order to reduce the tax liability on distributions. To deal with this problem, payments of QCET will be credited to the company’s imputation credit account. QCET will then effectively become a withholding tax. Branch equivalent and conduit memorandum accounts The entries balances in these accounts that relate to periods when the tax rate was 33% will be reduced to reflect the lower corporate tax rate. This is necessary because credits in these accounts will be used to match future actual or potential income tax liabilities that will have been calculated using the lower company tax rate. FITC A reduction in the company tax rate will affect how FITC is calculated. Where a dividend is imputed at 30/70 or less the new 30/70 FITC formula will apply. If imputation credits exceed 30/70, they will be apportioned between 33% credits and 30% credits. As a result, two FITC formulas will apply during the transitional period. Background In July 2006, the government released the Business Tax Review discussion document for public comment. It set out a range of possible business tax initiatives, including reducing the company tax rate to 30%, to help transform the New Zealand economy by enhancing productivity and improving our international competitiveness. A reduction in the company tax rate will encourage more investment into New Zealand by businesses that have decided to locate here. This will tend to increase New Zealand's stock of plant, equipment and buildings, which will boost labour productivity. A lower rate will reduce biases between different investments that companies undertake, which will tend to boost capital productivity. A reduction in the company tax rate will tend to encourage New Zealand companies to stay here, rather than shift to Australia or elsewhere. It will also increase the after- tax profits of companies, which means more funds are available for reinvestment. 19 Detailed analysis The legislative changes are broadly grouped into two areas: • the introduction of new sections MZ 10 to MZ 19 to the Income Tax Act (which are the substantive transitional amendments), and the “sign posts” to these sections; and • the introduction of a new imputation and DWP penalty tax in the Tax Administration Act for companies that over-distribute their 33/67 tax credits during the transitional period. Terminating provisions Imputation and DWP credits From the 2008–09 income year the maximum imputation credit ratio (section ME 8(1)), the maximum DWP credit ratio (section MG 8(1)), and the maximum combined imputation and DWP ratio (section MG 10(1)) will change automatically from 33/67 to 30/70, in line with the company tax rate reduction. Moving directly to a maximum 30/70 imputation credit ratio in 2008–09 would be the simplest option. However, it might be difficult for some companies which want to distribute profits that have been taxed at 33% with full credit for these taxes before 2008–09. A maximum tax credit ratio of 30/70 applying from 2008–09 has the potential to disadvantage shareholders on income derived by companies before the new rate applies. Trapped credits may occur where the underlying tax that generated unused imputation credits was paid at 33%. Example 1: Trapped 33/67 imputation credits Palmer Limited derives $100.00 of income during the 2007–08 income year, of which $33.00 of income tax is paid, leaving $67.00 of income available to be distributed to shareholders. During the 2008–09 income year, Palmer Limited distributes the $67.00 of income to its shareholders. Following the decrease in the company tax rate, Palmer Limited must impute the dividend using the new 30/70 tax credit ratio. As a result, only $28.71 ($67.00 x 30/70) of imputation credits can be attached to the dividend. If Palmer Limited does not have any non-taxed reserves available for distribution, $4.29 ($33.00 – $28.71) of imputation credits will be trapped. A number of shareholders would also be disadvantaged because they would need to pay more tax than if the distribution had been made before the reduction in the company tax rate. 20 Example 2: Effect on shareholders Helen has a marginal tax rate of 33% and during the 2008–09 income year receives a cash dividend of $67.00, with $28.71 ($67.00 x 30/70) of imputation credits attached. Following the decrease in the company tax rate, Helen will be required to pay additional income tax of $2.87 calculated as follows: Dividend received Dividend received Pre-2008–09 during 2008–09 income year income year Cash dividend received $67.00 $67.00 Imputation credits attached $33.00 $28.71 Taxable income $100.00 $95.71 Tax at 33% $33.00 $31.58 Less: Imputation credits ($33.00) ($28.71) Income tax to pay Nil $2.87 New section MZ 10 – override of maximum tax credit ratio To deal with these issues, new section MZ 10 allows companies a transitional period in which the core imputation and DWP maximum ratios set out in sections ME 8(1), MG 8(1) and MG 10(1) can be overridden. The section sets out how companies can elect to allocate imputation and DWP credits up to a maximum ratio of 33/67 from the 2008–08 income year until the end of their 2009–10 imputation year (being 31 March 2010), to the extent the underlying income was taxed at 33%. New section MZ 11 – benchmark dividends New section MZ 11 is a consequential amendment that alters the benchmark dividend ratios in sections ME 8(2) to (4) and MG 8(2) to (4) where an election has been made to use the 33/67 tax credit ratio. The objective is to provide that a change of tax credit ratio to or from 33/67 does not necessarily cause the benchmark dividend ratio to be changed. Shareholders’ tax credits – general Section LB 1(1)(c), (d) and (e) sets out rules that determine or limit, in particular circumstances, the amount of imputation credit or DWP credit regarded as being attached to a dividend for shareholders. Under these rules, the amount of dividend included in the shareholders’ gross income and the tax credits available to shareholders is limited to the maximum tax credit ratio of the time, that is, 30/70 from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. This needs to be overridden to allow for the new section MZ 10 over-imputed dividends. 21 New section MZ 12 New section MZ 12 modifies the maximum tax credit ratio to be used in section LB 1 when the tax credit ratio is greater than 30/70 and less than or equal to 33/67 during the transitional period to allow for over-imputed dividends. Limits on the amount of shareholders’ tax credit The policy rationale for the limitation is set out in the following example. Consider a company that is owned by a savings vehicle that receives $100 of income during the 2007–08 income year and pays tax of $33 in respect of this income. No further income tax implications would arise if the income was passed out to the savings vehicle as a dividend during the 2007–08 income year. This would be the appropriate policy outcome, given that the company tax rate and tax rate on savings vehicles are currently aligned at 33%. Suppose, however, that the dividend was paid out during the 2008–09 income year. In the absence of capping and assuming that the company imputes using the 33/67 tax credit ratio, the shareholder would have a grossed-up dividend of $100 on which $30 of gross tax would be payable. This would be offset by a tax credit of $33, which would lead to a net tax credit of $3. This $3 of net credit would offset the tax due on $10 of other income, which is inappropriate. Under the capping proposal, distribution of these profits would once more result in the shareholder receiving a grossed-up dividend of $100 on which gross tax of $30 would be payable. However, capping would limit the amount the savings vehicle could claim as a credit in relation to the dividend to $30. Therefore, there would be no net credit when the savings vehicle shareholder received the dividend, as would also be the case if the dividend was distributed during the 2007–08 income year. New section MZ 13 New section MZ 13 sets out how the tax credit under sections LB 2 and LD 8 will be calculated when the 33/67 tax credit ratio is used during the transitional period. When a taxpayer whose tax rate is 30% (including all PIEs) receives a dividend with 33/67 imputation credits attached during the transitional period, the amount of credits included as a credit against their income tax liability will be capped at the 30/70 tax credit ratio. These amendments are required to prevent taxpayers with a 30% tax rate from being able to use the additional 3% credit to shelter other income that would be taxed at 30%. 22 Example 3: Limits on the amount of shareholder credit – fully imputed dividend JG Limited receives a cash dividend of $1,200.00 during the 2008–09 income year with 33/67 imputation credits of $591.04 attached. However, new section MZ 13 limits the amount of the tax credit available to $537.31, calculated as follows: Cash dividend received $1,200.00 Imputation credits attached $591.04 Taxable income $1,791.04 Tax at 30% $537.31 Less: Imputation credits (capped at 30/70) ($537.31) Income tax to pay $Nil The actual imputation credits attached to the dividend of $591.04 are still included in income and the full $591.04 of credits would also be credited to the company’s imputation credit account. Example 4: Limits on the amount of shareholder credit – partially imputed dividend Morrison Motorcycles Limited receives a cash dividend of $1,500.00 during the 2008–09 income year with $701.87 of imputation credits attached (the dividend is 95% imputed with 33/67 imputation credits). New section MZ 13 limits the amount of the tax credit available to Morrison Motorcycles Limited to $660.56, calculated as follows: Cash dividend received $1,500.00 Imputation credits attached $701.87 Taxable income $2,201.87 Tax at 30% $660.56 Less: Imputation credits (capped at 30/70) ($660.56) Income tax to pay $Nil The actual imputation credits attached to the dividend of $701.87 are still included in income and $701.87 of credits would also be credited to the company’s imputation credit account. Credits for non-resident investors The amount of the credit under the FITC regime is determined according to the amount of the imputation credit allocated to the shareholder. The credit is calculated by multiplying the amount of imputation credit by a formula in section LE 2(2). The formula in section LE 2(2) is being amended to reflect the reduced company tax rate. The new formula for calculating the tax credit and supplementary dividend is IC \* 7/10. Consequently, the credit is set at 70 cents for every dollar of FITC- adjusted imputation credits attached to dividends paid to non-resident investors. In practical terms, it is often more straightforward to calculate the FITC by multiplying by 0.411806 the imputation credits the New Zealand company would usually distribute on dividends paid to the non-resident shareholders. The previous calculation for the 33/67 ratio used 0.358275. 23 Example 5: Foreign investor tax credits – fully imputed 30/70 dividend During the 2008–09 income year NZ Co pays a fully imputed (at the 30/70 ratio) dividend of $100 to a shareholder resident in the United States of America. At the same time, NZ Co pays a supplementary dividend to the USA shareholder for the original dividend. The amount of the supplementary dividend and the FITC credit is calculated as follows: 30/70 x $100 = $42.86 $42.86 x 0.411806 = $17.65 The amount of imputation credit attached to the original dividend is reduced by the amount of FITC to $25.21 ($42.86 – $17.65). NZ Co is also liable to deduct NRWT from both dividends. New section MZ 14 – credits for non-resident investors New section MZ 14 sets out how the FITC credit should be calculated during the transitional period where the imputation credit ratio or combined imputation and dividend withholding payment ratio is greater than 30/70 and less than or equal to 33/67. Example 6: Foreign investor tax credits – 33/67 fully imputed dividend During the 2008–09 income year, NZ Co elects under the new section MZ 1 to pay a fully imputed 33/67 dividend to its shareholders. A shareholder resident in the United Kingdom receives a $100 cash dividend plus imputation credits. At the same time NZ Co pays a supplementary dividend to the UK shareholder for the original dividend. The amount of the supplementary dividend and the FITC credit is calculated as follows: $49.25 x 0.358275 = $17.65 The amount of the imputation credits attached to the original dividend is reduced by the amount of the FITC to $31.60 ($49.25 – $17.65). NZ Co is also liable to deduct NRWT from both dividends. Example 7: Foreign investor tax credits – 60% imputed at 33/67, 40% imputed at 30/70 During the 2008–09 income year NZ Co elects under section MZ 10 to pay a dividend that is 60% imputed using the 33/67 tax credit ratio and 40% imputed using the 30/70 tax credit ratio. An Australian shareholder receives a $100 cash dividend plus imputation credits. At the same time, NZ Co pays a supplementary dividend to the Australian shareholder for the original dividend. The dividend is effectively split into two parts, one dealing with the 33/67 credits, and one dealing with the 30/70 credits. The amount of supplementary dividend and the FITC credit of $17.65 is calculated as follows: $100 x 33/67 x 60% = $29.55 of imputation credits $100 x 30/70 x 40% = $17.14 of imputation credits $46.69 The respective FITC formula is then applied to each part of the dividend, to get the supplementary dividend payable and the FITC claimable by the company. That is the sum of: 24 $10.59 ($29.55 x 0.358275) + $7.06 ($17.14 x 0.411806) = $17.65 The amount of the imputation credit attached to the original dividend of $46.69 is then reduced by the amount of the FITC of $17.65 to $29.04 ($46.69 – $17.65). NZ Co is also liable to deduct NRWT from the both dividends. Available subscribed capital amount The concept of available subscribed capital is relevant when a company cancels its shares and pays consideration to compensate the shareholder for the cancellation. The calculation to be made for the purpose of ascertaining the extent of crediting of a dividend is set out in section CD 32(25) and (26). Section CD 32(26), which calculates how much of a dividend is fully imputed, is being amended to enable the actual ratio to be modified when a dividend has an imputation ratio greater than 30/70 and less than or equal to 33/67 during the transitional period. New section MZ 15 – fully credited New section MZ 15 sets out the actual ratio that should be used where a dividend has an imputation ratio greater than 30/70 and less than or equal to 33/67 during the transitional period (period beginning of the 2008–09 income year and finishing on 31 March 2010). In these circumstances, new section MZ 7 treats the actual ratio as being 30/70. Dividends from qualifying companies When a qualifying company pays a dividend, the amount of any credits that may be attached during an imputation year is calculated at the end of each imputation year and is the lesser of the maximum imputation credits able to be attached under the imputation rules or an amount calculated in accordance with the formula set out in section HG 13(3). A similar exercise is carried out under section HG 13(4) for DWP credits when a company maintains a DWP account. These provisions need to be over- ridden to allow for dividends to be over-credited during the transitional period. New section MZ 16 – dividends from qualifying companies New section MZ 16 sets out that when an election is made by a qualifying company to allocate imputation credits at the 33/67 rate during the transitional period, section HG 13 is modified to ensure that the correct amount is treated as a taxable dividend in the shareholders’ hands. 25 Example 8: Dividends paid by a qualifying company Wilton Limited, a qualifying company, declares a dividend during the 2008–09 income year of $85,000, to which $33,000 of 33/67 imputation credits are attached. The gross dividend including imputation credits is $118,000. New section MZ 16 calculates the non-exempt portion of the dividend as $100,000 ($33,000 / 0.33). The exempt portion of the dividend is $18,000. The shareholder will be required to include as income in their personal tax return the gross dividend of $100,000 with $33,000 of imputation credits attached. Statutory producer boards and co-operative companies Statutory producer boards and co-operative companies which are imputation credit account or DWP companies may allocate imputation credits or DWP credits to cash distributions and to notional distributions. For a statutory producer board, the allocation of imputation credits to cash distributions must be done according to the formula in section ME 31. Section ME 33 allocates imputation credits for statutory producer boards’ notional distributions. For a co-operative company, the allocation of imputation credits to cash distributions must be done according to the formula in section ME 36. Section ME 38 allocates imputation credits for co-operative companies’ notional distributions. New section MZ 17 – attaching imputation credits and notional distributions New section MZ 17 amends the imputation provisions relating to statutory producer boards (sections ME 31 and 33) and co-operative companies (sections ME 36 and 38), as required, to take account of the dual imputation credit ratios during the transitional period. Branch equivalent tax account (BETA) and conduit tax relief account It is proposed that all entries that relate to 2007-08 and earlier years will be adjusted to reflect the reduced company tax rate of 30%. These adjustments are found in new sections MZ 18 and MZ 19. Other amendments Credits arising to imputation credit account A number of consequential amendments are being made to section ME 4 to reflect the reduced company tax rate. These include: • in section ME 4(1)(ab), “49.25%” is replaced by “42.86%” to ensure the appropriate entry is made when the attribution rules applies; • new section ME 4(1)(ae) is introduced allowing a credit for the amount of any QCET paid by the company for the imputation year (discussed in more detail below); 26 • new section ME 4(2)(ae) is introduced allowing the date of the credit under section ME 4(1)(ae) to arise on the date the QCET is paid. QCET Section ME 4(1) is being amended to include payments of QCET as a credit to the ICA. The credit will arise on the date the QCET is paid. This will address inappropriate tax planning opportunities that currently exist with the qualifying company rules, which are exacerbated by the reduction in the company tax rate. QCET is a tax on the company’s reserves at the time when a company elects to become a qualifying company. The purpose of QCET is to ensure that profits distributed by qualifying companies that relate to a period before the company gained that status are taxed in a similar way as distributions by non-qualifying companies. Whereas distributions by qualifying companies are either fully imputed or exempt from tax, distributions by non-qualifying companies are taxed at the shareholders’ marginal tax rate and imputation credits are allowed to the extent they are available. However, since the top individual marginal tax rate was increased to 39%, the qualifying company rules have provided unintended opportunities for inappropriate tax planning. Non-qualifying companies with high income shareholders and a significant amount of reserves may currently gain a tax advantage if they convert to the qualifying company rules immediately before winding up. The advantage occurs because, once imputation credits have been fully-allocated, reserves can be distributed by qualifying companies tax-free to shareholders. This is not appropriate because distributions from profits earned before the company became a qualifying company should be taxed at the shareholder’s marginal tax rate (less imputation credits.) The QCET rate is the same as the company tax rate, and will reduce automatically when the company tax rate falls. This will exacerbate existing opportunities for inappropriate tax planning. To deal with this problem, payments of QCET will be credited to the company’s imputation credit account. The effect of this will be that subsequent distributions of profits derived before the company became a qualifying company will need to be fully imputed. Those distributions would then be subject to tax at the shareholder’s marginal tax rate. Section OB 1 – definitions Two new definitions are included in the bill to reflect the reduced company tax rate. These include: • New tax rate person – a person who uses a 30% basic rate that applies from the 2008–09 and later income years and a portfolio tax rate entity. • Old company tax rate – the 33% rate that applied before the 2008–09 income year. 27 Imputation and DWP penalty tax Section 140B of the Tax Administration Act provides that where an imputation credit account has a debit balance at 31 March the company must pay further income tax equal to the debit balance plus a 10% imputation penalty tax. If a company elects to over-impute dividends in accordance with the new section MZ 10, and in doing so, causes a debit balance to arise in relation to the number of 33/67 credits, it is proposed that a new 10% transitional imputation penalty tax will apply. New section 140BB – imputation penalty tax payable in some circumstances New section 140BB sets out how the transitional imputation penalty tax should be applied and calculated. The 10% penalty will only be applied at 31 March 2010 if the taxpayer has a debit 33/67 imputation credit account balance. When a taxpayer is in a debit position in both their 33/67 and overall imputation account, two imputation penalties will apply. However, the section 140B penalty will apply only if it exceeds any section 140BB penalty. Example 11: Transitional imputation penalty tax Company A has a credit balance of $150,000 in its 2007–08 imputation credit account. No entries are made to the imputation credit account during the 2008–09 income year. During the 2009–10 income year, the company distributes a cash dividend of $406,060 and elects under the new section MZ 1 to attach $200,000 of 33/67 imputation credits. The company also pays 30% income tax of $100,000. These transactions result in a net credit balance of $50,000 in the 2009–10 imputation credit account. However, the balance is made up of a debit of $50,000 33/67 imputation credits and a credit of $100,000 30/70 imputation credits. A transitional imputation penalty tax of $5,000 ($50,000 x 10%) will be payable by the company as a result of the debit balance in the number of 33/67 imputation credits. New section 140CA – dividend withholding payment penalty tax in some circumstances New section 140CA sets out how the transitional DWP penalty should be applied and calculated. As with new section 140BB, the 10% will be only applied once on the taxpayer’s debit 33/67 DWP account balance as at 31 March 2010. 28 Resident withholding tax No changes have been made in relation to the rates of resident withholding tax on interest and dividends. Inland Revenue is currently considering an operational review of RWT to determine whether efficiencies can be made. As a result, when a taxpayer (who is taxed at the 33% marginal rate or otherwise) receives a dividend fully imputed using the 30/70 tax credit ratio, they will be subject to withholding tax deductions of 3% unless they hold a Certificate of Exemption from RWT. 29 Research and development tax credit 31 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDIT (Clauses 2(21), 100, 108, 111, 129, 135(8), (9), (22), (23), (26), (33), (42), (44), (49), (54), (55), (56), (60), 146, 147, 151, 156, 158, 166, 167, 169, 171, 172, 182 and 270) Summary of proposed amendments The bill provides a tax credit for research and development (R&D) conducted by New Zealand businesses. The aim of the incentive is to encourage businesses to invest more in R&D, which is expected to have wider benefits for the New Zealand economy and lead to improved productivity and international competitiveness. The credit applies to businesses that conduct R&D on their own behalf, or commission others to do it, provided the R&D is performed predominantly in New Zealand. The definition of R&D is in line with that in comparable jurisdictions where it has proved to be sustainable. It applies not just to white-coat research but to the development of new or improved products or processes in a variety of industries. R&D expenditure that is eligible for the credit includes the cost of remuneration, training and travel of employees conducting R&D, depreciation of tangible property, consumables, certain overheads and payments to entities conducting R&D on behalf of the claimant. The credit applies at the rate of 15 percent of eligible expenditure in a year. It is claimed in the annual tax return, offsetting the tax liability of the claimant. Surplus credits are refundable. This means that businesses that have a tax loss or are tax- exempt receive the credits in cash. Application date The credit will apply from the 2008–09 income year. There is provision for the Commissioner to issue individual determinations on the eligibility of a business for the credit. However, because of resource constraints, this will not be possible until a future date to be appointed by the Governor-General by Order in Council but not later than 1 April 2010. Key features Eligibility criteria (sections LH 1, LH 2, LH 4 to LH 6) To claim an R&D tax credit, a business must be eligible (section LH 2), the activities must be “research and development activities” (sections LH 4 and LH 5) and the expenditure must be eligible (section LH 6). 32 To be eligible, a claimant must be in business in New Zealand, with a fixed establishment in New Zealand, and the expenditure for which a claim is made must relate to that business. An exception exists for industry research co-operatives which do not need to be in business and have special rules. Crown Research Institutes, tertiary institutions, and District Health Boards, their associates and entities under their control are not eligible for the credit. Claimants must bear both the financial and technical risk associated with the R&D project, have control over the work and own the project results. When R&D is outsourced, this distinguishes the person who commissions the R&D (who is eligible for the credit) from the person who merely performs the R&D on behalf of someone else. The performer is not eligible for the credit, and the incentive is provided to the party making R&D investment decisions. The claimant must also spend at least $20,000 of eligible expenditure in the year a claim is made unless the R&D services are purchased from a listed research provider. These are entities that perform research for others on a commercial basis. This exception enables small businesses to access the credit. To qualify for the credit, R&D must be conducted predominantly in New Zealand (the credit can apply for R&D conducted overseas up to a limit of 10 percent of the eligible expenditure incurred in New Zealand where the project is based in New Zealand). Businesses can do more R&D overseas but it does not attract the credit. R&D activities must be systematic, investigative and experimental. They must either seek to resolve scientific or technological uncertainty or involve an appreciable element of novelty and be directed at acquiring new knowledge or creating new or improved products or processes. These are “core” R&D activities. Certain activities are excluded, as they are in other jurisdictions, generally to delineate more clearly the boundary between innovative and routine activity. Activities that support core R&D activities can be eligible. Eligible expenditure is listed and includes the cost of employee remuneration, training and travel; depreciation of tangible assets used primarily in conducting R&D; certain overhead costs; consumables and payments to entities conducting R&D on behalf of the claimant. Certain expenditure is ineligible. The main items are interest; loss on sale or write-off of depreciable property; the cost of acquiring core technology (technology used as a basis for further R&D); expenditure funded from a government grant or the required co-funding; expenditure on intangible assets and professional fees in determining eligibility. Cap on internal software development (sections LH 9, LH 11) There is a cap of $2 million on eligible expenditure where the R&D core activity is in- house-use software development. This can be waived by the Minister of Finance when it is in the national interest. Claimants under common control that undertake software development will be required to calculate such expenditure as a group and to allocate the cap between members. 33 Rate of credit (section LH 3) The credit applies at the rate of 15 percent of eligible expenditure. Administrative procedures (sections ME 4, ME 11 and MK 4 of the Income Tax Act 2004; sections 3(1), 22(2) and (7), 33A(2), 43A(2), 68D and 68E, 91AAP, 91C(1), 141(7C) and (7D), 108(1B) and 113D of the Tax Administration Act 1994) Businesses will claim the tax credit in an income tax return. They will work out their liability for tax in the normal way, and then subtract the amount of the credit. Where the amount of the credit exceeds the tax liability, the balance is used to reduce other tax liabilities, or is refundable in cash. The credit will reduce residual income tax, which will reduce provisional tax liability, allowing businesses to receive the benefit of the credit closer to the time they incur R&D expenditure. This reduction will be immediate for people who estimate provisional tax, but delayed for people who use the “uplift” method for calculating provisional tax. Companies and Māori authorities will receive a credit in their imputation credit accounts for a tax liability that is satisfied by way of the credit. To be eligible for the credit, a business must provide – in addition to the income tax return – a detailed statement of R&D activities and expenditure. This is collected for administrative, including evaluation, purposes. There are a number of other minor and consequential amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 relating to the new tax credit. From a date to be appointed by the Governor-General by Order in Council (but no later than 1 April 2010), a taxpayer will be able to apply to the Commissioner to determine whether an activity is R&D, whether a person is eligible for the credit, and whether expenditure is eligible for the credit. Binding rulings are not available on these matters. Background In its Business Tax Review discussion document, released in July 2006, the government put forward several possible tax initiatives targeted at transforming the New Zealand economy by enhancing productivity and improving international competitiveness with Australia. The measures included an R&D tax credit. R&D tax incentives are common overseas. The rationale for them is that there is under-investment by businesses in R&D because the investing firm does not capture all of the benefits of the investment. The government considers that there are wider benefits to New Zealand when businesses invest in R&D and that providing an R&D tax credit will encourage firms to invest more in R&D. There is a body of international evidence that suggests that these tax credits have been effective at encouraging business R&D. 34 An issues paper on the general eligibility criteria, the definition and eligible expenditure on R&D was released in November 2006. Submissions on that paper have been considered in developing the policy. Detailed analysis Entitlement to credit (section LH 1) Section LH 1 sets out the requirements for entitlement to the credit and describes the nature of the credit. To claim an R&D tax credit, a claimant must, in any year, be an eligible person under section LH 2(1) and meet the eligibility requirements in section LH 2(2). That is, the claimant must, in that year: • carry on business in New Zealand; • not be a Crown Research Institute, tertiary institution, District Health Board or an entity associated with or controlled by them; • carry on eligible R&D activities related to the business; • control the R&D, bear the financial and technical risk and own the results of the project; • have eligible expenditure or depreciation that is deductible (or would be deductible in certain events); and • have eligible expenditure of $20,000 or more (unless the R&D is contracted out to a listed research provider). They must also file an R&D statement in relation to that year under new section 68D or 68E of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The amount of the credit is set out in section LH 3 – 15 percent of the “eligible amount” of expenditure. The credit is applied to satisfy a person’s tax liability for as far as the credit extends (section LH 1(4)). Surplus credits are applied, in turn, to satisfy an income tax or provisional tax liability that is payable in relation to other years, or any amount payable under an Inland Revenue Act (such as GST, or PAYE). Any excess credits are refunded (section LH 1(5)). There are special rules for industry research co-operatives (discussed in relation to section LH 8) and for determining the credits in relation to depreciation for tax exempt entities (section LH 10). 35 Eligible person (section LH 2(1)) In business in New Zealand (paragraph (a)) To be eligible, a claimant must carry on business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand. This requires their activities to be a profession, trade, manufacture or undertaking and they must have an intention to make a pecuniary profit. All types of New Zealand businesses are eligible, whether incorporated or not, including businesses that earn only exempt income. In the case of partnerships, the business test is applied at the partnership level, rather than to individual partners (section LH 2(6)). An exception exists for industry research co-operatives which do not need to be in business. These entities are discussed further below in relation to section LH 8. Crown Research Institutes, tertiary institutions and District Health Boards (paragraph (b)) Crown Research Institutes, tertiary institutions, and District Health Boards, their associates and entities controlled by them are not eligible for the credit. These entities are defined in section OB 1 through cross-references to their enabling Acts. Crown Research Institutes are defined in section 12 of the Crown Research Institutes Act 1992. A tertiary institution is a body established under section 162 of the Education Act 1989. A District Health Board is a board established under section 19 of the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000. Association is determined using the test in section OD 8(3). Example A Co is 25% owned by a CRI and 26% owned by a wholly-owned subsidiary of a university. It is not an eligible person. Much of the R&D performed by these entities would be ineligible in any event because it is performed on behalf of other entities (which get the credit), or because it is funded by government grants. However, they do undertake some R&D on their own account that would otherwise be eligible. These entities are excluded because the credit is designed to target private sector business R&D. If the government wishes to increase R&D by these Crown entities, there are more effective and appropriate ways to do this than by providing a non-discretionary credit through the tax system. 36 Other eligibility criteria (section LH 2(2)) A business has a tax credit for a year if it satisfies the requirements in subsection (2). R&D must be related to the business of the claimant (paragraph (a)) The expenditure for which a claim is made must relate to the business of the claimant. Special rules apply to an industry research co-operative which are discussed in relation to section LH 8. Claimants must bear the risk, have control over the project and own the results (paragraph (b)) To avoid double dipping when R&D is outsourced, either the person commissioning or the person performing the R&D receives a tax incentive, not both. Paragraph (b) provides the credit to the person making the R&D investment decision (the person commissioning the R&D). Someone who merely performs R&D on behalf of another person is therefore not eligible. Claimants must be able to show that they bear both the financial and technical risk associated with the project, have control over the R&D work and own the project results. This is broadly in line with the Australian requirements, but what constitutes ownership of the project results is more relaxed. The person who has control over the R&D work is the person with the ability to choose the project, decide on major changes of direction, stop an unproductive line of research, follow up an unexpected result and end a project. Ownership of the results means that the claimant must have access to and control over the results. It does not require the claimant to own the intellectual property arising out of the project, or to continue to own the project results, or mean that they cannot share the results. Expenditure or depreciation loss (paragraphs (c) and (d)) The claimant must have expenditure on R&D activities (as defined in section LH 4) or depreciation on depreciable property used in the R&D activities. The expenditure or depreciation loss must be included in the list of eligible expenditure in section LH 6(1) and not excluded by section LH 6(2). Deductible expenditure (paragraph (e)) The R&D expenditure or depreciation loss must be deductible in the year in which it is incurred to be eligible for the credit. Non-deductible expenditure, such as GST input tax, capital expenditure on land or on non-depreciable intangible property will not be eligible. This is intended to reduce the fiscal risk associated with the credit. There are two exceptions to this. First, if a person has only tax exempt income, the requirement is that the expenditure or depreciation would be deductible if the person derived income other than tax-exempt income. 37 The second exception applies if a person has R&D expenditure that is capitalised for accounting and not immediately deductible for tax, and that expenditure is on creating an asset that would be depreciable – for example, a prototype or software. In this case, the requirement is that the expenditure would be deductible if the person had expensed it for accounting and section DB 26(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004 had applied. In the absence of this exception, capitalised development expenditure in creating a depreciable asset would never attract the credit – depreciation deductions attract the credit only if property is wholly or mainly used in the R&D process and is not created by the R&D. (See section LH 6(1)(b) and (e).) Example A Co has R&D expenditure in creating a plant variety right (which is depreciable property). Much of this is expensed for accounting and is immediately deductible for tax under section DB 26. The credit applies in the year the expenditure is incurred. The development expenditure that is capitalised for accounting also attracts the credit in the year in which it is incurred. Minimum expenditure threshold (paragraph (2)(f), subsections (3) and (4)) To qualify for the credit, a person must have an “eligible amount” of expenditure of at least $20,000 (unless the R&D is contracted out to a listed research provider). “Eligible amount” is defined in subsection (3) and the substance of the minimum threshold requirement is in subsection (4). “Eligible amount” of R&D expenditure (section LH 2(3)) “Eligible amount” is a critical concept because the amount of the credit is calculated on the “eligible amount”. This is the amount of expenditure that is deductible in the year and eligible under section LH 6 and that remains after adding back adjustments in subpart CH. The provision in that subpart most likely to apply is section CH 2. Example In March 2010, A Co incurs $100,000 of expenditure on R&D services to be provided by B Co. The services have not been performed by the end of A Co’s income year. The amount of the unexpired portion under section EA 3 is therefore $100,000 which is income of A Co under section CH 2. The eligible amount is therefore $0 ($100,000 deductible eligible expenditure less $100,000 added back as income). If the expenditure is on trading stock that is the subject of processing, only the net expenditure is eligible under section LH 6(1)(g). Therefore the closing value is not added back under this provision. 38 If the R&D expenditure relates to “internal software development” (software developed mainly for in-house use), the eligible amount cannot exceed $2 million unless this cap is waived by the Minister of Finance. This is discussed further in relation to section LH 9. Minimum expenditure threshold (section LH 2(4) and (5)) A claimant must have an “eligible amount” of expenditure of at least $20,000 to qualify for the credit. This is pro-rated when a person is not eligible under section LH 2(1) for part of a year (for example, when they carry on business for part of a year only). An exception to the minimum threshold exists if the R&D services are outsourced to an unassociated listed research provider. This provision allows small businesses to claim the credit for amounts of R&D under $20,000, but only if the R&D is performed by a listed research provider. The requirements to be a listed research provider are set out in section LH 7. Example In 2010, A Co spends $10,000 undertaking its own R&D. This is not eligible. In 2010, B Co spends $10,000 contracting an unassociated listed research provider to do its R&D. This may be eligible. In 2010, C Co spends $100,000 undertaking its own R&D. All of this may be eligible. The rationale for a minimum threshold is administrative – to avoid disproportionate compliance and administrative costs being incurred on small claims and to discourage small firms from reclassifying expenditure as R&D. Partnerships (section LH 2(6)) For partnerships, the requirements to be in business and carry on R&D in relation to that business, as well as the minimum eligible amount threshold, are applied at the partnership level. Amount of tax credit (section LH 3) The amount of the tax credit is 15 percent of the “eligible amount” of R&D expenditure in a year. 39 Definition of R&D activities (section LH 4) Eligible research and development activities are defined in section LH 4. The definition is: (a) systematic, investigative and experimental activities that seek to resolve scientific or technological uncertainty or that involve an appreciable element of novelty and that are carried on for the purposes of • acquiring new knowledge; or • creating new or improved materials, products, devices, processes or services; (b) other activities that are commensurate with, required for, and integral to, the carrying on of the activities in paragraph (a). The definition is expected to apply to a wide range of development activities in a variety of industries. It is not limited to basic research. It draws on elements of the R&D definitions in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada and Australia (these definitions are in Appendix 1 of the issues paper released in November 2006). It is most similar to the Australian definition, which has advantages for businesses operating on both sides of the Tasman and also for Inland Revenue, which will be required to implement the credit within a short timeframe. In particular, it is expected that application of the “appreciable element of novelty” limb would draw on Australian experience (the United Kingdom, Ireland and to some extent Canada focus on the resolution of scientific or technological uncertainty). Activities described in paragraph (a) are “core” activities and activities in paragraph (b) are support activities. This is relevant in relation to the exclusions, and the in- house software development cap, discussed below. The creation of new or improved production equipment and machinery would be included in paragraph (a) as new or improved products or processes. R&D need not be successful to qualify for the credit. It is sufficient if the activities seek to resolve uncertainty or seek an output with sufficient novelty. There is legislative clarification of the meaning of some of the terms used in the definition. Further elaboration on the definition will be in general and industry- specific guidelines (for example, software, oil and gas exploration, and pharmaceuticals). There will be consultation with these industries in developing guidelines. Systematic, investigative and experimental activities (subsection (2)) Claimants will need to demonstrate that the R&D process followed a planned, logical progression of work involving hypothesis, experiment, observation and evaluation. 40 Scientific or technological uncertainty (subsection (3)) This exists when knowledge of whether something is scientifically or technologically possible, or how to achieve it in practice, is not publicly available or deducible by a competent professional working in the field. This definition, and the definition of “technology”, are derived from the United Kingdom R&D definition. Novelty (subsection (4)) For activities to be “novel” there needs to be some development of the technology or a new use of existing technology. To establish whether something is new, it should be compared with what is already available in the public arena on a reasonably accessible world-wide basis at the time in that technology. The “appreciable element of novelty” limb is drawn from the Australian R&D definition and the statutory clarification discussed in the paragraph above is based on the explanation of that term in the Australian R&D Guide (Part B page 16). The provisions should be very similar in scope. Technology (subsection (5)) For the purposes of the R&D definition, technology is the practical application of scientific principles and knowledge. Simultaneous R&D Under the definition, R&D can be done: • by two firms simultaneously and independently doing the same innovative work; • when work has already been done but this is not public knowledge because it is a trade secret, and another firm repeats the work. Improvements to existing products/processes Improvements to existing products or processes can qualify as R&D. However, the improvement that is sought would have to be one that involved an appreciable element of novelty or attempted to resolve scientific or technological uncertainty. It therefore should be more than routine upgrading. Support activities (paragraph (b) of R&D definition) Supporting activities that are commensurate with, required for, and integral to the carrying on of core R&D activities referred to in paragraph (a), but which in themselves are not systematic, investigative and experimental, are eligible R&D. Support activities are eligible only if there is a core R&D activity. 41 “Commensurate with” and “required for” mean that the supporting activity must be only to the degree necessary to support the project. For example, if a drilling company is developing an innovative piece of drilling equipment that can be adequately tested using computer simulation, drilling is not “required for” the core R&D activity. If drilling is required to test the equipment, only drilling that is the minimum necessary qualifies as commensurate with or required for the development. “Integral to” means that such activities must be part of an R&D project (rather than indirect supporting activities such as cleaning and administration, which are dealt with as expenditure on overheads). Examples of support activities that could be eligible are scientific or technological planning activities, mathematical analysis or modelling used to analyse the results of the experiments and routine data collection. The definition of “research and development activities” applies only for the purposes of the credit. The definitions of “research” and “development” in section DB 27 which apply to allow tax deductibility to follow accounting treatment remain (although the definitions are updated in the bill). As the tax treatment is so closely linked to accounting, the accounting definitions have been retained for that purpose. Following release of the issues paper in November 2006, some submissions were received which argued for extending the proposed definition – for example, to adopt the accounting definition for the purposes of the tax credit. The government is concerned that extending the definition beyond the scope of that in comparable jurisdictions may result in a definition that is not sustainable. Overseas experience is that perceived stability in an R&D tax incentive is critical in increasing investment in R&D. Activities excluded from “core” R&D (section LH 5) Certain activities are routinely excluded from R&D tax incentives. This can be because governments do not wish to incentivise a particular activity through an R&D concession, or to remove uncertainty over whether a particular activity could be considered R&D, or clarify the boundary between development and post-development activity, or innovative and routine work. The activities listed below are excluded from being core activities in paragraph (a) of the R&D definition in section LH 4(1). The exclusions are broadly the same as in Australia (though certain exclusions in that jurisdiction, such as preparation for teaching and specialised routine medical care, have been omitted because it is considered that they clearly would not fall within paragraph (a) in any event). It is doubtful that some that have been included would fall within paragraph (a) but they are included for avoidance of doubt. The excluded activities are: • prospecting, exploring or drilling for, or producing, minerals, petroleum, natural gas or geothermal energy; • research in social sciences, arts or humanities; • market research, market testing or market development, or sales promotion (including consumer surveys); 42 • quality control or routine testing of materials, products, devices, processes or services; • the making of cosmetic or stylistic changes to materials, products, devices, processes or services; • routine collection of information; • commercial, legal and administrative aspects of patenting, licensing or other activities; • activities involved in complying with statutory requirements or standards; • management studies or efficiency surveys; • the reproduction of a commercial product or process by a physical examination of an existing system or from plans, blueprints, detailed specifications or publicly available information; and • pre-production activities, such as demonstration of commercial viability, tooling-up and trial runs. It is important to emphasise that, as in Australia, these activities are excluded from being core activities only – they may still be support activities within paragraph (b) of the definition. For example, routine data collection will not be eligible as a core R&D activity but can qualify as a support activity. Prospecting, exploring or drilling for, or producing, minerals, petroleum, natural gas or geothermal energy (paragraph (a)) It is possible to have R&D in extractive industries – for example, R&D to develop new exploration techniques, but the exploration in itself is not R&D. Drilling can be a supporting activity if it is commensurate with, required for and integral to the development of a new exploration technique or new equipment – for example, testing of new drilling equipment. Research in social sciences, arts or humanities (paragraph (b)) Research in these disciplines is excluded in each of the jurisdictions considered in the development of the R&D definition. The focus of R&D tax incentives is on extending business scientific and technological know-how rather than promoting research in these areas which are funded by other means. The exclusion covers, for example, research in economics, classics, languages, literature, music, philosophy, history, religion, and visual and performing arts. Examples of activities excluded under this head would be the study of the historical development of a language or the role of the family in society, or writing a novel or screenplay. 43 The scope of this exclusion was queried in submissions. If a business is developing an innovative product and the development process satisfies the criteria in the definition in section LH 4, the development is not excluded simply because the product is used in the arts or humanities. For example, if a business develops computer software for use in the film industry in a process that satisfies the criteria in the definition, the software development is not excluded under this paragraph. Similarly, if a business develops and manufactures innovative ceramic glazes, the development is not excluded under this paragraph because glazes are used in the visual arts. As with the other exclusions, this research is excluded from being a core R&D activity only. Where research in these fields is required for development of a new product or process, the research can be an eligible support activity. For example, if research into human behaviour is required for innovative product development, the research can be an eligible R&D support activity. Market research, market testing or market development, or sales promotion (including consumer surveys) (paragraph (c)) Conducting of market research is excluded. However, it can be a supporting activity when the research is commensurate with, required for and integral to development of a product or process. For example, if a firm is developing a new food product and needs to determine the appropriate level of sweetness for the market in different countries, the taste-testing research would be an eligible support activity. Quality control or routine testing of materials, products, devices, processes or services (paragraph (d)) Quality control in itself is excluded as a core activity. However, the development of new or improved methods of quality control testing can be eligible R&D. Quality control may also be a supporting activity – for example, in the development of a new manufacturing process, checking that the products in a trial run meet the desired quality. Making cosmetic or stylistic changes to materials, products, devices, processes or services (paragraph (e)) Changes that are purely cosmetic or stylistic (such as changes to colour or pattern) are excluded from being a core activity. For example, this would include design changes for fabrics and wallpapers. However, work to create a desired cosmetic or aesthetic effect through the application of science or technology can require the resolution of uncertainty and can be R&D. Also, cosmetic or stylistic changes that meet the requirements in paragraph (b) of the R&D definition can be a supporting activity. For example, if a firm is improving a product it manufactures in a way that falls within the definition of a core R&D activity, work on the associated stylistic changes can be eligible R&D. 44 Commercial, legal and administrative aspects of patenting, licensing or other activities (paragraph (g)) This is post-R&D work which is very unlikely, even in the absence of the exclusion, to qualify as a core R&D activity. It is also unlikely to be a supporting activity because patenting or licensing would seldom be “required for” a core activity. Activities involved in complying with statutory requirements or standards (paragraph (h)) This exclusion targets routine testing and analysis of materials, products and processes to check that they comply with statutory requirements or standards. It does not apply to development of new technologies to comply with standards. Activities involved in developing, rather than complying with, standards is also not excluded. Checking that new products meet relevant standards can be an eligible R&D support activity. Management studies or efficiency surveys (paragraph (i)) In Australia this includes studies relating to inventory control (such as Just-in-Time), work practices, industrial relations, feasibility analysis, and time and motion studies. The exclusion also covers industry research – for example, where a company carries out a survey into a particular industry’s characteristics and future needs. These studies or surveys can be a supporting activity. For example, if a manufacturer’s improvement to its processes is R&D, a monitored test to determine how efficient the new process is would be eligible as a supporting activity. The reproduction of a commercial product or process by a physical examination of an existing system or from plans, blueprints, detailed specifications or publicly available information (paragraph (j)) No R&D is involved in simply reproducing an existing product or process, and this is excluded as a core R&D activity. Pre-production activities, such as demonstration of commercial viability, tooling-up and trial runs (paragraph (k)) This excludes activities that are post-R&D but pre-production. It is very unlikely that any of these activities would be a core R&D activity in the absence of the exclusion. However trial runs are likely to be eligible as a qualifying supporting activity, as could tooling up (for example, to test a new manufacturing process). It is unlikely that demonstration of commercial viability is required for and integral to the core R&D and therefore is unlikely to be a supporting activity. 45 Eligible expenditure (section LH 6(1)) Only the following expenditure is eligible for the credit: • salaries and other remuneration of employees conducting R&D; • depreciation of tangible assets used wholly or mainly in conducting R&D; • costs of staff training, recruitment, relocation and travel incurred directly as a result of R&D; • the cost of materials incorporated into prototypes and pilot plant; • overheads that relate to administration, personnel, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and security, rates, utilities, insurance and leasing of buildings, plant and equipment; • the cost of items consumed, and the net cost of items processed or transformed, in R&D activities; and • payments to an entity or person conducting R&D on behalf of the claimant. Salary and other remuneration of employees conducting R&D (paragraph (a)) Salary, wages, allowances, bonuses, commissions, extra salary, overtime, holiday pay and long-service pay paid to employees who are conducting core or supporting R&D activities are eligible for the credit. If an employee works part-time on R&D, the credit only applies to remuneration in relation to that portion of the employee’s time that is spent on R&D. Depreciation of tangible property (paragraph (b)) Annual depreciation on tangible property wholly or mainly used in conducting R&D is eligible (depreciation on intangible property is excluded under subsection (2)(o)). Expenditure on depreciable property created from the R&D (such as a prototype) is not eligible under this paragraph (see subsection (2)(e). This expenditure would attract the credit during the development process. The credit is available to the extent the property is used or available for use in conducting R&D. If assets are not wholly or mainly used for R&D, the depreciation is not eligible. Example A Co has equipment that is used 20 percent of the time on R&D, 10 percent on other activities and 70 percent is downtime (evenings, weekends, holidays). The equipment is therefore used mainly in conducting R&D and is eligible for the credit. It is used or available for use for R&D 90 percent of the time and therefore the credit may be claimed in relation to that annual depreciation. If the equipment was used 10 percent of the time for R&D and 20 percent of the time for other activities, it would not be eligible. 46 To minimise compliance costs, there is no clawback of credits on disposal of assets for more than their tax book value. When the asset is sold to an associate, the price above the vendor’s adjusted tax value does not attract the credit in the hands of the associated purchaser (section LH 6(2)(f)). Similarly, any loss on sale or write-off of depreciable property does not attract the credit. This is discussed further below under “ineligible expenditure” (section LH 6(2)(b)). The credit does not apply to depreciable assets in a tax depreciation pool unless the pool consists solely of R&D assets used wholly in conducting R&D. Special rules are provided in section LH 10 to calculate the amount of depreciation loss in relation to tax exempt entities. Employee training, recruitment, relocation and travel (paragraph (c)) The cost of training, recruitment, relocation and travel of employees is eligible when it is incurred directly as a result of R&D activities. Materials incorporated into prototype products and plant (paragraph (d)) The cost of materials incorporated into a trial model or preliminary version of a product or plant is eligible for the credit. Overhead costs (paragraph (e)) Expenditure incurred on the following overheads is eligible when they are incurred as a result of the following R&D activities: • costs of administration, personnel, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and security; • rates, utilities (including telecommunications) and insurance; and • costs of leasing buildings, plant and equipment. This paragraph does not include depreciation deductions, which may only be claimed under paragraph (b). Apportionment is required when overheads are only in part incurred as a result of R&D activities. Items consumed in R&D activities (paragraph (f)) Items consumed in the R&D process are eligible for the credit. This would include, for example, laboratory chemicals and stationery. 47 Net cost of items processed or transformed in R&D process (paragraph (g)) For items that are processed or transformed during R&D activities, only the net expenditure is eligible – that is, the excess of the cost of the items which are the subject of processing or transformation, over the value of the output. The value of the output is the sale proceeds when the products are sold in an arm’s-length transaction and, when they are not, the market value of the products. This replicates the Australian treatment of “feedstock” expenditure. Payments to a person conducting R&D activities (paragraph (h)) When part or all of an R&D project is outsourced, a payment for the R&D to the person or entity conducting the R&D is eligible expenditure. The performer of the R&D does not get a credit (they will fail the requirement to control the project, bear the risk and control the results). When the R&D is outsourced to an associate, some of the payment may be ineligible under section LH 6(2)(c). The payment must relate only to the R&D conducted by the third party. If the payment is for multiple items (such as R&D services and feedstock), costs must be separately identified. Payments for core and supporting activities are included under this paragraph. Ineligible expenditure (section LH 6(2)) The following expenditure is ineligible: • interest; • loss on sale or write-off of depreciable assets; • profits on R&D services and property provided by an associate; • amounts in excess of market value for leasing property of an associate; • depreciation on property created from the R&D; • certain depreciation deductions on assets acquired from an associate; • the cost of acquiring core technology (technology used as a basis for further R&D); • in-house software development costs exceeding $2 million (unless the cap is increased by Ministerial waiver); • the cost of R&D conducted overseas (except the credit may be claimed for up to 10 percent conducted overseas if it is part of a larger project based in New Zealand); • expenditure funded from a government grant or any required co-funding; • the making of donations; • professional fees in determining whether the person, activities or expenditure are eligible; 48 • the cost of acquiring intangible assets; and • expenditure of an industry research co-operative funded by an ineligible person. Some of this expenditure (for example, professional fees and donations) would not be eligible in any event, as it would not fall within the list of eligible expenditure in subsection (1). It is inserted to make the provisions as clear as possible, and for avoidance of doubt. Interest (paragraph (a)) Interest incurred in financing R&D activities is not eligible. This replicates the position in Australia where, to control fiscal cost, interest no longer attracts the 125 percent deductibility concession. Allowing interest to be eligible would also increase complexity as allocation rules would be required so that all interest paid was not attributed to the R&D. Depreciation loss on disposal or write-off of assets (paragraph (b)) As noted earlier, to reduce compliance costs, there is no clawback of credits when depreciable property used in R&D is sold for more than its adjusted tax value. There is a corresponding restriction in relation to a loss on disposal of depreciable assets and the write-off when depreciable items are no longer used (sections EE 11(3) to (5) and EE 32). No credit is available in relation to this loss or write-off. Example A Co purchases an asset for $1 million which is used wholly in R&D for three years. Credits are claimed in relation to that depreciation. The adjusted tax value at the time of sale is $700,000. The asset is sold for $650,000. No credit is available for that $50,000 loss. R&D services and property purchased from an associate (paragraph (c)) When R&D is outsourced to an associate of the claimant, or property used in R&D is acquired from an associate, the credit cannot be claimed for any profit margin of the associate in supplying the services or property. The credit is payable on the lesser of the amount paid to the associate (eligible under section LH 6(1)(h)) and the eligible expenditure of the associate incurred in a third-party transaction. Example A Co contracts its sister company B Co to perform R&D services. B Co obtains all the services and property used to perform the R&D from third parties unassociated with the company (for example, employees and contractors). Unassociated T Co provides core technology to B Co to enable B Co to perform the services. B Co spends $30,000 on the core technology and incurs $50,000 eligible expenditure on performing the R&D services (salary of employees and depreciation on equipment). B Co charges A Co $100,000 for the services. A Co may claim the credit only on $50,000. 49 Property leased from an associate (paragraph (d)) When property is leased directly or indirectly from an associate at more than market value, the excess over market value is not eligible for the credit. Property created from R&D (paragraph (e)) The cost of property created by R&D attracts the credit as it is created. In the unlikely circumstance that this property could be “used wholly or mainly in conducting R&D”, this paragraph specifies that depreciation on it is not eligible for the credit. Depreciation deduction on property purchased from associate (paragraph (f)) Because there is no clawback of credits when depreciable property used in R&D is sold for more than its tax book value, a rule is required to prevent associated entities claiming credits twice for depreciation. Paragraph (f) therefore provides that when depreciable property is sold to an associate for a price in excess of the vendor’s tax book value, the excess over the vendor’s tax book value does not attract the credit in the hands of the purchaser. This rule is required even if the sale price is less than the vendor’s cost (that is, it is required even though there are restrictions on the associated purchaser’s ability to deduct depreciation under section EE 34). Example A Co sells an asset that cost $200 and has a tax book value of $100 to associated B Co for its market value of $130. The $30 is not eligible for the credit in the hands of B Co. Core technology (paragraph (g) and section LH 6(3)) Core technology is technology which is used as a basis for further R&D. It may be intellectual property or a tangible asset such as a prototype. Core technology is ineligible for the credit for two reasons. First, it is excluded to prevent double dipping when development of the underlying technology has already attracted the credit. For example, a firm could build a prototype which is a capital asset, with the inputs treated as immediately deductible under general R&D rules. The inputs would be eligible for the credits but no tax or claw-back of credits would arise on sale of the prototype. If the prototype was sold to another party for use as a basis for that party’s R&D, the cost of the prototype would, but for paragraph (g), again be eligible for the credits as expenditure on an input into that party’s R&D. Secondly, even if the core technology has not previously attracted the credit, this restriction provides some protection against credits being claimed for excessive input costs for marginal R&D. For example, a company could claim to be attempting to improve further on expensive technology developed by an associate so that it could claim the credit on the purchased base technology. 50 In Australia the 125 percent concession does not apply to core technology, and the ability to deduct it is limited to one-third of related R&D expenditure. “Core technology” is defined in subsection (3). The definition is in substance the same as it is in Australia. Cap on certain in-house software development (paragraph (h)) This is discussed under section LH 9 at the end of the commentary on R&D. R&D conducted outside New Zealand (paragraphs (i) and (j) and section LH 6(4)) Paragraph (i) applies where a project is based overseas (see the definition of R&D project). While the credit is available for the R&D conducted in New Zealand, it is not available for any of the work done overseas. Where the project is based in New Zealand expenditure on R&D performed outside New Zealand is not eligible except to the limited extent set out in paragraph (j). The amount of eligible expenditure on overseas R&D that attracts the credit in any year cannot exceed 10 percent of the eligible expenditure incurred on R&D conducted in New Zealand in that year. Companies may do more R&D overseas but it is not eligible for the credit. Example In 2009, A Co incurs eligible expenditure of $1 million on R&D conducted in New Zealand. It also incurs $500,000 eligible expenditure in relation to R&D conducted overseas. It may claim a credit in relation to $100,000 of that expenditure on overseas R&D. “R&D project” is defined in section LH 6(4). Grants and required co-funding (paragraphs (k) and (l)) Expenditure funded from a government or local authority grant or any required co- funding is ineligible for the credit because the R&D project is already subsidised by government. The rule applies when the co-funding is required from the person receiving the grant or from another party. 51 Example A Co receives an R&D grant of $2 million from the Foundation for Research Science and Technology. As a condition of the grant, A Co is required to contribute $1 million of its own funds towards the project. The $3 million is used to pay for R&D salaries and to purchase depreciable property that is mainly used in the R&D. It is ineligible expenditure. If A Co receives the $2 million grant on the condition that B Co provides $1 million to A Co towards the project, A Co receives no credit for the $3 million expenditure. Donations (paragraph (m)) Making donations towards the R&D of others is not eligible. In Australia, making of donations is excluded as an activity. Professional fees in determining eligibility (paragraph (n)) Fees paid to accountants, lawyers, scientists and others in determining whether claimants, activities and expenditure are eligible and calculating the amount of the claim are not eligible for the credit. Cost of acquiring intangible assets (paragraph (o)) The credits are not available for the cost of purchasing, leasing or obtaining the right to use intangible assets. The expenditure on intangibles can be by way of royalties or a lump sum capital cost. The extent to which they can be included in eligible expenditure requires careful consideration as such assets tend to be the focus of tax avoidance schemes. This policy work will be done once the R&D credit is in effect. Example A Co acquires a licence to use software in its R&D process. Depreciation on, or licence fees for, the software are not eligible. The paragraph does not exclude the cost of creating intangible assets from R&D. Certain expenditure of an industry research co-operative (paragraph (p)) Paragraph (p) provides that expenditure of an industry research co-operative that is sourced from funds contributed by a person who is ineligible under section LH 2(1) is not eligible expenditure of the co-operative. This is to prevent co-operatives being used to circumvent the requirements for eligibility. Industry research co-operatives are discussed in more detail in relation to section LH 8. 52 Listed research providers (section LH 7) Section LH 7 sets out the requirements to be listed with the Commissioner as a research provider. Payments to a listed research provider are eligible even if they are under the minimum threshold of $20,000. To be listed, a person must give notice to the Commissioner that it has the capability to perform contracted R&D, has R&D facilities in New Zealand, charges fees on commercial terms, is available to undertake work on behalf of multiple unrelated organisations, and will maintain records to show that they satisfy those criteria and to show the amounts derived and incurred in carrying out R&D on behalf of others. Inland Revenue will check the first two requirements and list the research provider if it is satisfied they are met. The provider is listed until it seeks to be removed from the list or is delisted by the Commissioner. Industry research co-operatives (section LH 8) Industry research co-operatives fall into two categories. They can be organisations, generally in the primary sector, that collect levies from those in an industry and apply them to various purposes including R&D – for example, Meat and Wool New Zealand Limited. Outside of the primary sector, they may be co-operatives set up within an industry that receive contributions for various activities including R&D. These organisations are unlikely to be in business, but the R&D they either conduct or commission on behalf of businesses in the relevant industry should be eligible for the credit (those in business in the industry and making payments to the co-operative will not be eligible for the credit in relation to those levies or contributions). Industry research co-operatives are therefore exempt from the business test. Instead: • they must be undertaking or commissioning R&D mainly on behalf of New Zealand businesses that, but for the minimum threshold, would be eligible for a tax credit if they were carrying out the R&D activities; and • those businesses make contributions or pay levies that are used in financing the R&D; and • the R&D relates to the businesses of those who make contributions or pay levies (section LH 2(a)(ii)). Depreciation base for tax exempt entities (section LH 10) R&D tax credits are potentially available to most entities undertaking an R&D activity, including charities and not-for-profit entities which have only exempt income. The normal rules for calculating depreciation loss are ineffective for entities which generate only exempt income from an asset. Section LH 10 provides rules to calculate the amount of depreciation loss these entities can claim a credit for. 53 When a person conducting or commissioning R&D has not previously been allowed a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss for an asset because they derive only exempt income, they are treated as acquiring the asset on the first day of the 2008–09 income year for market value, or on the actual date of acquisition at cost, whichever is the later. These entities are then considered, solely for the purposes of calculating the amount of depreciation loss for the purposes of the credit, to have had deductions for depreciation in every year since acquisition. This does not allow the person to claim a depreciation loss, but does lead to the correct amount of depreciation loss to use in calculating the amount of R&D tax credit. Example Physicists Having Borders, a charitable society, undertakes R&D in 2010–11. A Digital Serial Analyser, purchased new in 2007, is mainly used in the R&D activity and the resulting depreciation loss would be deductible if PHB were in business. PHB’s income year runs from 1 April to 31 March, and an independent valuation of the analyser on 1 April 2008 puts its market value at $35,000. For the purposes of calculating the depreciation loss which is eligible for the credit in 2010–11, PHB assumes the analyser was purchased on 1 April for $35,000. The applicable depreciation rate for the analyser is 26.4 percent (diminishing value rate for an oscilloscope with 20 percent loading). PHB is treated as being allowed a deduction for depreciation loss in each of the 2008–09, 2009–10, and 2010–11 income years, being the completed income years following deemed acquisition. Therefore, the assumed amounts of depreciation loss and adjusted tax values (ATV) in each year are: Income year ATV at beginning of year Depreciation loss 2008–09 Cost = $35,000 26.4% x $35,000 = $9,240 2009–10 $35,000 – $9,240 = $25,760 26.4% x $25,760 = $6,800 2010–11 $25,760 – $6,800 = $18,960 26.4% x $18,960 = $5,005 In the 2010–11 income year PHB can claim a tax credit for $5,005 of eligible depreciation loss. If the Digital Serial Analyser, instead of being purchased new in 2007, was purchased second-hand, the applicable depreciation rate for the analyser would be 22 percent (diminishing value rate for an oscilloscope without 20% loading). R&D tax credits and imputation accounts (sections ME 4, ME 11, MK 4) In other jurisdictions such as Australia, tax credits to companies are “clawed back” when paid out as dividends. The New Zealand credit has been designed to reduce such “clawback”. If a person has an imputation credit account or a Māori authority credit account, an R&D tax credit will lead to a credit to that account. A refund of R&D tax credit will lead to a debit (existing sections ME 5, ME 12 and MK 5). The result is that companies receive an imputation credit for a tax liability satisfied by way of the credit. The credit is equal to the amount of the R&D tax credit (sections ME 4(1)(ib), ME 11(1)(ib) and MK 4(1)(gb)), and the debit is equal to the amount of the refund. The credit arises on the day the relevant income tax return is received by Inland Revenue (sections ME 4(2)(gb), ME 11(2)(db) and MK 4(2)(db)). 54 Examples: Tax credit leads to credits and debits to imputation credit account 1. Company A receives a tax credit of $10,000 for expenditure incurred in its 2008–09 income year, reducing its tax-to-pay to $100,000. Company A’s income tax return for the 2008–09 year is received by Inland Revenue on 1 June 2009. On 1 June 2009, there is a credit to A’s imputation credit account of $10,000. 2. Company B receives a tax credit of $10,000 for expenditure incurred in its 2008–09 income year, pushing it from tax-to-pay of $5,000 to a tax loss of $5,000. Company B’s income tax return for the 2008–09 year is received by Inland Revenue on 1 March 2010. B receives a cash refund of $5,000, being the amount of the surplus refundable tax credit, on 1 April 2010. On 1 March 2010, there is a credit to B’s imputation credit account of $10,000. On 1 April 2010, there is a debit for B’s imputation credit account of $5,000. Claiming the credit Taxpayers will claim the tax credit in an income tax return. The taxpayer will work out the liability for tax in the normal way, and then subtract the amount of the credit. If the amount of the credit exceeds the tax liability the balance is used to reduce other tax liabilities, or is refundable in cash. The tax will reduce residual income tax, which will reduce provisional tax liability, allowing taxpayers to receive the benefit of the credit closer to the time the related eligible expenditure is incurred. This reduction will be immediate for people who estimate provisional tax, but delayed for people who use the “uplift” method for calculating provisional tax. To be eligible for the credit, the taxpayer must provide – in addition to the income tax return – a detailed statement of R&D activities and expenditure, containing essential information for administrative purposes, by a due date. There are a number of other minor and consequential amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 relating to the new tax credit. Example: Claiming the tax credit In 2010, Company A has assessable income of $200,000 and allowable deductions of $170,000, $100,000 of which is an “eligible amount” of R&D expenditure. A claims an R&D tax credit of $15,000 of R&D expenditure. Assessable income $200,000 Less Deductions $170,000 Net income $30,000 Tax liability (@ 30%) $9,000 Less R&D tax credit $15,000 Tax to pay $0 Refund of surplus credit $6,000 Addendum Credit to imputation credit account $15,000 (on date return is received) Debit to imputation credit account $6,000 (on date refund is paid) 55 Requirement for a detailed supporting statement (section LH 1(3) Income Tax Act 2004; sections 68D and 68E Tax Administration Act 1994) A person claiming a tax credit on an income tax return is required to furnish electronically file a detailed supporting statement. The detailed statement contains essential information to be used for audit, forecasting, statistical and evaluation purposes, and is expected to have similarities to Australian and Canadian statements. If a person is a member of an internal software development group, the detailed statement must be filed by a nominated member of the group on behalf of all group members. A partnership may elect to file the detailed statement, in relation to the partnership’s R&D activities, on behalf of all the partners, for convenience. A partnership which elects to file a statement on behalf of all the partners, and does internal software development, is not an internal software development group merely because it makes this election. Alternatively, if the partnership does not make this election, each partner must separately file their own detailed statement, including their share of the partnership’s eligible expenses and tax credit. The statement must be filed before the due date. If a statement is filed late, there will be no tax credit for the year and there could be use-of-money-interest and penalties to pay. 5 The government recognises that taxpayers and their agents need sufficient time to prepare the statement. Therefore, the statement is never required to be filed before the due date for the associated income tax return. The due date of the detailed statement for an individual is the same as the due date for the person’s income tax return. The due date for an internal software development group is the latest income tax return due date of any of the group’s members. The due date for a partnership which elects to file a statement for all the members of the partnership is the latest income tax return due date of any of the partners. Example: Due date for filing a detailed statement A’s income year runs from 1 April to 31 March. B and C have income years which run from 1 November to 31 October. A, B and C are under common control and have amounts eligible for a tax credit. B and C have a tax agent who is granted an extension of time, until 31 March 2010, to file B and C’s 2008–09 income tax returns. A’s internal accountant files its income tax return. A must file its 2008–09 income tax return by 7 July 2009. B and C have until 31 March 2010. The group’s detailed statement must therefore be furnished by 31 March 2010. 5 There may be an exception in one situation: when a group return is filed on time but is incorrect due to a simple oversight, the Commissioner has discretion to grant an extension of time to file a corrected version. This exception was created to avoid the situation in which a group accidentally omits a member from its group return, causing the other members of the group to lose entitlement to their credits. 56 It is possible that a person will be required to file (or have filed on their behalf by a group or partnership) more than one detailed statement for an income year. Provisional tax (section OB 1 Income Tax Act 2004; section 3(1) Tax Administration Act 1994 – definition of residual income tax) The R&D tax credit reduces residual income tax. Taxpayers therefore have the option of reducing their provisional tax payments in anticipation of an R&D credit at the end of the year. Example: estimating provisional tax including tax credit Company A expects to have a tax liability of $100,000 for the 2008–09 income year (before credits). A also expects to receive a credit of $40,000, so estimates its RIT to be $60,000. A furnishes this estimate to Inland Revenue and thereby elects to use the estimated provisional tax method (see sub- paragraph MB 2(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2004). On each provisional tax instalment date, A pays provisional tax payments of $20,000. Changes to the disputes and reassessment rules Time limit for notice of proposed adjustment (section 3(1) Tax Administration Act 1994 – definition of response period) The government recognises that claimants and their agents will require time to prepare and check their claims for tax credits. The time for reassessing the amount claimed has therefore been extended from the standard four months. In the case of only R&D tax credit amounts, the time limits within which the taxpayer can issue a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) are: • For a person who is not a member of an internal software development group, one year following the date the income tax return is received by Inland Revenue. • For a person who is a member of an internal software development group, from the date the person’s income tax return is received by Inland Revenue, up until one year after the due date for the group’s detailed statement of R&D activities. Example: Taxpayer issues NOPA within the new response period Company A is in the process of internally auditing its R&D expenditure. On 15 March 2010, A’s agent files A’s 2008–09 income tax return and files a detailed statement of R&D activities, claiming a $50,000 tax credit. Inland Revenue receives the tax return on 17 March. When A completes its audit, A discovers that it was actually entitled to a tax credit of $60,000. As long as Inland Revenue receives the notice of proposed adjustment by 16 March 2011, the disputes process will begin and, subject to the outcome of the process, A could receive the additional $10,000 credit. If the notice of proposed adjustment is received after 16 March 2011, the notice will not be effective. 57 Issuing a NOPA for an amount of R&D tax credit does not allow the taxpayer to reopen any other aspect of the income tax return. Time limit for Commissioner’s reassessment (sections 108(1B), 113D Tax Administration Act 1994) Overseas experience suggests that when taxpayers are given long periods to reconsider their original claims, practitioners have incentives to trawl through past years’ accounts and identify R&D expenditure that the taxpayer was unaware was R&D. This practice of “grave-digging” is at odds with the intent of the R&D tax credit policy, which is that the credit should provide an incentive to undertake R&D. If credits are being given for R&D which the taxpayer was unaware they were undertaking, it is clear that the credit has not provided any incentive. To prevent “grave-digging”, the Commissioner will not be allowed to reassess an amount of R&D credit upwards if one year has passed since the end of the year in which the original income tax return was filed. Example: Taxpayer requests amendment after more than a year Company A claims a $50,000 credit for R&D undertaken in the 2008–09 year, by filing an income tax return on 6 June 2009. The return is filed in the 2009–10 tax year, which ends on 31 March 2010. On 1 June 2011, A discovers that it was actually entitled to a $60,000 credit for R&D and asks the Commissioner to amend the amount originally self-assessed. However, Inland Revenue may not amend the amount to $60,000 after 31 March 2011. There is an exception to the new rule. When the taxpayer has issued a NOPA on their claim for an R&D credit within the response period for doing so, the Commissioner has the normal four years to reassess the amount of credit, allowing time for disputes procedures to be completed. In no case may the Commissioner increase the amount of the R&D tax credit by more than the adjustment proposed in the NOPA which arrived within the original response period. Example: Taxpayer requests amendment after more than a year, having issued a NOPA Company A claims a $50,000 credit for R&D undertaken in the 2008–09 year, by filing an income tax return on 6 June 2009. The return is filed in the 2009–10 tax year, which ends on 31 March 2010. On 1 June 2010, A discovers that it was actually entitled to a $60,000 credit for R&D and issues a notice of proposed adjustment. The notice is issued within the response period (one year following the date the tax return was received), so the disputes process begins. The disputes process is concluded on 30 August 2011, and Inland Revenue agrees the credit should be $60,000. Normally, Inland Revenue would be unable to reassess the amount of the credit, since the date for doing so (31 March 2011) has passed. However, because the taxpayer had issued a NOPA relating to the amount of the R&D tax credit, Inland Revenue will reassess the amount to $60,000. 58 Example: Taxpayer requests amendment after more than a year, having issued multiple NOPAs Company A claims a $50,000 credit for R&D undertaken in the 2008–09 year, by filing an income tax return on 6 June 2009. The return is filed in the 2009–10 tax year, which ends on 31 March 2010. On 1 June 2010, A discovers that it was actually entitled to a $60,000 credit for R&D and issues a notice of proposed adjustment. The notice is issued within the response period (one year following the date the tax return was received), so the disputes process begins. On 20 August 2010, A issues another NOPA, revising up the credit again to $70,000. The disputes process relating to the first NOPA is concluded on 30 August 2011, and Inland Revenue agrees the credit should be $60,000. Because the taxpayer issued a NOPA relating to the amount of the R&D tax credit within the response period, Inland Revenue will reassess amount to $60,000. The second NOPA is ineffective because it was issued outside the relevant response period, being the first year after the income tax return was originally filed. Inland Revenue is unable to reassess the tax credit amount above $60,000. Determinations (sections 91AAP, 91C(1)(eb)(vb) Tax Administration Act 1994) Taxpayers who are uncertain about their eligibility for the tax credit will be able to apply for a determination that: • they meet the eligibility criteria in Section LH 2; • their activity meets the definition of R&D in Section LH 4; and • their expenditure or depreciation loss is an eligible amount, as defined in LH 3. Taxpayers will not be able to obtain binding rulings about these matters. There will be regulations to prescribe how taxpayers should apply for a determination on these matters. The determinations will be binding on the taxpayers who request them, and on the Commissioner, from the date the determination is signed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. When there is an amendment or repeal of the law relevant to the determination, and this detrimentally affects the person who relies on the determination, the determination is no longer binding and cannot be relied upon. Where the applicant has misrepresented or omitted facts relevant to the determination, whether intentionally or not, the determination is no longer binding and cannot be relied upon. Inland Revenue may withdraw the determination by notice, at which point it can no longer be relied upon. There is an exception, however – when the taxpayer is already undertaking an activity in reliance on the determination, and was doing so before the notice of withdrawal, they can continue to rely on the determination as originally set down for the activity. 59 The ability to apply for a determination might not be available immediately after this Bill is assented to, owing to resource constraints. The provision allowing for determinations will therefore come into force by Order in Council, but not later than 1 April 2010. Record-keeping (sections 22(2) and 22(7) Tax Administration Act 1994) Taxpayers must keep sufficient records to support their claim for an R&D tax credit. For a business, general record-keeping requirements are laid out in detail in section 22(1). An entity which is not a business is expected to keep records of a similar standard to support its claim for a tax credit. In addition, all entities claiming a tax credit will be expected to keep a wider range of records than specified in section 22(1). For example, non-accounting documents such as project plans or test-reports might be required to provide evidence of a scientific, investigative and experimental approach to an activity. No exemption from filing an annual return of income (sections 33A(2) and 43A(2) Tax Administration Act 1994) A person who claims a tax credit under section LH 1 must file a return of income for the year the credit relates to. The exemption from filing in section 33A does not apply to a person who claims the tax credit. A non-active company which claims a tax credit under section LH 1 ceases to be a non-active company and must file an income tax return. Refunds of surplus credits not subject to GST (section 6 Goods and Services Tax (Grants and Subsidies Order) 1992) A refund of surplus tax credits under section LH 1 is not subject to GST. Cap on internal-use software expenditure eligible for a credit (sections LH 9, LH 11) A maximum of $2 million of internal software development will be eligible for an R&D tax credit. The cap may be lifted by the Minister of Finance if it is in the national interest. In other jurisdictions, claims for R&D incentives relating to internal software development have been problematic. In Australia, the 125% and 175% deductibility R&D tax incentives are not available for software developed for solely internal use. The New Zealand credit allows claims for internal software development, but caps these claims to limit the fiscal risk of abuse. 60 Outline of the sections Section LH 9 limits the eligible amount of credit a person can claim for internal software development, and also calculates the eligible amount. In particular: • Subsection (1) determines when a person is eligible for a credit for internal software development and therefore has to apply LH 9. • Subsection (2) determines which other subsections to use in calculating the eligible amount. • Subsections (3) and (4) calculate the eligible amount to use for a period that a person is not a member of an internal software development group. • Subsections (5) to (10) calculate the eligible amount to use for a period that a person is a member of an internal software group in which all members have the same income year. • Subsections (11) to (14) calculate the eligible amount to use for a period that a person is a member of an internal software group in which not all members have the same income year. • Subsection (15) gives the Minister of Finance discretion to determine a higher level of the cap for a person, and provides criteria that the Minister will use in exercising this discretion. Section LH 11 defines the terms “internal software development”, “associated internal software developer”, “internal software development controller” and “internal software development group”. Internal software development In section LH 11, “internal software development” is defined as the development of software, as a core R&D activity, that does not have a main purpose of sale, rent, license, hire or lease to two or more people who are not associated with the developer or with each other. Software developed as part of a supporting activity, rather than as a core R&D activity, is not subject to the cap. 61 Examples: definition of internal software development 1. Company B is undertaking R&D to develop software which it will use internally. The cap applies, because Company B is developing the software with no purpose of sale. Company B may not claim credits for more than $2 million of its software development expenditure. 2. Company C is undertaking R&D to develop software which it will sell to Company D, its parent. The cap applies, because Company C is developing the software with a purpose of sale only to an associate. 3. Company E is undertaking R&D to develop software which it will use internally. The board members of Company E have also discussed the possibility of sale of the software to other large companies that are not competitors, to recoup some development costs. The board members have instructed a staff member to investigate the potential market for the software and to ensure that the software is easily customised. The developers have been advised that they need to build some flexibility into the design of the software. The cap applies, because Company E has a purpose of sale of the software, but does not have a main purpose of sale of the software. The purpose of sale is ancillary to the purpose of internal use. 4. Company F is undertaking R&D to develop software which it will sell to utility companies. It has signed contracts with three companies to supply the software and it is actively marketing to other interested parties. One of these companies is Company F’s parent, Company G, which is also a utility company. The other companies are not connected in any way to Company F or to each either. All the contracts are for similar amounts. In this case, the cap is unlikely to apply, since the main purpose of development is sale to multiple non-associates. The sale to an associate is ancillary to the main purpose in this case. Internal software groups (section LH 11) To prevent multiplication of caps through the use of subsidiaries, people who undertake internal software development are required to group themselves with other developers under the same control, and the expenditure of the entire group counts towards a single cap. Each person undertaking internal software development (a “developer”) has an internal software development controller (a “controller”). The controller is the person, or group of people, who have ultimate control over the developer. In simple cases, the developer and the controller might be the same person. The test for control of an entity by a person is that the person has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity to obtain benefits from its activities. The test is based on the definition of “control” in New Zealand International Accounting Standard 27 (Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements), so if two people would be required to consolidate for financial reporting purposes, it is highly likely that they would be under common control. When a person has the same controller as other people, then those people are members of an internal software development group (a “group”). A person is a member for as long as the person’s controller does not change, provided that there is at least one other person with the same controller at the same time. A person can be a member of no group for all or part of the year, one group for all or part of the year, and more than one group over the course of a year. 62 Examples: mechanics of internal software development groups • ACo, BCo and CCo have the same internal software development controller (implying they undertake internal software development) and are therefore members of an internal software development group. ACo stops doing internal software development. Therefore, ACo no longer has an internal software development controller, and ACo is not a member of the group any longer. The group continues to exist, however, with BCo and CCo as members. • DCo, ECo and FCo have the same internal software development controller and are therefore members of an internal software development group. DCo and ECo stop doing internal software development. Therefore, DCo and ECo no longer have an internal software development controller, and are not members of the group any longer. FCo no longer has any other person having the same internal software development controller, so the group ceases to exist. • GCo and HCo both have the same, single shareholder, Carol. GCo undertakes internal software development, and Carol is GCo’s internal software development controller. HCo does not undertake internal software development. HCo begins internal software development. Therefore, GCo and HCo are now the members of an internal software group. • JCo and KCo are the members of an internal software development group, X, controlled by Mrs X. LCo and MCo are the members of another internal software development group, Y, controlled by Mr Y. Mr Y sells LCo and MCo to Mrs X. Group Y ceases to exist, and LCo and MCo become members of Group X. • At the beginning of the year, NCo, OCo and PCo have the same internal software development controller and are therefore in an internal software development group, Z. OCo is sold to a non- associate in the middle of the year. QCo is purchased by PCo in the last quarter of the year. NCo, OCo, PCo and QCo are all members of Z at some time over the course of the year. NCo and PCo are members for the entire year, OCo is a member for the first half of the year and QCo is a member for the last quarter of the year. Allocation of the cap (subsections LH 9(3) to LH 9(14)) When not a member of any group (subsections LH 9(3) and LH 9(4)) For the period a developer is not a member of any internal software development group, the developer will have an eligible amount of internal software development expenditure. The eligible amount of internal software development expenditure for which a credit may be claimed is capped. The cap is $2 million for a full year. If the period for which the person is not a member of any group is less than a year, then the formula in subsection (3) prorates the $2 million on a daily basis. Example: credit for internal software development when not in a group ACo undertakes internal software development. For the first 73 days of the year, ACo is not under common control with any other developer. However, on 13 June 2008, BCo – also a developer – purchases 100 percent of ACo. For the purposes of claiming a credit, ACo is limited to an eligible amount of internal software development expenditure, for the period it was not in any group, of $2 million x 73 ÷ 365 = $400,000. If ACo’s actual eligible amount for the period is $300,000, ACo will be able to claim a credit for $300,000. If ACo’s actual eligible amount for the period is $500,000, ACo will only be able to claim a credit for $400,000. 63 Allocation when a member of a group For the period that a person is a member of an internal software development group, that person is not entitled to any credits for an individual eligible amount relating to internal software development expenditure, but might be entitled to a share of credits for the combined eligible amounts of group members. The entitlement to credits for a share of the combined eligible amounts of group members depends on the nature of the group, but in no case can a group allocate more than $2 million across all its members for a full year. The group members are free to decide the exact allocation, subject to the restrictions described below. An overriding requirement in all cases is that no member may have an eligible amount which is greater than the eligible amount that person would have had, during the period of membership, in the absence of section LH 9. Note that in the special case where a person leaves a group and one person or no-one is left in the group, the group ceases to exist. In that case, the person leaving and the person remaining in the group (if any) will have their entitlement to credits determined on the basis of part-year membership. Members of a group with identical income years (subsections LH 9(5) to LH 9(10)) If all the members of the group have the same income year (same length of year and same balance date), then a member can have an eligible amount allocated to it and claim a credit. The eligible amount available to be allocated to all group members is $2 million for a full year, and this amount is required to be prorated on a daily basis where the period for which the member is in the group is less than a full year. Members of a group with non-identical income years (subsections LH 9(11) to LH 9(14)) If any member, X, of the group has an income year which differs from the income year of another member, then X will only be able to receive an amount of credit if X has been a member of the group for X’s entire income year. It has not been possible to derive a simple and fair formula for when members have different income years and a member is only a member for part of the year. The eligible amount available to be allocated across all group members is $2 million for a full year. 64 Examples: allocation of the cap • ACo and BCo are members of an internal software development group. ACo and BCo have the same (standard) income years, and are members of the group for the entire year. ACo would have an eligible amount of internal software development expenditure of $1.2 million for the year, in the absence of section LH 9. BCo would have an eligible amount of $1.5 million. ACo and BCo may share credits for an eligible amount of $2 million. The allocation may be made as the parties see fit, as long as ACo receives no more than $1.2 million and BCo receives no more than $1.5 million. • CCo and DCo, which have standard income years, are not members of any internal software group, but are under common control. CCo and DCo begin internal software development on 1 July 2008. Therefore, they are the members of an internal software development group from 1 July. The group exists for 274 days of the income year (1 July 2008 to 31 March 2009), and CCo and DCo are members for this entire period. CCo would have an eligible amount of internal software development expenditure of $4 million in the absence of section LH 9. DCo would have an eligible amount of $5 million. CCo and DCo can share credits for an eligible amount of $2 million x 274 ÷ 365 = $1,501,369 (see subsection LH 9(6)). This can be shared in any way. • ECo and FCo are members of an internal software development group. ECo and FCo have the same (standard) income years, and are members of the group for the entire year. ECo would have an eligible amount of internal software development expenditure of $1.2 million for the year, in the absence of section LH 9. FCo would have an eligible amount of $1.5 million. GCo, an internal software developer with a standard income year, is bought by FCo on 1 July 2008, so is a member of the group for 274 days of the year. GCo has an eligible amount of internal software development expenditure of $1 million for the first 91 days of the year, and in the absence of section LH 9 would have an eligible amount over the other 274 days of $3 million. GCo calculates that the group can allocate up to $2 million x 274 ÷ 365 = $1,501,369 to it for the period it is a member (according to subsections LH 9(6) to LH 9(10)). ECo and FCo calculate that the group can allocate up to $2 million to either of them for the full-year period they are members (also according to LH 9(6) to LH 9(10)). Assume GCo has received the full $1,501,369 available for the period it was a member, with ECo and FCo receiving no amount for the period. Then of the $2 million available to the group over the (full-year) period of ECo and FCo’s membership, $498,631 is left for distribution to ECo and FCo. This distribution may be made as the parties see fit. GCo is also entitled to a credit for $2 million x 91 ÷ 365 = $498,630 for the eligible amount relating to its time outside the group. • HCo and ICo are members of an internal software development group. HCo and ICo have the same (standard) income years, and are members of the group for the entire year. HCo would have an eligible amount of internal software development expenditure of $1.2 million for the year, in the absence of section LH 9. ICo would have an eligible amount of $1.5 million. JCo, an internal software developer with an income year ending 31 December 2008, is bought by ICo on 1 July 2008, so is also a member of the group for 184 days of its income year. JCo has an eligible amount of internal software development expenditure of $1 million for the first 181 days of the year and, in the absence of section LH 9, would have an eligible amount over the other 184 days of $2 million. HCo and ICo share credits for an eligible amount of $2 million (according to the formula in subsection LH 9(13) to LH 9(14)). The allocation may be made as the parties see fit, as long as HCo receives no more than $1.2 million and ICo receives no more than $1.5 million. JCo receives no credit for the internal software expenditure incurred while a member of the group, because it is a member for less than its full income year (see subsection LH 9(12)). JCo is, however, entitled to a credit for $2 million x 181 ÷ 365 = $991,780 for the eligible amount relating to its time outside the group (subsection LH 9(3)). • KCo and LCo are members of an internal software development group. KCo has an income year ending 31 March and LCo has an income year ending 30 April. KCo would have an eligible amount of internal software development expenditure of $1.2 million for the year, in the absence of section LH 9. LCo would have an eligible amount of $1.5 million. KCo is liquidated on 30 November 2008, and the group ceases to exist on this date. KCo and LCo are members of the group for only part of their 2008–09 income years and have different income years, so receive no credit relating to internal software development expenditure incurred while members of the group. LCo is entitled to credits for such expenditure incurred after the group dissolves, according to the formula in LH 9(3). 65 Waiver of the cap (LH 9(15)) The $2 million cap is not expected to affect many claimants, but in exceptional cases where expenditure does exceed the cap, the cap may be waived by notice in the New Zealand Gazette. The waiver may be granted on application to the Minister of Finance, if the expenditure meets the other eligibility requirements and the Minister considers that three further requirements are all met. The three requirements are based on similar requirements for obtaining government-provided incentives in Australia and New Zealand, and are: • That the R&D will be exploited mainly for the benefit of the New Zealand economy. In practice, the Minister might look at whether the profits or gains resulting from the exploitation of a particular result of an R&D activity are commensurate with the amount expended in the carrying on of that activity in New Zealand. This would involve consideration of the value of the result of the activity, the profits or gains to non-residents accruing directly from the exploitation of the result of the activity, the amounts expended in the carrying on of the activity inside and outside New Zealand respectively, and any other relevant matters. • That New Zealand will derive a substantial net benefit from the R&D. In practice, the Minister might look at whether the R&D will generate substantial net economic benefits for New Zealand, such as increased gross domestic product, gross national product and employment, or substantial positive publicity (such as defining New Zealand as a world-leader in a particular area). • That the claimant has a commitment to retain the value of their business in New Zealand. In practice, the Minister might look at whether the entity is majority- owned by New Zealand residents, or whether the entity habitually reinvests a high proportion of earnings in its New Zealand operations. Use-of-money interest and penalties (section 141(7C) Tax Administration Act 1994) Use-of-money interest and penalties generally apply to amounts of tax credit as they would apply to other amounts of tax. However, there is an exception to the normal shortfall penalty rules, applying only to internal software development groups. Where the members of an internal software development group reallocate the credits for internal software development undertaken by the group, there will not be a shortfall as long as the reallocations are offsetting. This recognises that group members who file a tax return early might not yet know the internal software development expenditure of other group members. 66 Example: reallocation of credits for internal software development (no shortfall) Company A and Company B, standard balance date companies, are members of an internal software development group from 1 October 2008 to 31 March 2009. The following expenditure is undertaken: • Company A spends $1 million on internal software development in the period from 1 April 2008 to 30 September 2008, and $1 million on internal software development in the period from 1 October 2008 to 31 March 2009. Company A also spends $6 million on other R&D over the year. • Company B spends $0.5 million on internal software development in the period from 1 April 2008 to 30 September 2008, and $1.5 million on internal software development in the period from 1 October 2008 to 31 March 2009. Company B also spends $4 million on other R&D over the year. Company A files its tax return on 1 May 2009, claiming a tax credit for $7,997,260 of R&D expenditure ($1 million of internal software development expenditure before it was part of the group, $997,260 of internal software development expenditure afterwards, and $6 million for other R&D expenditure). This gives a total credit of $1,199,589. Company B files its tax return on 1 July 2009, claiming a tax credit for $4.5 million of R&D (internal software development expenditure of $0.5 million incurred before it was part of the group, and $4 million of other R&D expenditure). This gives a total tax credit of $675,000. Company B would also like to claim for internal software development expenditure incurred while in the group, but is aware that the group’s expenditure cap has been reached. Company B negotiates with Company A. Company A files a notice of proposed adjustment and reduces its claims for tax credits by $90,000. Company B files a notice of proposed adjustment and increases its claim for tax credits by $90,000. The Commissioner makes both adjustments. Because the $90,000 is less than the credits Company A received for internal software development expenditure incurred while in the group, and because Company B is entitled to more than $90,000 of credits for internal development expenditure incurred while in the group, Company A has no tax shortfall. The provision only applies where there is reallocation of credits for internal software development expenditure incurred while in the group. It neither allows reallocation of any credits for expenditure incurred outside the group, nor reallocation of any credits for expenditure which is not on internal software development. The taxpayer who is allocated a greater amount of credits must also have a sufficient eligible amount, relating to internal software development undertaken while in the group, to justify those credits. 67 Penalties 69 OVERVIEW The compliance and penalties rules in the Tax Administration Act 1994 came into effect on 1 April 1997. They were designed to promote effective and fairer enforcement of the Inland Revenue Acts by providing better incentives for taxpayers to comply voluntarily with their tax obligations. The discussion document, Tax penalties, tax agents and disclosures, was released in October 2006. The discussion document examined the current compliance and penalty rules, and identified several areas where the rules could be clearer, more consistent and better targeted to encourage voluntary compliance. It discussed options for the relaxation of penalties when taxpayers have genuinely and consistently tried to do the right thing. The discussion document also proposed that, in future, before recognising a person as a “tax agent” the Commissioner must be satisfied that doing so is consistent with the protection of the integrity of the tax system. The following amendments result from the proposals in the discussion document. 70 THE DEFINITION OF “TAX AGENT” (Clauses 146(1) and (3), 153, 154 and 160(2)) Summary of proposed amendment Inland Revenue will have a discretion to withhold recognition or remove a person as a tax agent when the action is necessary to protect the integrity of the tax system. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of the bill’s enactment. Key features The definition of “tax agent” in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being amended to give Inland Revenue a discretion to withhold recognition or remove a person as a tax agent when the action is necessary to protect the integrity of the tax system. Operational guidelines will set out the circumstances in which the discretion might be exercised. It is envisaged that the discretion not to grant, or to remove, tax agent status will be exercised only in a very small number of cases. Potential factors that might be taken into account, while not necessarily definitive, include: • whether a person has been found guilty of an offence or breach by the disciplinary body of a professional organisation of which they are a member – for example, the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants; • whether the person is an undischarged bankrupt or an insolvent entity; • whether the person is an individual or a body corporate that has been convicted of a crime involving dishonesty (within the meaning of section 2(1) of the Crimes Act 1961) and has been sentenced for that crime within the last seven years; • whether an individual is prohibited from being a director or promoter of, or taken part in the management of a company under sections 382, 383 or 385 of the Companies Act 1993; • whether a person has been convicted of an offence under the Tax Administration Act 1994; and • the tax agent’s compliance history – including both their own tax affairs and their level of compliance as an agent. 71 Inland Revenue will be required to give a tax agent notice of the intention to revoke the agent’s status and give reasons for the intended revocation. The agent will be given a 30-day period (or a shorter period if Inland Revenue is concerned that there is a substantial risk to the revenue) in which to resolve the matters raised in the notice of intended revocation. If the agent does not resolve the matters to the satisfaction of Inland Revenue, the agency status will be revoked and the agent and taxpayers linked to that agent advised accordingly. If, because of a revocation of tax agency status, a taxpayer fails to meet a filing deadline, the legislation will provide an appropriate extension to the deadline so that penalties are not imposed. Entities will be recognised as tax agents along with individuals, provided that the entity supplies Inland Revenue with the names of: • each person responsible for filing returns if the entity is a body corporate; • all shareholders of closely held companies; • all partners if the entity is a partnership; and • all individuals who are members of the entity, if the entity is an unincorporated body. Individual agents currently recognised by Inland Revenue as tax agents will not be required to reapply for their agency status. Entities currently listed will continue to be listed as tax agents provided they supply Inland Revenue with the above information within 12 months of the enactment of the new rules. The information is necessary to enable the Commissioner to be satisfied on an ongoing basis that, given the involvement of these individuals, it is consistent with protection of the integrity of the tax system for the entity to have agency status. Inland Revenue’s secrecy provisions will be amended so that information can be provided to professional bodies (for example, the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) about the removal of any person as an agent. Background Currently, provided an agent meets the limited criteria required, Inland Revenue cannot refuse to register a person as a tax agent even if, for example, that person has a long record of non-compliance in their own tax affairs or those of their clients, or they have been convicted of offences involving serious dishonesty. The amendments will allow Inland Revenue to withhold recognition, or remove a person as a tax agent when the action is necessary to protect the integrity of the tax system. 72 LATE FILING PENALTY (Clause 174) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment clarifies that when an employer monthly schedule is filed late a warning will be given, and that late filing penalties will be imposed on subsequent late filing. Application date The amendment will apply to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2008. Key features The late filing penalty rules will be clarified to reflect the current practice of not imposing a late filing penalty the first time an employer monthly schedule is filed late, but rather advising the taxpayer that the schedule is late and warning that subsequent breaches will be penalised. The late filing penalty will be payable if a schedule is filed late in the 12 months following the first breach. If all schedules are filed on time for a year, the process will start again – that is, if a schedule is late, the taxpayer is warned. Background The current late filing penalty rules generally require Inland Revenue to impose the penalty when an employer monthly schedule is filed late. However, in practice the first time an employer monthly schedule is late Inland Revenue provides the taxpayer with a warning. If the employer is again late in filing the schedule (within 12 months of the first schedule being filed late), the late filing penalty is assessed. The legislation is being clarified to reflect Inland Revenue’s current practice. 73 LATE FILING PENALTIES FOR GST RETURNS (Clauses 175 and 192) Summary of proposed amendment A late filing penalty will be introduced for GST returns that are not filed by the due date. Application date The amendment will apply to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2008. Key features A late filing penalty will be imposed for failing to file a GST return on time. There will be two levels of penalty: if the taxpayer accounts for GST on an invoice basis the late filing penalty will be $250, and for taxpayers who account for GST on a payments basis the penalty will be $50. As is the practice in relation to late filed employer monthly schedules, the first time a GST return is filed late Inland Revenue will advise the taxpayer that the return is late and warn that subsequent breaches will be penalised. The late filing penalty will be payable if any GST returns are filed late in the 12 months following the first breach. If all returns are filed on time for a year, the process will start again – that is, if a subsequent return is late the taxpayer will be warned. Background Currently, when taxpayers fail to file their GST returns Inland Revenue issues a default assessment. A default assessment is an estimation of tax liability and remains in place until the taxpayer files the return. A default assessment is likely to present a slightly larger debt than a self-assessment as it is intended to encourage taxpayers to file their returns. The default assessment is in many cases an excessive response to non-filing. Imposing a late filing penalty would be a more appropriate response, with the default assessment reserved for significant or ongoing non-compliance. 74 LATE PAYMENT PENALTIES (Clause 176) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment specifies that Inland Revenue will notify a taxpayer the first time their payment is late rather than imposing an immediate late payment penalty. If payment is not made by a certain date the penalty will be imposed. Application date The amendment will apply to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2008. Key features Inland Revenue will notify taxpayers the first time their payment is late. The notification will explain that if the payment is not made by a certain date, a late payment penalty will be imposed. The notification will also state that if taxpayers make late payments within the next two years, further leniency will not be granted. Inland Revenue will not send the taxpayer any further notifications for two years, and the initial late payment penalty will be imposed in the normal manner. If the warning does not result in payment, the late payment penalty will be imposed in the normal manner as if the warning had not been given. All taxpayers will start with a clean slate. After 1 April 2008, the first time a taxpayer pays late (irrespective of whether a payment has been paid late in the previous two years) a warning will be given. Background One of the basic obligations of taxpayers is to pay their taxes on time. To encourage taxpayers to do this, those who pay late face late payment penalties. The late payment penalty is imposed in two stages: the initial late payment penalty and the incremental late payment penalty. The initial late payment penalty is also applied in two steps: a 1 percent penalty imposed the day after the due date and a 4 percent penalty imposed at the end of the sixth day if the tax owing remains outstanding. An incremental late payment penalty of 1 percent is imposed each month the tax remains outstanding. The amendment will ensure that those taxpayers who are usually compliant, but have inadvertently missed a payment, do not have late payment penalties imposed on them. In these cases, the penalty can be disproportionately high compared with the severity of the breach. The effect of the amendment will therefore be to give consideration to the taxpayer’s previous record of compliance before imposing the late payment penalty. 75 ASSOCIATED PERSONS (Clauses 182(1), (2), (3) and (5)) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment will enable Inland Revenue to treat return periods that overlap as the same return period for associated persons, allowing a tax refund to be used to reduce an associated person’s tax shortfall. Application date The amendment will apply to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2008. Key features Under the proposed changes, Inland Revenue will be able to treat return periods that overlap as the same return period for associated persons, allowing a tax refund to be used to reduce an associated person’s tax shortfall. This discretion will not apply when the tax shortfall arises as the result of an abusive tax position or evasion – for example, when a taxpayer deliberately claims an input tax credit in the wrong entity to claim the refund early. The proposed provision will also apply when the adjustment results in less tax to pay for the second taxpayer. Background Occasionally, taxpayers include transactions in the wrong entity’s return – for example, in an associated person’s return. Because they do not know they have included the transaction in the wrong return, the tax shortfall does not show up when a reconciliation is undertaken. These shortfalls are often not voluntarily disclosed because the taxpayer is unaware they have occurred and the shortfall cannot be considered “temporary”. Currently, if there is a tax shortfall in one taxpayer’s return and, as a result an associated taxpayer’s return is adjusted, resulting in an entitlement to a refund or an increased refund, the refund may be used to reduce the tax shortfall of the associated taxpayer. The returns must, however, be for the same tax type and return period. Problems arise when the return periods are not the same – for example, when one associated taxpayer files the GST return on odd months and the other associated taxpayer files on even months. Because the return periods are not the same, the refund cannot be used to reduce the tax shortfall. The amendment will allow periods that overlap to be treated as the same return period for an associated taxpayer. 76 The current provision also applies only when adjustment results in a refund or an increased refund for the second taxpayer. The proposed provision will also apply where the adjustment results in less tax to pay for the second taxpayer. 77 TAX AGENTS AND THE SHORTFALL PENALTY FOR NOT TAKING REASONABLE CARE (Clause 183) Summary of proposed amendment The legislation will prescribe the circumstances in which a shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care can be imposed when taxpayers have used a tax agent. Application date The amendment will apply to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2008. Key features The legislation will prescribe the circumstances in which a shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care can be imposed when taxpayers have used a tax agent. The circumstances include: • failing to provide adequate information to the agent; • failing to provide adequate instructions to the agent; • unreasonably relying on an agent or advisor; and • having had a previous tax shortfall penalty imposed for the same error or action. Background Taxpayers who have relied on the advice of a tax agent will usually be considered to have exercised reasonable care. This principle is not set out in the legislation but has developed over time through practice. The current practice is that taxpayers who use an agent may still be exposed to a penalty for not taking reasonable care if they: • fail to provide adequate information when seeking advice; • fail to provide reasonable instructions to a tax agent; or • unreasonably rely on a tax advisor or on advice that they have reason to believe is not correct. Outside these exceptions, the shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care is generally not assessed if the taxpayer has used a tax agent. This does not apply to the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty, which is assessed if the tax position taken does not meet the standard of “being about as likely as not to be correct” and the tax shortfall is greater than the prescribed thresholds. In this case, the penalty may be assessed, irrespective of whether an agent is used. 78 In this bill the scope of the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty will be reduced. This highlights the need to clarify the scope of the penalty for not taking reasonable care. The standard of “reasonable care” is not excessive and does not require perfection. However, many taxpayers use an agent because agents have more knowledge about the requirements of the tax system. There needs to be a better balance, however, between recognising that tax agents are not infallible, while providing a greater incentive for them to, as far as possible, determine the taxpayer’s correct tax position. Accordingly, the legislation will prescribe the circumstances in which a shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care can be imposed when taxpayers have used a tax agent. As well as incorporating current practice, the amendment will take into account the situation of the taxpayer having had a tax shortfall previously and the same error or action being repeated in relation to the same tax type. In this situation the taxpayer should have been aware that there was a known risk associated with a particular action. Depending on the facts, a reasonable person in the taxpayer’s circumstances would check that the correct tax position had been taken in the second instance. 79 REFINING THE SCOPE OF THE UNACCEPTABLE TAX POSITION SHORTFALL PENALTY (Clauses 184(2), (3) and 191) Summary of proposed amendments The amendments will remove GST and withholding-type taxes from the scope of the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty. The thresholds for the assessment of the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty will be increased. Application date The amendments will apply to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2008. Key features The discretion allowing Inland Revenue to cancel or not impose the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty in some situations will be repealed and replaced with other measures that will refine the scope of the penalty. GST and withholding-type taxes will be removed from the scope of the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty so that the penalty will apply only to tax positions relating to income tax. For other types of tax, the shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care will apply in appropriate cases. The thresholds above which the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty is assessed will be increased. Under the proposed changes, the penalty will apply when the tax shortfall arising from the taxpayer’s tax position is more than both: (a) $50,000; and (b) 1 percent of the taxpayer’s total tax figure for the relevant return period. As well as increasing the minimum threshold to $50,000 (from $20,000), the amendments will remove the upper threshold of $250,000, thus significantly further increasing the thresholds. Removing the $250,000 limit ensures that the penalty does not apply to what may be regarded as everyday transactions for some large corporates. Background An unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty of 20 percent of the shortfall is assessed if, viewed objectively, a taxpayer’s tax position fails to meet the standard of being “about as likely as not to be correct”. The penalty is applied only in cases where the tax shortfall is significant – which is currently a tax shortfall of more than $20,000 and the lesser of either 1 percent of the total tax figure or $250,000. The penalty does not apply to tax shortfalls that arise from mistakes in the calculation or recording of numbers in a return. 80 Under the current rules, taxpayers who make and acknowledge errors in taking a particular tax position cannot be regarded as having met the standard of being “about as likely as not to be correct”. If the standard is not met, unacceptable tax position shortfall penalties may apply. The legislation has had an adverse effect on taxpayer behaviour by making them less inclined to disclose errors to Inland Revenue. To counter this problem, a recent amendment, section 141KB, provides Inland Revenue with the discretion either to cancel or not impose the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty if: • the tax position taken is the result of a clear mistake or simple oversight; • the shortfall arising from the tax position is or would be subject to a reduced penalty because the shortfall was voluntarily disclosed before notification of a pending tax audit or investigation, or is a temporary shortfall; and • it is appropriate that the taxpayer not be liable to pay an unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty in relation to the tax position taken. Section 141KB applied retrospectively from 1 April 2003. When introduced, the discretion was signalled as a short-term solution only because: • it gives rise to significant increases in administrative and compliance costs; • it does not fit well with the self-assessment environment; and • using the words “clear mistake and simple oversight” in the penalties context is inherently uncertain and could create a revenue risk if the term became more broadly interpreted over time. The amendments in this bill will result in the penalty being refocused by being limited to income tax only with higher thresholds applying. This will provide incentives for greater voluntary compliance. The bill consequently also repeals section 141KB. 81 ABUSIVE TAX POSITION SHORTFALL PENALTY THRESHOLD (Clause 185) Summary of proposed amendment The threshold for imposing the abusive tax position shortfall penalty will be repealed. Application date The amendment will apply to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2008. Key features The current $20,000 threshold for the imposition of the shortfall penalty for having an abusive tax position will be repealed. Background An abusive tax position shortfall penalty of 100 percent of the tax shortfall applies when the tax position taken is an unacceptable tax position that has a dominant purpose of reducing or removing a tax liability or giving tax benefits. Currently, for an abusive tax position shortfall penalty to be imposed the tax shortfall must be greater than $20,000. Although an abusive tax position is an unacceptable tax position, it is also at the more aggressive end of the non-compliance scale. While it is appropriate that the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty has a threshold, as it would be overly onerous to apply the standard to all tax positions, this does not hold true for abusive tax positions. 82 LATE PAYMENT OF PAYE (Clauses 186, 187 and 194) Summary of proposed amendment A new graduated penalty to replace the current shortfall penalty in relation to PAYE will apply when an employer has filed an employer monthly schedule but not paid the PAYE. Inland Revenue will contact the employer and, if payment or an arrangement for payment is not made, a 20 percent penalty will be imposed. This will be reduced to 10 percent if the employer pays the outstanding PAYE within one month of the penalty being imposed. If the payment is not made, the process will repeat itself – that is, another 20 percent penalty will be imposed, which will reduce to 10 percent if payment is made within 30 days. The penalty will not exceed in total any penalty that could be charged under the shortfall penalty rules. Application date The amendment will apply to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2008. Key features A new penalty will be introduced to replace the current shortfall penalty in relation to PAYE. The new rules will better reflect the degree of seriousness shown by employers in meeting their PAYE obligations, while adopting a more graduated approach will provide better incentives for taxpayers to correct any non-compliance. Shortfall penalties for evasion will not be imposed if the employer files the employer monthly schedule but does not pay the PAYE. Instead, Inland Revenue will contact the employer to establish the reason for the non-payment and offer to assist the employer to establish or enhance its systems to ensure future compliance. The legislation will require that Inland Revenue warn the employer that a 20 percent PAYE shortfall penalty will be imposed if payment, or an arrangement for payment, is not made by the date specified. If the employer does not make the payment or enter an instalment arrangement, the employer will receive instruction requesting payment within 30 days. On the expiry of 30 days, the PAYE shortfall penalty of 20 percent of the unpaid PAYE will be imposed. If the PAYE is paid within the 30 days specified, the penalty will be reduced to 10 percent. If the payment is not made, the process will repeat itself – that is, another 20 percent penalty will be imposed, which will reduce to 10 percent if payment is made within 30 days. The penalty will not exceed in total any penalty that could be charged under the shortfall penalty rules. 83 This proposal is aimed at encouraging employers to pay the outstanding PAYE. Compliance includes entering into an instalment arrangement. If the employer enters an instalment arrangement the new penalty will not apply unless the employer defaults on an instalment arrangement. In this case, the penalty will be imposed at 20 percent, with no reduction to 10 percent. The normal late payment penalties, use-of-money interest and ability to prosecute will continue to operate as they do at present. Background One of the basic tax obligations of employers is to withhold PAYE tax on behalf of their employees and pay the PAYE to Inland Revenue by specific dates. If the employer fails to pay Inland Revenue on time, penalties will apply. Non-payment of PAYE may be regarded more seriously than failure to pay other taxes, as PAYE places a special responsibility on the employer to make payment on behalf of the employee. The current penalties that apply in relation to PAYE obligations include late filing penalties, late payment penalties, shortfall penalties for evasion and prosecution. When considering non-compliance in relation to PAYE obligations there are a number of possible scenarios, including: • employers who have some or all of their employees outside the PAYE system; • employers who pay the PAYE to Inland Revenue but do not file the employer monthly schedule; and • employers who file the employer monthly schedule but do not pay the PAYE to Inland Revenue. In relation to the first scenario, the current penalty rules should continue to apply. In the second scenario, penalties are limited because the tax is paid. In the third situation, when the employer files the schedule but does not pay the PAYE, the current rules give rise to a number of concerns: • Distortionary outcomes in different situations: A taxpayer with a good record of tax compliance incurs the same (or a higher) level of penalty as a taxpayer with a record of non-compliance. An employer who fails to file an employer monthly schedule could be eligible for a 75 percent reduction for voluntary disclosure, while an employer who files an employer monthly schedule, but no payment, is not eligible for any voluntary disclosure penalty reduction as disclosure has already occurred. This is effectively providing a disincentive for employers to file. • A lack of opportunity for taxpayers to correct non-compliance: The shortfall penalty for evasion can be imposed the day after PAYE has not been paid to Inland Revenue, leaving taxpayers with little opportunity to address non- payment. 84 • A perception that the current rules may be harsh: In theory, taxpayers could incur shortfall penalties for evasion (150 percent of the unpaid PAYE) plus the initial late payment penalties, even if payments are made only a few days late. The amendment is aimed at encouraging employers to pay any outstanding PAYE by providing better incentives to comply. 85 PENALTY REDUCTIONS FOR VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURES (Clauses 188 and 190) Summary of proposed amendment The shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care or taking an unacceptable tax position will not be imposed when a tax shortfall is voluntarily disclosed before notification of a pending tax audit or investigation. Application date The amendment, once enacted, will apply from the date the bill was introduced. Key features To increase the incentive for taxpayers to comply voluntarily, shortfall penalties payable for “not taking reasonable care” and “unacceptable tax positions” will not be imposed when the shortfalls are voluntarily disclosed before taxpayers are notified of pending tax audits or investigations. Background Currently, shortfall penalties may be reduced if taxpayers voluntarily disclose tax shortfalls. Penalties are reduced by: • 75 percent if the disclosure is made before the taxpayer is notified of a pending tax audit or investigation; or • 40 percent if the disclosure is made after the taxpayer is notified of the pending tax audit or investigation but before the audit or investigation starts. The penalty reduction reflects the lower administrative cost of having the tax shortfall identified before resources are committed to an investigation. It also recognises the taxpayer’s intention to comply and co-operate with Inland Revenue. However, the current rules do not adequately encourage taxpayers to disclose a tax shortfall. Imposing shortfall penalties in cases when taxpayers voluntarily disclose tax shortfalls, even though the penalties are reduced, reduces the incentive for taxpayers to make voluntary disclosures. This is because taxpayers know that a consequence of making a voluntary disclosure is the assessment of shortfall penalties. The amendment will encourage taxpayers to come forward and tell Inland Revenue when they discover they have a tax shortfall. 86 The bill incorporates two changes as the result of submissions received on the 2006 discussion document, Tax penalties, tax agents and disclosures. First, the proposal as set out in the discussion document required that the tax shortfall be disclosed within two years of the tax position being taken. Submissions noted that the time bar provisions provide a window of four years in which to make a disclosure. A two-year limit on the non-application of shortfall penalties would mean that taxpayers may decide not to disclose errors and omissions outside of the two-year period, even when they arose from the same issue as that in the two-year time span. By removing the two-year period from the proposal, the incentive for taxpayers to voluntarily disclose tax shortfalls is increased. Secondly, submissions also recommended that the voluntary disclosure proposal should apply as soon as possible. Submissions were concerned that some taxpayers may refrain from making voluntary disclosures until the legislation is enacted. The proposal once enacted will therefore apply to voluntary disclosures made after the day the bill was introduced. 87 TEMPORARY SHORTFALLS (Clause 189) Summary of proposed amendment For temporary shortfalls to which a 75 percent reduction in the shortfall penalty applies, the legislation will clarify that a tax shortfall has been permanently reversed or corrected if it appears from the taxpayer’s actions or through operation of law that the shortfall will be remedied. For a shortfall to be considered temporary it must be permanently reversed or corrected within two years of the tax position being taken. Application date The amendment will apply to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2008. Key features The legislation will be clarified, in line with current practice, to ensure that the reduction for a temporary shortfall applies, even though the opportunity has not yet arisen to deal with it in a subsequent return, if: • it appears from the taxpayer’s actions that steps taken will remedy the tax shortfall; or • through operation of law or circumstances, the matter will reverse itself. The amendment will require the temporary shortfall to be permanently reversed or corrected within two years of the tax position being taken. Background A shortfall penalty is reduced by 75 percent if the tax shortfall is temporary. The legislation sets out what is meant by “temporary”. When the compliance and penalty rules were first introduced, there was considerable criticism relating to the imposition of shortfall penalties in cases where there had been little or no fiscal risk. This problem was particularly obvious when a GST refund check was made by Inland Revenue and a timing difference was detected. The rules reducing the penalty for temporary shortfalls require the taxpayer to permanently reverse or correct the situation in a subsequent tax-return period. However, in some cases, there is little or no opportunity for this to occur. 88 Inland Revenue’s Standard Practice Statement INV-231, released in May 1998, dealt with this concern. The legislation requires that the temporary shortfall is: ... permanently reversed or corrected before the taxpayer is first notified of a pending tax audit or investigation. The Standard Practice Statement states that ... the Commissioner will accept that a tax shortfall has been permanently reversed or corrected if: • it appears from the taxpayer’s actions that steps taken will remedy the tax shortfall; or • through operation of law or circumstances, the matter will reverse itself. The legislation is being clarified to reflect Inland Revenue’s current practice. 89 TAX COMPLIANCE INITIATIVES (Clause 195) Summary of proposed amendment Inland Revenue will be given the power to offer limited amnesties to specific industries where tax evasion is a significant concern. Application date The amendment will apply from the date the bill is enacted. Key features Under the proposed rules, an affected person will have to pay tax on previously undisclosed income from the specific industry for two years (covering the current filing year and the year before that). Inland Revenue will be able to offer a limited amnesty to a specific targeted industry or activity. The terms of the offer will specify the taxes that are included in the amnesty and a period in which the tax evader can come forward under the amnesty. It will also be clearly communicated that after the amnesty offer expires, investigations and audits of the affected industry will begin. The amnesty will apply to those who have undisclosed income earned from the targeted industry. The overall determination of the person’s liability for the period being assessed will include use-of-money interest and shortfall penalties. The shortfall penalties will be reduced by 75 percent for voluntary disclosure and 50 percent for previous good compliance if appropriate. The amnesty will apply only to income from the specific industry. If an affected taxpayer discloses income from another source the two-year limit will not apply to that other income. The assessment of this income will also include use-of-money interest and shortfall penalties. If the income is not disclosed and the taxpayer is investigated, the full rate of the shortfall penalty may apply. Any consequential effects of disclosing income for family assistance, student loans and child support liabilities will also be included in the assessment. Having qualified for one amnesty, a taxpayer will not be able to then qualify under another amnesty. This is because the objective of the amnesty is to give affected taxpayers a single opportunity to come forward and start to comply. To provide some assurance when coming forward under an amnesty, the amendment provides that an affected taxpayer coming forward under an amnesty will not be prosecuted. 90 Background The discussion document, Options for dealing with industry-wide tax evasion, was released in August 2004. The discussion document noted that New Zealand’s tax laws contain severe penalties for evasion. This can make it difficult for people who have failed to meet their tax obligations in the past and who want to comply with the law to come forward and sort out their tax affairs. The document also noted that existing rules do not deal with the problem of industry-wide tax evasion because the rules are designed to apply to individual businesses. This fails to recognise that a different approach to promoting compliance is required when evasion becomes commonplace within an industry. The discussion document recommended that Inland Revenue be given the power to offer limited amnesties to specific industries in which tax evasion is a significant problem. Following the amnesty, the affected industry would be subject to increased audit, and any tax shortfalls detected would face the full range of penalties and other sanctions provided in the legislation. 91 Other policy matters 93 TAX EXEMPTION FOR TOKELAU AND NIUE INTERNATIONAL TRUST FUNDS (Clauses 22, 135, 244, 254 to 255 and 258) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments to the Income Tax Act 1994, the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 are being made to ensure that the contributions received, income earned and distributions made by the Tokelau and Niue International Trust Funds are exempt from taxation. Application date The amendments will apply to the Tokelau and Niue International Trust Funds from the start of the tax year in which contributions were first made to the funds – the 1999–2000 tax year for the Tokelau International Trust Fund and the 2003–2004 tax year for the Niue International Trust Fund. Key features Sections CB 4(1) and CB 9(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 will be amended and new sections CW 49B and CW 49C of the Income Tax Act 2004 will be added to ensure that income earned by the Tokelau International Trust Fund or the Niue International Trust Fund is exempt from income tax, and distributions made from the Tokelau International Trust Fund or the Niue International Trust Fund are not subject to taxation. Section 73(2) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 will be amended to ensure that contributions made to the Tokelau International Trust Fund or the Niue International Trust Fund are not subject to gift duty. Background The Tokelau and Niue International Trust Funds were established by the New Zealand Government in 2000 and 2004 respectively and trust deeds for the Trust Funds were subsequently executed, with the parties to the trust deeds agreeing to ensure that the Trust Funds would be exempt from all direct taxation. Existing tax provisions did not appear to provide the certainty needed to ensure that the income earned, distributions made or contributions received by the Tokelau and Niue International Trust Funds were exempt from tax. The amendments therefore ensure that the contributions received, income earned and distributions made by the Tokelau and Niue International Trust Funds are exempt from taxation, and that such legislative amendments apply from the date that the Tokelau and Niue International Trust Funds were established. 94 REWRITE ADVISORY PANEL – RETROSPECTIVE AMENDMENTS TO INCOME TAX ACT 2004 Major land developments (Clauses 6 to 8) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment ensures that the rule in section CB 11 will not apply to sales of land made after commencement of the Act if the landowner uses the land for the purposes of and use in their own commercial undertakings, including rental income. However, these exclusions will not generally apply if the landowner is a land developer. Application date The changes are intended to ensure that the tax treatment outlined above extends back to open tax years if a person has taken a tax position consistent with the policy intent of the amendment. Background Section CB 11 has been the subject of a number of submissions to the Rewrite Advisory Panel. These submissions asserted that the drafting of the provision contains an unintended change in law. While the Panel did not agree the provisions contained an unintended change in law, it considered that that the rule contained uncertainty about whether the provision applies to developments undertaken by a landowner for the purposes of and use in their own commercial undertakings. Petroleum mining operations (Clauses 16, 17 and 135(36)) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment ensures that the petroleum mining provisions continue to apply to a petroleum miner who undertakes prospecting and exploration activities outside New Zealand. Application date The amendment will apply from the beginning of the 2005–06 income year, being the income year the Income Tax Act 2004 came into effect. 95 Background The Rewrite Advisory Panel has identified that the 2004 Act, as originally enacted, contains an unintended change in legislative outcome when compared with corresponding provisions in the Income Tax Act 1994. The change identified is that the petroleum mining provisions do not apply to prospecting and exploration activities undertaken outside New Zealand by a petroleum miner. The provisions affected are those that rely on the meaning of the defined term “petroleum mining operations”, which include sections CT 5, DT 15 (DK 2 – 1994 Act), DT 20, DZ 4 (seal and abandonment – 1994 Act), DZ 5, DZ 7, EJ 16, EZ 3(2), GC 12(3), IH 3(2), OB 1 – definition of “removal or restoration operations”, and OB 1 – definition of “seal and abandonment.” Employment obligations transferred on sale of a business (Clause 28) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment to section DC 9 ensures that, on the transfer of a business with continuing employees, the purchaser is allowed a deduction for satisfying transferred employment obligations to the extent that the amount paid in satisfying the obligations exceeds the valuation of the obligations in the transfer (sale and purchase) agreement. Application date The amendment applies from the beginning of the 2005–06 income year, being the income year the Income Tax Act 2004 came into effect. Background The Rewrite Advisory Panel has identified that the 2004 Act, as originally enacted, contains an unintended change in legislative outcome when compared with corresponding provisions in the Income Tax Act 1994. The change identified is that a purchaser of a business would not have a deduction for the payment of a contingent liability, transferred as part of the sale and purchase agreement when a business was sold, if that payment is more than the amount provided for that liability in the sale. As the previous employer had incurred the obligation to meet those employment obligations, the purchaser’s payments to satisfy these obligations’ nature were regarded as part of the price of acquiring the business and so were payments of capital (Commissioner of Inland Revenue v New Zealand Forest Research Institute Limited (2000) 19 NZTC 15,689). The amendment restores the effect of section DF 10(5) of the 1994 Act. 96 Correction of cross-references (Clauses 84 and 247) The Rewrite Advisory Panel has also noted cross-references should be corrected in section IG 2(9) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section 10(7) of the GST Act. 97 IMPLEMENTING THE FAIR DIVIDEND RATE IN LIFE INSURANCE (Clauses 2, 4, 77, 78 and 135) Summary of proposed amendment The fair dividend rate (FDR) treatment of all portfolio shares with interests of less than 10 percent in non-resident companies other than Australian-listed companies will be extended to a life insurer’s policyholder base tax calculation. The change is intended to correct an anomaly arising from implementing FDR for life insurers. Application date The amendment will apply from as early as 1 April 2007, with some elections available to life insurers on the effective date. Key features The policyholder income calculation in section EY 42 (1) will be amended by amounts referred to in subsection (5B) as the “FDR adjustment” and the “PIE adjustment”. The PIE adjustment applies only to unit-linked life policies that have elected to be portfolio investment entities and incorporates the FDR adjustment within the formula. The FDR adjustment applies to all other life insurance products. New section EY 42C (1) to (6) prescribes the “PIE adjustment” for assets held in a portfolio investment-linked life fund, defined in section OB 1 to mean a fund where investments are held subject to a life policy under which benefits are directly linked to the value of investments held in the fund. The portfolio investment-linked life fund must also be eligible to be, and elect to be, and has not ceased the election to be, a portfolio investment entity. The PIE adjustment is contained in a formula in new section EY 42C (2). The part of the formula relevant for the FDR adjustment is: 0.9 x (FIF accounting income or loss – FDR income) “FIF accounting income or loss” is defined in subsection (4) as the positive income or negative loss on FIF property for the income year calculated under accepted accounting practice. The accounting income or loss must materially be the same amount as foreign investment fund income if not for the replacement of the FIF rules by the FDR method (in other words, the amount calculated under the comparative value method). The formula thus excludes the after-tax amount of the actual returns on the property as recorded in the life insurer’s financial statements, which should be the same amount excluded by life insurers in calculating the FDR return for their life office base income. 98 “FDR income” is defined in subsection (5) and refers to the amount of fair dividend rate income on that property. It will be the same amount that was calculated in the life insurer’s life office base income calculation. The net amount is adjusted by a factor of 0.9 which reflects the typical amount of income included in policyholder base income with these products. The “PIE adjustment formula” also contains an amount of 0.9 of “excluded shares”. This refers to exclusion of realised and unrealised Australasian capital gains, which are discussed separately in the item Inclusion of life insurance in portfolio investment entity rules. New section EY 42B describes the “FDR adjustment” for life insurance savings products other than for those in portfolio investment-linked funds which have elected to be portfolio investment entities. These include traditional participating life insurance savings products such as whole of life and endowment policies, and also investment-linked products which the life insurer has not elected to be portfolio investment-linked products. The FDR adjustment for FDR income on FIF property is the same as that used in the PIE adjustment formula except that there is an adjustment factor of 0.4 of the net amount. This is an estimated average of the income that is included from these products in the annual policyholder base calculation and is used to minimise compliance costs. The PIE adjustments and FDR adjustments will be effective from: • the beginning of the 2008–09 income year; or • on 1 October 2007, if an election by the life insurer to do so is received by the Commissioner before 1 April 2008; or • the first income year beginning on or after 1 April 2007 if an election by the life insurer to do so is received by the Commissioner before 1 April 2008. Background In 2006, Parliament enacted major changes to the taxation of offshore portfolio equity. As a result, all portfolio shares with interests of less than 10 percent in non- resident companies other than Australian-listed companies will be taxed on a deemed fair dividend rate (FDR) of 5 percent instead of actual returns (dividends, plus realised gains in the case of revenue account holders). The fair dividend rate is effective from the beginning of the first income year beginning after 31 March 2007. However, entities electing to become PIEs have the option of making the fair dividend rate apply from 1 October 2007, regardless of their income year. Under the current life insurance tax rules, a life insurer effectively annually pays tax on the higher of the life office base and the policyholder base. Tax on the life office base is determined under the normal tax rules, which takes into account the fair dividend rate on the relevant equities. However, tax on the policyholder base is calculated on actual returns (through movements in reserves) of these equities, and not at the fair dividend rate. The policyholder base tax calculation therefore requires a change so that the appropriate amount of tax based on the fair dividend rate will result in both bases. 99 INCLUSION OF LIFE INSURANCE IN PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT ENTITY RULES (Clauses 2, 4, 77, 78, 81, 82, 83 and 135) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment allows life insurers to elect to have New Zealand and Australian- listed equity gains from investment-linked insurance products excluded from tax. The change is intended to allow policyholders with unit-linked life insurance products to access some of the benefits of the new portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 October 2007. Key features Life insurers will be able to elect to have realised New Zealand and Australian-listed equity gains from investment-linked life insurance products excluded from both the life office base and policyholder base calculations of tax. New section HL 3(5B) prescribes the eligibility requirements for life insurers who can elect to be subject to the new rules. The life insurer must first meet the eligibility requirements to be a portfolio investment entity. The gains exclusion is then only available for assets held by a “portfolio investment-linked life fund”. This is defined in section OB 1 as a fund where investments are held subject to a life policy under which benefits are directly linked to the value of investments held in the fund. The portfolio investment-linked life fund must also be eligible to be, and elect to be, and has not ceased the election to be, a portfolio investment entity. In these circumstances, realised New Zealand and Australian-listed equity gains for these life saving products which are excluded from the calculation of the life insurer’s life office base under section CX 44C are also excluded from the policyholder base income calculation. This is achieved under amended section EY 42C by exclusion of the “PIE adjustment”. The PIE adjustment outlined in new section 42(C) (1) to (5) and (6) excludes from the calculation of policyholder income 0.9 of, amongst other things, “excluded shares”. These are defined in subsection (6) as realised gains or losses of New Zealand and listed Australian equities that were excluded from the calculation of tax under the life office base, in addition to unrealised gains or losses on those equities that would qualify for the exemption if sold during the year. The 0.9 adjustment factor recognises the approximate average amount of income that is included in the policyholder base income for these types of products. 100 Life insurers who elect into the new rules will have a deemed disposal of the excluded shares, with any tax to pay spread over a period of three years from the date of election. Other consequential amendments for these funds are contained in sections HL 8(1) and HL 11(2B), and to the definitions in section OB 1 for “investor”, “portfolio investment entity”, “portfolio listed company” and “portfolio tax rate entity”. Background Life insurers pay tax at 33 percent on investment income in unit-linked life insurance products. The investment return to policyholders is determined by the rise (or fall) in their investment units, reflecting the after-tax performance in the underlying investment assets. Tax not paid on realised Australasian equity gains leads to a commensurate increase in the value of units and therefore an increase in savings. Under current life insurance tax rules, a life insurer is subject to tax on its life office base and the policyholder base, with tax paid on the life office base being able to be credited towards the tax liability on the policyholder base. Investment income on the life office base is calculated under tax principles applicable to other taxpayers, whereas special rules apply to the calculation of policyholder base income. Realised New Zealand and Australasian-listed equity gains therefore have to be excluded from both the life office base tax calculation as well as the amount included in the policyholder base. Further, as the policyholder base income also includes unrealised equity gains or losses, these amounts will also need to be excluded from the policyholder base tax calculation. 101 GREATER TAX INCENTIVES FOR CHARITABLE DONATIONS (Clauses 27, 33 and 85) Summary of proposed amendments The bill introduces changes that will enhance the current tax incentives for donations of money made by individuals, companies and Māori authorities. The changes are aimed at facilitating greater giving to donee organisations and encouraging a culture of generosity in New Zealand. 6 Enhancements include removing the current rebate threshold on donations made by individuals, removing the deduction limit on charitable donations made by companies and Māori authorities, and extending the company deduction for charitable donations to include unlisted companies with five or fewer shareholders. The changes result from options canvassed in the government’s October 2006 discussion document, Tax incentives for giving to charities and other non-profit organisations. The discussion document was issued as part of the government’s commitment to its Confidence and Supply Agreement with United Future, to develop a new tax rebate regime for charities during the current term of Parliament. Application date The changes will apply from the 2008–09 income year. Key features The Income Tax Act 2004 is being amended as follows: • The individuals’ rebate threshold limit for charitable donations will be removed (section KC 5). The current limit is $1,890. • The company deduction limit for charitable donations will be removed (section DB 32). The current limit is 5 percent of the net income of the company before taking into account the donation deduction. • The company deduction for charitable donations will be extended to close companies (companies with five or fewer shareholders) not listed on a recognised stock exchange (section DB 32). Unlisted close companies are currently not eligible for the company deduction. • The Māori authority deduction limit will be removed (section DV 11). The current limit is 5 percent of the net income of the Māori authority before taking into account the donation deduction. 6 A donee organisation is an entity or trust whose activities are not carried out for the private pecuniary profit of any individual and whose funds are applied principally for charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes in New Zealand. Some of the major donee organisations include churches and social service organisations. 102 In general, removing these limits will mean that the total of all donations made in a tax year for which tax relief is available will be limited only by the amount of the donor’s net income. Background Under current law, individuals are entitled to a tax rebate at a set 33⅓ cents in the dollar up to a maximum of $1,890 for cash donations made to donee organisations. Companies and Māori authorities are entitled to a deduction for cash donations made to donee organisations but the deduction cannot exceed 5 percent of their net income before taking into account the donation deduction. Close companies that are not listed on a recognised stock exchange are not eligible for tax relief for their donations. The policy approach for developing tax incentives for promoting charitable giving in New Zealand has been to make small incremental enhancements to the existing tax incentives for charitable donations, while maintaining a cap on eligible donations and limits on overall eligibility. The most recent changes occurred in 2002. As part of the government’s Confidence and Supply Agreement with United Future, the government released the October 2006 discussion document, Tax incentives for giving to charities and other non-profit organisations. The discussion document took a wider, more comprehensive and radical approach to the whole area of tax incentives for promoting charitable giving. The options canvassed in the discussion document included: • enhancements to the current tax incentives for donations made by individuals, companies and Māori authorities; • a rebate or grant that recognises the time and skills provided by volunteers to charities and other non-profit organisations; • clarifying and streamlining the tax obligations of volunteers in receipt of reimbursement payments and honoraria recipients; and • tax incentives offered by other countries, such as the United Kingdom’s gift aid scheme, payroll giving, deductibility of non-monetary donations, and Australia’s specialised charitable trust rules. The discussion document also sought people’s views on what further initiatives could be employed to encourage increased generosity and to support any tax measures that could arise out of the discussion document. To support the discussion document, a series of consultation workshops were held and 300 people attended these workshops. A total of 229 written submissions were received from a wide range of people and organisations. Feedback from consultation strongly supported most of the options put forward in the discussion document. 103 CHARITABLE DONEE STATUS (Clause 85) Summary of proposed amendments The Hamlin Charitable Fistula Hospitals Trust, the Hope Foundation Development Trust, the Hope International Charitable Trust, the Limbs 4 All Charitable Trust, the New Zealand Disaster Assistance Response Team Trust, the Operation Restore Hope Charitable Trust and The World Swim for Malaria Foundation (New Zealand) are to be given charitable donee status. This will enable donors to these organisations to obtain tax relief on their donations. Application date The amendments will apply from the 2007–08 tax year. Key features The following organisations are being added to section KC 5(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004, which lists the organisations that qualify for charitable donee status: • Hamlin Charitable Fistula Hospitals Trust; • Hope Foundation Development Trust; • Hope International Charitable Trust; • Limbs 4 All Charitable Trust; • New Zealand Disaster Assistance Response Team Trust; • Operation Restore Hope Charitable Trust; and • The World Swim for Malaria Foundation (New Zealand). Background The current rules for a rebate or deduction are: • Donations to qualifying organisations entitle individual taxpayers to a rebate of 33⅓ percent of the amount donated, to a maximum of $630 a year. • Donations by non-closely held companies, and closely held companies which are listed on a recognised stock exchange, qualify for a deduction to a maximum of 5 percent of their net income. • A Māori authority may also claim a deduction from its net income. The maximum deduction for a Māori authority is 5 percent of its net income donated to charitable organisations or a body that has been defined as a Māori association under the Māori Community Development Act 1962. 104 Hamlin Charitable Fistula Hospitals Trust This organisation’s activities focus on the treatment and prevention of obstetric fistulae. Treatment of obstetric fistulae is carried out in the Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital in Ethiopia. Hope Foundation Development Trust This organisation provides education, medical and humanitarian aid to children in developing countries who have been affected by poverty, HIV/AIDS or abuse. It also assists young adults affected in this way with university education. Hope International Charitable Trust The organisation is part of an international organisation founded in 1975 in Canada. It provides humanitarian aid in developing countries, such as establishing clean water supplies and assisting in self-help activities by providing microfinance. Limbs 4 All Charitable Trust This organisation provides disabled people with artificial limbs and devices, and encourages and supports research into new limbs and devices. It will carry out these activities both in New Zealand and overseas. While not limited to any overseas country, it is particularly aimed at Cambodia, Tibet and Nepal. New Zealand Disaster Assistance Response Team Trust The New Zealand Disaster Assistance Response Team Trust operates both in New Zealand and overseas and provides disaster rescue training, education and resources for rescue teams. Operation Restore Hope Charitable Trust This organisation provides assistance to indigent children born with, or afflicted by, functional or cosmetic defects. It provides surgical and medical services, and other assistance that improves their educational, economic, vocational, physical and social welfare needs. It also carries out research. The World Swim for Malaria Foundation (New Zealand) This organisation is part of an international organisation aimed at the prevention and treatment of malaria. 105 TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS TO BRANCH EQUIVALENT TAX ACCOUNT RULES (Clauses 117(1), 118, 119(1), 120, 256 and 257) Summary of proposed amendments The amendments make two changes to the rules for branch equivalent tax accounts (BETAs). Branch equivalent tax accounts are memorandum accounts designed to prevent the double taxation of foreign income which might otherwise occur as a result of the accrual taxation of controlled foreign companies (CFCs) and foreign investment funds (FIFs), in combination with the imposition of dividend withholding payments (DWPs) on foreign dividends received by New Zealand companies. The amendments tighten and clarify the rules applying to these accounts to ensure their operation is consistent with this objective and that they are not used inappropriately to offset or defer tax on other income. Application date The amendments to sections MF 5 and MF 10 of the Income Tax Acts 1994 and 2004 will apply for the 1997–98 and subsequent income years, except when taxpayers have already filed returns based on existing law at the time the bill was introduced. The amendments to sections MF 4(3)(a) and MF 8(4)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2004 will apply from the date of the bill’s introduction. Key features Sections MF 5 and MF 10 of the Income Tax Act 2004 are being amended to clarify that companies’ and consolidated groups’ access to BETA debits is limited to the amount necessary to offset the tax on their foreign income (before any New Zealand losses are taken into account). Equivalent changes are being made to the Income Tax Act 1994 (the section references are the same). Sections MF 4(3)(a) and MF 8(4)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2004 are being amended to prevent BETA debits being generated when a dividend withholding payment (DWP) is paid on dividends received from grey list investments in controlled foreign companies (CFCs). 106 Background Under the CFC and FIF rules, foreign income derived from outside one of the eight “grey list” countries is taxed on accrual as it is earned. It may also be subject to DWP if subsequently repatriated to New Zealand as dividends. Branch equivalent tax accounts are designed to prevent double taxation arising as a result. When tax is paid on foreign income on accrual, or when New Zealand losses are used to relieve this tax, credits to the account are generated. These credits can be then be used to offset a subsequent liability to DWP. Alternatively, if dividends are received first, the company pays DWP, generating debits to the account which can then by used to offset accrual taxation under the CFC and FIF rules. Clarifying access to BETA debits Amendments introduced initially by sections 61 and 64 of the Taxation (GST, Trans- Tasman Imputation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003 corrected an anomaly in the BETA rules whereby a company could retain New Zealand losses carried over from previous years or from other companies in the same group and use its BETA debits to offset tax on foreign income, while current year losses made by that company had to be set against its foreign income. The anomaly was corrected by allowing debits in excess of the income tax liability on foreign income (after New Zealand losses have been allowed) to be converted into a loss which can be carried forward and set against future income. The change applied for the 1997–98 and subsequent income years. The underlying assumption is that debits can only be converted into a loss to the extent that this is necessary to offset income tax on attributed CFC income in the absence of New Zealand losses. The scope of relevant elections is not expressly limited in this way, however. If companies could convert debits into losses regardless of the level of their attributed CFC income, they could use those losses to relieve other income that is properly taxable. The amendments to section MF 5 of the 1994 and 2004 Income Tax Acts clarify that companies can access BETA debits only to the extent necessary to offset the tax on their foreign income before any New Zealand losses are taken into account. Once those losses are factored in, the company may be left with excess BETA debits that can be converted into a loss and set against other taxable income, but any larger pool of excess debits has to remain untouched until future foreign earnings justify their use. The amendments to sections MF 10 of the 1994 and 2004 Income Tax Acts make equivalent changes in relation to consolidated groups. Preventing BETA debits for DWP on grey list investments There are circumstances in which a company may accrue surplus BETA debits, with no prospect of ever having a corresponding liability on attributed CFC income. This can happen when dividends are received from grey list countries. Generally, no DWP is paid on these dividends because the New Zealand company can claim underlying foreign tax credits that reduce its DWP liability to nil. Where section LF 2(2) of the Income Tax Act 2004 applies, however, underlying foreign tax credits are not available. In those cases, DWP is payable on dividends received from grey list countries, and BETA debits are generated in the usual way. 107 The generation of BETA debits in these circumstances is anomalous because there is no corresponding accrual taxation of the underlying profits. This can leave a company with a pool of surplus debits which, potentially, can be used to offset or defer tax on other income. Sections MF 4(3)(a) and MF 8(4)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2004 are therefore being amended to ensure that, in future, BETA debits will not be generated when DWP is paid on a dividend derived from a CFC that, at the time, is an unqualified grey list CFC. This brings the law for dividends received from grey list CFCs into line with existing law applying to dividends derived from grey list FIFs. 108 INCOME TAX RATES (Clause 3) Summary of proposed amendment The bill sets the annual income tax rates that will apply for the 2007–08 tax year. Application date The provision will apply for the 2007–08 tax year. Key features The annual income tax rates for the 2007–08 tax year will be set at the rates specified in Schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004. The rates in Schedule 1 that apply for the 2007–08 year are those that applied for the 2006–07 year, except that a new rate will be added for Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) income, and new thresholds set for Specified Superannuation Contribution Withholding Tax (SSCWT) where SSCWT rates are determined by the combined total of an employee’s salary or wages and employer superannuation contributions. The PIE tax rate and new thresholds for SSCWT are those set by the Taxation (Savings Investment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006. 109 RETIREMENT SCHEME CONTRIBUTION WITHHOLDING TAX (RSCWT) (Clauses 5, 10, 14, 23, 24, 59, 66, 87, 94, 96, 133, 135(47), 135(48), 139, 147, 148, 157, 168 and 193) Summary of proposed amendments The bill introduces new rules for taxing contributions to retirement savings schemes so that: • a withholding tax is imposed on contributions instead of income tax; • tax rates on contributions are set at 19.5%, 33% and 39%, based on taxable income in the previous income year; and • contributions are not taken into account for social assistance purposes. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2007. Key features The Income Tax Act 2004 is being amended as follows: • Subject to the approval of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, companies (but not close companies), widely held unit trusts and Māori authorities will be able to apply a withholding tax on certain contributions they make to members’ accounts in retirement savings schemes. • Contributions will not be included in members’ taxable income, but will be subject to the withholding tax instead. • The tax rates on contributions are set at: – 19.5% if taxable income in the previous income year is $38,000 or less; – 33% if taxable income in the previous income year is more than $38,000 and $60,000 or less; and – 39% if taxable income in the previous income year is greater than $60,000. • Contributions will not be taken into account in determining members’ entitlement to social assistance. 110 Background Te Rūnunga o Ngāi Tahu (TRoNT) asked government to consider new rules for taxing contributions to retirement savings schemes. TRoNT was setting up a retirement savings scheme for its members, and was planning to make contributions to the scheme on behalf of its members. The contributions would be distributions of TRoNT’s profits. Members’ funds, including contributions made by TRoNT, would be locked in until retirement. However, withdrawals would be permitted for first home purchase, tertiary education (defined as repaying a student loan), significant financial hardship, serious illness (permanent and total disability, or imminent death) and permanent emigration. Under current law, any contributions that TRoNT made to the scheme on behalf of members would be subject to income tax. Resident withholding tax (RWT) would be deducted, and if a member wanted to claim a refund on RWT paid or was required to pay additional tax as the RWT was insufficient, then he or she would have to file a tax return. Contributions would also be taken into account for social assistance purposes. TRoNT proposed that instead of being subject to income tax, contributions could be subject to a final withholding tax. This would ensure that members would not be required to file tax returns solely on the basis that they are receiving locked-in retirement savings contributions. TRoNT also proposed that the contributions should not be taken into account for social assistance purposes, given that contributions would be locked in and would not be available for day-to-day living expenses. Taxing contributions through a final withholding tax instead of subjecting them to income tax in the hands of members is consistent with the treatment of employer superannuation contributions, fringe benefits, and portfolio investment entity (PIE) income. Excluding contributions from being taken into account for social assistance purposes is also consistent with the treatment of employer superannuation contributions, fringe benefits and PIE investment income, and is reasonable given that the contributions will be locked in and unavailable for day-to-day living purposes. Although the impetus for developing the new withholding tax rules came from TRoNT, the rules have been designed to accommodate companies (but not closely held companies), widely held unit trusts and other Māori authorities in addition to TRoNT. Detailed analysis Eligibility to use the RSCWT rules Entities that want to make contributions to retirement savings schemes will be able to request the Commissioner’s approval to apply the retirement scheme contribution withholding tax (RSCWT) rules to those contributions. In order to use the RSCWT rules, the contributing entity and the scheme to which the contributions are made must meet specific criteria. 111 The contributing entity must be either: • a company but not a closely held company; • a widely held unit trust; or • a Māori authority. The scheme to which contributions are made must be a PIE. The scheme must have rules to lock contributions in until retirement and the age of retirement must be specified in the scheme’s trust deed. Contributions must remain locked in even if individuals sell their shareholding or unit holding, or cease to be a member of the contributing Māori Authority. Withdrawals other than retirement withdrawals may be permitted for: • first home purchase; • significant financial hardship; • serious illness (permanent and total disability, or imminent death); • permanent emigration; and • repayment of student loans. Contributions to individuals’ retirement savings accounts must be made on the basis of those individuals’ shareholdings, unit holdings or membership in the contributing entity. Contributions must remain locked in even if the saver sells their shareholding or unit holding in the contributing entity, or ceases to be a member of the Māori authority. If the Commissioner is satisfied that the contributing entity and the scheme meet the criteria, and that the withdrawal rules are fair and reasonable, then the contributing entity will be able to use the RSCWT rules in respect of contributions. Excluding retirement scheme contributions from taxable income The RSCWT rules exclude the contributions from taxable income for individual savers, and impose a withholding tax instead. Because a withholding tax is applied, the contributions will not be subject to the resident withholding tax rules. Excluding the contributions from taxable income means that they will also be excluded from being taken into account for social assistance purposes, when social assistance is delivered through the tax system. The definition of income used for social assistance delivered through social welfare systems already excludes income which is locked in and not available for day-to-day living purposes, so no further amendment is needed. 112 In some cases, retirement schemes may set an age of retirement that is earlier than the age of eligibility for New Zealand Superannuation, but is still fair and reasonable. In those cases, if a person is eligible to receive retirement scheme contributions, and he or she makes retirement withdrawals, including withdrawals of retirement scheme contributions, those retirement withdrawals may be taken into account for social assistance purposes. RSCWT rates Contributing entities will be obliged to collect RSCWT rates from individual savers. Savers will be required to declare a tax rate to the contributing entity for the purposes of calculating and deducting RSCWT. The applicable tax rates are: • 19.5% if the individual’s taxable income in the previous income year is $38,000 or less; • 33% if the individual’s taxable income in the previous income year is more than $38,000 and $60,000 or less; and • 39% otherwise. This aligns RSCWT rates with income tax rates and thresholds. Calculating and paying RSCWT When a contribution is made, the contributing entity must calculate the amount of RSCWT owing, and return it to Inland Revenue by the 20th of the month following the month in which the contribution was made. The RSCWT liability can be satisfied with imputation credits or Māori authority credits attached to the contributions in the ordinary way, if the contributions are dividends or Māori authority distributions. There may be some cases where the imputation credit attached to the contribution exceeds the RSCWT liability. In that case, any remaining imputation credits will be passed on to the individual savers to whom they belong, who may then use the credits in their own income tax return. This situation should not arise for contributions from Māori authorities, because the maximum value allowed for a Māori authority credit is 19.5 percent, which is the same as the minimum rate of RSCWT. However, the same provision is made for excess Māori authority credits to be passed on to individual investors, to maintain consistency. The contributing entity is required to send an annual reconciliation statement to Inland Revenue. The statement must record the following details for the contributing entity: • total contributions paid; • total RSCWT liability; • total imputation credits used to pay the RSCWT liability; 113 • total Māori authority credits used to pay the RSCWT liability; and • total money paid to Inland Revenue for any remaining RSCWT liability. The reconciliation statement must record the following details for each person who has received a contribution: • the saver’s name; • amount of each contribution; • RSCWT rate used to calculate RSCWT on the contribution; • RSCWT for the contribution; • imputation credits attached to the retirement scheme contribution; • imputation credits used to meet the RSCWT liability; • Māori authority credits attached to the retirement scheme contribution; • Māori authority credits used to meet the RSCWT liability; • RSCWT owing on the retirement scheme contribution after the use of imputation credits and Māori authority credits; • RSCWT paid in cash; • the saver’s IRD number, if a rate of less than 39% is used to calculate RSCWT for that individual; and • any other particulars the Commissioner may require. The contributing entity may nominate the retirement savings scheme to act as its agent in fulfilling its tax obligations. Penalties If an individual declares the wrong rate to the contributing entity, that person will be required to file a return, pay any tax owing and may be required to pay use-of-money- interest. However, entitlements to family assistance will not be affected. The same penalties that apply to any failure to deduct and pay resident withholding tax will apply to any failure to deduct and pay RSCWT. Consequential amendments RSCWT rates will be included in Schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act. The name of the Schedule will be changed to reflect this, and consequently, the name of the Schedule has been changed wherever it appears in the Income Tax Act. 114 ACCELERATED WRITE-DOWN RATES FOR SHUTTLE STALLIONS (Clause 39) Summary of proposed amendments The bill introduces changes to the write-down rules for bloodstock so that shuttle stallions qualify for the same write-down rates as other stallions that are new to New Zealand ownership. Application date The amendments will apply to shuttle stallions purchased on or after 1 August 2007. Key features The Income Tax Act 2004 is being amended so that shuttle stallions are included in the list of types of bloodstock that can be written down as if they were new to breeding in New Zealand, despite having been used for breeding in New Zealand in the past. Background Shuttle stallions are stallions that are owned overseas but are brought to New Zealand for a breeding season. Under existing rules, if shuttle stallions have been used for breeding in New Zealand, and are subsequently bought by a New Zealand breeder, they must be written down over five years, even though they are new to New Zealand ownership. This is inconsistent with the treatment of stallions which have previously been used for breeding, but not in New Zealand. If these stallions are purchased by New Zealand studs, they can be written down over two years, or at 75 percent reducing value. The amendment will allow shuttle stallions to qualify for the same accelerated write-down rate. 115 ACC ATTENDANT CARE PAYMENTS – SETTING THE WITHHOLDING RATE AND DELAYING IMPLEMENTATION (Clauses 11, 12, 23, 30, 95, 135(3), 136, 151, 152 and 272) Summary of proposed amendments The application date for amendments made last year in the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act to the taxation of payments by the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) to attendant caregivers is to be deferred from 1 April 2008 to 1 July 2008. In addition, the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 are being amended to set the withholding rate from these payments at 15 cents in the dollar. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 July 2008. Key features The changes made in the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006, which were to have come into effect on 1 April 2008, are being repealed and replaced to allow implementation to be deferred to 1 July 2008. A number of drafting changes are being made to ensure that the changes achieve the original policy intent. The Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 are being amended to make ACC attendant care payments subject to the withholding tax rules. Withholding tax of 15 cents in the dollar will be withheld from ACC attendant care payments made by ACC to claimants or to a caregiver on behalf of claimants. Background Attendant care payments are made by ACC to injured claimants for the provision of personal care to those claimants. Claimants may use ACC-contracted caregivers or independent caregivers. Uncertainty about the correct tax treatment of ACC attendant care payments led to some inconsistent practices. It was decided to address these inconsistencies by requiring ACC to withhold tax at source from the payments. Legislative amendments were made last year to establish the tax treatment of these payments. The changes were to come into effect on 1 April 2008, but the government has agreed that they should be deferred until 1 July 2008 to allow ACC to implement its new claim management system. 116 THE ADOPTION OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (IFRS) FOR TAXATION PURPOSES (Clauses 25, 26, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 135(15), (19), (21), (32), (34), and (51), 164 and 184) Summary of proposed amendments Changes to the research and development expenditure and trading stock tax rules align references in the Income Tax Act 2004 to the new International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and ensure that taxpayers who adopted IFRS can continue to use these tax rules. Changes to the financial arrangement tax rules incorporate the IFRS accounting methods into the financial arrangement timing rules. Application date The proposed changes to the research and development expenditure and trading stock tax rules ensure that IFRS must be adopted for taxation purposes from the first income year for which a person adopts IFRS for the purpose of financial reporting, or the 2007–08 income year, whichever is earlier. However, taxpayers do not have to apply the changes to the financial arrangement rules until the 2007–08 income year. They can use the existing financial arrangement rules in earlier income years even though they have adopted IFRS for the purpose of financial reporting. The exemption from unacceptable tax position penalties applies only to taxpayers who adopted IFRS for the purpose of financial reporting and tax before the 2007–08 income year. Key features The amendments: • update the existing trading stock and research and development expenditure rules to reflect changes following the adoption of IFRS; and • modify the existing financial arrangement timing rules to allow taxpayers to use the method they adopt under IFRS, but the Commissioner will provide alternative spreading methods to limit the effect of any volatility of income and expenditure; and • provide legislative relief for taxpayers who adopt IFRS before the 2007–08 income year from unacceptable tax position penalties in some circumstances. 117 Background Current taxation rules are linked to accounting practice in areas such as the trading stock valuation rules, research and development expenditure rules and in areas where the Courts and tax legislation have relied on generally accepted accounting practice. The tax rules’ reliance on accounting practice in these areas is “ambulatory” in principle, meaning that changes in accounting practice arising from the adoption of IFRS are also brought into effect for tax purposes and automatically reflected in tax law. However, some areas, such as the research and development expenditure and trading stock valuation rules, require legislative amendments to incorporate the specific changes brought about by the adoption of IFRS. IFRS have introduced significant changes to the methods of accounting for income and expenditure of financial arrangements. These changes bring financial accounting methods closer in line with existing tax timing rules. Although the IFRS methods could, arguably, be applied for taxation purposes under the existing rules as the “financial reporting” methods, there are considerable uncertainties on the acceptability of these methods under the existing legislative provisions. The legislative amendments will set out the circumstances when taxpayers who adopted IFRS methods can rely on the same methods for taxation purposes. Detailed analysis Research and development expenditure The research and development expenditure rules in section DB 26 are updated to reflect changes brought about by IFRS. Under IFRS, the treatment of research and development expenditure is dealt with under the general accounting standards on intangibles (NZ IAS 38). The core standards for capitalisation of development costs under NZ IAS 38 are substantially the same as the old accounting standards and should continue to be appropriate for taxation purposes. However, some provisions in the old standards (such as paragraphs 2.3 and 5.4 of FRS-13) are no longer applicable and have been amended accordingly. Trading stock tax rules The trading stock valuation rules in subpart EB are amended to reflect the application of a new accounting standard, NZ IAS 2, under IFRS. The trading stock valuation rules under the new standards are largely consistent with the old accounting standards and continue to be appropriate for taxation purposes. However, primary sector producers may be required to use another new accounting standard, NZ IAS 41, to value their trading stock. NZ IAS 41 requires primary sector producers to value their trading stock at fair value, which includes gains and losses that should not be included for taxation purposes. Special rules are provided to ensure that these taxpayers can continue to value their trading stock at cost, despite having to fair value them under NZ IAS 41. 118 Financial arrangement rules The financial arrangement spreading rules have been re-ordered so that taxpayers who adopted IFRS for financial reporting purposes would generally be required to follow the IFRS timing rules for taxation purposes. In addition, these IFRS-compliant taxpayers will have an option to use alternative spreading methods for financial arrangements that are within the scope of specific determinations. Taxpayers who do not prepare IFRS accounts will continue to apply the current tax timing rules for financial arrangements, except that they will not have the option of using the financial reporting method that is currently available. A summary of the spreading methods available to taxpayers under the proposed legislative changes is presented in Figure 1. Figure 1 Proposed financial arrangement spreading rules Qualify for and want to use cash basis? IFRS financial statements Use cash basis No Yes Qualify for and want to use straight line? No Qualify for and want to use alternatives Yes Use alternatives in Determinations G9C, G14B or G27 Yes Use IFRSNo Use straight lineYes Qualify and want to use market value? No Use market valueYes Can use yield to maturity or equivalent? No Use yield to maturity or equivalent Yes Qualify and want to use determinations? No Use determinations Yes Use default method No 119 Adopting the IFRS methods for taxation purposes means that income and expenditure of financial arrangements are calculated before their maturity using either the “fair value method” or the “effective interest method” under NZ IAS 39. Income and expenditure calculated under these methods would include fees that are “integral” to the financial arrangement. The determination of whether fees are “integral” to the financial arrangement made for financial reporting purposes would be acceptable for taxation purposes. Taxpayers who adopt IFRS methods for taxation purposes are expected to satisfy additional conditions. First, income and expenditure reported under IFRS in both the income statement and the statement of changes in equity should be included for taxation purposes. Secondly, credit impairment adjustments made under IFRS must be reversed out for taxation purposes. Credit impairments of financial arrangements will be deductible of tax purposes only when the debt is written off as being “bad” in accordance with section DB 23. In addition to the IFRS methods, the proposed legislation will provide other spreading methods based on the existing determinations. Taxpayers who prepare IFRS accounts will have the option of using the determination methods or an alternative that is not materially different from these methods. The existing determinations that will be available are: • Determination G9C – Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach; • Determination G14B – Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach; and • Determination G27 – Swaps (specifically, Method C as outlined in sub-clause 6(3)). Transitional rules Application of the existing financial arrangement rules The proposed amendments will “grandparent” existing financial arrangement spreading rules until the 2007–08 income year. This means that early adopters of IFRS (who may be preparing their IFRS-based tax returns from the 2005–06 income years) could continue to file on the basis of the existing financial arrangement rules (and the pre-IFRS accounting treatment of financial arrangements). This provision is necessary because significant changes are proposed to the financial arrangement spreading rules and these provisions would not have been enacted by the time early adopters are required to file their tax returns. Exemption from unacceptable tax position penalties Further legislative relief from unacceptable tax position penalties is provided for early adopters of IFRS who may be filing their tax returns before enactment of the proposed amendments. The legislative relief would be available for the 2005–06 and 2006–07 income years for an IFRS-related tax position, provided that the taxpayer has adopted an interpretation for tax purposes that is “as likely as not” to represent generally accepted accounting practice under IFRS and full disclosures are provided to Inland Revenue. 120 COMMISSIONER’S ACCEPTANCE OF A TAXPAYER’S NOTICE OF PROPOSED ADJUSTMENT (Clause 163) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment is being made to the Tax Administration Act 1994 to clarify when the Commissioner of Inland Revenue can begin a new tax dispute. The change will make it clear that the Commissioner cannot issue a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) in respect of the same issue after accepting (or being treated as having accepted) a taxpayer NOPA except when the taxpayer: • was fraudulent; • wilfully misled the Commissioner; or • failed to supply the Commissioner with relevant information. The change will ensure that disputes procedures have their intended effect. However, to protect the revenue base, the timeframe may be overridden in cases of misrepresentation, material omission or fraud. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features New disputes procedures were introduced in the Tax Administration Act 1994 (Part IVA) from 1 October 1996. The disputes procedures involve various steps that are undertaken when the Commissioner and a taxpayer cannot agree on a matter. A key feature of the disputes rules is the timeframe allocated to parties to lodge notices and respond to notices received from the other party. Underpinning the response time limits is an acceptance rule that applies when a party fails to respond within the specified period. However, current law is uncertain about whether the Commissioner can issue a new NOPA to replace a taxpayer’s NOPA when the Commissioner has accepted an earlier taxpayer NOPA in relation to the same issue or has failed to respond within the set time period. 121 A change has therefore been proposed to clarify that the Commissioner cannot generally issue a NOPA on the same matter after accepting (or being treated as having accepted) a taxpayer NOPA. This change will ensure that the disputes procedures have their intended effect. Revenue concerns will be addressed by still allowing this timeframe to be overridden in cases where the taxpayer wilfully misleads the Commissioner, or there is material omission or fraud. Background A NOPA is the document that begins the disputes resolution process. The Commissioner may issue a NOPA to alter a return as filed or amend an existing assessment. A taxpayer can also issue a NOPA. Taxpayer NOPAs play an important role in the disputes process. They disclose the taxpayer’s position and minimise the taxpayer’s exposure to shortfall penalties. They also require the Commissioner to focus on an issue and explicitly decide on the correct position. This provides certainty for taxpayers. Section 89H(2) states that if the Commissioner does not, within the response period, reject an adjustment contained in a taxpayer NOPA, the Commissioner is considered to have accepted the proposed adjustment and section 89J applies. Under section 89J, if the Commissioner accepts or is treated as having accepted the proposed adjustments in the taxpayer’s NOPA, the Commissioner must include or take account of the adjustments in a notice of assessment issued to the taxpayer. This is intended to be the end of the disputes process on issues within that NOPA. The only intended exception is if the Commissioner applies to the High Court for an order allowing a notice of response to be issued outside the two-month response period (section 89L). While the intention behind the disputes procedures was for all parties to be bound by the time limits incorporated in the rules, the current law is uncertain (and has been challenged in at least two recent cases) on whether the Commissioner can begin a new dispute on the same issue once a time limit has been exceeded. 122 GST AND CONSUMABLE STORES (Clause 248) Summary of proposed amendments Changes are being made to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to clarify the circumstances when a supply of consumable stores to departing aircraft and commercial ships may be zero-rated. Application date The changes will apply to consumable stores supplied on and after the date of enactment. Key features Section 11(1)(l) of the GST Act governs when a supply of consumable stores is zero- rated. Changes are being made to that section to clarify, in the case of New Zealand stopovers, the requirement that consumable stores be used by an aircraft or commercial ship that is going to a destination outside New Zealand. The changes require that the consumable stores are intended for use on an aircraft or commercial ship on an international flight or voyage. The supply of consumable stores to ships, other than pleasure craft, which are in turn used to provide consumable stores to “fishing ships” and “foreign-going ships” will also be zero-rated. For example, the supply of consumable stores to motherships used to support fishing fleets operating outside New Zealand fisheries waters will be zero- rated. Consequential changes are also being made to the definitions of “foreign-going ship” and “consumable stores” in section 11(9) of the GST Act. Background The changes clarify when consumable stores provided to aircraft and commercial ships are considered to be “exported” from New Zealand and therefore treated as a zero-rated supply for GST purposes. The term “consumable stores” in section 11(9) includes goods such as fuel and lubricants and other goods that may be consumed by passengers and crew on board an aircraft or ship. “Consumable stores” do not include spare parts. The proposed changes are designed to zero-rate supplies of consumable stores in the following circumstances: 123 • Aircraft or commercial ships that are in transit in New Zealand as part of an international flight or voyage – for example, an aircraft or commercial ship that travels from Christchurch to Auckland en-route to Singapore. (The current legislation requires that the aircraft or commercial ship must be going to a destination outside New Zealand and is ambiguous concerning stopovers in New Zealand). • Commercial ships that do not necessarily travel to countries outside New Zealand but carry consumable stores to other commercial ships that are leaving New Zealand or fishing ships operating outside New Zealand fisheries waters. The changes are also intended to deal with the situation when consumable stores are supplied to a non-resident broker but the goods are delivered directly to a third-party aircraft or commercial ship that is departing New Zealand. The changes ensure that the contract for consumable stores with the non-resident broker does not preclude zero-rating. 124 SHARED TAX INVOICES (Clauses 246, 250 and 251) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment is being made to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to allow two or more suppliers to invoice a customer using one tax invoice. The change is intended to simplify the way in which suppliers are required to invoice customers for bundled supplies of goods and services for GST purposes. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features The amendment will allow certain multiple suppliers to issue a single, simplified shared tax invoice. The GST Act will be amended by a new section 24BA which will allow a single shared tax invoice to be issued by one principal supplier on his or her own behalf and on behalf of other GST-registered suppliers. The change specifies that shared invoices can be issued in two situations: • when suppliers have statutory obligations which make it practical to use a single invoice (for example, a levy imposed by statute); or • when suppliers are part of the same GST group of companies. Section 24BA will also specify what information should be contained on a shared tax invoice for it to be considered a valid tax invoice. This information will be similar to the current requirements of a tax invoice. Section 2, the definition section of the GST Act, will also be amended to include shared tax invoices in the definition of “tax invoice”. Background A tax invoice is a document that contains certain details as set out in the GST Act. The Act broadly requires disclosure of the name and address of the supplier and their GST registration number in addition to a description of the goods and services sold, the name and address of the recipient and the date the invoice is issued. 125 A situation may arise where two GST-registered persons, Supplier A and Supplier B, provide goods and services to the same customer, although Supplier B is the only supplier with whom the customer has actual communication. For example, when selling house and contents insurance, an insurer not only collects a house insurance premium, but also a Fire Service levy and an Earthquake Commission levy. The current legislation does not clearly allow a single invoice for the transactions. To simplify invoice issuing requirements for multiple suppliers, the amendment will allow members of the same GST group or parties to arrangements created by statute to use shared tax invoices. 126 CHILD SUPPORT INFORMATION SHARING BETWEEN INLAND REVENUE AND CUSTOMS (Clauses 160(1), 160(3), 263, 265, 266 and 267) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed changes introduce information sharing between Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Customs Service. The purpose of information sharing is to allow Inland Revenue to identify when certain persons with outstanding child support debt are entering or leaving New Zealand. Application date The changes will apply from the earlier of a date to be fixed by the Governor-General by Order in Council or 1 April 2009. Key features New section 280J-L of the Customs and Excise Act 1996 allows information sharing of child support information between Inland Revenue and Customs. Section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is also being amended. Inland Revenue will provide Customs with the names and other identifying information of certain parents who have outstanding child support debts. An information match will occur by Customs, comparing identifying information against arrival and departure information it holds on liable parents. Customs will then supply Inland Revenue with information on liable parents identified by the information match. This information will give Inland Revenue the opportunity to take the administrative and legal steps, where appropriate, to recover outstanding debt from liable parents while they are located in New Zealand and, if necessary, stop liable parents from subsequently leaving New Zealand to avoid meeting their child support obligations. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue and the Chief Executive of Customs may enter into an agreement to determine the frequency, form and method for the exchange of information. Schedule 3 of the Privacy Act 1993 is also being amended. 127 Background At present, outside of its reciprocal agreement with Australia, New Zealand has limited authority to enforce payment from liable parents who are overseas. This highlights the importance of Inland Revenue being able to contact liable parents whenever they are back in New Zealand to make arrangements for payment of their outstanding child support liability. Urgent recovery action is often required while the liable parent is still in New Zealand. Inland Revenue currently has the ability to obtain an arrest warrant to detain non-compliant liable parents who attempt to leave New Zealand to avoid child support liabilities. However, this power is limited because it relies on third parties advising Inland Revenue when a liable parent has arrived in, or is about to leave, New Zealand. In addition, Inland Revenue often does not have any New Zealand contact information for liable parents living overseas. The government agreed to investigate introducing information sharing to help Inland Revenue track the New Zealand movements of liable parents living overseas. Under the proposed changes, if a liable parent living overseas is known to be visiting New Zealand, effective steps can be taken to recover outstanding liabilities before the person attempts to leave the country. 128 TAX EXEMPTION FOR HOSPITALS OPERATED AS CHARITIES (Clauses 19, 20, 21, 253 and 254(3)) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment re-instates an income tax exemption for hospitals operated as charities by council-controlled organisations (CCOs). Activities of CCOs generally do not qualify for the charitable tax exemption. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2001, which is consistent with the date when District Health Boards were deemed to be public authorities, and therefore, exempt from income tax. Key features Income derived by hospitals that are operated as charities by CCOs will qualify for the charitable tax exemption. Consistent with the tax treatment of other charities, the hospitals must register under the Charities Act 2005. Background Commercial activities by most, if not all CCOs, such as water and waste water services, roading, public transport facilities, public culture and recreational facilities and various other public works activities can be considered as beneficial to the community. Generally, activities that are beneficial to the community would qualify for the charitable tax exemption, but the policy intention is that commercial activities should not. Therefore, income derived by CCOs is specifically excluded from the charitable exemption. However, District Health Boards are exempt from income tax because they are treated as public authorities, so there is no reason why income derived by a hospital operated by a CCO as a charity should be denied the charitable tax exemption. 129 TAXATION REVIEW AUTHORITY COSTS (Clauses 260 and 261) Summary of proposed amendments An amendment to the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 will allow the Taxation Review Authority to make an award of costs for the TRA filing fees. Another amendment will introduce a provision in the TRA Act to empower the government to make regulations in relation to the Authority’s filing fees and fee waiver. Application dates The amendment allowing the Authority to make an award of costs for the TRA filing fees will apply from 1 April 2008. The amendment introducing the empowering provision will apply from the date of assent. Key features The TRA Act will be amended by a new section 22B which will allow the Authority to order the Commissioner to pay to an objector or a disputant an amount of costs. The amount of costs will be limited to the amount of the filing fee paid by the objector or the disputant. Another amendment will introduce a provision in the TRA Act to empower the government to make regulations in relation to the Authority’s filing fees and fee waiver. Background In 2001 the Working Party on Civil Court Fees set up by the Minister for Courts initiated a review to determine an appropriate level of fees for each general civil court. In 2004, following the review, the then government decided, in relation to the Taxation Review Authority, to: • raise the filing fees for the Authority to $400; • enable the Authority to waive filing fees in appropriate circumstances; and • allow the Authority to award costs for fees. The proposed amendments deal with the last of the Cabinet’s decisions, and empower the government to make regulations to implement the first two of the Cabinet’s decisions. 130 131 Remedial amendments 133 OFFSHORE PORTFOLIO SHARE INVESTMENT RULES (Clauses 13, 31, 60 to 65, 67 to 76, 93(2) and 165) Summary of proposed amendments New tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares were enacted on 18 December 2006, with application for income years beginning on or after 1 April 2007. Several remedial amendments are required to make application of the new rules consistent with the policy intent. The more significant of these amendments are: • That the Australian shares exemption will provide that Australian-resident companies may be included in an approved Australian Stock Exchange index at any time during the year for persons who are not managed funds or who do not do daily valuations (instead of at all times as currently required). For managed funds, or any other person applying the fair dividend rate method on a daily basis, this listing requirement will be tested on the first day of their income year. • That the fair dividend rate method cannot be used for an interest in a non- resident which has 80 percent or more of the value of its assets, directly or indirectly, as debt instruments denominated in New Zealand dollars, or that are hedged to achieve the effect of New Zealand dollars. Application date The amendments will come into force on 1 April 2007, which is the commencement date of the new offshore portfolio share investment rules. The exception is certain amendments concerning restrictions on the use of the fair dividend rate method, which will apply for the 2008–09 and subsequent income years. Key features Australian shares exemption Investments in Australian-resident companies listed on an approved index of the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX), such as the All Ordinaries index, are exempt from the foreign investment fund rules. To assist compliance with this exemption in section EX 33C the current requirement that Australian-resident companies must be included in an approved ASX index at all times during the income year will be amended to an “at any time during the year” test for persons who are not managed funds or who do not do daily valuations. This means, for example, that the exemption will apply for an income year if a company that is listed on the ASX All Ordinaries index at the beginning of the year is omitted from the index during the year. For managed funds, or any other persons applying the fair dividend rate method on a daily basis, the listed requirement will be tested on the first day of their income year. 134 An amendment to the Australian shares exemption will also ensure that it does not apply to stapled securities. This means that a share in an Australian-listed company that would otherwise qualify for the exemption will not do so if it is stapled to another security. Stapled securities are two or more securities that are contractually bound together so they can only be sold together and not separately. The result of this amendment is that the foreign investment fund rules (and most likely the fair dividend rate method) will apply to Australian stapled securities. Guaranteed returns The fair dividend rate method cannot be used for guaranteed return-type investments. The policy intent is that the fair dividend rate method should not be used for investments which are, in substance, debt instruments designed to achieve a return higher than the fair dividend rate. These investments should be subject to full taxation under the comparative value method. Consistent with the policy intent, an amendment replacing current section EX 40(8)(a)(iii) will specify that the fair dividend rate method cannot be used for an interest in a non-resident which has 80 percent or more of the value of its assets, directly or indirectly, as debt instruments denominated in New Zealand dollars, or that are hedged to achieve the effect of New Zealand dollars. This amendment will generally apply for the 2008–09 and subsequent income years. However, the part of the amendment referring to “80 percent or more” by value of the non-resident’s assets will apply from 1 April 2007. An amendment to section EX 40(8) will allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to determine that the fair dividend rate method may be used for an investment even though the specific requirements of the legislation may not otherwise allow it to be used. The Commissioner’s power to make a determination that the fair dividend rate method cannot be used for a particular investment will be widened by removing the determination-making criteria in section 91AAO(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. For example, if the Commissioner considers that the compliance costs of applying the method to the investment would be higher than is appropriate and that not applying the method would not pose a revenue risk, then the Commissioner could make a determination that the fair dividend rate method may not be used for that investment. Any investment that is the subject of a determination would have to apply the comparative value method. Australian unit trusts exemption Investments in Australian unit trusts that meet minimum investment turnover requirements and use the RWT proxy rules are exempt from the foreign investment fund rules. An amendment is being made to this exemption in section EX 33D to ensure the turnover requirement relates only to shares held by the unit trust and not to all assets as currently worded. A clarifying amendment will also ensure that the turnover requirement relates to the unit trust’s accounting year which falls within the investor’s income year. 135 The RWT proxy requirement will be amended to cater for investments acquired part- way through an investor’s income year, and will apply when the unit trust makes a distribution to investors. The exemption will also be expanded to include investments in Australian unit trusts that distribute at least 70 percent of their income and use an RWT proxy. Venture capital exemption An amendment will be made to the exemption in section EX 33(3) and (4) which is designed for certain venture capital investments, to ensure the exemption continues to apply if an original investor acquires more shares after the relevant company is listed. A clarifying amendment will also ensure that the references to $1 million of expenditure include expenditure over $1 million. The current reference in section EX 33(4)(d) to the grey list company directly or indirectly owning a New Zealand-resident company will be clarified by referring to a majority of voting interests. Employee share purchase scheme exemption There is a limited exemption in section EX 33(5) for offshore shares acquired through employee share purchase schemes if there are restrictions on the disposal of shares. The current eight-year restriction on the disposal of shares will be replaced with a restriction that affects the value of shares that only needs to apply for all of the relevant income year. Access to fair dividend rate method Share-lending transactions (tax rules for which were enacted last year) will be disregarded for all fair dividend rate purposes. Therefore, the “share supplier” in a “returning share transfer” will be treated as holding the “original shares”. The share supplier will be treated as deriving any dividend paid on the original shares (this is not taxable under section EX 47 but is taken into account in calculating “quick sale gains”). Any replacement payment will not be taxable to the share supplier. An amendment will allow any person to apply the fair dividend rate method under section EX 44D on a daily basis and not just unit valuers as currently provided. This means that the quick sale rules will not apply to that person. Quick sales rules A clarifying amendment will confirm that the annual average cost basis is used for both the “peak holding adjustment” and “quick sale gains” components of the “quick sale adjustment” in sections EX 44C and EX 44D. The reference to “quick sale gains” in section EX 44D will be amended to refer to the gains for the unit valuation period instead of the income year, to be consistent with the rest of section EX 44D. 136 Cost method An amendment will allow an investor with publicly available audited accounts to use as its opening value the net asset value of its attributing interests in foreign investment funds disclosed in the audited accounts if the offshore entity also has publicly available audited accounts. The definition of “opening value” in section EX 45B(4)(b) will be amended to require an independent valuation on entry into the cost method when a person has an old attributing interest that was previously covered by the $50,000 minimum threshold. It would not be appropriate to allow what could be a very old historical cost to be used as the opening value. It will also be clarified which of the paragraphs in the definition of “opening value” in section EX 45B(4) has priority in a particular case. In particular, this ensures that the independent valuation requirement in paragraph (b) applies to old grey list investments entering the cost method rather than paragraph (d). Average cost definition The definitions of “average cost” in the fair dividend rate and cost methods currently only take into account expenditure incurred in a particular year. This could lead to an inappropriate result in deferred purchase situations. There is no need for the legislation to refer to the period in which the expenditure is incurred. The definitions of “average cost” in the fair dividend rate and cost methods will be amended to refer to expenditure incurred in acquiring or increasing the attributing interest during the relevant period. This will deal with deferred purchase situations. Currency conversion rules To provide clarity and consistency for foreign currency conversion provisions in sections EX 44C(11) and EX 44D(13), these provisions will be amended to include references to amounts derived. Credits An amendment to section LB 2 will ensure that a New Zealand investor is entitled to an imputation credit under the trans-Tasman imputation rules when they receive a dividend from an investment in an Australian company that is subject to the distribution exclusion in section EX 47. The amount of “gains” under the comparative value method in section EX 44 will be grossed up by the amount of this imputation credit. Change of calculation method Section EX 51, which deals with the consequences of changing foreign investment fund calculation methods, will be amended to include a rule for changing between the fair dividend rate and comparative value methods. 137 The new rules will provide that there is a deemed disposal and reacquisition of the interest at its market value at the start of the income year to which the new method applies. Changes in application of exemptions Clarifying amendments are being made to ensure that the deemed disposition and reacquisition that occurs when there is change in application of exemptions from the foreign investment fund rules are ignored for the purposes of the $50,000 minimum threshold rules in sections CQ 5 and DN 6. This will ensure that the original cost basis applies. Measurement of cost Section EX 56(2) (requiring an average cost per income year approach) will be replaced with the previous EX 56(2), which mandates a FIFO (first-in-first-out) cost flow identification approach. This provision will be subject to sections EX 44C(12) and EX 44D(14), which require a LIFO (last-in-first-out) approach for purposes of calculating “quick sale gains” to ensure these specific provisions prevail. Family trust definition A clarifying amendment will be made to the family trust definition used in sections EX 40(6)(d) and EX 50(8)(c) to ensure that it also includes a testamentary trust. Transitional rules Offshore investments which become subject for the first time to the new foreign investment fund rules enter the new rules at their market value on the start date of the new rules. This is achieved by a deemed disposition and reacquisition under section EX 54B. A clarifying amendment will ensure that this provision applies as intended to persons intending to become portfolio investment entities and who elect to defer the start date of the new foreign investment fund rules. Clarifying amendments are also being made to the $50,000 minimum threshold rules in sections CQ 5 and DN 6 and the fair dividend rate method in sections EX 44C and EX 44D to ensure that the deemed transaction under section EX 54B is ignored for the purposes of these provisions. Cross-reference and terminology corrections In sections EX 45B(6)(c) and EX 45B(12)(c), the current reference to section EX 44C will be changed to section EX 44E. In section EX 33B, the references to a company listed on a recognised exchange will be replaced with the correct references to shares that are listed on a recognised exchange. 138 FAMILY ASSISTANCE (WORKING FOR FAMILIES TAX CREDITS) PROVISIONS The bill contains remedial technical amendments to the family assistance provisions in the Income Tax Act 2004 and gives legislative effect to the name change from family assistance to Working for Families Tax Credits. Name changes (Clauses 79, 86, 107, 135 of Part 1; clauses 155, 159 and 162 of Part 2; clauses 264, 268, 269, 271, 273 and 274 of Part 3, and Schedules 1 and 2) Summary of proposed amendments The changes replace the term “family assistance” with “Working for Families Tax Credits” to describe the package of tax credits for families. From 1 April 2007, the names Family Support, In-Work Payment, Family Tax Credit and Parental Tax Credit will be replaced with Family Tax Credit, In-Work Tax Credit, Parental Tax Credit (unchanged), and Minimum Family Tax Credit as set out in Table 1: Table 1 Current New Names Family Assistance Working for Families Tax Credits Family Support family tax credit In-work Payment in-work tax credit Parental Tax Credit parental tax credit Family Tax Credit minimum family tax credit Application date The amendments will apply from the tax year beginning 1 April 2007. Key features The grouping of the credits as family support and family plus is removed. The names are replaced as shown in Table 1 wherever they occur in subpart KD and elsewhere as cross-references in: • The Income Tax Act 2004 • The Tax Administration Act 1994 • The Housing Restructuring and Tenancy Matters Act 1992 • The Rates Rebate Act 1973 139 • The Social Security Act 1964 • The Health Entitlement Cards Regulations 1993 • The Social Security (Temporary Additional Support) Regulations 2005 • The Student Allowances Regulations 1998 The amendments to the Income Tax Act 2004, other than the amendments to subpart KD are in Part 1; the amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 in Part 2; the amendments to other Acts and Regulations in Part 3 and Schedule 2; and the amendments to subpart KD in Schedule 1. Parental tax credit (Clauses 88, 89 and 90) Summary of proposed amendments Under the proposed amendments, lump sum payments will be calculated as if the whole of the entitlement period, up to the maximum of 56 days, is in the year of birth when a child is born in the last 56 days of the tax year and parents choose to receive the parental tax credit as a lump sum. Currently, because the calculation formula spans two tax years, it concedes entitlement at levels of income that should extinguish entitlement. Application date The amendments will apply from the tax year beginning 1 April 2008. Key features The item FCA in the formula in section KD 2(2) will be modified, as applicable, by sections KD 2A(2) and KD 2B. The new sections will apply only for the purposes of calculating a lump sum entitlement to the parental tax credit at the end of the tax year for a birth that has occurred within the last 56 days of the tax year. Determination of net income for the purposes of the minimum family tax credit (Clause 135(29)) Summary of proposed amendment The minimum family tax credit tops up after-tax income to an annually specified amount. Currently, the relevant provisions have the effect of deeming that tax has been paid for certain types of income when it has not been paid, and vice versa for some other items of income. 140 The proposed replacement definition “net specified income” in section OB 1 is intended to ensure that the minimum family tax credit is calculated from a base of after-tax income in all cases. Application date The amendment will apply from the tax year beginning 1 April 2008. Write-off of additional instalment in some years (Clause 91) Summary of proposed amendments Because a year cannot be divided evenly into weeks or fortnights, there are some years in which more than 26 fortnightly or 52 weekly instalments fall within the tax year. The Act already provides for the automatic write-off of a 27th fortnightly instalment paid by Inland Revenue or a 53rd weekly instalment paid by the Ministry of Social Development. At the time the relevant provisions were introduced, Inland Revenue did not pay weekly interim instalments and there was an expectation the problem may be resolved before the next incidence of 27 fortnightly instalments to be paid by the Ministry of Social Development in the 2008–09 tax year. The proposed amendments will provide an automatic write-off of a 53rd interim weekly instalment paid by Inland Revenue, or a 27th interim fortnightly instalment paid by the Ministry of Social Development in the years in which those events occur, to ensure no-one is disadvantaged. Application date The amendments will apply from the tax year beginning 1 April 2008. Key features The proposed amendments to section KD 7A are intended to ensure that the end of year calculation formula when there have been 53 weekly or 27 fortnightly interim instalments applies regardless of whether those interim instalments have been paid by Inland Revenue or by the Ministry of Social Development. 141 ALIGNING PROVISIONAL TAX PAYMENTS WITH GST (Clauses 102, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 173, 177 and 249) The bill contains several remedial amendments to the legislation to align the payments of provisional tax with GST payments and to provide another method of calculating provisional tax by basing payments on a percentage of their GST taxable supplies (the GST ratio method). These amendments are required to give full effect to the policy intent of the recently enacted GST and provisional tax legislation. Provisional tax payment frequency Summary of proposed amendment The proposed change makes it clear that when a taxpayer ceases using the GST ratio method and elects to pay GST on a six-monthly basis they will have to make just two provisional tax payments along with their six-monthly GST payments. Application date The amendment applies from the start of the 2008–09 tax year, which for most taxpayers begins on 1 April 2008. Key features Under the current rules, taxpayers who change from paying GST monthly or two- monthly to paying GST six-monthly would no longer qualify to use the GST ratio method for calculating provisional tax. Their provisional tax payments would change from three payments to two payments to align with their six-monthly GST filing frequency. However, the current legislation still requires the taxpayer to make three provisional tax payments instead of the two payments originally intended. The amendment to section MB 6(5) of the Income Tax Act 2004 ensures that taxpayers who change from using the GST ratio method to paying GST on a six- monthly basis will make two provisional tax payments. This is achieved by referring to the six-monthly payment dates in section MB 6(5). Determining ratio percentage Summary of proposed amendment When a taxpayer has an extension of time to file their tax returns and uses the GST ratio method to calculate provisional tax, their ratio is based on the latest tax and GST information available. The amendment enables taxpayers to use information which is three years old if this is the latest information available. 142 Application date The amendment applies from the start of the 2008–09 tax year, which for most taxpayers begins on 1 April 2008. Key features The ratio used to determine provisional tax payments is based on figures from the taxpayer’s latest income tax return, which is usually two years old. In some circumstances the latest return may be three years old, if a taxpayer has been given an extension of time (up to 31 March of the following year) to file their income tax return and Inland Revenue has not processed the return before the first provisional tax instalment date. Section MB 7(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004 provides for the GST ratio to be based on information up to two years old, not three years old. The amendment enables taxpayers, who have an extension of time to file their income tax return, to use information from three years earlier to calculate the GST ratio if that is the latest information available. Application by phone Summary of proposed amendment Taxpayers will be allowed to apply by phone to continue to use the GST ratio method in circumstances when a default is as the result of circumstances beyond their control or they have a reasonable justification for defaulting. Application date The amendment applies from the start of the 2008–09 tax year, which for most taxpayers begins on 1 April 2008. Key features Currently, taxpayers have the option of applying to the Commissioner for remission of penalties by phone rather than in writing. However the current legislation requires taxpayers who have defaulted in filing their GST return to apply in writing to the Commissioner to continue to use the GST ratio method when the default was the result of circumstances beyond their control or where they have a reasonable justification for defaulting. The bill amends section MB 15(8)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2004 to enable taxpayers to apply by phone. 143 Sale of assets Summary of proposed amendment Taxpayers who account for GST on a payments basis and who use the GST ratio method will be allowed to exclude asset sales (if they have received payment for the asset) when basing their provisional tax payments on a percentage of their GST taxable supplies. Application date The amendment applies from the start of the 2008–09 tax year, which for most taxpayers begins on 1 April 2008. Key features For taxpayers who use the GST ratio method, their GST taxable supplies figure for a two-month period is used to calculate their provisional tax liability. When the taxpayer sells a significant asset, the taxable supplies figure on which the ratio is based is adjusted to exclude the GST-inclusive proceeds from the sale of the asset. The current legislation, section MB 18 of the Income Tax Act 2004, works well for taxpayers who account for GST on an invoice basis but does not provide the correct outcome where a taxpayer accounts for GST on a payments basis. The amendment to section MB 18(2) ensures that taxpayers who account for GST on a payments basis can only adjust for asset sales when they have received payment for the asset. Late payment penalty Summary of proposed amendment The late payment penalty will be extended to late payments of provisional tax when the taxpayer uses the GST ratio method to calculate their provisional tax payments. Application date The amendment applies from the start of the 2008–09 tax year, which for most taxpayers begins on 1 April 2008. Key features The original policy intent was for all late payments of provisional tax to be subject to late payment penalties, including taxpayers who use the GST ratio method. When legislation was enacted last year, the late payment penalty provisions were not extended to cover taxpayers who use the GST ratio method and who pay their provisional tax after the due date. 144 The proposed amendment to section 139C(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ensures that a penalty is imposed for late payments of provisional tax by taxpayers who use the GST ratio method. Late payment penalties are only imposed on provisional tax payments after the end of the income year when the taxpayer’s actual tax liability is known. This ensures penalties are not imposed on amounts that exceed a taxpayer’s final tax liability. The late payment penalty that applies to taxpayers who use the GST ratio method will also be imposed at year end, to ensure penalties do not exceed the taxpayer’s final tax liability. The penalty will be based on the lower of the actual GST ratio for the year (determined when the tax return is filed) or the GST ratio that applied at the date the payment was due. Special GST returns Summary of proposed amendment Additional time will be provided for GST-registered taxpayers to file special GST returns which are due over the Christmas and Easter periods. The new due dates will be 15 January and 7 May respectively. Application date The amendment applies to taxable periods ending on or after 30 November 2007, in time for the amendments to apply to the 2007 Christmas period. Key features When a registered person’s goods are seized and sold to pay a debt owed by the registered person, the seller has to provide a special GST return and account for the GST on the sale of the asset. The special return is due on the 28th of the month following the month in which the sale occurred. The extension of the GST due dates for ordinary GST returns around Christmas (due 15 January) and Easter (due 7 May) does not apply to special GST returns. To ensure consistency of due dates for all GST returns, the bill amends section 17 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to change the due date for November and March special returns to the 15th of January and 7th of May respectively. 145 Minor amendments Summary of proposed amendments Amendments are being made to address five minor drafting oversights and cross- referencing errors in the GST and provisional tax legislation: • Section MB 8(6) of the Income Tax Act 2004 incorrectly refers to section MB 6. The bill removes this reference. • Section MB 15(2) of the Income Tax Act 2004 requires taxpayers to be registered for the whole of the previous tax year in order to qualify for the GST ratio method. The reference to “tax year” is incorrect and is being changed to “income year” to reflect the intent of the legislation. • Section MB 17(2) of the Income Tax Act 2004 incorrectly refers to subsection (3) when it should refer to subsection (5). The bill makes the necessary amendments. • Section MB 17(4) of the Income Tax Act and section 120KE (6) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 are amended to ensure taxpayers who elect not to use the ratio method before their first provisional tax instalment are able to receive use-of-money interest on any voluntary payments made before their election. These amendments apply from the start of the 2008–09 tax year, which for most taxpayers begins on 1 April 2008. 146 KIWISAVER – EXCLUDING CASUAL EMPLOYEES FROM THE AUTOMATIC ENROLMENT RULES (Clause 203) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment is being made to the KiwiSaver Act 2006 to exclude casual employees from the automatic enrolment rules. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2008. Key features Section 12 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 is being amended to exclude casual employees from the automatic enrolment rules. “Casual employment” is defined by reference to the Holidays Act 2003, as employment that is “intermittent or irregular”. The effect is that if an employee is paid holiday pay regularly with their salary or wages they will be excluded from automatic enrolment. Those employees can continue to opt-in to KiwiSaver, either by providing a deduction notice to their employer or by contracting directly with a scheme provider. The current rules will continue to apply to temporary fixed-term employment. Employees are excluded from the automatic enrolment rules if their employment contract is for a period of 28 continuous days or less. If employment was extended beyond 28 days, on day 29 the employee would then become subject to the automatic enrolment rules (as if they had started new employment). Casual agricultural workers (as defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act) are also excluded from automatic enrolment. If an employee ceases to be a casual agricultural worker, the automatic enrolment rules then apply. Background The policy intention for KiwiSaver was for employees to be exempt from the automatic enrolment rules if they were employed for a continuous period of 28 days or less. If employment was extended beyond 28 days, the employee would then become subject to the automatic enrolment rules (as if they had started new employment). 147 These rules are simple to apply in circumstances where employers and employees are fully aware of the length of employment when it is contracted. Employment law, however, has shown that in the case of “casual” employment, there is not continuous service between assignments. In these situations an employer would need to have a tracking system in place to determine whether an employee is employed for a continuous 28 day period. A further problem arises when the initial contract is for less than 28 days and, before it ends, is extended beyond 28 days. Case law has shown that in these circumstances employment is considered to be one assignment, meaning that the employee should have been automatically enrolled on day one (because the contract lasts longer than 28 days). In this circumstance, employers inadvertently breach their obligations. 148 KIWISAVER AMENDMENTS (Clauses 141, 144, 200 to 202, 204 to 211, 213, 214, 218, 221, 223, 224, 226, 228 to 230, 232 to 236 and 238 to 243) The bill contains several remedial amendments to the Income Tax Act 2004, the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 and the KiwiSaver Act 2006. Some are required to fine-tune the provisions to ensure they give full effect to the policy intent of KiwiSaver, while others correct minor drafting errors. Fund withdrawal tax Summary of proposed amendment New section CS 10B of the Income Tax Act 2004 will ensure that no permitted KiwiSaver withdrawal or no complying superannuation fund withdrawal is subject to fund withdrawal tax. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 July 2007. Implied terms: transfers without consent Summary of proposed amendment An amendment is being made to section 9BAA(1) of the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 to ensure that the provisions in the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 enabling transfers to alternate schemes without member consent (when the Government Actuary approves the alternate scheme as having no less favourable conditions and benefits) override any express provisions in superannuation and KiwiSaver trust deeds that prevent these transfers occurring. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Transfers from a complying superannuation fund to a KiwiSaver scheme Summary of proposed amendment An amendment is being made to section 226(1)(b) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 to ensure that when a person is transferred from a complying superannuation fund to a KiwiSaver scheme they will be eligible to receive the $1,000 Crown contribution. 149 Application date The amendment applies from 1 July 2007. Serious illness withdrawal Summary of proposed amendment Amendments to clauses 12(2) and (3) of the KiwiSaver scheme rules (Schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006) will ensure that the serious illness withdrawal facility applies only when the member is permanently and totally disabled or when death is imminent. The member will then be able to withdraw the $1,000 Crown contribution. An amendment to clause 13 of the KiwiSaver scheme rules also ensures that applications for withdrawal on the grounds of serious illness can be made without the need to complete a statutory declaration of the assets and liabilities of the applicant. Application date The amendment applies from the date of enactment. SSCWT exemption and participation agreements Summary of proposed amendment An amendment is being made to section 35(1)(e) of the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 to ensure that the complying superannuation fund SSCWT exemption applies to participation agreements or schemes which replace those that were in place on 1 July 2007. However, the exemption does not apply if an employer enters into a participation agreement after 1 July 2007, if no agreement had been previously held. Application date The amendment applies from 1 July 2007. Minor technical and drafting amendments A number of amendments are being made to the KiwiSaver Act to correct errors of a minor technical or drafting nature. Application date – 1 July 2007 The following minor amendments apply from 1 July 2007: PAYE intermediaries accepting opt-out notices An amendment is being made to section 17 to ensure that PAYE intermediaries can accept KiwiSaver opt-out notices. 150 Final allocation of members to a scheme The amendments to sections 48 and 51 ensure that final allocation to a KiwiSaver scheme does not occur when a dispute is underway and will ensure that final allocation to a KiwiSaver scheme occurs “as soon as practicable” three months after the Commissioner received the first contribution for a person. Employer chosen schemes Amendments are being made to section 50 to clarify that the exemption for the Commissioner from sending an investment statement for a default scheme because an employer has a chosen scheme will apply only to employment that triggered the automatic enrolment rules. Refunds by employers by direct credit Amendments to section 221 clarify that the requirement to give a refund by direct credit to a bank account applies only to the Commissioner. Involuntary transfers – employer chosen schemes An amendment to section 57 provides that an employer choice of scheme does not apply in the case of involuntary transfers. Information packs Amendments to section 40 ensure that there is no inference that the Commissioner would, on an ongoing basis, forecast the number of information packs employers would need and issue them automatically. The Commissioner will regularly remind employers of the need to ensure they have adequate information packs. KiwiSaver penalties An amendment is being made to section 215 to ensure that a KiwiSaver penalty will not be imposed if the Commissioner has not given the employer notice within the preceding 12 months that a penalty may be, or has been, imposed. Late opt-out notices An amendment to section 18 ensures that the Commissioner is able to accept a late opt-out notice if it is received by the employer or the Commissioner in the period ending three months after the date on which the Commissioner received the first contribution for the person. Pro rating of employer contributions when contributions short paid An amendment is being made to section 99 to allow the formula providing for the pro rating of employer contributions where the contribution is short paid to consider part payments. The amendment will also clarify that if an employer contribution is short paid, no more than 100 percent of the contribution recorded for an employee is attributed to that person. 151 Refunds of ad hoc contributions An amendment is being made to section 80 to allow refunds of ad hoc contributions (contributions not deducted from salary or wages). Application date – date of enactment The following proposed minor amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Employer chosen schemes An amendment is being made to section 46 to ensure that an employer can have a chosen KiwiSaver scheme for its employees only if the scheme is open to all employees (whether new or existing). Delegated authority for administration of $1,000 kickstart payment An amendment to section 225 removes the ability for the Chief Executive of the Ministry of Economic Development to delegate authority for administration of the $1,000 Crown contribution. Transfers from a complying superannuation fund to a KiwiSaver scheme An amendment is being made to section 102 so that if a member transfers from a complying superannuation fund to a KiwiSaver scheme, the time during which they have contributed to the complying fund counts toward the time for eligibility for a contributions holiday. Mortgage diversion Amendments to section 229 clarify that the mortgage diversion facility may be used more than once, provided the mortgage is for the person’s principal residence. Also, contributions to a complying superannuation fund can be diverted and applied towards payment of the person’s mortgage, provided the same conditions that apply to KiwiSaver mortgage diversion are met. Refunds by providers to the Commissioner An amendment to section 81 will ensure that providers are required to refund to the Commissioner the amount of contribution that the Commissioner requests, up to the amount that is in excess of what was required to be paid under the Act. Amendments to participation agreements An amendment to section 129 will ensure that if trustees of a KiwiSaver scheme propose to make any changes to any participation agreement entered into between the scheme trustees and any employer, the solicitor of the scheme must provide certification that the amendment is consistent with the requirements of the KiwiSaver Act and the Superannuation Schemes Act. 152 Involuntary transfers – unvested employer contributions An amendment to section 210 will specify that if an involuntary transfer arises under KiwiSaver, the amount that is transferred is, at a minimum, the member’s accumulation. Wording changes The reference to a “superannuation scheme” in section 121(3)(a) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 is being replaced with the term “KiwiSaver scheme”. A provision will be inserted in section 123 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 requiring the provision of the annual report to the Government Actuary in accordance with section 14(3) of the Superannuation Schemes Act. Regulation 6 will be amended and Regulation 7 of the KiwiSaver Regulations 2006 will be revoked, as they deal with the requirement to provide an annual report and will be redundant. Application date – 1 April 2008 The following proposed minor amendment will apply from 1 April 2008. Application of Act An amendment to section 6 will provide that the KiwiSaver Act 2006 applies to people who, at the time they become subject to automatic enrolment or opt in are, or normally are, living in New Zealand. 153 LARGE BUDGET SCREEN PRODUCTION GRANTS (Clauses 32 and 41 to 44) Summary of proposed amendments Remedial amendments are being made to ensure that provisions in the Income Tax Act 2004 relating to the tax treatment of large budget screen production grants reflect their policy intention. Deductions should be allowed for costs incurred in acquiring or producing a film, irrespective of whether a large budget screen production grant is paid. Application date These amendments will apply from the 2005–06 income year, the same application date as the Income Tax Act 2004. 154 MISCELLANEOUS TECHNICAL AMENDMENT Taxable bonus issue definition (Clause 258(3)) The definition of “taxable bonus issue” in the Income Tax Act 1994 is being amended to align it with the tax treatment of bonus issues in the Income Tax Act 2004. The new definition recognises that taxable issues that are exempt dividends in the hands of shareholders can be treated as taxable bonus issues, but only if they are restricted to the value of the reserves capitalised. The amendment applies from 16 November 2004, the date when equivalent changes were made in the 2004 Act.
Limited Partnerships Bill Commentary on Parts 5 and 6 of the Bill – associated tax changes Hon Peter Dunne Minister of Revenue First published in August 2007 by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department, P O Box 2198, Wellington. Limited Partnerships Bill; Commentary on Parts 5 and 6 of the Bill – associated tax changes.

Limited partnerships are a form of partnership involving general partners, who are liable for all of the debts and liabilities of the partnership, and limited partners, who are liable only for their contribution to the partnership. Limited partnerships are an internationally preferred structure for investing in venture capital. In a highly competitive international venture capital market, New Zealand is disadvantaged by size and distance. This makes it particularly important for New Zealand to adopt a limited partnership structure which is consistent with international norms and which provides a legal and tax structure that is recognised and accepted by investors. Currently, New Zealand has a statutory form of limited partnership called the “special partnership”, as described in Part 2 of the Partnerships Act 1908. However, because the legislation is outdated, it does not have all of the features preferred by foreign venture capital investors and the local venture capital industry has been unable to make use of the existing special partnership rules. These rules are being updated and replaced. At the same time, the bill introduces new tax rules for limited partnerships and updates the tax rules related to general partnerships. This commentary deals with the tax changes. Information on the regulatory side of the bill can be found at http://www.med.govt.nz/ . New limited partnership structure Parts 1 to 4 of the Limited Partnership Bill introduce a new limited partnership vehicle with the following key features: • Limited partners’ liability will be limited to the amount of their contribution to the partnership. • Limited partners should be able to undertake certain activities (“safe harbours”) that allow them to have a say in how the partnership is run, without being treated as participating in the management of the partnership and consequently losing their limited liability status. • A limited partnership should be a separate legal entity to further protect the liability of limited partners – for example, to allow the partnership itself to own property. 2 Changes to the partnership tax rules Parts 5 and 6 of the bill introduce new tax rules for limited partnerships and general partnerships. Under the proposed rules, the limited partnership vehicle will have separate legal entity status. If the proposed regulatory rules were to be introduced without any change to the tax legislation, a limited partnership would be characterised as a “company” for income tax purposes. As a result, income and expenses would not flow through the partnership to be taxed at partner level but would instead be taxed at company level. The bill will ensure that the limited partnership will not be taxed. Instead, each partner will be taxed individually. The introduction of a new limited partnership vehicle also highlights some problems around the current taxation of general partnerships. To resolve these problems, the bill clarifies and modernises the tax treatment of partnerships generally. This will improve certainty and reduce compliance costs for investors. The proposed new partnership rules will amend the Income Tax Act 2004 in the following ways: • Income and expenses will flow through to partners on the basis of their partnership agreement. However, to prevent streaming, income, expenditure and other items from different sources will generally be allocated to the partners in the same proportion. • Transactions between partners and partnerships (except salary payments) will be treated as being at arm’s length. • Partners will be required to account for tax upon their exit from a partnership in certain circumstances, to address revenue concerns. There are, however, several exceptions to this requirement including when compliance costs outweigh the fiscal risks. A new exception is that partners will generally not need to account for tax upon exit if their profit is $50,000 or under. They will also not need to comply with the requirement in relation to: – trading stock, if the trading partnership has a turnover of under $3 million; – certain types of depreciable tangible property, if the historical cost of any depreciable tangible asset held by the partnership is less than $200,000; – certain types of financial arrangements, if the financial arrangement has been entered into as a necessary and incidental purpose of the business (for example, a loan to provide working capital for the business); and – certain excepted financial arrangements. • When an exiting partner accounts for tax, the partnership and the incoming partner must take on a cost base in the partnership’s assets and liabilities. The cost base must be equal to the amount that the exiting partner was deemed to dispose of them for, in accordance with the disposal provisions. 3 • If an exiting partner has performed a revenue account adjustment on livestock, the incoming partner will be allowed to deduct the amount of that adjustment on a straight-line basis over a five-year period. This will reduce any compliance costs as separate tax books for livestock will not need to be maintained. • The new entry and exit rules will be elective for partnerships of five or fewer partners provided no partner has limited liability for the debts of the partnership business. An amendment applying to limited partnerships will ensure that a limited partner’s loss will be restricted in any year to the limited partner’s level of economic loss. Amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 will clarify and simplify the record- keeping and filing requirements for partnerships. 5 Policy changes 7 SCOPE AND APPLICATION OF THE NEW RULES (Clauses 119 and 121) Summary of proposed amendments The bill introduces a new definition of “partnership” and clarifies which partnership arrangements are covered by the new rules. The rules also clarify when the source taxation rules will apply to partnership income. Application date The changes will apply to income years beginning on or after 1 April 2008. Key features Section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being amended to ensure that the new rules will apply to: • any partnership under the Partnership Act 1908; • a limited partnership registered as a “limited partnership” under the Limited Partnership Bill; • any New Zealand-resident partners of a foreign general partnership; • any New Zealand-resident partners of a foreign limited partnership (that has at least one general partner) that is not publicly traded and does not have separate legal personality; • joint ventures whose members choose to be treated as a partnership for the purposes of the Inland Revenue Acts; and • co-owners of property (not being a company or a trust) where all the co-owners choose to be treated as a partnership for the purposes of the Inland Revenue Acts. Definition of partnership The definition of “partnership” in the Income Tax Act will be based on the definition contained in the Partnership Act 1908. That means a partnership will be a group of two or more persons who have, between themselves, the relationship described in section 4(1) of the Partnership Act 1908. 8 Income source rules The changes will modify the income source rules in section OE 4 when: • the partnership is a limited partnership registered under the Limited Partnership Act; or • 50 percent or more of the partnership capital is owned by partners who are resident in New Zealand; or • the centre of partnership management is in New Zealand. In these situations, any New Zealand residence requirement in the income source rules will be considered to be satisfied. Background There is currently no general definition of “partnership” in the Income Tax Act. In clarifying the partnership rules, the bill introduces a new definition of “partnership” and explains which forms of co-ownership are covered by the partnership rules. In its 1991 review, the Valabh Committee 1 noted that the tax treatment of partnerships that have non-resident partners or that receive foreign-sourced income is uncertain. The proposed rules deal with these situations by making it clear when the partners of a partnership are treated as New Zealand-resident for the purposes of the source taxation rules. 1 Key reforms to the scheme of tax legislation, the Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital (“Valabh Committee”), 1991. 9 FLOW-THROUGH OF INCOME, EXPENSES AND OTHER ITEMS (Clause 116) Summary of proposed amendments The Income Tax Act will be amended to allow income, expenses, tax credits, rebates, gains and losses to flow through to individual partners. Income, tax credits, rebates, gains, expenditure or loss will generally be allocated to the partners in proportion to each partner share in the partnership’s income. A partner will be able to deduct partnership expenditure incurred by the partnership before he or she became a member, subject to the other deductibility tests in the Income Tax Act. Application date The changes will apply to income years beginning on or after 1 April 2008. Key features New section HD 2 of the Income Tax Act will clarify that the income, tax credits, rebates, gains, expenditure or loss allocated to a partner in an income year will generally be allocated in proportion to each partner’s share in the partnership’s income under the partnership agreement. In the absence of a partnership agreement, these items will be apportioned to partners under the Partnership Act 1908 or whichever law determines their right to a share in the partnership’s income. The proportionate approach prevents streaming of these items to specific partners, by requiring them to be allocated to the partners in the same proportion as their respective shares in the partnership’s income. Under the proposed rules, it will be clear that expenditure apportioned to new partners who were not partners when the expenditure was originally incurred will generally be deductible, subject to the other tests of deductibility in the Income Tax Act. Background The Valabh Committee noted that the current legislation is generally silent on the apportionment of income, expenses and other items to partners, which can create uncertainty. The proposed rules follow the Valabh Committee’s recommended proportionate approach. This provides certainty in the allocation of these items for income tax purposes and ensures that they cannot be streamed to take advantage of the different tax circumstances of the partners. 10 Under current law, new partners are generally not entitled to claim expenditure incurred through the original partnership because they will not generally meet the “incurred test”. The proposed new rules will allow deductions for expenditure incurred through the original partnership to be claimed by new partners, subject to the other tests of deductibility in the Income Tax Act. 11 TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN PARTNERS AND PARTNERSHIPS (Clause 115) Summary of proposed amendment Transactions between partners within partnerships (except for the payment of wages and salaries) need to be at market value for tax purposes, a requirement designed to protect the tax base. Application date The changes will apply to income years beginning on or after 1 April 2008. Key features Proposed section GD 16 of the Income Tax Act provides that transactions between partners (except salary payments) will be treated as being at market value for tax purposes. This rule applies to partners acting as members of the partnership. Salaries are excepted because it is common in professional partnerships that partners’ salaries are not set at market value, with the bulk of their income coming from their share of the partnership’s income. Therefore a blanket rule would be inappropriate for salary and wages. In case of abusive manipulation of salary and wages, the Commissioner can still use other provisions such as the general anti-avoidance provisions. Transactions that do not occur at market value, such as goods provided at a discount, are likely to have an impact on limited partners’ partnership basis, with excess value given to a partnership being treated as a capital contribution, and excess value received from a partnership being treated as a distribution. Background Transactions between partners are either explicitly or implicitly required to be at market value. For example, the existing rule on rent transactions effectively requires the transaction to be made at market value for tax purposes, and the requirement for arm’s length transactions is implicit in the requirements of section DC 4 in relation to contracts of service. The proposed amendment applies to all transactions between partners and partnerships, other than the payment of wages and salaries. 12 ENTRY AND EXIT OF PARTNERS AND CHANGES TO PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS (Clauses 106, 109 and 116) Summary of proposed amendments A partner will be required to account for tax on exiting the partnership only if the amount of the disposal proceeds derived from the partnership interest exceeds the total net tax book value of the partner’s share of partnership property 2 by more than $50,000. However, if this $50,000 threshold is exceeded, an exiting partner will not have to account for tax on: • trading stock, if the total annual turnover of the partnership is $3 million or less; • depreciable tangible property, if the historical cost of any depreciable tangible asset held by the partners of a partnership is $200,000 or less; • financial arrangements, provided that: – the partnership is not itself in the business of deriving income from financial arrangements; and – the financial arrangement has been entered into as a necessary and incidental purpose of the business; • certain excepted financial arrangements. When exiting partners account for tax in respect of their share of partnership assets and liabilities, the partnership and the incoming partner must take on a cost base in the partnership’s assets and liabilities. The cost base must be equal to the amount the exiting partner was deemed to have disposed of them for under the disposal provisions. When an exiting partner has accounted for tax on livestock, the incoming partner can choose to deduct the amount of that adjustment on a straight-line basis over a five- year period. Similarly, if an exiting partner has a loss on disposal for livestock, the incoming partner must account for income on a straight-line basis over a five-year period. Partners in a partnership of five or fewer people (when no partner has limited liability on any debts of the partnership business) may elect to be treated as owning an undivided interest in the property and income of the partnership instead of following the proposed partnership interest disposal rules. 2 Less any liabilities under generally accepted accounting practice. 13 Application date The changes will apply to income years beginning on or after 1 April 2008. Key features New subpart HD of the Income Tax Act will reflect the current practice when a change in the partnership ownership has tax consequences only for partners who dispose of all or part of their interests. Exiting partners will be required to recognise revenue account gains and losses when there is a change in the partnership ownership, subject to the minimum threshold rule and the partial relief categories discussed below. If the remaining partners’ underlying interests are unchanged they will not be affected. However, if their underlying interests in the partnership diminish and they receive consideration for the change in interest, there may be tax consequences. An over-arching rule will create a deemed dissolution for tax purposes if there is a change of 50 percent or more in the ownership of the partnership within any 12-month period. This is discussed further under “dissolution of a partnership”. $50,000 minimum threshold rule The general rule of accounting for tax on disposal of an interest (or part of an interest) will be subject to a minimum threshold rule. Partners will have to account for tax on exit only if the disposal proceeds for their interest in the partnership exceeds the net tax book value of their share in all of the partnership’s property (less any liabilities under generally accepted accounting practice) by more than $50,000. When interests in the same partnership have been sold within a 12-month period, all sales are taken into account for purposes of the threshold. Partial relief Partners who do not qualify for tax relief under the minimum threshold test may still be entitled to partial relief in certain circumstances. Trading stock Exiting partners will not have to perform a revenue account adjustment in relation to trading stock if the total annual turnover of the partnership is less than $3 million. Depreciable tangible property Exiting partners will not have to account for depreciation recovery or loss on their share of any depreciable tangible asset if the historical cost of any depreciable tangible asset held by the partnership is less than $200,000. 14 Financial arrangements Exiting partners will not be required to perform a base price adjustment in relation to their interest in a financial arrangement held through a partnership if: • the partnership is not itself in the business of deriving income from financial arrangements; and • the financial arrangement has been entered into as a necessary and incidental purpose of the business. For example, exiting partners would not generally be required to perform a base price adjustment in respect of their interest in a loan that provides capital for a partnership’s business. Excepted financial arrangements Exiting partners will not have to account for tax on certain excepted financial arrangements of a debt nature (such as short-term agreements for the sale and purchase of property). Relief not mandatory Exiting partners can elect to account for tax on exit, even if they are subject to the minimum threshold rule. Incoming partners Incoming partners will generally acquire their partnership interest at market value. This means that, generally, they will take on a market value cost base in partnership assets and liabilities. A general exception is livestock, which is discussed below. Further, when an exiting partner is not required to account for tax on disposal (as a result of the application of the minimum threshold rule or the various relief categories) the incoming partner would inherit the exiting partner’s tax book value. Livestock When the exiting partner accounts for tax on livestock, the new partner will be able to deduct the total revenue account adjustment of the outgoing partner on a straight-line basis over five years. Similarly, if the exiting partner has a loss on disposal, the new partner will account for income on a straight-line basis over five years. This exception will not apply in relation to livestock valued under the herd scheme. Small partnerships Partners in a partnership of five or fewer people (when no partner has limited liability for the debts of the partnership business) may elect to treat themselves as owning an undivided interest in the property and income of the partnership instead of following the proposed partnership interest disposal rules. 15 Background The Valabh Committee noted that the tax law governing the entry and exit from partnerships is unclear. There remains significant uncertainty about the correct tax treatment to apply on entry to, and exit from, a partnership. In practice, the tax treatment adopted may depart from the technical legal position. It is likely that problems associated with this uncertainty will become more pronounced with the introduction of the limited partnership structure. Accordingly, the proposed new rules seek to provide certainty and minimise compliance costs while protecting the revenue base. 16 DISSOLUTION OF A PARTNERSHIP (Clause 116) Summary of proposed amendment The new rules will clarify when a dissolution of a partnership occurs for tax purposes, and the tax consequences of a dissolution. Application date The changes will apply to income years beginning on or after 1 April 2008. Key features Proposed new section HD 3 will deem the partnership to have disposed of all its assets at market value for tax purposes on dissolution. When there is a 50 percent or more change in the partnership ownership within 12 months there will be a deemed disposal of all of the partnership property for tax purposes. This is to prevent large asset transfers that give rise to significant deferral of tax liabilities. A partnership will not automatically be treated as dissolving for tax purposes when there is a change in partners or a smaller change in partnership interests. Background The current legislation is generally silent on the tax consequences of a partnership dissolution. The proposed new rules provide certainty on the tax treatment that applies in these circumstances. 17 LIMITATION OF LIMITED PARTNERS’ TAX LOSSES (Clause 116) Summary of proposed amendments New tax loss limitation rules for limited partners are being proposed to ensure that the losses claimed reflect the level of a limited partner’s economic loss. A limited partner’s excess tax losses will be available for carry-forward to future income years. An anti-avoidance rule is to be introduced to prevent an artificially high basis around the year end being used to increase any loss flow-through. Application date The changes will apply to income years beginning on or after 1 April 2008. Key features Proposed new section HD 11 will ensure that a limited partner’s tax loss will be restricted if the amount of the loss exceeds the tax book value of his or her investment (the partner’s basis). This is to ensure that limited partners can offset, for tax purposes, only tax losses to which they have exposure. This provision applies only to limited partners because general partners have unlimited liability and therefore full exposure to the risk of loss. Basis calculation A limited partner’s adjusted investment in a partnership will be referred to as the “partner’s basis”. In calculating a limited partner’s basis, the limited partner will take into account the sum of the limited partner’s: • investment contributions; • share of the partnership debt guaranteed (or indemnities provided) by the partner; • share of the net limited partnership income previously recognised; • share of the capital gains previously realised; • any previous equity injections; 18 less his or her: • share of the partnership debt guarantees (or indemnities) retired or extinguished by the partner; • share of the net limited partnership loss previously deducted; • share of capital losses previously realised; and • any previous distributions. Proposed section HD 12 will ensure that if a limited partner’s basis is reduced to nil, tax losses apportioned to the limited partner will not be deductible in that income year and instead will be carried forward to the next income year. The loss will be deductible when additional basis becomes available – for example, the partner contributes more capital to the partnership (putting more capital at risk) or the partnership earns income. Anti-avoidance rule To prevent the artificial creation of a high basis just at the end of the year when loss flow-through is taken into account, a limited partner’s basis will be reduced by the amount the basis is increased by if: • the limited partner’s basis is increased within 60 days before the end of the income year; and • the limited partner’s basis is subsequently reduced within 60 days after the end of the income year. Background The rationale for restricting a limited partner’s tax losses in any given year is to ensure that the tax losses claimed reflect the level of that person’s economic loss. Given that limited partners will have limited liability on their limited partnership interest, they will not have exposure to losses greater than the amount of their investment in any year. It is therefore an appropriate policy result to allow limited partners to offset, for tax purposes, only the tax losses to which they have exposure. This will also help to protect the tax base against the use of limited partnerships as tax shelters. 19 Miscellaneous technical amendments 21 GENERAL PARTNER LIABLE IF LIMITED PARTNER AN ABSENTEE (Clause 117) Summary of proposed amendment The general partner of a limited partnership will be treated as an agent of an absentee limited partner. Application date The changes will apply to income years beginning on or after 1 April 2008. Key features Section HK 17 of the Income Tax Act will be amended to ensure that the general partner of a limited partnership will be treated as an agent of an absentee limited partner for income derived from a partnership business carried on in New Zealand. It is envisaged that limited partnerships will be widely held and similar to a company, so it would be impractical to impose this liability on all the partners. General partners in a limited partnership are usually responsible for management of the limited partnership and are also liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership. General partners will therefore be treated as agents of an absentee limited partner for income derived from a partnership business carried on in New Zealand. Background Section HK 17 of the Income Tax Act currently treats all the partners as agents of an absentee partner on income derived from a partnership business carried on in New Zealand. The inference is that any or all of the other partners would, as agent of the absentee, be responsible for the reporting, disclosure and tax liabilities of the absentee in relation to that business. The term “absentee” refers to a person who is “for the time being” outside New Zealand and is likely to include non-residents. With the advent of limited partnerships and the potential for there to be many limited partners located in different jurisdictions, this requirement would be impractical. Given the nature of general partners in a limited partnership, the proposed rules will restrict the imposition of the agency relationship for tax purposes to general partners only. 22 RECORD-KEEPING AND FILING REQUIREMENTS (Clauses 123 and 124) Summary of proposed amendments The record-keeping and filing obligations of a partnership will be clarified. Application date The changes will apply to income years beginning on or after 1 April 2008. Key features Section 22 of the Tax Administration Act will clarify that it is “the partnership”, rather than each partner in the partnership, which must maintain the records, in accordance with usual practice. Section 42 of the Tax Administration Act will be amended to ensure that a foreign general or limited partnership is required to file a New Zealand return of income only when the partnership is a registered limited partnership or carries on a business in New Zealand. Background In relation to the record-keeping requirements for partnerships, confusion may arise as tax legislation often refers to a “person’s” obligation. Under current income tax law, a partnership is a legal person, as is a partner. Therefore it can be inferred that all partners must maintain separate (yet identical) records. In practice, the partnership typically keeps one set of records relating to all the partners and all the firm’s activities. The proposals would bring the law into alignment with current practice. Current legislation is not specific about whether all partnerships (such as foreign partnerships with one or more New Zealand partners) have to file a joint return in New Zealand. The proposals clarify that a return of income filing obligation will exist when the partnership is a registered limited partnership, or carries on a business in New Zealand. 23 TRANSITIONAL ISSUES (Clause 118) Summary of proposed amendments A simple transition from a special partnership to a limited partnership would not generally result in the triggering of income tax provisions to the partners. Special partnerships continuing after enactment of the new rules will not be required to comply with the loss limitation rules. Two options will be available for the calculation of a limited partner’s opening basis amount for existing partnership interests: one based on market value and the other on the basis that the rules had always applied to the limited partnership interest. Application date The changes will apply to income years beginning on or after 1 April 2008. Key features Under proposed new section HZ 3, special partnerships will continue to exist until their expiry. Partners of special partnerships will not be required to comply with the proposed loss limitation rules for compliance cost reasons. Generally, the cessation of a special partnership and the creation of a limited partnership would crystallise a tax event. However, under the proposed new rules, a simple transition from a special partnership to a limited partnership will not generally result in the triggering of income tax provisions to the partners if the business and ownership of the partnership remains the same. New Zealand-resident partners of special partnerships that make the transition into the new limited partnership rules can determine their initial basis by either: • the market value of their interest in the limited partnership; or • calculating their basis as if the rules were, in effect, the entire time the partner has held the partnership interest. 24 Background When a special partnership becomes a limited partnership, the special partnership ceases to exist and a new limited partnership with separate legal personality is created. This event can involve the transfer of assets, rights, and obligations from the special partnership to the newly created limited partnership. This can, in turn, result in the triggering of various income tax adjustments, such as depreciation recoveries and base price adjustments under the financial arrangement rules. The transition may also have other tax implications, such as the triggering of gift duty liabilities and goods and services tax liabilities relating to the transfer of assets. The transitional proposals provide that a simple transition from a special partnership to a limited partnership will not generally have income tax consequences for the partners.

Compliance costs can arise because of the variety of tax compliance activities involved (for example, performing tax calculations, seeking advice, record-keeping, filing returns and making tax payments) and the complexity of tax law and administrative procedures. These costs often have a disproportionate impact on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which make up approximately 96 percent of total businesses in our economy. 1 1.3 The 2006 Business Tax Review noted that reducing tax compliance costs can help boost productivity and competitiveness as it would allow more resources to be applied to core business activities. Submissions on the Business Tax Review broadly supported further moves to reduce tax compliance costs. Purpose of this review 1.4 The purpose of this review is therefore to reduce tax compliance costs for businesses operating under our tax laws, in order to assist productivity and competitiveness. The emphasis is on measures that may reduce these costs for SMEs. However, where appropriate and/or feasible, measures that might apply to businesses generally are also considered. 1.5 This document seeks submissions on a number of possible measures aimed at eliminating, where possible, the activities that give rise to significant tax compliance costs for SMEs. It also looks at streamlining certain other tax compliance activities, having regard to issues such as the security of tax revenues, fiscal costs and administrative feasibility. What are SMEs? 1.6 SMEs can be defined in a variety of ways – for example, according to their level of turnover, number of employees or total assets. While it is difficult to precisely define “SME” given the diverse nature of New Zealand businesses, for the purposes of implementing potential measures for SMEs, some broad definition of “SME” may be appropriate, possibly with more than one eligibility criterion. 1 Ministry of Economic Development, SMEs in New Zealand: structure and dynamics, 2006, Wellington, New Zealand. 2 1.7 The typical characteristics of SMEs include a lower level of specialist tax expertise, greater owner-involvement in day-to-day management, a smaller human capital base, a higher level of debt funding and greater exposure to personal liability. SMEs range from micro-businesses (such as taxi drivers and family-owned dairies) to larger firms with the potential to grow and develop globally connected operations. 1.8 A starting point for a definition of “SME” could be that used by the Ministry of Economic Development, which is “...enterprises with 19 or fewer employees...”. Firms with fewer than 20 employees account for approximately 96 percent of New Zealand’s enterprises, 39 percent of the economy’s total output and 30 percent of all employees. 2 While SMEs are spread widely across most sectors, they feature particularly highly in the construction, agriculture, communication services, finance, insurance, property and business services industries. From 2000 to 2005, SMEs accounted for 57 percent of all new jobs in the New Zealand economy. In the year ended 30 June 2005, incorporated companies (excluding unit trusts) with fewer than 20 employees paid over $6 billion in income tax, over $1.6 billion in GST and $60 million in fringe benefit tax. 1.9 An alternative definition based on turnover could be used to standardise a number of concessions that could apply to SMEs meeting those criteria. This is discussed further in Chapter 2. Why focus on SMEs? 1.10 Minimising tax compliance costs is an important matter for all businesses. However, research suggests that while SMEs do not bear higher compliance costs than larger businesses in absolute terms, they bear higher relative costs. 3 Consequently, SMEs may bear a disproportionate burden of tax compliance costs. While New Zealand’s tax system is ranked highly according to ease of doing business, 4 these higher relative costs can be a barrier to economic growth for a group that constitutes the majority of New Zealand businesses. The government wants to ensure that, by making it easier for business to comply with their tax obligations, valuable economic resources are freed up and re-directed towards more productive activities. This should also improve voluntary compliance in the sector. 1.11 A number of tax simplification reviews have been carried out over the last decade or so. 5 This demonstrates the government’s commitment to the ongoing monitoring and reduction of tax compliance costs. 2 Ministry of Economic Development, SMEs in New Zealand: structure and dynamics, 2006, Wellington, New Zealand. 3 OECD issues paper, Implications of tax policy for SME growth and tax compliance, 2007, para 50. 4 New Zealand is currently ranked number 2 overall on the World Bank’s “Ease of doing business index”. The same index reports that medium-sized New Zealand businesses spend 70 hours a year in tax administration, compared with the OECD average of 203 hours a year. 5 The following government discussion documents have been released: Simplifying taxpayer requirements, 1997; Less taxing tax, 1999; More time for business – Simplification for small business, 2001; Making tax easier for small businesses, 2003; and Streamlining the taxation of fringe benefits, 2003. 3 1.12 Areas that have undergone simplification in recent years include goods and services tax (GST), income tax and pay as you earn (PAYE) and fringe benefit tax (FBT). Examples of specific changes include: • aligning the GST and provisional tax payment dates; • allowing provisional tax to be paid on the basis of GST taxable supplies; • increasing the low-value asset write-off threshold; • introducing a PAYE subsidy to offset costs faced by small businesses in complying with their PAYE obligations; and • streamlining the FBT rules – including introducing an exemption for the private use of business tools and increasing the minor benefit exemption thresholds. 1.13 The need for further simplification measures follows the results in the most recent survey conducted for Inland Revenue, which shows that SMEs, on average, face an annual total tax compliance cost of $4,024 across all tax types (see Figure 1). 6 Other survey evidence indicates that tax compliance costs remain high. 7 FIGURE 1: COMBINED MEAN ANNUAL COMPLIANCE COSTS (INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL) Source: Colmar Brunton (2005) Measuring the compliance costs of small and medium-sized enterprises – a benchmark survey.

An appendix to this discussion document provides further details on some of the simplification measures undertaken overseas. Evaluating potential initiatives 1.15 In deciding whether to proceed with any initiatives, the government will consider the trade-offs involved, and the alignment with broader tax policy design. 1.16 Key considerations will include: • the extent of the likely reduction in unproductive tax compliance activity and the cost-benefit efficiency of each measure; • the impact on both economic efficiency and equity – for example, making measures voluntary may mean no firm is disadvantaged, but this can also result in higher economic costs; • the fiscal cost, including revenue impacts and the administrative costs of implementing, maintaining and monitoring specific measures; • administrative feasibility and short-term Inland Revenue capacity constraints; • eligibility rules and boundary issues (determining who can benefit from particular measures); • likely transitional measures and associated compliance and fiscal costs; • the potential for reduced accuracy (in terms of calculating tax liability); • minimising any increased potential for tax avoidance and erosion of the tax base; and • the potential for introducing undesirable or unintended bias or distortions into economic decision-making. 1.17 These factors will be carefully weighed against the expected benefits arising from each of the measures suggested. The critical focus will be on developing initiatives that genuinely result in greater simplicity in tax compliance – measures that require complex legislation, for instance, could actually increase compliance costs and would not be worth pursuing. 1.18 A question that invariably arises when considering concessions is whether they should be compulsory or voluntary. The benefit of making any threshold concessions compulsory is that it reduces complexity by creating fewer options for businesses to consider. On the other hand, making threshold concessions compulsory may, depending on circumstances, be disadvantageous to both the taxpayer and the tax system. An example of this is the GST six-monthly filing threshold, when many taxpayers that are 5 entitled to file six-monthly in fact choose not to – for example, to ensure earlier input tax credit entitlement. Making six-monthly filing compulsory may be less convenient for businesses because they would lose the cash-flow benefits of more frequent filing. It may also be disadvantageous to a tax system that is dependent on the better financial management that more frequent filing may provide. 1.19 The opposite is true of voluntary concessions, which generally tend to increase compliance costs for taxpayers and add complexity to the tax system. For example, businesses may wish to operate dual systems in order to choose the result that gives the best financial outcome, even if this outcome increases compliance requirements and results in a more complex tax system. 1.20 The government requests that those making submissions prioritise the measures they consider will genuinely, and in the long term, reduce compliance costs in light of the factors outlined. This prioritisation will allow government to establish those issues that should be progressed, taking into account the fiscal costs and viability of implementing the chosen measures. Success indicators 1.21 While there is no single method of measuring and monitoring the level of tax compliance burdens, any measures used are likely to include direct and indirect indicators. 1.22 Direct indicators (which largely formed the basis of the results shown in Figure 1) can include the quantum of absolute monetary expenditure on items such as external tax advisor costs and paid internal time spent complying with tax obligations. Importantly, direct indicators may also include non- monetary costs such as stress and unpaid time. 1.23 Indirect measures aim to provide a richer picture, by exploring factors that affect direct costs. These can include proxy measures of the complexity of the compliance process (such as taxpayer filing error rates) and the quality of services (for example, user satisfaction with the legislation, or with Inland Revenue’s staff/service lines and products). 1.24 The government plans to review measures such as these periodically to track compliance costs over time. 6 Summary of possible initiatives Thresholds (Chapter 2) • Increasing current thresholds for: – PAYE once a month filing – from $100,000 to $250,000 – FBT annual return filing – from $100,000 to $250,000 – The provisional tax use-of-money interest safe harbour – from $35,000 to $50,000 – GST registration – from $40,000 to $50,000 – GST six-monthly return filing – from $250,000 to $500,000 – GST change-in-use adjustments – from $90,000 to $100,000 – Accounting for financial arrangements – Low-value trading stock – from $5,000 to $10,000. • Introducing a single threshold for certain concessions. Simplified rules for certain expenses (Chapter 3) • Introducing simplified rules for deducting legal expenditure. • Introducing simplified rules for deducting entertainment expenses. Fringe benefit tax (Chapter 4) • Introducing a single category of restricted private-use motor vehicles for SMEs. • Simplifying record-keeping requirements for private use of motor vehicles. GST tax invoices (Chapter 5) • Simplifying GST invoice disclosure requirements, including: – Changing the content requirements of tax invoices – Allowing alternative documentation – Broadening the scope of shared tax invoicing. Tax administration (Chapter 6) • Allowing the correction of minor errors in subsequent returns. • Reviewing record-keeping periods. • Reviewing withholding tax exemption certificate requirements. • Reviewing application of the PAYE intermediaries’ subsidy. 7 Timing of possible reforms 1.25 Many of the measures suggested in this discussion document are threshold- related and therefore relatively simple to legislate for. The government plans, subject to consultation and prioritisation, to include some of these measures in the next available taxation bill. 1.26 The application date for these measures would generally be from 1 April 2009, subject to this being administratively and fiscally feasible. 1.27 A number of the other suggestions contained in this discussion document represent a more fundamental departure from the standard tax rules and will require a longer consultation period. If adopted, these will be included in a later tax bill, with the likely application date being 1 April 2010. How to make a submission 1.28 The government invites submissions on the merits of the suggested initiatives. The government also welcomes submissions on any similar measures that meet the objectives of this review. Those who make submissions are asked to: • discuss whether, and how, the suggested changes would deliver substantial compliance cost reduction benefits; and • prioritise these initiatives and any others put forward. 1.29 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also specify whether it would be acceptable for Inland Revenue and Treasury officials to contact those making submissions and discuss their submission if required. 1.30 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those making a submission who feel there is any part of it that should be properly withheld under the Act should indicate this clearly. 1.31 Any legislation relating to increases in thresholds is intended to be included in a taxation bill to be introduced in 2008. The closing date for submissions on thresholds is therefore 31 January 2008, so that submissions can be considered before the bill is introduced. The closing date for submissions on all other matters is 29 February 2008. 8 1.32 Submissions should be addressed to: Reducing SME Compliance Costs C/- Deputy Commissioner Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON Or email: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Reducing SME Compliance Costs” in the subject line. 9 CHAPTER 2 Thresholds 2.1 The New Zealand tax system uses a variety of monetary thresholds in defining taxpayers’ obligations. It also sets limits for certain rules, generally with the aim of reducing compliance costs for taxpayers that fall below those limits. 2.2 The possibility of increasing current thresholds with the aim of reducing compliance costs was raised in the Business Tax Review discussion document, and received general support from submissions. Thresholds can be changed by increasing the level at which they are set and by extending the types of taxpayers that may elect to use them. 2.3 From a taxpayer’s perspective, changing a threshold may reduce compliance costs in several ways. For example, it may reduce the number of tax returns that must be completed and the amount of information or the number of calculations required to complete each return, or reduce the number of payments the taxpayer must make to Inland Revenue. Together, these measures would reduce the number of interactions taxpayers have with Inland Revenue and the amount of time taxpayers must spend on complying with tax rules. 2.4 Reducing the complexity of the tax rules means that taxpayers are less likely to require expert assistance and are less likely to make errors. As well as reducing tangible costs, such as hours spent and expenditure on accounting fees, reducing the complexity of the tax rules can reduce the stress associated with completing tax requirements. 2.5 This chapter suggests, for the purpose of discussion, a number of changes to the following thresholds by: • increasing the threshold for paying PAYE deductions once a month; • increasing the threshold for filing FBT returns annually; • increasing the provisional tax use-of-money interest safe harbour threshold; • increasing the registration threshold for GST; • increasing the threshold for filing GST returns six-monthly; • increasing the threshold for making GST output tax change-in-use adjustments; • changing thresholds relevant to accounting for financial arrangements; and • increasing the threshold for low-value trading stock valuation rules. 10 2.6 The possibility of using just one threshold to define a number of tax obligations is also considered in this chapter. 2.7 When determining the level at which the individual thresholds should be set, the trade-offs discussed in Chapter 1, including the level of compliance-cost saving, fiscal cost, and the need to minimise economic distortions will be taken into account. 2.8 Each change may make only a small difference to individual taxpayers. However, there could be a significant reduction in compliance costs overall if a number of cost-reducing thresholds apply to the same taxpayer. Current thresholds and suggested changes Paying PAYE deductions once a month 2.9 All employers are required to deduct pay as you earn (PAYE) and specified superannuation contribution withholding tax (SSCWT) from their employees’ wages or salaries, and pay the deductions to Inland Revenue. If, in the previous year, the total amount deducted for PAYE and SSCWT for all employees was $100,000 or more, the employer must pay the deductions to Inland Revenue twice each month, on the 5th and the 20th. If the total amount deducted for PAYE and SSCWT is less than $100,000, the employer may pay the deductions once each month, on the 20th. 2.10 If the threshold for paying PAYE twice-monthly were increased, some employers could reduce the number of payments they make to Inland Revenue, thereby decreasing transaction costs and record-keeping costs. 2.11 If the threshold were lifted to $250,000, an additional 24,000 employers could file once-monthly. This equates to 96 percent of all employers – approximately the same percentage of businesses considered to be SMEs under the definition used by the Ministry of Economic Development, as noted in Chapter 1. 2.12 Employers that are above the current threshold but below a new threshold could still file twice-monthly if that better suited their business systems. 2.13 Increasing the threshold for paying deductions from employees’ wages to Inland Revenue once a month instead of twice a month from $100,000 to $250,000 would cost the government an estimated $8 million a year. Seasonal employers 2.14 Some employers employ large numbers of people for short periods – for example, the horticultural industry. This can mean that they deduct more than $100,000 per year in PAYE and SSCWT, but those deductions are often made in just a few months. The employers are then required to make twice- monthly payments for the remainder of the year when they have just a few employees. There is currently no capacity for them to revert to once-monthly payments at these times. 11 2.15 One suggested way to reduce compliance costs for these employers would be to allow industry members to make monthly payments at certain times of the year, but require them to make twice-monthly payments when they have large numbers of employees. However, this could lead to greater rather than less complexity. 2.16 Lifting the PAYE twice-monthly payment threshold to $250,000 would incorporate about 91 percent of horticultural employers. In large part, this would meet the needs of that industry without having to put special rules in place. Using an employee count to determine once-monthly or twice-monthly payments 2.17 Instead of using a monetary threshold to determine whether an employer should pay deductions once or twice-monthly, once-monthly filing could be restricted to businesses with up to, for example, 20 employees. 2.18 Calculating the number of employees could, however, be complicated. In seasonal industries, for example, it can be difficult to predict how many employees will be employed in a particular year. Even if the overall headcount of employees is known, part-time employees can complicate calculations further. 2.19 Using an employee count could unduly influence business decisions, such as an employer’s decision whether or not to employ a new person. It would also require increased record-keeping on the part of both employers and Inland Revenue, thus increasing rather than decreasing compliance costs. The PAYE intermediaries’ subsidy 2.20 The PAYE intermediaries’ subsidy is currently paid for employers employing payroll agents to manage their PAYE obligations. Only small employers are eligible for the subsidy. Employers are considered to be small employers if, among other things, they pay less than $100,000 in PAYE and SSCWT. An increase in this threshold, in line with the increase for paying PAYE deductions once a month, would allow more employers to receive this subsidy. 2.21 Other issues relating to the broadening of the PAYE intermediaries’ subsidy are discussed in Chapter 6. Given that the PAYE intermediaries’ subsidy is a relatively new measure, the government is interested in receiving submissions on its effectiveness before proceeding with any changes in this area. E-filing employer monthly schedules 2.22 Employers with more than $100,000 in PAYE and SSCWT deductions are required to file their employer monthly schedules (EMS) electronically, instead of completing a manual return. As discussed in Chapter 8, over time Inland Revenue envisages ongoing improvements to its systems, aimed at encouraging an improvement in the take-up of e-filing by taxpayers. Accordingly, the threshold for filing EMS electronically will remain at $100,000. 12 Filing FBT returns annually 2.23 Employers who pay $100,000 or less in PAYE and SSCWT annually may file FBT returns and pay FBT on an annual basis. All other employers must pay their FBT on a quarterly basis. 2.24 Raising the current $100,000 threshold would mean that fewer FBT returns and payments would need to be filed by small businesses, therefore reducing compliance costs for eligible employers. This possibility was first raised in the Business Tax Review discussion document, and received general support from submissions. 2.25 If the threshold were set at $250,000, a further 3,000 employers (or approximately 18 percent of employers currently eligible) would be able to file FBT returns annually instead of quarterly. 2.26 Increasing the threshold for annual FBT filing from $100,000 to $250,000 would cost the government an estimated $4 million a year. Provisional tax use-of-money interest safe harbour 2.27 Taxpayers are liable to pay provisional tax if their residual income tax in the previous year is greater than $2,500. Residual income tax is the amount of tax payable after any credits have been deducted. There are two methods for calculating provisional tax – the estimation method and the standard uplift method. 2.28 Under the estimation method, taxpayers must estimate their residual income tax liability for the year and pay provisional tax in three instalments to meet that tax liability. If the residual income tax liability is underestimated, and therefore the provisional tax payments are not sufficient to meet the taxpayer’s tax liability, the taxpayer must pay use-of-money interest. If residual income tax is overestimated, and provisional tax overpaid, the Commissioner must pay use-of-money interest to the taxpayer. 2.29 Estimating residual income tax can be a difficult task. Businesses must make accurate forecasts, which can be complicated by both internal and external factors. This in itself can be a substantial compliance cost, especially for smaller businesses, which may not have access to specialist expertise to assist in the task. Further, if the forecast is wrong, the amount of use-of- money interest charged can be substantial. This is because the use-of-money interest rate may be higher than most business borrowing rates, so that taxpayers do not delay tax payments. Likewise, the rate the Commissioner uses for paying use-of-money interest to taxpayers is set lower than bank deposit rates, so that taxpayers do not use the Crown as an investment opportunity. 2.30 The standard uplift method takes a taxpayer’s previous year’s residual income tax, and increases this by 5 percent to determine the current year’s provisional tax liability. If the previous year’s residual income tax liability is not yet known, residual income tax from two years earlier is increased by 10 percent to determine the current year’s provisional tax liability. 13 2.31 No use-of-money interest is payable by individuals who use the standard uplift method (that is, those who do not estimate their provisional tax) if their residual income tax is less than $35,000 in the relevant year and they meet their terminal tax obligations. 2.32 It is not recommended that the $2,500 threshold above which taxpayers are required to pay provisional tax be increased. Increasing this threshold would be expensive relative to the compliance cost savings likely to arise. In addition, increasing this threshold is more likely to benefit individual taxpayers, predominantly earning income from employment or investments, rather than SMEs. 2.33 The use-of-money interest safe harbour threshold could be increased, however. This would allow more individual taxpayers to use the standard uplift method of calculating provisional tax rather than estimating, thus reducing compliance costs for those taxpayers and reducing exposure to use- of-money interest. Currently, about 238,000, or 95 percent of all individual provisional taxpayers have residual income tax of less than $35,000. If the threshold were lifted to $50,000, about 243,000, or 97 percent of all individual provisional taxpayers, could potentially rely on the use-of-money interest safe harbour threshold. 2.34 Therefore it is suggested that the use-of-money interest safe harbour threshold for using the uplift method for calculating provisional tax be increased from $35,000 to $50,000. Registration for GST 2.35 Taxpayers that carry on a taxable activity are required to register for GST if their turnover, arising from the regular or continuous supply of goods and services, exceeds $40,000 in a 12-month period. 8 Voluntary registration is permitted for taxpayers that have an annual turnover of less than $40,000. Over 630,000 taxpayers are currently registered for GST, about 40 percent of whom have an annual turnover of less than $40,000. 2.36 By international standards, the registration threshold for GST in New Zealand is low. For example, Australia has recently increased its registration threshold to $A75,000. 9 In the United Kingdom the threshold is £64,000. 10 Canada, on the other hand, has a registration threshold of $CAN30,000. 11 These countries also permit registration below these amounts and often have special compulsory registration rules that apply to some economic activities – such as for taxi drivers in Australia. 8 Originally set at $24,000, when GST started, the threshold was increased to $30,000 in 1990 and then to its current level in 2000. These adjustments have largely been directed at indexing the threshold to take into account movements in the price of goods and services. 9 About $NZ$89,000 assuming $A0.84:$NZ1 10 About $NZ$182,000 assuming £0.35:$NZ1 11 About $NZ40,000 assuming $CAN0.75:$NZ1 14 2.37 A low registration threshold results in most businesses facing the same pricing considerations. This means they are less likely to be placed at a competitive disadvantage than taxpayers who are below the registration threshold. In competitive markets, the pricing effect from registering for VAT can lead to businesses engaging in undesirable activities, such as sales suppression, in order to stay below the threshold. 2.38 Importantly in the New Zealand context, a low registration threshold is consistent with the objective of maintaining a GST system that applies at a low to moderate rate to a very broad range of goods and services. 2.39 A high registration threshold, on the other hand, could allow sectors that have a higher proportion of final consumers as customers, such as the personal services sector, to exit the GST base. The result would be a substantial reduction of the GST base, which may lead to a need to increase taxes in other areas. A higher threshold could also increase compliance costs for businesses generally, as determining the supplies that did or did not give rise to input tax deductibility might become more complex. 2.40 The government recognises, however, that registering for GST imposes compliance costs for individual businesses as a result of the requirement to file regular returns and other obligations imposed by the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. These costs can be particularly high for smaller businesses. 2.41 Increasing the registration threshold for GST from $40,000 to $50,000 should allow about 24,000 taxpayers to exit the GST base if they wish to do so, while still maintaining the real level of the threshold. The estimated cost to the government of implementing this change would be about $15 million a year. Filing GST returns six-monthly 2.42 In general, GST-registered entities must file GST returns every two months. However, taxpayers with a turnover of more than $24 million are required to file every month, while taxpayers with a turnover of less than $250,000 may elect to file returns every six months. 2.43 The threshold for filing GST returns every six months could be increased, which would allow more taxpayers to file GST returns on that basis if they wished. Taxpayers with highly seasonal activities and small businesses may find this helpful. 2.44 Not all taxpayers that are able to file GST returns six-monthly choose to do so. About 400,000 taxpayers are eligible to file GST returns every six months, but only about one-third do, with the remainder opting for two- monthly returns. This may be because two-monthly returns provide an earlier input tax credit entitlement and may also make cash-flow management easier for these businesses. In addition, in order to use the GST-ratio method for calculating provisional tax, businesses must file GST returns monthly or two-monthly. As the benefits of the GST-ratio method become apparent to them, more taxpayers may elect to move from six- monthly filing to two-monthly filing so they can use this method for 15 calculating provisional tax, with the result that fewer taxpayers will file six- monthly. 2.45 Based on current figures, however, increasing the threshold to $500,000 would mean that an extra 58,000 taxpayers would be able to file GST returns six-monthly if they wish to do so. 2.46 The estimated cost to the government of increasing the GST six-monthly filing threshold from $250,000 to $500,000 would be about $12 million a year. Making GST output tax change-in-use adjustments 2.47 Special rules apply if an asset (goods or services) has been acquired or produced by a GST-registered person for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, and is later applied for a non-taxable purpose or for mixed taxable/non-taxable purposes. 2.48 In either case, an output tax adjustment must be made to reflect the person's non-taxable use. However, no output tax adjustment is required if goods and services are used for making exempt supplies and the total value of the exempt supplies over the next 12 months does not exceed the lesser of: • $90,000; or • 5 percent of the total of all supplies made (taxable and exempt) in the 12-month period. 2.49 The rule is designed to simplify accounting for GST for taxpayers who supply a small proportion of exempt goods or services in relation to their total business. 2.50 The estimated cost to the government of increasing the threshold for making GST output tax change-in-use adjustments from $90,000 to $100,000 would be about $24 million a year. Other GST issues Requirements for accounting on a payments basis 2.51 A GST-registered person may account for GST on a payments, invoice or hybrid basis. The basis used determines when output and input tax is taken into account for GST-return purposes. 2.52 If the invoice basis is used, tax is brought to account at the earlier of the time an invoice is issued or when any payment is made. If the payments basis is adopted, tax is generally brought to account when payment is made. 16 2.53 GST-registered persons may adopt the payments basis if their total value of taxable supplies (excluding GST) has not exceeded or is not likely to exceed $1.3 million in a year. Because of possible revenue base concerns associated with the GST accounting bases, an increase to the payments basis threshold is not proposed in this discussion document. Instead, the GST accounting bases will be reviewed at a later date. Thresholds relevant to accounting for financial arrangements 2.54 Accounting for income tax in relation to financial arrangements, such as futures contracts, swaps, foreign currency hedging and overseas loans, is determined by the financial arrangements rules. These rules are complex because of the underlying nature of financial instruments. 2.55 SMEs sometimes use such financial arrangements, but do not always have the expertise to account for them. In addition to complexity issues, the tax treatment of financial arrangements means that income must often be recognised before any cash transactions take place, creating cash-flow management problems for SMEs. 2.56 Currently, individuals are able to account for financial arrangements on a cash basis, subject to certain conditions. The conditions are that either their total income or expenditure in the income year from their financial arrangements does not exceed $100,000, or the total value of their financial arrangements on every day in the income year does not exceed $1 million in value, and that using the cash basis does not defer more than $40,000 of income. Other types of taxpayers (such as companies and trusts) are excluded from using this rule. 2.57 If entities other than individuals were able to use the cash basis to account for financial arrangements, it would be possible for a tax advantage to be gained in related-party transactions by one entity being able to account for the transaction on a cash basis, but a related entity in the same transaction being able to account for it on an accrual basis. 2.58 If the ability to use the cash basis were extended to non-individuals, rules would therefore be needed to ensure that related-party transactions adopted the same accounting basis or were otherwise unable to use the cash basis to artificially reduce tax liabilities. This may entail extra requirements for accounting for financial arrangements. Submissions are sought on whether this would increase compliance costs and negate any benefit. 2.59 Another issue is that, under current law, if an individual or other entity is a party to financial arrangements that have a total value of $1.5 million or less on every day in the income year, the income or expenditure from those financial arrangements may be accounted for on a straight-line basis. This avoids the need for more complex calculations, although it does mean that in some circumstances income may be taxed before cash is received. 2.60 It is therefore suggested that the threshold could be extended to $1.85 million, either in addition to, or instead of, extending the cash basis. 17 Low-value trading stock valuation rules 2.61 Businesses that sell stock as part of their business activity must value stock on hand at each balance date in order to calculate the cost of sales for the year for tax purposes. Keeping stock records and counting and valuing stock on hand at balance date can be complex and time-consuming, particularly if selling stock is not the primary activity of the business. For example, tradespersons such as plumbers and electricians may keep a small amount of stock on hand so they can complete jobs for customers quickly, without having to make extra trips to pick up parts. 2.62 Businesses with a turnover of $1.3 million or less in a year, that reasonably estimate their closing stock is worth less than $5,000, are not required to calculate its value at year-end. Instead, they may use the value of opening stock as the value for closing stock. This reduces record-keeping for businesses and reduces the amount of time that must be spent each year counting and valuing stock. 2.63 The $5,000 stock threshold could be increased to $10,000, which would allow more businesses for which stock on hand is an incidental part of their business to use this simplified valuation rule. 2.64 It is therefore suggested that the low-value threshold for using the opening value of trading stock as the closing stock value be increased from $5,000 to $10,000. Consideration of a single threshold for concessions 2.65 Instead of having a particular threshold for each type of transaction that a business may engage in, an option might be to set one threshold and apply it to a number of available concessions. From a tax compliance perspective, having one single threshold across a range of activities should reduce costs. 2.66 The first question to consider is the underlying basis for the single threshold. The threshold concessions noted earlier in this chapter are based on different tax types, which can create problems for determining an appropriate basis. 2.67 Potentially, thresholds could be based on the following: • PAYE and SSCWT deductions: This may not be a satisfactory basis as these deductions are only applicable to businesses that have employees. Among those that do, some large businesses may have few employees, while other small businesses may have many employees. As a result, the single threshold would not be well targeted. • Number of employees: This may not be a satisfactory basis, for the same reasons as using a PAYE and SSCWT basis. There is also a compliance cost in trying to calculate full-time equivalents, especially when there are seasonal and holiday workers. 18 • Turnover: This would seem to be the best method, as most businesses can reasonably estimate the level of their turnover, and it is a reasonable measure of the size of a business. 2.68 Turnover is the measure by which Australia decided to differentiate between small and large entities when it recently adopted a single threshold approach, based on a turnover of A$2 million or less. In Australia, businesses with a turnover of A$2 million or less are now eligible to: • choose to account for GST on a cash basis; • choose to pay GST by instalments; • make an annual apportionment of GST input tax credits; • use simplified trading stock rules; • use simpler depreciation rules; • use the “entrepreneurs’ tax” offset; • use various capital gains tax concessions; • make pay as you go (PAYG) instalments based on GDP-adjusted notional tax; • use a two-year period for amending assessments (exceptions may apply); • make immediate deductions for certain prepaid business expenses; and • use a FBT car-parking exemption. 2.69 Australian businesses can choose whether or not to apply each of the concessions. 2.70 A similar approach could be taken in New Zealand. That is, a single threshold could be set for certain tax obligations of small businesses. This could reduce the complexity for businesses in terms of having to determine which concessions do or do not apply to them when a variety of thresholds is used. It would also create greater transparency around the rules, which would simplify their administration. 2.71 On the other hand, there are a number of inherent risks and concerns in adopting a single threshold. In particular, the threshold would not differentiate between businesses. For example, it would classify a business with a turnover of say, under $1.3 million as a small business, and therefore eligible for concessions, while a business with a turnover of over $1.3 million would be classified as a large business and be ineligible for the concessions. In particular, basing a threshold on turnover does not take into account the fact that businesses may have different features such as different profit ratios. The following examples illustrate this point: 19 • A petrol station would ordinarily have a large turnover owing to volumes of sales. Profit margins of petrol stations are, however, quite small. It may also employ relatively few people and deduct little by way of PAYE and SSCWT. As a result, a petrol station could exceed a $1.3 million turnover threshold, but could, in fact, be a small business in terms of its profits and the number of employees it has. • A self-employed professional services firm may have a turnover under a $1.3 million threshold, but most of this turnover may be profit and form the bulk of the remuneration of an individual partner of the firm. 2.72 Another concern is that if it were possible to choose to apply or not apply each concession, as in Australia, the simplification benefits would be quickly eroded. Further, the incentive to remain under the single threshold would be much stronger as the compliance cost increase to a person who exceeded the threshold could be significant. 2.73 The incentive to remain in such a simplified system could be reduced to some extent if two parallel schemes operated – the current rules with their individual thresholds and concessions, and a single threshold scheme. Taxpayers that satisfied the single threshold would be eligible for all the concessions available under this rule. However, taxpayers that failed to satisfy the standardised threshold would still be eligible to access individual concessions if they satisfied the relevant individual thresholds. 2.74 The individual thresholds discussed in this chapter could be considered for the single threshold approach. If a turnover threshold applied – for example, at $1.3 million – these concessions could potentially be applicable, irrespective of whether each individual threshold was satisfied: • paying PAYE deductions once a month instead of twice a month; • filing FBT returns annually instead of quarterly; • using the provisional tax use-of-money interest safe harbour; • accounting for financial arrangements; • using the low-value trading stock valuation rules; • using the GST payment basis (although this will be considered at a later date); and • using a reduced rate for restricted private use vehicles (discussed in Chapter 4). 20 Special submission points The government is interested in receiving submissions on the following matters. Whether compliance costs for SMEs would be significantly reduced (and if so, how) by increases to the following thresholds discussed in this chapter: • paying PAYE deductions once a month; • filing FBT returns annually; • using the provisional tax use-of-money interest safe harbour; • registering for GST; • filing GST returns six-monthly; • making GST output tax change-in-use adjustments; • accounting for financial arrangements; and • using the low-value trading stock valuation rules. Whether compliance costs would be significantly reduced if a single overall threshold were introduced for certain concessions. 21 CHAPTER 3 Simplified rules for certain expenses 3.1 Many businesses find that the rules determining the deductibility, for tax purposes, of business-related legal expenses and business-related entertainment expenses are complicated. This can lead to high compliance costs for SMEs in particular. Simplified rules for deducting legal expenditure 3.2 In general, legal expenses are tax deductible if they are incurred in the course of earning income. Legal costs in relation to events such as setting up a business, increasing capital or changing the business ownership structure may not, however, be tax deductible as these costs may represent capital rather than revenue expenditure. 3.3 Many SMEs are likely to be unfamiliar with the intricacies of, or the distinction between, expenditure incurred for capital or revenue purposes. Seeking the advice of experts on these issues in relation to relatively small amounts can be time-consuming and expensive. 3.4 One possibility to alleviate this problem would be to allow businesses to deduct all business-related legal expenses up to a GST-exclusive cost of $10,000 a year, without having to distinguish between legal expenses incurred for capital or revenue purposes. This would remove the uncertainty and complexity associated with differentiating legal expenses for the purposes of calculating allowable deductions. 3.5 One consideration is whether this suggested change should be limited to businesses that met a certain turnover threshold. However, if the concession applied only to certain businesses there would be equity issues between those who would qualify for the concession and those who would not. This could give rise to undesirable distortions in the tax system. 3.6 Under this suggested change all businesses would be allowed to deduct the first $10,000 of business-related legal expenses in an income year without having to distinguish between those incurred for capital or revenue purposes. This concession would have general application, but would be of greatest benefit to SMEs, which are less likely to have very large legal expenses. 3.7 There would need to be an associated persons test so that legal expenses are not inappropriately divided among separate but related entities. It may be possible that other limitations of a similar nature would also need to be introduced. 3.8 The estimated cost of implementing this change would be about $6 to 10 million a year. 22 Simplified rules for deducting entertainment expenditure 3.9 Current tax rules provide that 50 percent of certain business-related entertainment expenditure is non-deductible. The purpose of these rules is to ensure that any private benefit received by employees for entertainment provided by an employer is effectively taxed. This could not easily be achieved under the FBT rules. 3.10 Many SMEs find that these rules cause undue compliance costs compared with the non-deductible business entertainment incurred by businesses. Unlike other tax rules, there is no minimum amount built into the non- deductible entertainment expenditure rules (for example, the FBT rules have a minimum-value threshold on the value of unclassified benefits). 3.11 The government considers that, as with legal expenses, a minimum threshold should be built into the non-deductible entertainment expenditure rules. In practice, this would mean that a business incurring entertainment expenses below a particular level would not need to account for non-deductible entertainment expenditure. This would lower compliance (and tax) costs, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses. 3.12 There would need to be an associated persons test to use these rules. It may be possible that other limitations of a similar nature would also need to be introduced. 3.13 The estimated costs to the government of allowing businesses, subject to an associated persons test, to deduct an amount of business-related entertainment expenses without having to account for non-deductible expenditure would be: • for a threshold of $2,500 – $20 to 30 million a year; • for a threshold of $5,000 – $25 to 40 million a year; and • for a threshold of $10,000 – $30 to 50 million a year. Special submission points The government is interested in receiving submissions on whether compliance costs for SMEs would be reduced (and, if so, how) if rules were introduced to allow businesses, subject to an associated persons test, to fully deduct the first $10,000 of business-related legal expenses, and an amount (to be determined) of business-related entertainment expenses. For business-related entertainment expenses, what threshold should be introduced, bearing in mind the ongoing annual costs involved to the government relative to other priorities? 23 CHAPTER 4 Fringe benefit tax 4.1 Fringe benefit tax (FBT) is a tax payable on the value of fringe benefits provided to employees by an employer. FBT was introduced in 1985 in response to the growing trend at the time to provide in-kind benefits in lieu of cash remuneration. The FBT rules buttress the PAYE system so that all forms of employee remuneration are taxed more or less equally. FBT therefore continues to play an important role in maintaining the integrity of the tax base. 4.2 One of the reasons the employer, rather than the employee, is subject to FBT is to help control administration, as it is more efficient for one employer to pay FBT rather than a multitude of employees. The number of businesses that file FBT returns is relatively small, at approximately 24,000. 4.3 Changes made last year following a review of FBT, such as increases to the minor benefit threshold and the introduction of a business tools exemption, are expected over time to provide a number of compliance-cost savings and other benefits to taxpayers. (There is often a time lag before the benefit of any change is fully realised.) 4.4 Early consultation has, however, revealed that many SMEs still consider that compliance with the FBT rules can be unduly complicated, particularly those concerned with the taxation of motor vehicles predominantly used for business purposes. 4.5 This chapter examines the possibility of introducing changes to the FBT rules for motor vehicles used by SMEs in this way. In particular, it discusses a new single category of vehicle for FBT purposes which would apply when private use is largely restricted to travel between home and work. The logbook requirements for calculating the private use of motor vehicles by employees for FBT purposes are also examined. Current FBT rules in relation to motor vehicles Summary of current rules 4.6 A fringe benefit arises when a motor vehicle is made available to an employee for his or her private use. This includes travel in the vehicle to and from work. 4.7 If an employee is considered to have private use of a motor vehicle the benefit is calculated, on a daily basis, when the vehicle is available for private use, using either 20 percent of the vehicle’s cost price, or 36 percent of the vehicle’s tax book value. 24 4.8 Vehicles that fit the definition of “work-related vehicle” in the Income Tax Act 2004 are exempt from FBT. In broad terms, a motor vehicle is treated as a work-related vehicle if it is not a motorcar and has the employer’s name or logo prominently and permanently displayed on the outside of the vehicle. The exemption applies for any day on which the vehicle is not available for private use by an employee. For this purpose, private use excludes travel between the employee’s home and place of work that is necessary for, and is a condition of, the person’s employment, or other travel in the course of employment conferring only an incidental private benefit. Problems with the work-related vehicle exemption 4.9 Many employers consider that the definition of “work-related vehicle” is too restrictive. The main reason for this is that passenger-carrying vehicles are not included in the definition of “work-related vehicle”, even though they may be used primarily for business purposes. This has led to the practice of bolting down the back seats of cars and incorporating the necessary signage to ensure the work-related vehicle exemption applies. 4.10 Employers consider that the FBT rules should be amended both to reduce compliance costs and to better reflect circumstances when employees’ private use of motor vehicles is significantly restricted. 4.11 While recognising employer concerns, the government considers that it is appropriate to continue to calculate any employee benefits arising from the availability of an employer-provided motor vehicle on the basis of the vehicle’s availability for private use. This approach remains valid even if the vehicle is used predominantly for business purposes, as if there are no restrictions placed on private use an employee would, in most instances, still benefit from cost-savings associated with owning a vehicle. 4.12 It is, however, recognised that the current definition of “work-related vehicle” can be anomalous, especially for SMEs, and can distort decisions about what type of vehicle to buy. It is also recognised that there can be circumstances when employers, who need or choose to use cars rather than work-related vehicles in their business, may be overpaying FBT when private travel is restricted. Calculating the benefit received by an employee 4.13 The private benefit that an employee obtains when the availability for private use of a vehicle is purely restricted to home-to-work travel will vary depending on each employee’s preferences. Employees who would otherwise use public transport to travel between home and work will undoubtedly save on costs, whereas employees who would have walked, or made other alternative arrangements, may save nothing. 4.14 For employees who would normally travel to work by car, the saving would be the vehicle running costs and depreciation they would have incurred in using their own vehicles or, if a private vehicle had to be purchased, the full fixed and variable costs associated with owning a vehicle. 25 4.15 The value of the availability of the vehicle to the employee also depends on non-cash factors. Employees may or may not value the convenience and flexibility that having a car provides, even if its use is restricted to home-to- work travel. For example, some employees may find having to park or garage a vehicle at their home an inconvenience, particularly if they also have their own vehicle. 4.16 These considerations aside, there is still, on balance, a benefit to employees who have the use of an employer-provided vehicle, even when that use is largely restricted to home-to-work travel. In these circumstances, however, that benefit is likely to be less than the 20 percent of the vehicle’s cost price, or more than the effective percentage applicable to exempt work-related vehicles, as specified in the current FBT rules. 4.17 The following suggestion of a lower rate for all vehicles used predominantly for business purposes has been considered to help alleviate some of the concerns raised by business. It is expected that, at least over time, this measure would be largely revenue-neutral. Introduction of a single category of restricted private-use vehicle 4.18 A new, single category of restricted private-use vehicles could be introduced for employers with a turnover of less than $1.3 million. Motor vehicles (including those currently within the definition of “work-related vehicle”) that are considered to be restricted-use vehicles would be valued for FBT purposes based on a rate of 10 percent of the vehicle’s cost price (or 18 percent of their tax value). 4.19 The availability of the work-related vehicle exemption would be phased out for an employer falling into the new rules. At a minimum, work-related vehicles on hand before the introduction of any new rules would not lose their status as work-related vehicles. 4.20 Having just one category for all restricted private-use vehicles would remove problems at the margin over whether a particular type of vehicle is within one category or the other, and reduce associated compliance costs. It would also remove the costs associated with bolting down the back seats to cars and applying signage. Significantly, the lower rate would better reflect the predominantly business-related purpose of the vehicle, while at the same time reducing compliance costs by lowering the incentives to engage in tax planning with respect to FBT. 26 Defining restricted private use 4.21 Some necessary constraints would need to be in place for SME taxpayers to qualify for the restricted private-use category. These could include: • Only private travel between home and work, and other incidental travel that was necessarily undertaken in the course of, and as a condition of, employment, would be permitted. • The work use of the vehicle would need to account for at least 75 percent of its total use. This could be measured by a representative three-month test period in which the kilometres travelled would be recorded and allocated between business and private use. Results from the three-month test period could be relied on for a three-year application period. Alternatively, if the number of kilometres travelled on business could be reasonably estimated to exceed 21,000kms during the income year, the 75 percent test would be assumed to have been met. • A restriction on the value or type of vehicle, to ensure that inappropriate vehicles (such as expensive sports cars) could not qualify as a restricted private-use vehicle. This could be linked, for example, to twice the average value of motor cars. 4.22 These restrictions would ensure that the vehicle was predominantly used for work purposes, and that clear restrictions on private use were in place. One question is whether employees who have no fixed place of work (such as plumbers) would be regarded as undertaking any private home-to-work travel. To provide greater certainty in this area, a specific exemption from FBT could be provided for employees who had no fixed place of work and used the vehicle just for work purposes. 4.23 FBT liabilities are calculated on a daily basis so that a vehicle may be exempt as a work-related vehicle one day and subject to FBT at the full rate the next. This causes compliance costs and would be inappropriate if a lower rate were to apply for restricted private use. To overcome this, it is proposed that the lower rate applicable to restricted private-use vehicles would apply at all times. Example An employer with a turnover of less than $1.3 million uses three motor vehicles in its business. All vehicles are used for predominantly work-related purposes, with employees’ private use being restricted, under the terms of their employment contracts, to travel between work and home. One of the motor vehicles currently qualifies as a work-related vehicle, whereas the other two do not. Under the suggested restricted private-use vehicle initiative, the employer would include all three vehicles in the restricted private-use vehicle category for FBT purposes. All three vehicles would therefore be subject to FBT, but would be valued at a lower rate of 10 percent of the vehicles’ cost price (or 18 percent of their tax value). Vehicles would not have to satisfy the work-related vehicle requirements to qualify, so that passenger- carrying vehicles with no signage could be included in the rules. 27 Test period for establishing the private use of motor vehicles 4.24 Employers who provide vehicles to their employees can currently use a three-month test period to establish the number of days that a motor vehicle is available for private use, and therefore liable to FBT. The result of this test can then be used to calculate the employer’s FBT liability for the next three years. The test period used by the employer must be representative of the three-year application period. 4.25 This concession relieves employers and employees from having to continually record a vehicle’s use during this three-year period. However, the legislation currently also states that if the actual private use in any quarter, year or income year is 20 percent or more than the test period result, the application period will end on the last day of that quarter, year or income year. This requirement has the effect of requiring continual monitoring of actual private use during the three-year application period. 4.26 It is proposed to remove the requirement to continue monitoring private use during the three-year application period to ensure that actual private use is not 20 percent or more than the three-month test results. This will help ease compliance requirements on both employers and employees when measuring the private use by employees of employer-provided motor vehicles. However, the existing requirement that the three-month test period for measuring private use must be representative of the three-year application period would continue to apply. Special submission points Submissions are sought on whether a new FBT rule for employers with a turnover of less than $1.3 million, which is based on a 10% rate for all vehicles used predominantly for business purposes (restricted private-use vehicles), would ease compliance and cost concerns for SME employers. 28 CHAPTER 5 GST invoices 5.1 GST is based on a system of self-assessment. It is the responsibility of taxpayers to calculate the amount of GST output tax they are required to pay and any GST input tax deductions that they are eligible to receive. 5.2 A “tax invoice” is the key instrument used in these GST transactions, since GST may be deducted only if the GST-registered person holds a valid tax invoice at the time the return is filed. 5.3 This chapter looks at possible measures to simplify the requirements associated with tax invoices. It suggests that compliance costs could be reduced if taxpayers were able to use, as tax invoices, other documents produced in the ordinary course of business, such as receipts. Current law 5.4 While the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 makes a number of concessions on the use of tax invoices (for example, allowing buyer-created invoices), the standard requirements for a GST tax invoice are relatively prescriptive. To be a tax invoice, section 24 of the GST Act requires that a document must contain: • the words “tax invoice” in a prominent place; • the name and registration number of the supplier; • the name and address of the recipient of the supply; • the date of issue; • a description of the goods and services supplied; • the quantity or volume of the goods and services supplied; and • the taxable amount, the tax, and the tax-inclusive amount, or the consideration and a statement that it includes GST (at 12.5% or 0%). 5.5 These requirements are broadly similar to those that would appear on an invoice for accounting purposes. However, the prescriptive nature of tax invoices can easily give rise to taxpayer errors. 5.6 A simplified tax invoice has slightly more relaxed requirements than a “full” invoice. This type of invoice may, however, be issued only when the consideration for the supply does not exceed $1,000. 29 5.7 The current rules for both full and simplified tax invoices could be simplified by: • reducing the number of details that must be contained on a tax invoice; • broadening the scope of the recently proposed shared invoice change; • allowing taxpayers to outsource the requirement to prepare tax invoices; • reducing the requirements for buyer-created tax invoices; and • clarifying the legislative consequences in relation to “copy only” invoices. 5.8 Consideration will also be given, following further consultation, to the use of bank statements and receipts in place of tax invoices. Suggested changes Changes to content requirements of tax invoices 5.9 The prescriptive nature of tax invoices requires taxpayers to establish a system to manage and create invoices. It is proposed that, provided adequate regard is had to the need for efficient tax administration, a wider range of ordinary business-created documents could be used as tax invoices. 5.10 It would not be practical to remove the requirements to have the name and registration number of the supplier, and the name and address of the recipient on a tax invoice for supplies over $1,000. The former is needed to identify the taxpayer who supplies the goods and services; the latter is necessary to ensure that the correct person receives any corresponding tax deductions. 5.11 Since a tax invoice may trigger the time of supply, it is also important to know on which date the invoice is issued. 5.12 A description of the goods and services supplied is necessary to identify the transaction and ensure that only one input tax deduction has been claimed in relation to the specified supply. 5.13 Finally, the requirement to state the tax-exclusive amount of the consideration, the tax, and the tax-inclusive amount of the consideration is necessary to identify whether the supply has been subject to GST and therefore subject to output tax and any related input tax deduction. 5.14 On the other hand, the requirement to have the words “tax invoice” displayed in a prominent place and to provide details of the quantity or volume of goods and services supplied could be removed. 30 Removing the requirement for the words “tax invoice” 5.15 Requiring the words “tax invoice” to appear in a prominent place on a tax invoice is meant to provide certainty that there is only one unique identifiable document that can be used to ascertain either a GST output tax liability or a GST input tax entitlement. 5.16 Nevertheless, removing this requirement would reduce compliance costs for suppliers by enabling them to use documents that are produced in the ordinary course of business as tax invoices. For example, this might include receipts or web-based documents, provided that the documents contain all the other information prescribed for a tax invoice. 5.17 There is a risk that removing the requirement could lead to more than one document being used for a single supply and more than one deduction being claimed for a single supply of goods or services. To reduce this risk, Inland Revenue could issue guidelines outlining the types of documents that would be acceptable as tax invoices. Removing the requirement to state the quantity or volume of goods and services supplied 5.18 The requirement that a tax invoice must state the quantity or volume of the goods or services supplied is meant to assist Inland Revenue’s audit processes and help businesses to manage their trading stock inventories. 5.19 Any assistance this requirement provides businesses could be achieved through other commercial or business documentation (which under the suggested changes in this chapter could themselves become tax invoices), and does not need to be a requirement for tax purposes. It is therefore suggested that this requirement be removed. Broadening the scope of the shared invoicing proposal 5.20 Modern business practices often make it more convenient for consumers to be invoiced by suppliers for multiple goods and services on one bill. For example, a consumer may receive one bill for electricity and gas from two different respective suppliers. 5.21 The current GST legislation generally does not accommodate this practice of shared invoicing by multiple suppliers. 5.22 A recently proposed legislative change allows a single shared tax invoice to be issued by one “principal supplier” on his or her own behalf and on behalf of other GST-registered suppliers. The proposal specifies that shared invoices can be issued in two situations: • when suppliers face statutory obligations (for example, a levy imposed by statute) that make it practical to use a single invoice; or • when suppliers are part of the same GST group of companies. 31 5.23 To avoid risk to the tax base, the proposed changes are deliberately narrow. The government does, however, recognise that there may be potential for the proposed shared tax invoicing rules to apply more broadly, if this extension does not unduly jeopardise the integrity of the GST base. 5.24 This could be achieved by allowing one GST-registered party to issue tax invoices on behalf of other GST-registered suppliers. The individual suppliers themselves would remain responsible for payment of the GST. Controls could also be put in place to further reduce the risk of suppliers failing to account for GST, such as approval of shared invoice arrangements by Inland Revenue, a minimum turnover requirement for a party responsible for issuing an invoice, and requiring the invoice issuer to retain documents to enable the other suppliers and the supplies to be identified. 5.25 This change would allow a number of independent suppliers to offer their goods or services (such as internet, mobile, parking and television service providers) to customers with a shared invoice acting as a single clearing point. 5.26 Submissions are sought on the possible extension of the shared tax invoice proposal and ways to minimise the risks associated with an extension. Outsourcing the requirement to prepare a tax invoice 5.27 Under the current rules, the obligation to prepare a tax invoice rests with the supplier (unless it is a buyer-created tax invoice). For some suppliers, having the invoice prepared by a third party may save time and money. 5.28 There may be some compliance savings to businesses in allowing suppliers to outsource the responsibility of creating tax invoices. Under the change suggested, a supplier would contract a third party (a billing agent) and provide the billing agent with the information required to create a valid tax invoice. The billing agent would then be responsible for creating the invoice and delivering it to the relevant customer on behalf of the supplier. 5.29 To ensure that tax invoices prepared by a billing agent are based on correct information, the billing agent would be required to keep the records of any information provided to them by suppliers. The supplier would still be responsible for filing GST returns and for the associated liabilities, even in the case of error by the agent. Billing agents would be responsible for retaining copies of tax invoices prepared for their clients. 5.30 If the suggestion to extend the scope of shared tax invoicing proceeds, billing agents would be able to issue a single tax invoice on behalf of a number of suppliers. Tax invoices and input tax deductions 5.31 Suppliers are prohibited from issuing more than one tax invoice for a single supply unless the other document is a copy and clearly marked as such. A criminal penalty, by way of prosecution and fine, can apply when more than one tax invoice is issued in connection with the same taxable supply. 32 5.32 A change could be made to replace the penalty for issuing more than one tax invoice with a penalty to taxpayers who claim more than one input tax deduction in relation to the same supply of goods and services. The requirement that GST-registered suppliers must issue a tax invoice within 28 days, and the penalty for not doing so, would be retained. 5.33 The normal penalty rules would continue to apply for incorrect tax positions. Claiming multiple input tax deductions for one supply will result in a tax shortfall. Depending on the facts of the case, shortfall penalties, ranging from not taking reasonable care to evasion, may apply. Buyer-created tax invoices: removing the requirement for Inland Revenue’s approval 5.34 Ordinarily, the responsibility to create a tax invoice lies with the supplier of goods or services. In certain circumstances, a recipient of a supply may create a tax invoice (a “buyer-created” tax invoice). 5.35 Parties must seek Inland Revenue’s approval before a buyer-created tax invoice can be issued. This requirement is to avoid the possibility of both the supplier and the recipient of the supply creating a tax invoice. 5.36 It is proposed that the requirement to seek Inland Revenue’s approval be removed, and the recipient be able to create a buyer-created tax invoice if: • the supplier and the recipient agree that the recipient should issue a tax invoice; • the document is provided to the supplier and a copy is retained by the recipient; and • the words “buyer-created tax invoice” are contained in a prominent place on that document. 5.37 In case both the supplier and the recipient accidentally issue a tax invoice in relation to the same supply, the recipient of the supply will have to ensure that they do not claim more than one input tax deduction for the supply. Should more than one tax invoice exist, the supplier’s tax invoice will take precedence in deciding the time of supply in relation to the goods or services in question. “Copy only” invoices 5.38 If a taxpayer has lost the original tax invoice, the supplier or the recipient, as the case may be, may provide a duplicate of the tax invoice, provided that it is clearly marked “copy only”. 5.39 The current rules are too prescriptive, at times resulting in invalid invoices. A possible solution is for the rules to be changed so that the exact term for “a copy” is not legislatively prescribed. Instead, all that would be required would be a clear statement that makes it obvious that the tax invoice is not the original (for example, “copy only”, “copy” or “duplicate”). 33 The “no tax invoice” threshold 5.40 Among GST/VAT jurisdictions, New Zealand is unusual in comprehensively waiving the requirement to hold a tax invoice for low-value transactions (when the GST-inclusive cost of a supply is $50 or less). 12 5.41 It is not proposed to increase the level of the threshold. The “tax invoice” is Inland Revenue’s primary method for verifying GST input tax deduction claims. While the amount of revenue involved in a transaction of less than $50 is small, the large volume of these transactions means that the revenue risk of any increase to this threshold is significant. 5.42 The changes suggested in this chapter are seen as a better response in dealing with compliance cost issues arising from the use of tax invoices. Invoice requirements for regular transactions 5.43 It has been suggested that GST tax invoice requirements could be simplified by reducing the requirements for regular transactions. For example, commercial leases are typically the same amount each month. As a result, once this figure and the other information required in a tax invoice is documented, there should be no further need for GST invoices to be issued each month. 5.44 Inland Revenue is considering ways that regular transactions can be accommodated within the current legislative framework. Submissions on whether legislative change would assist in this area are also welcome. Electronic invoicing 5.45 Modern businesses find themselves increasingly involved in electronic communication and delivery of information. The government’s position is that tax and other legislation that affects business should reflect this. 5.46 Under current rules, taxpayers may issue both paper and electronic versions of invoices and tax invoices. Submissions are sought on whether any improvements in the GST legislation could further facilitate the use of electronic invoicing. Bank statements and receipts 5.47 The government is interested in submissions, including from the financial sector, on whether bank statements, such as EFTPOS and credit card statements, could be used to support the deduction of input tax by GST- registered persons. 12 The United Kingdom provides some industry concessions. For example, VAT invoice requirements have been waived for the retail sector (the justification being that the majority of invoices are issued to unregistered parties). Canada imposes a graduated scale of disclosures, depending on the value of the transaction. For transactions below CAN$30, the vendor’s name, the amount paid and sufficient information to establish that GST was paid on the supply must be disclosed. 34 5.48 If the changes suggested in this chapter were to go ahead, the documentation used would need to include a similar level of detail as that required for a tax invoice. Special submission points Submissions are invited on the following matters: • The removal of the words “tax invoice” and the requirement to state the quantity or volume of goods and services supplied, with the ability to use alternative commercial documentation for output tax and input tax purposes. • The suggestion to extend shared tax invoicing and how to minimise any associated risks. • The use of billing agents to issue tax invoices. • Invoice requirements for regular transactions. • Electronic invoicing. • The use of bank statements, EFTPOS receipts and similar documents to support the deduction of input tax by GST-registered persons. 35 CHAPTER 6 Tax administration 6.1 The processes involved in calculating and paying tax require businesses to interact with their employees, their customers, other businesses and Inland Revenue. Minimising and streamlining administrative processes can reduce the compliance costs of these interactions and are just as important (if not more so) than legislative amendments. 6.2 There are two broad areas in which tax administration could be made more efficient: • Businesses are required to calculate tax liabilities, document transactions and calculations, hold files that record all their transactions, and authenticate their tax affairs. The requirements for acquiring and holding this information could, in some cases, be relaxed. • Businesses must interact with Inland Revenue, file tax returns and make payments regularly, and provide information as needed. These interactions could be streamlined by introducing changes to Inland Revenue’s procedures and to some legislative processes. 6.3 The following areas have been identified where changes could possibly be made to reduce tax compliance costs: • correcting minor errors in subsequent returns; • using the GST ratio to pay provisional tax; • the record-keeping requirements period; • withholding tax exemption certificates; and • reviewing the PAYE intermediary subsidy. Correcting minor errors in subsequent returns 6.4 Taxpayers are required to correctly determine the amount of tax payable under tax laws. If an amount is not correctly calculated, or not paid on time, penalties can apply. Use-of-money interest applies if the correct amount of tax is not paid when due. 36 The issue 6.5 For GST returns, registered persons are generally able to correct minor errors in a subsequent (current) return-period. For revenue types other than GST, errors will generally be required to be corrected in the returns in which they arose. Recently proposed rule changes to remove shortfall penalties for most voluntary disclosures should mean taxpayers that make such adjustments in a current year return will not be unduly penalised. However, use-of-money interest may still apply if the adjustment is not in the taxpayer’s favour. Possible solution 6.6 A solution is for the legislation to allow taxpayers to rectify minor errors in previous returns by including them in the current tax return. This change could provide taxpayers and their agents with a greater level of comfort in making such changes. 6.7 As taxpayers will no longer need to contact Inland Revenue to correct minor errors, this would also reduce the number of interactions taxpayers have with Inland Revenue. 6.8 It is suggested that there be a single threshold of $500 of tax to which this proposal would apply. This change would apply when the error is less than the threshold – that is, when the error or total errors involve less than $500 of tax. 6.9 The threshold would apply to the error or errors made in one return and not affect the level of error/s that could be corrected in a later return. Special submission points • Would an amount of $500 of tax be sufficient to include most minor errors? • Are there other measures for achieving the same result? Using the GST ratio method to calculate provisional tax 6.10 From the 2008–09 income year, taxpayers will be able to use the GST ratio method to calculate their provisional tax. To be eligible to use this method, taxpayers must: • file GST returns either monthly or every two months; • have been GST-registered and filing returns for all of the preceding income year; and • have residual income tax greater than $2,500 and less than $150,000 in the preceding income year. 37 6.11 The ratio must be between 0 and 100 percent. 6.12 If taxpayers meet these criteria, they may apply to use the ratio method and Inland Revenue will calculate the applicable ratio. Taxpayers will then apply the ratio to their taxable supplies for a two-month period to determine their provisional tax liability. The calculation may exclude major asset sales. 6.13 Provisional tax is paid at the same time as any GST owed to Inland Revenue. Any GST refund due to the taxpayer is offset against the taxpayer’s provisional tax liability. Taxpayers that use the GST ratio method must make six provisional tax payments, either with each two-monthly GST payment, or with every second monthly GST payment. The issue 6.14 The alignment of GST and provisional tax payments was designed as a simplification measure for SMEs. Using the ratio method means that taxpayers are not required to estimate provisional tax and are not therefore subject to use-of-money interest. 6.15 However, the current rules apply only to taxpayers that pay income tax and GST within the same entity. There are some business structures that are excluded from the rules, because the income tax paying entities are separate from the GST-registered entity. 6.16 For example, many SMEs use a company structure. At the end of each income year, all or most of the profit in the company is paid out to shareholder employees as salary. The company then has no or very little taxable income, and therefore it is not required to pay income tax. Shareholder employees, however, must pay income tax and, if their residual income tax is over $2,500, they must pay provisional tax. If their residual income tax liability is over $35,000 (which may rise to $50,000 – see Chapter 2), and their provisional tax liability is wrong, they will be liable for use-of-money interest. Partners in partnerships and beneficiaries of trusts can also face this problem. Possible solution 6.17 A possible solution would be for the GST ratio method for calculating provisional tax payments to be extended so that salaries paid to shareholder employees are added back to a company’s taxable income before the GST ratio is calculated. The resulting provisional tax payments would cover both the income tax liability of the company and the provisional tax liability of the shareholder employees. 6.18 The provisional tax paid at the company level would be attributed to the shareholder employees when salaries are paid to them. 6.19 A similar process could be used for partners in partnerships and beneficiaries of trusts. 38 6.20 Provided the company and its shareholder employees, and likewise, the partnership and its partners or the trust and its beneficiaries, met the rules for using the GST ratio method for determining provisional tax, and paid their provisional tax liability by the due date, they would not be liable to pay use- of-money interest on underpayments of provisional tax. Nor would they be able to earn use-of-money interest on overpayments of provisional tax. 6.21 Income from other sources earned by shareholder employees, partners and beneficiaries will, in many instances, be subject to withholding taxes. Any provisional tax liability from other income would continue to apply in the usual way. Special submission points • Would expanding the GST ratio method to cover shareholder employees, partners in partnerships, and beneficiaries of trusts reduce the amount of time spent and stress involved in estimating and paying provisional tax? • If you are currently excluded from the ratio method, would you consider taking it up under the suggested change? Record-keeping requirements 6.22 Taxpayers are generally required to keep their tax records for seven years. This period can be extended by three years if the taxpayer’s affairs are audited by Inland Revenue. Taxpayers can apply to Inland Revenue to keep records for shorter periods and, if granted, this period is usually reduced to four years. Taxpayers may keep their records electronically. 6.23 Inland Revenue cannot amend an assessment if more than four years have passed since the end of the tax year in which the taxpayer provides the return. There are two exceptions to this rule: • if the tax return provided by the taxpayer is fraudulent or wilfully misleading; or • if the tax return does not mention income of a particular nature or source. The issue 6.24 In complying with the record-keeping requirements, taxpayers may incur costs. While the majority of these costs are incurred when the records are made, on-going compliance costs may also be incurred. 39 Possible solution 6.25 The record-keeping period could be reduced to four years to align it with the time-bar for amending assessments. The period could be extended if Inland Revenue were auditing the taxpayer or had notified them they were about to be audited. The advantages to taxpayers of a reduced period are a reduction in storage costs and possibly also the ability to move more quickly to electronic filing systems. 6.26 Before making this change, however, other business record-keeping periods will also need to be considered, and consultation undertaken. There are other New Zealand statutes which require businesses to keep records – for example, the Companies Act 1993 requires records to be kept for seven years, and the Employment Relations Act 2000 requires that employee records be kept for six years. 6.27 It is also worth noting that in overseas jurisdictions the length of time tax records are required to be kept varies: • In Australia, records are required to be kept for five years after they are prepared, obtained or the transactions completed (whichever occurs later). • In the United Kingdom and Canada, business records generally must be kept for six years. In the United Kingdom, if the six-year rule causes serious storage problems or undue expense, the taxpayer may be allowed to keep some records for a shorter period. • In the United States, the period is dependant on circumstances and can vary between three years and an indefinite period. Special submission points • What compliance costs are incurred in keeping records for a seven-year period? • How would these costs reduce if records could be kept for a shorter period of time? Withholding tax exemption certificates 6.28 The Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 apply to taxpayers that receive withholding payments – that is, payments made for the provision of certain services listed in the regulations. These include, for example, payments to sheep shearers, company directors’ fees and fees for setting examination papers or questions. 6.29 A business that engages contractors is required to deduct withholding tax from any payments made to the contractors – unless the contractor holds a valid certificate of exemption from withholding tax. 40 6.30 Persons can apply to Inland Revenue for a certificate of exemption if they: • are in business; • receive withholding payments; and • have a good record in New Zealand for filing returns and paying their tax when it is due. Recent changes 6.31 There have been a number of recent administrative changes aimed at reducing the compliance costs faced by contractors in obtaining certificates of exemption. For example, contractors can now apply online for a certificate of exemption and, since 1 April 2007, Inland Revenue has issued a new style of certificate which is a convenient credit card size, with more security features. The issue 6.32 When a business engages a contractor, it can be difficult to ascertain whether the contractor has an exemption certificate. If a business engages a contractor who does not have an exemption certificate and does not withhold tax, the business can be liable to pay Inland Revenue the amount that should have been withheld (even though the full amount has been paid to the contractor). Possible solution 6.33 One possible solution has been raised during initial consultation, and also by the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance in its Tax Compliance report to the Treasurer and Minister of Revenue in December 1998. That is, to allow businesses employing contractors to assume that the contractor has a certificate of exemption, and not deduct withholding tax if the contractor is registered for GST and gives the business a tax invoice for its services. Contractors who are not registered for GST would still be able to obtain a certificate of exemption in the usual way. 6.34 If the contractor is GST-registered and the business engaging the contractor assumes that the contractor holds a certificate of exemption, Inland Revenue would no longer be able to collect from the business any withholding tax owed. 6.35 The suggested change could not, however, realistically proceed without addressing the potential base-maintenance risk that it could cause. GST- registered persons are already in the tax base and therefore pose less of a tax- base risk than other contractors. Nevertheless, an important purpose of the withholding tax rules is to protect the tax base, and this is why the contractor’s compliance history is an important consideration in issuing exemption certificates. 41 6.36 Possible options for dealing with this concern include: • giving Inland Revenue the power to allow GST registration as a means of determining exemption for certain approved types of consultant or industry; and • requiring the contractor to supply the business with a statutory declaration that they have a good tax compliance history and/or that they have no outstanding tax debts. 6.37 The main compliance costs in this area may, however, be due to businesses being unaware of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations and the possibility that the business employing the contractor could be liable for any tax that should have been withheld. It is questionable whether these concerns can be resolved through legislation. Special submission points • Would compliance costs be significantly reduced if businesses were able to assume that contractors they engage have a certificate of exemption if they are registered for GST? • What options are available to deal with the compliance-risk concern? Reviewing the PAYE intermediaries’ subsidy 6.38 Since 1 October 2006, the government has subsidised the use of payroll agents (known as PAYE intermediaries) to meet the PAYE obligations of small businesses. The subsidy is available to employers with up to five employees. 6.39 The aim of the subsidy is to offset some of the costs of complying with PAYE by contributing towards a small employer’s cost of using a PAYE intermediary for assistance in meeting its PAYE obligations. The benefits include: • reduced compliance costs and penalties for non-compliance for smaller businesses; • more time for smaller employers to focus their efforts on their business, rather than compliance activities; • an improvement in the timeliness of payments and quality of information supplied to Inland Revenue; and • increased efficiency in the PAYE system in general, as PAYE intermediaries provide services to a large number of employers, using their skills and technology to increase the accuracy and timeliness of returns. 42 The issue 6.40 While still in its infancy, the PAYE subsidy has not had significant take-up by employers. This may be for a variety of reasons, such as the negative impact on an employer’s cash-flow of not retaining PAYE deductions, the costs of engaging a PAYE intermediary to handle the payroll, the fact that the subsidy does not cover assistance with other employment-related taxes such as FBT, or the fact that it only applies to the first five employees. The government welcomes submissions on whether the existing PAYE subsidy is effective and why taxpayers are not yet taking up this opportunity. 6.41 If retention of the PAYE subsidy is preferred by taxpayers, there are possible ways in which it may be improved. These are discussed below and those making submissions are asked to rank these in order of perceived importance. Possible solutions Extending subsidy application to other taxes 6.42 A question for consideration is whether the PAYE subsidy should be extended to other employment-related taxes – for example, FBT. This would improve SMEs’ access to expert assistance, decreasing the likelihood of errors. The estimated cost to the government of implementing this change would be about $1 million a year. Increasing the rate of subsidy 6.43 Increasing the rate of subsidy would mean that greater assistance from PAYE intermediaries would be possible. However, increasing the subsidy may entail a significant fiscal cost (for example, an estimated ongoing annual cost to the government of about $10 million to raise the subsidy to $3 per employee). Accordingly, this option may need to be ranked in terms of its priority and considered alongside other simplification initiatives. Increasing the number of employees covered 6.44 There are a number of factors to weigh up in considering an increase to the number of employees covered by the PAYE subsidy. For example, in order to use a PAYE intermediary, a business typically must pay over the entire amount of an employee’s salary or wages at the time that they are due to be paid to the employee. 6.45 The PAYE intermediary will pay the employee’s net wages immediately, but it pays PAYE and other deductions over to Inland Revenue at a later date. This means that the PAYE and other deductions will enhance the intermediary’s cash-flow, earning income through the time-value of money. The employer foregoes this time-value of money by using the PAYE intermediary. Larger businesses may be able to negotiate lower fees in return for the time-value of money advantage the payroll firm will receive, but smaller businesses may not be able to do so. 43 6.46 Accordingly, once a business has a certain number of employees, given the time-value of money consideration, it may be more cost-effective to manage payroll transactions within the firm instead of engaging a PAYE intermediary to perform the service. 6.47 The estimated cost to the government of extending the PAYE subsidy to six or seven employees would be about $4 to 8 million a year. Special submission points Is the existing PAYE subsidy effective and should it be retained? If the PAYE subsidy should be retained, please rank the following options as possible improvements to the system: • extending the subsidy’s application to other employment-related taxes; • increasing the rate of subsidy; and • increasing the number of employees covered by the subsidy. 44 CHAPTER 7 Information sharing 7.1 The government wants to create a business environment which minimises compliance requirements and costs so that businesses can focus on their domestic and international growth. 7.2 Multiple requests for the same business information from a range of government agencies can be an irritant and can impose unnecessary compliance costs on businesses. Requests to fill in different forms with the same core business information (company name, physical and email addresses and registration details) on every form used in a transaction between business and government may result because government agencies are unable to share information. 7.3 This chapter aims to open up discussion around the issue of information sharing and compliance. The government would like to gauge the extent to which businesses, and in particular SMEs, consider current levels of co- ordination of information between specific government agencies impose an unnecessary compliance burden. It would also like feedback on measures that the government could take to deal with any problems and mitigate any associated risks. The current situation 7.4 A significant number of government agencies request information from businesses annually, 13 but are unable to share it because of incompatible IT systems, a lack of formal co-ordination, and privacy concerns. Table 1 provides a broad summary of the government information requirements for a typical SME. 13 The Companies Office, Department of Labour, Inland Revenue, Statistics New Zealand, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, New Zealand Customs, Food Safety Authority, Ministry of Transport, Accident Compensation Corporation, Ministry of Social Development, Ministry of Health, Immigration New Zealand, Environmental Risk Management Authority, Ministry of Education and various local authorities.

Sector-specific only 7.5 To improve the efficiency in transactions between business and the government, one option for information sharing would be a co-ordinated, minimised, verified, secure and up-to-date electronic collection and storage system for core business information. This system might include elements such as: • a single point of entry for business and government departments to all government services and interactions; • greater information sharing between government agencies to prevent repeat information requests, brought about by improving compatibility between IT systems; 46 • “pre-population” 14 of forms after businesses provide their core information to the government; • online completion of necessary business-government interactions; • online alerts for upcoming information/filing requirements; • personal log-ons that allow businesses to access all personal information held by government; and • using business reporting protocols (Standard Business Reporting). 7.6 Submissions on what features might be considered necessary in an electronic information sharing system are welcomed. 7.7 It is acknowledged that certain legislation, such as the secrecy provisions contained in section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Privacy Act, are there to protect and ensure the confidentiality required by taxpayers and citizens in general. It is critical that any system intended to maximise the efficiency of government transactions with taxpayers does not compromise these rights. Initiatives to effect compliance cost reductions and information sharing 7.8 Some recent or current information sharing initiatives are: • The Ministry of Economic Development, in conjunction with Inland Revenue, ACC and Statistics New Zealand, is preparing a report on Standard Business Reporting in New Zealand, investigating the feasibility of developing a centralised repository for duplicated business information, with the need for taxpayer confidentiality in mind. • Information sharing between the New Zealand Companies Office (NZCO) and Inland Revenue means the allocation of a tax number and GST registration can now occur simultaneously with online company incorporation. • The 2006 Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC) provides a framework for grouping companies by industrial classification and contains information on a company’s “main business activity”. This information could be stored and shared for statistical research, policy and analysis purposes by both the public and private sectors as a “real time” snapshot of the business activities of New Zealand firms at any time. This has the potential to reduce some of the survey burdens on business. 14 The automatic generation of completed or partially completed information in an electronic form from previously supplied information. 47 • The State Services Commission (SSC) is enforcing standards across all government websites to aid accessibility and information sharing. SSC aims to have all government transactions online by 2010, and has begun implementing the Government Logon Service, which will enable users to adopt the same log-on to access all central government sites. Planned or possible future initiatives 7.9 Initiatives currently underway or planned include: • Future collaboration with the Companies Office so that Inland Revenue will be able to access real-time NZCO data updates to find out contemporaneously when a company has gone out of business. Start- up firms will also be able to register for PAYE at the point of incorporation. • Work investigating the appropriateness and feasibility of implementing a Standard Business Reporting system is being undertaken. This would enable a business’s financial data to be posted once and then drawn down as required by government agencies. • Making the business.govt.nz portal (launched in August 2007) the sole entry point for businesses seeking to interact with government. • Enabling businesses to provide commonly sought data (such as the number of employees, physical address and changes of address) only once to government, with all agencies advised of this information and subsequent forms being pre-populated for the business. Special submission points The government is interested in receiving submissions on the following matters: • How significant a concern for business is the current lack of information sharing, and to what extent would dealing with those concerns reduce the compliance burden for businesses? • What information, in particular, should be shared across government departments? What information should specifically not be shared? • Are there any initiatives described in this chapter that stand out as being of immediate importance? • If a centralised data system were to be developed, what specific concerns would there be regarding taxpayer confidentiality? 48 CHAPTER 8 Other matters 8.1 In addition to the changes suggested in this discussion document, the government is looking at a number of other ways to reduce the amount of time that businesses must spend on dealing with their tax obligations. Use-of-money interest 8.2 The government is reviewing the existing use-of-money interest rate-setting methodology as a result of concerns raised by taxpayers over its appropriateness and sustainability. Decisions are expected on this in 2008. Making better use of technology 8.3 In developing tax policy, one of the factors taken into account is the effect a proposal is likely to have on the compliance costs of taxpayers. Inevitably, some proposals will increase compliance costs for businesses, although government makes every effort to minimise these costs. For example, to minimise compliance costs associated with KiwiSaver, the scheme is administered through Inland Revenue, thus ensuring that many of the costs of running employee superannuation schemes are borne by the government. KiwiSaver was also designed to work within existing systems, and the KiwiSaver rules use concepts and definitions that are already used in tax law. 8.4 Better ways of using technology can also help to reduce compliance costs. In this respect Inland Revenue is constantly looking at ways to improve its systems – by promoting electronic filing of returns and providing online calculators. 8.5 Some of the issues raised in this chapter concern areas where systems could in future be redesigned to reduce compliance costs (bearing in mind redesigning systems is time-consuming and costly). Views are sought on what measures should be prioritised for future change. Employer monthly schedules 8.6 Some recent tax changes, such as KiwiSaver, have been implemented using the employer monthly schedule (EMS). The EMS is the form which is completed by an employer or PAYE intermediary monthly (or, in the case of a larger employer, twice-monthly) setting out the gross earnings of employees and the deductions made from those earnings. This includes PAYE, withholding tax deductions, child support and student loan deductions, KiwiSaver deductions and KiwiSaver employer contributions. 49 8.7 Reducing the compliance costs associated with the EMS – for example, by creating a more user-friendly form that is better able to interface with payroll systems, would require a redesign of Inland Revenue’s systems and, in particular, the IT systems used for processing PAYE and KiwiSaver. 8.8 Redesigning systems is a lengthy process. Inland Revenue has undertaken some initial analysis which suggests that any redesigned system would benefit from the following features: • an electronic interface over the internet; • systems support; • filing and payment services; • “real-time” processing of information; • a two-way exchange of information between employers and Inland Revenue; • tailoring of services to support employers’ circumstances; and • use of Standard Business Reporting to support system-to-system filing and payment services. 8.9 Before a project of this nature could be undertaken, Inland Revenue would work alongside businesses to understand how they produce information and how systems should be redesigned to work smoothly with existing business processes. 8.10 In the longer term, systems would be designed so that all taxpayers could file EMS schedules and other returns electronically. If Inland Revenue systems are designed to integrate electronically with employers’ payroll systems, and with payroll processing firms’ systems, compliance costs could be significantly reduced because taxpayers would no longer be required to transfer data from one system to another. In the meantime, some costs could be reduced by redesigning existing paper-based processes so they fit better with information produced by employers’ payroll systems. Personal tax summaries 8.11 A personal tax summary (PTS) shows salary or wage earners their income and tax deduction details for the year. These details are based on the employment, New Zealand superannuation or benefit information provided to Inland Revenue each month. Inland Revenue automatically issues a PTS to some taxpayers (for example, because they have used an incorrect tax code) in June or July each year. Other taxpayers may request a PTS. 8.12 One of the matters raised during initial consultations was whether interest and dividend income and the resident withholding tax deducted from that income could be included in PTS. This could be achieved, for example, by requiring corporates to file dividend statements electronically and then linking this information to the PTS. 50 8.13 Making this change would require major changes to Inland Revenue’s systems and would be more likely to benefit individual taxpayers rather than SMEs more generally. In addition, requiring corporates to file their dividend statements electronically could result in an increase in compliance costs for this group, which would need to be balanced with the compliance cost savings of other taxpayers such as SMEs. Cash-basis accounting for tax purposes 8.14 Consideration has been given to the possibility of allowing small taxpayers to use cash-basis accounting for income tax purposes in order to reduce the number of adjustments required when preparing an income tax return. However, because of tax-base risks, concerns over the potential fiscal cost of this measure and significant transitional and boundary issues, such a change is not proposed at this stage. Submissions on this matter, along with ways of addressing tax-base risks and fiscal costs are, however, welcome if this change would substantially reduce business tax compliance costs. Accrual adjustments to tax deductible expenditure 8.15 Expenditure that is deductible for income tax purposes must generally be adjusted for accruals that exist at the end of the income year. Determination E11 specifies certain circumstances where accrual expenditure adjustments are not required for income tax purposes. 15 8.16 There are three components to Determination E11: • a description of expenditure potentially exempted from the prepayments provisions; • details of a maximum amount of the applicable accrual, if the exemption is to be available; and • details of a maximum term for some applicable expenses, if the exemption is to be available. 8.17 Submissions on possible changes that could be made by the Commissioner to this determination are welcome if the changes would substantially reduce tax compliance costs without raising tax-base concerns. Depreciation rules 8.18 In recent years, following a comprehensive review of the depreciation rules, the government has made a number of improvements to these rules. Among these changes was an increase to the low-value asset write-off threshold, which served to reduce the number of assets that are required to be capitalised and depreciated for income tax purposes, thereby reducing compliance costs in this area. 15 Tax Information Bulletin, Vol. 16, No. 3, April 2004. 51 8.19 Given that a comprehensive review of depreciation has already recently taken place, and that the fiscal cost of changes in this area are generally high relative to the marginal compliance cost saving opportunities, the government does not consider further changes in this area are warranted at this time. 52 APPENDIX SME measures in other countries Australia Australia operates a simplified taxation system (STS) for smaller businesses that meet certain requirements. Under this system, eligible businesses have simplified requirements for tax purposes, such as the ability to: • calculate certain income and deductions on a receipts or payments basis; • immediately expense depreciating assets costing A$1,000 or less; • use simplified tax depreciation rules for depreciating assets; and • use simplified rules for calculating the value of closing trading stock. The Australian government recently passed legislation to standardise the eligibility criteria for access to small business tax simplification concessions. Applying from 1 July 2007, these measures include the adoption of one definition for “small business” that enable a business with an annual turnover of less than $2 million to access the various small business concessions available for capital gains tax (CGT), pay as you go (PAYG) instalments, GST and FBT. Businesses meeting the $2 million annual turnover test can choose which concessions apply. Australia’s recent simplification package STS Annual turnover < $1 million GST GST turnover < $1 to 2 million CGT Active assets < $5 million FBT Ordinary income + statutory income < $10 million PAYG instalments Instalment income < $1 million Annual turnover < $2 million (96% of businesses) Simplified trading stock rules Simpler depreciation rules A 2-year amendment period Immediate deductions for certain prepaid business expenses Entrepreneurs’ tax offset Choice to account for GST on a cash basis Choice to pay GST by instalments Annual apportionment of GST input tax credits Simplified accounting methods for GST CGT 15-year asset exemption CGT 50% active asset reduction CGT retirement exemption CGT rollover provisions FBT carparking concession PAYG instalments based on notional tax Current individual concessions 5 different small business tests The new small business framework 1 small business test Small businesses would be eligible for: 53 Canada In Canada, businesses must generally pay income tax in instalments and account for GST or harmonised sales tax (HST). Further, they are required to make deductions from employees’ wages for income tax, pensions and employment insurance contributions, and remit these to the government. In an effort to further reduce the tax compliance burden of small businesses, the 2007 Canadian Budget proposed to allow small businesses to reduce the number of tax remittances and filings they are required to make. The proposed measures include: • introducing quarterly instalments of corporate income tax to replace monthly instalments for certain small companies; • increasing the corporate income tax payable threshold (at or below which corporations may pay annually) to $3,000; • increasing the average monthly withholdings threshold (below which businesses may be eligible to pay source deductions quarterly) to $3,000; • increasing the taxable supplies threshold (at or below which businesses can annually file a GST/HST return) to $1.5 million; and • increasing the net tax threshold (below which annual GST/HST return filers can remit the tax annually) to $3,000. United Kingdom The United Kingdom has recently completed measuring the administrative burden 16 of the tax system and percentage reduction targets have been set to reduce this by up to 15 percent over five years. The United Kingdom has also increased the VAT registration threshold, reducing the number of taxpayers required to file. There are a number of methods by which VAT can be returned to ease compliance and match the nature of a taxpayer’s business (for example, a cash or payments-basis method). In addition, a rewrite of the United Kingdom tax legislation into clearer, simpler language has been largely completed. United States The United States Internal Revenue Service provides a website for small business and the self-employed, which brings together helpful tax-related information in relation to starting, operating, and ceasing a business. The United States has also for some time been looking to reduce the burden of tax administration. Since 2006, certain employers can file their employment tax returns annually and pay the taxes with their returns. Further, in November 2005, the President’s Tax Advisory Panel recommended two tax reform plans. These plans for small business included simplified cash-basis accounting or business cash-flow tax and the immediate expensing of certain business assets. 16 Comprising activities such as: return, application, and form filing and other interactions with HM Revenue & Customs such as audit activities.

For the purposes of certification discussed in this document, the actuary should be as defined in current tax legislation, which broadly is a Fellow of the New Zealand Society of Actuaries or a person who holds an equivalent qualification. Annual renewable policies. Term life insurance that may be renewed from year to year without evidence of insurability by acceptance of a premium for a new policy term. The premiums under these policies usually increase in cost each year. Annuity. There are many types of annuities but, basically, they are a contract between the investor and an insurance company under which the investor makes a lump-sum payment or series of payments. In return, the insurer agrees to make periodic payments to the investor beginning immediately or at some future date, with the payments continuing for a set period or until the death of the annuitant. They may include a terminal death benefit that will pay the investor’s beneficiary a guaranteed minimum amount, such as total purchase payments. Claim.\* Request for payment from the insurance company by the insured as a result of an insured event occurring. In life insurance, survivors submit a claim when the insured dies. The insurance company investigates the claim and pays the appropriate amount if the claim is found to be legitimate, or denies the claim if it determines the loss was fraudulent or not covered by the policy. Endowment policy. These policies have features similar to those of a whole of life policy but the sum insured is payable upon the survival of the insured life to a certain age or date, or upon prior death. Expected death strain (EDS). Expected level of claims against a life insurer as calculated by an actuary. Fair dividend rate (FDR).\* From 1 April 2007 it is the general method for determining foreign investment fund income with respect to less than 10% interests in foreign companies other than some listed Australian companies. It is generally a deemed return of 5% of the market value of the shares held by the taxpayer on the first day of the income year. Natural persons have the option of using the actual return but not a loss. Group life. A single life insurance policy under which individuals in a group – for example, employees and their dependents – are covered. Incurred but not reported (IBNR). Losses occurring over a specified period that have not been reported to the insurer. International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 4. A financial accounting standard that applies to virtually all insurance contracts (including reinsurance contracts) that an entity issues and to reinsurance contracts that it holds. KiwiSaver.\* A work-based voluntary savings initiative set up by the government to help New Zealanders save for their retirement. Level premium term insurance (sometimes referred to as level term insurance). Term insurance that provides consistent coverage over a specified amount of time for a guaranteed level premium cost. The face value of a level term policy usually remains the same for the duration of the period selected. The premium is usually constant over the term of the policy. Level term coverage usually lasts for 10, 15, or 20 years. The product does not usually build cash value. Life insurance.\* A contract in which one party agrees to pay a given sum upon the happening of a particular event contingent upon the duration of human life in consideration of a smaller sum or certain equivalent periodical payment by another. Life office base (LOB). Defined under the current tax rules. It combines underwriting profit (as defined in the legislation) and investment income less expenses. See also “policyholder base”. 2 Margin on services (MoS). The MoS valuation method is used for valuing policy liabilities which, by incorporating profit margins in policy liabilities, seeks to release profit as it is earned through the provisions of services and the receipt of the related income. The New Zealand Society of Actuaries has a professional standard which covers the calculation of policy liabilities under the MoS method. Mortality. Actuaries use mortality tables that show, for a person at each age, what the probability is that they will die before their next birthday as well as statistics such as the probability of surviving to any particular year of age and remaining life expectancy for people at different ages. The tables usually take into account risk characteristics such as gender, age and smoking status, and can also have regard to occupation and socio-economic status. Outstanding claims reserve (OCR). A provision made by an insurance company for all claims that have been made and for which the insurer is liable, but which had not been settled at the balance sheet date. Participating policy (also known as “with- profits policy”). A policy that entitles the policyholder to participate in distributions of profit – as most whole of life and endowment policies are. Policyholder. The owner of an insurance policy, usually, but not always, the insured. Policyholder base (PHB).\* The PHB is part of the two-tier calculation of life insurance income under current tax rules. It attempts to tax the economic income (subject to certain tax adjustments) of policyholders. (Also see “life office base”.) Policyholder income. New taxation rules proposed in this document that aim to tax the economic income (subject to certain tax adjustments) of policyholders. Portfolio investment entity (PIE). A collective investment vehicle that elects to be a PIE for tax purposes. The difference between PIEs and other investment vehicles is that PIEs are not subject to tax on trading in New Zealand and some listed Australian equities, and most PIEs may attribute income to individual investors and apply tax at their rate (subject to a cap of 30% from 1 April 2008). Premium.\* The periodic payment made on an insurance policy. Premium loading.\* The premium calculated from mortality and interest factors is a net premium, and adjustments, or loadings, will have to be made to arrive at the actual premium chargeable. The major loading is to cover the expenses of the life insurer. There will also be a safety margin to guard against higher than expected mortality and a profit margin. Tax legislation calculates premium loading by formulas for the purposes of the current life insurance rules. Premium smoothing reserve (PSR). The PSR is a method in the life tax rules proposed in this document to recognise premium income for risk products or risk elements of savings products during the periods when premium rates are contractually guaranteed or in a period when level premiums are payable. Reinsurance. A contract whereby one party, called the reinsurer, in consideration of a premium paid to it agrees to indemnify another party, called the reinsured, for part or all of the liability assumed by the latter party under a policy or policies of insurance which it has issued. Reserve. The amount of funds or assets necessary for a life insurer to have at any given time to enable it, with interest and premiums paid as they accrue, to meet all future claims and expenses on the insurance then in force. However, for tax purposes, different calculations are required. It is proposed in this document that the reserves for tax purposes will consist of either a premium smoothing reserve or an unearned premium reserve, and an outstanding claims reserve for claims. Shareholder.\* Any person, company, or other entity that owns at least one share in a company. Shareholders are the owners of a company. They have the potential to profit if the company does well, but that comes with the potential to lose (in terms of the amount invested) if the company does poorly. Shareholder income. New taxation rules proposed in this document which aim to tax the economic income (subject to certain tax adjustments) of the shareholder. Surrender value (SV) (also known as “cash value”, and “policyholder's equity”). The sum of money an insurance company will pay to the policyholder or annuity holder in the event his or her policy is voluntarily terminated before its maturity or the insured event occurs. This cash value is the savings component of life insurance policies. 3 Term insurance. The sum insured is payable only if death occurs during a specified period of time. Premiums usually rise with age (though see level term insurance).This product does not build cash value. Traditional products. Participating and non- participating whole of life and endowment policies. Unearned premium reserve (UPR). The sum of all the premiums representing the unexpired portions of the policies which the insurer has on its books as of a certain date. It is usually calculated by a formula of averages of issue dates and the length of term. The reserve is equivalent to the amount of return premium due to policyholders if the insurer terminates the insurance. Under the rules proposed in this document, the UPR will apply for risk products or risk elements of other products where premiums are stepped yearly or where premium rates are not contractually guaranteed. Unit-linked products. These generally provide a savings vehicle in which the policyholder shares directly in returns of the asset pool, with no guarantee of performance, similar to a unit trust. As such, the investment risk is borne by the policyholder rather than the life insurance company. Whole of life. The policy guarantees payment of the sum insured, so long as premiums are kept up to date. The policy can be cashed in or surrendered before maturity, although the time when the policy is cashed in will determine what amounts are received (which are generally at the discretion of the insurer). Premiums are level throughout the life of the insured. When the policy is a participating policy the holder is entitled to bonuses that add to the amount of the benefit and are also received on death or maturity of the policy. \* These terms are also defined in section YA (1) of the Income Tax Act 2007. The Glossary definition provides their ordinary meaning unless specifically expressed otherwise. 4 5 CHAPTER 1 New rules for taxing the life insurance business 1.1 Although the provision of life insurance undoubtedly has benefits for those for whom it is intended, there is no compelling reason for giving life insurance companies greater tax benefits than are enjoyed by other producers of goods and services. Tax concessions effectively exist for them, nevertheless. 1.2 Since the tax rules relating to life insurance companies were enacted in 1990, there have been significant changes to life insurance products, to New Zealand’s business environment generally, and to the way income in collective investment vehicles is taxed. They all make it timely to review the rules relating to the provision of life insurance and to bring them up to date. 1.3 Individuals who save through life insurance products face a higher tax burden than do other savers who invest directly or through managed funds that become portfolio investment entities (PIEs). To remove this disadvantage, the proposed rules extend PIE tax benefits, where applicable, to investment income earned for the benefit of policyholders. 1.4 On the other hand, term insurance, a major part of life insurance business now but a minor part when the rules were enacted, is significantly under-taxed and, in many cases, profitable business generates artificial tax losses for the insurers. It is this sort of unintended concession for the life insurance industry that the proposed changes seek to remove. 1.5 The changes proposed in this discussion document have emerged from a government review of the taxation of the life insurance business. Most of the life insurers that were consulted in the course of the review agreed with the need for reform of the tax rules, although they did not always agree on the details of the changes that were needed. 1.6 A core objective of the rules proposed here is for life insurance companies to pay no less and no more tax on their profits than would any other business. 1.7 This discussion document looks at problems relating to the taxation of the life insurance business in New Zealand and outlines proposals for changing the rules. Chapters 1 to 3 are intended for a wider, non-specialist audience, while the remaining chapters assume a certain degree of specialist knowledge about the business of life insurance. 6 Will the changes raise the cost of insurance premiums? 1.8 In the development of the proposed changes, extensive consultation has taken place over the last year with the life insurance industry, actuarial and accounting professionals and their professional associations, representatives of life insurance advisers, the home equity release industry, and other people interested in life insurance taxation. In the course of that consultation, some life insurers argued that if the current rules were changed they would have to increase the cost of life insurance to their customers. 1.9 The government’s response is that tax is a business cost, and life insurance companies should not rely on tax benefits to make a profit. They should be able to conduct their business on an equal footing within their industry and with other businesses. Again, there are no compelling arguments for the life insurance industry to be preferred over other sectors of the economy. 1.10 Furthermore, there should be minimal tax-related reasons for prices to increase on policies taken out before 1 April 2009. Profits on those policies will not be subject to the proposed rules for a further five years from the application date (in other words, not until the 2014–15 income year) and, in some cases, will remain taxed under current rules until the policies expire or mature. The proposed rules will apply only to products sold after 31 March 2009. 1.11 Even then, the impact on premium prices is uncertain and will not be the same for all members of the life insurance industry. Not all life insurers or products enjoy the same effective level of tax benefits under the current rules, and, as occurs in any industry, some insurers have cost structures that are more efficient than others and can respond to economic changes better. 1.12 Premium prices are also affected by general market forces as well as factors such as overall health and mortality, and the rate of commissions to advisers who sell life insurance. Commissions are the biggest expense, after death claims, for the majority of term insurance products. 1 On the other hand, other recent tax reforms such as the reduction in the company tax rate to 30% and the application of the PIE rules and fair dividend rate rules to life insurers should tend to reduce the price of life insurance. Other options investigated 1.13 Chapter 2 discusses the weaknesses of the current tax rules and the reason for replacing them with the proposed rules. The proposals are based on the model discussed in the officials’ paper, Life Insurance tax reform: Suggestions for reform, 2 and the resulting consultation. During the submission process, two alternative options were put forward, and these were considered but rejected for reasons that are discussed in Appendix 4. 1 For a recent discussion on the rate of commissions for life insurance products see “Adviser Commissions Dominate Discussion”, Good Returns, 27 July 2007. 2 Published by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue, February 2007. This paper followed up Life insurance tax reform: Officials’ paper No 1 – scope of the reform, published by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue, September 2006. Both papers are available at www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz . 7 1.14 In developing the proposed rules, the tax treatment of life insurers and policyholders in other jurisdictions has been closely examined (see Appendices 1 and 2). New Zealanders’ investment income is now taxed under the portfolio investment entity (PIE) tax rules, so in bringing policyholders’ investment income under those rules, as is proposed, overseas precedent is limited. 1.15 A number of countries tax claims or benefits received by policyholders either under income tax or through inheritance tax. Although this option was raised in submissions, the government considers that taxing claims is contrary to New Zealand tax law principles (under which the claim is generally a capital item). Furthermore, with the abolition of estate duty in 1992, there is no basis to subject the estate of claimants to an inheritance tax. 1.16 Some countries provide tax deductions (in some cases up to certain limits) to policyholders for premiums paid, as happened in New Zealand up to 17 December 1987. In some countries, the deductibility is for premiums to life savings policies, and in many cases, the claims are taxable, as previously discussed. Tax preferencing of life insurance over and above other taxpayers is not acceptable, for reasons discussed in Chapter 3. 1.17 Life insurers are taxed in a variety of ways internationally. New Zealand is in a small minority by taxing underwriting profits by way of formula (discussed in Chapter 2). Many countries use financial accounts as the starting point, and this has the effect of largely taxing life insurers on their actual profits. The proposed rules favour a general insurance approach to the taxation of risk profits and fee income, similar in concept (though not necessarily in detail) to present Australian tax rules, which aim to tax the insurer fairly on the economic profits derived from that business. Summary of proposed changes • The proposed rules separate the taxation of income from a life insurance business into that earned by the equity owners of the company (shareholder income), and the income for policyholders of life insurance savings products (policyholder income). • Shareholder income will consist of underwriting profits from risk business; traditional business profit attributable to shareholders; fees and charges; and net investment income from shareholder funds. Therefore life insurers will be fairly taxed on all their profits. • Tax will be payable at the company tax rate, net of any credits related to the income. All other provisions that apply to corporate taxpayers, including imputation credit rules, loss carry forward and grouping, will apply to the life insurer in respect of shareholder income. 8 • Policyholder income will consist of investment income from policyholder funds (reduced by distributions of with-profits income to shareholders) net of deductible charges and fees, and calculated under ordinary tax principles (as amended by the PIE and fair dividend rate rules). Tax at the top PIE rate will be paid (net of any credits) by the life insurer on policyholders’ behalf as a final tax. • Subject to interest from the industry in developing a suitable methodology, a life insurer may elect for net investment income to be “attributed” to policyholders and so subject to tax at investors’ prescribed investor rates (19.5% or 30%). • Policyholder income cannot be offset with losses or credits from either shareholders’ income or any other company in the life insurer’s tax group. • The proposed rules will apply to life insurers on the first day of their income year that begins after 31 March 2009. Term insurance products sold before 1 April 2009 will effectively be taxed under existing rules for a period of up to five income years from application date and for the duration of the policy for some single premium and level term products. What is not affected by these proposed changes 1.18 Life insurance premiums are not tax-deductible, except for certain income replacement products, and proceeds of claims are not taxable to individuals. That will not change. 1.19 The discussion document does not deal with annuities, which relatively few companies offer today. The government has a clear preference for bringing annuities into the new life rules, but that would raise a number of questions that are outside the scope of this discussion document. Annuities may be dealt with in future considerations. Submissions 1.20 The government invites submissions on any aspect of the issues raised or the proposals made in this discussion document. Without limiting the range of matters that we want feedback on, we would particularly be interested in comments on: • What technical problems are there in the proposed rules? Are they fair to all stakeholders in the life insurance business (including the government)? • Are there feasible ways to correctly attribute investment income to individual policyholders? • What are the expected initial and continuing costs of complying with the proposed rules (compared with the continuing costs of complying with the current rules)? 9 1.21 Submissions should be made by 12 February 2008 and be addressed to: Taxation of Life Insurance C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington Or e-mail policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Taxation of Life Insurance” in the subject line. 1.22 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for Inland Revenue and Treasury officials to contact those making the submission to discuss the points raised, if required. 1.23 Submissions may be the source of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those making a submission that feel there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under the Act should indicate this clearly. 10 CHAPTER 2 Why the rules need to be changed 2.1 The current rules for taxing life insurers have applied since 1990 and are no longer appropriate for the modern insurance and savings environment. Although a number of submissions on the suggestions set out in the earlier officials’ paper 3 agreed that change to the current rules was necessary, a small number of submissions disagreed, arguing that the current rules accurately taxed the economic income of all stakeholders. 2.2 Therefore, before outlining the proposed new rules, this chapter discusses why the current taxation of life insurers requires change in the context of two key principles: that economically equivalent entities, products and services, should be taxed equivalently (often referred to as neutrality), and all taxpayers should contribute their fair share in taxes (equity). The current rules 2.3 Although the current rules do not contain explicit tax concessions for policyholders, term life insurance products are effectively under-taxed. Individuals generally cannot claim a tax deduction or get a tax credit for life insurance premiums paid (as happens in some countries) but, on the other hand, they are not taxed on insurance proceeds. In its 1989 report, the Consultative Committee considered this to be the correct treatment. 4 2.4 The current rules tax life insurers on a two-tier basis. The first tier, the life office base (LOB), taxes the income earned for the benefit of both shareholders and policyholders of the life insurer (and a re-insurer) as a whole. It consists of: • gross income (including realised gains on equities and other property but not premiums from policyholders or life reinsurance claims); 5 • less expenses (with the exception of reinsurance premiums and claims credited to policyholders); • plus underwriting income. 3 Life insurance tax reform: Officials’ paper No 2 – suggestions for reform, published by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue, February 2007. 4 “4.3.2 Policies covering private risks. In respect of premiums paid to cover private or non-business risks, a fairly strong case can be made for non-deductibility. This is the current treatment of all policies covering private risks except disablement policies providing replacement income. The Committee considers that such premiums should, in theory, be non-deductible. Claims would of course become non-assessable.” Tax Treatment of Life Insurance and Related Areas: August 1989; Report of the Consultative Committee. 5 The reinsurance components of the claims and premiums are netted only when the reinsurer is taxed in New Zealand. 11 2.5 Underwriting income arises from three sources (as laid down by statutory formulas): • profit on mortality, being the expected death strain (EDS) (in simple terms, the expected claims), less the actual death strain (in simple terms, actual claims); • profit on termination risks; and • premium loading, deemed to be 20 percent of the EDS and one percent of reserves released on death in the case of life annuities. The formula is intended to bring in as income the profit and expenses of the life insurer from providing the risk spreading service to the policyholder. 2.6 Income accruing to policyholders is taxed to the life insurer on a proxy basis under the policyholder base (PHB). Income is calculated by a formula equal to the increase in reserves plus benefits (such as claims) paid plus underwriting income less premiums. The tax base is grossed up by (1 – the LOB tax rate) to arrive at the before-tax amount necessary to provide the after-tax benefit implicit in the policy. Tax paid on the LOB generates imputation credits that can then be used to meet the PHB liability (thus avoiding double taxation) or as tax credits on dividends paid to shareholders. 2.7 There are two fundamental problems with these rules. The first is that they under-tax term insurance profits. The second is that they over-tax savings income. Term insurance 2.8 At the time the current life insurance tax rules were enacted, the vast majority of life insurance business was the traditional risk protection and savings products such as whole of life and endowment policies. Term insurance, which was small in 1990, however, now comprises the majority of total life insurance premiums written. Term insurance is a pure risk product that pays out only on death (within the term of the policy). There is no savings component. 6 2.9 The key factor in the taxation of term insurance is the premium loading formula. In practice, 20 percent of EDS bears no relationship to actual profit. Typically, the expenses of many term insurance products are at least, and in many cases considerably more than 20 percent of expected claims, implying that such products will always generate a loss for tax under the formula. The anomalous tax result is illustrated in the following example: 6 There are varying types of term insurance products with different premiums and benefit characteristics. These include: • regular premium increasing with age, such as term life and yearly renewable contracts; • level premium with no reducing sum insured; • level premium with reducing sum insured, such as home loan repayment insurance; and • single premium, such as lump sum mortgage repayment insurance. 12 Financial accounting LOB Tax Premiums 100 Claims (=Expected claims) (50) 0 Investment income 10 10 Expenses (35) (35) Premium loading (20% claims) 10 Accounting profit/ tax (loss) 25 (15) 2.10 In this example, where there is a loss ratio (claims ÷ premiums) of 50%, a $25 accounting profit translates into a $15 tax loss. This tax loss may be offset against other profitable business of the company, or with that of another company that is part of the same wholly owned tax group as the life insurer, in which case the after-tax return to the life insurer (at a 30% tax rate) is $29.50. 2.11 Even more incongruously, greater accounting profit on term insurance business may result in a greater tax loss. If another life insurer had the same financial accounting results as in the previous example except that claims were $25 (a loss ratio of 25%), the accounting profit and the LOB tax would be as follows: Financial accounting LOB Tax Premiums 100 Claims (=Expected claims) (25) 0 Investment income 10 10 Expenses (35) (35) Premium loading (20% claims) 5 Accounting profit/ tax (loss) 50 (20) 2.12 The lower expected claims result in a premium loading for tax of $5 and a tax loss of ($20). So, although accounting profit is actually $25 higher than in the first example, the corresponding tax loss is also higher. 2.13 Artificial tax losses such as these demonstrate that the tax system is effectively providing a subsidy to insurers, which was not the intent of the legislation. In effect, life insurers are not being taxed on the profit they make on term risk business and so are treated more favourably than other businesses. 13 Savings 2.14 Policyholders can save through certain life insurance products, the main examples being participating whole of life and endowment policies, investment bonds, unit-linked products and annuities. The PHB taxes unrealised investment gains. In contrast, investors who hold investments directly or through PIEs are not taxed on realised or unrealised gains on New Zealand and Australian equity investments. They are also taxed at investors’ marginal tax rates, not at a proxy rate of tax. 2.15 The PIE rules, which seek tax neutrality between direct investments and investments made through intermediated savings vehicles, currently exclude life insurance, 7 principally because of the technical complexity of life insurance products and life insurance tax rules. PIE benefits should, however, where feasible, be extended to policyholder investment income. Need for change 2.16 Attempting to deal with these problems by simply amending the current rules in an ad hoc way is not a viable option, in the government’s view. For example, increasing the premium loading to a more realistic level would create winners and losers as loss ratios differ between term products and life insurers. What is needed is an approach that better reflects taxing on actual results. 2.17 Incorporating savings products in the PIE rules without addressing the term insurance issue is also inappropriate as it would exacerbate the under-taxation of life insurance income. It would also mean that life insurance tax would develop in an ad hoc and arbitrary fashion and would further add to the complexity of the tax rules. 2.18 The government therefore proposes to replace the current life tax rules with new rules and, in the case of savings products, incorporate them, where relevant and feasible, into the PIE rules. The proposed rules are outlined in the following chapters. 7 Once enacted, legislation in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Business Taxation, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Bill will allow policyholders with unit-linked life insurance products to have access to some of the benefits of the new PIE rules with effect from 1 October 2007. 14 CHAPTER 3 The proposed changes 3.1 When the current rules were enacted, most large insurance companies were mutual companies, and the vast majority of insurance consisted of traditional participating products. Accordingly, someone who bought such a product bought not only a combination of life risk protection and savings, but also an equity interest (usually implying some level of ownership rights) in the company. However, since 1990 all the large life insurers have demutualised, with the result that no large mutual life insurers now operate in New Zealand. 3.2 For this reason, life insurance companies now typically operate through a limited liability corporate structure (though some operate as branches of foreign companies) in which traditional participating policyholders have no ownership rights. The various relationships within a typical life insurance company are shown in figure 1. F IGURE 1: STRUCTURE OF A LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY • Financial arrangements • Equities (and deemed equities) • Real property Premiums Life insurance company Share capital Shareholders Policyholders Investable funds Bonuses and claims to policyholders and dividends to shareholders Fees taken out at any stage in the process 15 3.3 A common way of categorising life products is to distinguish between participating and non-participating policies. A participating policy (also known as a “with-profits policy”) is a policy entitled to participate in distributions of profit, as most whole of life and endowment policies are. Conversely, a non-participating policy (also known as a “without-profits policy”) does not participate in distributions of profit, examples being term life insurance and most unit-linked policies. 3.4 Since 1990, term insurance business has increased from being less than 10 percent of total industry premiums to now well over 50 percent. Product development has been driven by consumer demand for greater clarity in life insurance products and a desire to unbundle, or split out, the various risk, savings and expenses components of a contract. This has resulted in several new types of products – for example, combining life protection with income or disability insurance. 3.5 The task in designing a tax on the myriad complexities of a life insurance business is a two-step process. First, the total investment return of a life insurance business must be divided between a return on equity invested in the company and a return on the accumulated savings of the policyholder. Second, a way of taxing these returns must be determined in a way that fulfils as much as possible the concepts of neutrality and equity within existing tax policy settings and structures. A norm for taxing life insurers 3.6 Life insurance businesses consist of three elements. The first is protection against the improbable event of death during the next succeeding relatively brief period. The insured (or someone else on his or her behalf) pays a premium in return for which a stipulated sum will be paid to his survivors in the event of the insured person’s death. The second is the investment element. The third is fee income for managing the other two elements. These components are now analysed. Pure risk insurance (without savings) 3.7 Pure risk insurance income consists of either or both underwriting gains (if fewer people die than is assumed in setting premiums) and investment income on corporate retained earnings. Therefore, life insurers’ profits, measured as the excess of premiums plus interest earnings over outgoings (claims and expenses) are, in principle, no different from the profits of any other business (excess of receipts over cost of goods sold or income from the provision of services less expenses). However, as income for the insurance service is spread over a long period, and liabilities may be incurred but not actually reported in a period, there are differences in the timing of revenue and expense recognition. A number of countries therefore tax on accounting income or, as in Australia, a basis equivalent to general insurance. (See Appendix 1.) 16 Fees 3.8 A life insurer receives income from fees and charges in respect of investment, administration or risk and these can be deducted from premiums, investment income or account balances. The profits made are therefore no different from any other business that charges fees for services. Investment income 3.9 A company that sells pure term insurance earns profits on only invested capital, including reinvested income on accumulated company surpluses, but amasses virtually no reserves on behalf of policyholders and earns no investment income for them. It is selling a “risk product”. This investment income should be taxed to the life insurer. 3.10 A company that sells savings products and traditional with-profits insurance accumulates reserves in the name of policyholders, eventually payable to them or their estate. Two types of income are earned by the company: one, ordinary profits, including investment income on invested corporate surplus and equity, and share of traditional participating profits allocated through the gate; and two, investment income. The first type of income flows to be taxed in the company. However, as the second type of income accrues to the owners of the investments, it should be regarded as personal income and treated like other individual income. Tax preferences 3.11 Whether any aspect of life insurance should enjoy tax concessions to promote uptake of life insurance is an obvious question that must be asked. Some countries provide benefits in the form of deductibility of part or all premiums paid by policyholders, (as was the case in New Zealand up to 17 December 1987) taxing certain life insurance income at concessionary tax rates or deferring taxation of participating policy income until the surrender or maturity of the policy. However, such concessionary features are not universal and some apply for savings policies only. (See Appendix 2.) 3.12 On the other hand, claims proceeds are taxed or subject to an inheritance tax, a form of estate duty, in many countries. 3.13 With the notable exception of incentives to save through KiwiSaver, New Zealand tax policy generally eschews providing tax preferences for particular industries. It is very difficult to establish whether tax concessions would encourage more insurance or simply make it cheaper for those who already have it. In any case, while term life insurance has an important social and economic function, the same can be said of any number of goods and services provided by other sectors. 17 3.14 Providing tax advantages to saving through life insurance by income deferral or other methods is unjustified as it distorts the savings market and artificially lowers the amount of tax revenue. The PIE system provides a framework for the taxation of investment income which, if possible, should be extended to life insurance savings. To tax investment income earned through life insurers at a lower effective rate than investment income earned in other ways would distort savings behaviour into an inefficiently high level of savings through life insurance. 3.15 There is no compelling case, therefore, for providing any concessionary treatment or tax benefits to producers or consumers of life insurance products over the goods or services of any other industry in New Zealand. 3.16 Likewise, the taxation of claims proceeds is contrary to current law and current policy settings. 3.17 Appendix 4 describes some alternative approaches towards taxing life insurers that were considered but rejected as not being an appropriate method. The proposed rules 3.18 Taking the foregoing discussion into account, the proposed rules aim to tax life insurance companies on all their profits. This will be achieved by removing tax discrepancies in the treatment between life insurance companies and other entities. Policyholders will also be appropriately taxed on their investment income. 3.19 This means there will be two separate calculations imposing a tax liability on the stakeholders who derive the economic benefit. These are referred to as shareholder income and policyholder income. In terms of shareholder income, the following are included in taxable income: • premiums (excluding savings amounts) paid to the life insurer, changes in the value of reserves that relate to risk business, risk-related claims and expenses; • net investment income on shareholder funds calculated under ordinary tax principles; • fee income; and • the shareholders’ share of traditional profit in respect of with-profits policies. 3.20 Tax will be payable on the shareholder income at the tax rate applying to companies, net of imputation and other credits related to the income. All other provisions that apply to corporate taxpayers, including imputation credit rules, loss carry forward and grouping, will apply to the life insurer in respect of income from those sources. 18 3.21 Policyholder income equals investment income determined in respect of policyholder funds, reduced by distributions of with-profits income to shareholders, net of deductible charges and fees, and calculated under ordinary tax principles (as amended by the PIE rules). This will be paid by the life insurer on the policyholder’s behalf at the rate of 30% as a final tax. However, subject to interest from the industry in attribution and the development of a suitable attribution methodology, the life insurer may elect for net investment income to be “attributed” to policyholders and so subject to tax at investors’ marginal tax rates (as modified by the PIE rules). 3.22 Policyholder net taxable investment income cannot be offset with losses or credits from either shareholder income or any other company in the life insurer’s tax group. 3.23 An algebraic representation of the rules and the underlying methodology is outlined in the next chapter and developed in the subsequent chapters. These chapters are aimed at life insurance professionals (actuaries and accountants), who will implement the rules and work with them on a daily basis. They are therefore more technically focussed than the discussion in chapters 1 to 3. 19 CHAPTER 4 Taxing structure and methodology of proposed rules 4.1 The formulas for determining taxable income under the proposed rules, discussed in the previous chapter, can be expressed as follows: • Shareholder income (Y sh ) = P r – RP r – C r + RC r + I r + X + W s – \[E total – E wp \] +/– Change in (PSR/UPR/OCR) • Policyholder income (Y ph ) = I wp – W s + I s – EI wp – EI s 4.2 The methodology to determine (and define) these formulas is based on dividing life insurance business into three distinct product groups: • Risk. • Traditional with-profit (WP). • Other (mixed risk and savings products). 4.3 Total premiums (P total ), and reinsurance premiums (RP total ), are split between: • WP (all premiums in respect of WP): P wp and RP wp • Risk and the risk portion of Other: P r and RP r • Saving element of Other: P s and RP s 4.4 Total claims (C total ) and reinsurance claims (RC total ) are split between: • WP (all claims in respect of WP): C wp and RC wp • Risk and the risk portion of Other: C r and RC r • Savings element of Other: C s and RC s 4.5 Total investment income (I total )is split between: • WP: I wp • Savings: I s • Risk: I r (includes investment income on shareholder funds) 4.6 X refers to other gross income earned by the shareholder not already captured under any of the other headings. 4.7 W s is the transfer to shareholders from with-profit business through the “gate” (see Chapter 7). 20 4.8 The relevant component of total expenses (E total ): • WP all expenses: E wp • WP expenses associated with generating investment income: EI wp • Savings expenses associated with generating policyholder investment income (which includes the profit component of fees charged to policyholders for providing investment services): EI s • Risk and risk portion of other expenses (this includes any shareholder investment-related expenses): E r 4.9 The risk components of reserves are: • Premiums: Premium Smoothing Reserve (PSR) for guaranteed premium policies (or the period of level premium) and Unearned Premium Reserve (UPR) for other policies. • Claims: Outstanding claims reserve (OCR). 4.10 Many of the apportionments are required for accounting and actuarial purposes. A general principle of the proposed rules is that the life insurer should follow its normal accounting and actuarial practices for tax as long as they are consistent with the overall thrust of the rules. Some calculations, such as the calculation of reserves, will be conducted purely for tax, just as occurs with many of the calculations for current tax rules. 4.11 There will obviously be costs for learning and implementing the proposed rules, but it is reasonable to expect that the tax calculation process will eventually be largely systematised, as it is under current rules. Life insurers who already apply similar principles for financial accounting should mitigate the costs of compliance. 4.12 The following chapters explain the components and methodology of the proposed model in more detail. An example of the application of the proposed rules is provided in Appendix 3. 21 CHAPTER 5 Shareholder income (Y sh ) – net risk component of premiums, claims and expenses 5.1 The principal business activity of most life insurers is that of “risk” or underwriting. This chapter proposes rules for including in the calculation of shareholder income net risk premiums (P r – RP r ), less net risk claims and expenses (C r + RC r – E r ). Splitting premiums between risk and capital 5.2 An amount that is paid as a life insurance premium can have four components: • a risk component that meets the costs of the life cover; • premium-based fees such as risk charges, entry fees and exit fees; • a shareholder margin; and • an investment and savings component. 5.3 The first three are taxable as shareholder income, but the fourth one is not. The components of a premium are not always readily identifiable. Bundled policies, notably whole of life and endowment insurance policies, have all four components even though they are not separately identified. Such products can be contrasted with unbundled policies, in which all components are separately identified. 5.4 In any year, total premiums (P total ) received by a life insurer will be P wp + P r + P s . The proposed tax treatment is to make total premiums taxable and then allow as a deduction the savings or capital component of the net premium, or the part of the premium that would be returned to the policyholder when a benefit is paid. Accordingly: • P wp are excluded entirely from tax and so are deducted from premium revenue. • P s (the deposit element of policies that have a savings element) – deductible from the premium. • P r (the residual from total premiums less the first two) – entire premium taxable. 5.5 The “net” refers to the taxable amount excluding the amount of the premium that is subject to a reinsurance arrangement that has been offered or entered into in New Zealand. 8 Total reinsurance premiums (RP total ) equals RP wp + RP r + RP s . Their tax treatment mirrors that of premiums for similar products except that instead of being taxable, they are an expense of the life insurer. The reinsurance premiums will be “premiums” in the hands of the reinsurer. 8 For discussion of what constitutes “reinsurance” refer to page 41. 22 5.6 This means that the taxable amount of premiums for a life insurer is calculated as P total – (P wp + P s ) – RP total + (RP wp + RP s ). 5.7 Risk, savings and traditional products need to be tightly defined as discussed next. Definitions of product types Traditional participating policies 5.8 “Traditional participating policies” will be comprehensively defined to mean life insurance business that consists of the provision of discretionary participating benefits to policyholders from an identifiable with-profit pool, with an allocation of some element to shareholders (through a mechanism usually referred to as “the gate”). They will be also defined in terms of commonly accepted concepts of whole of life and endowment policies. “Participating benefits” should mean that a specified percentage of profits will go to policyholders as bonuses or similar. Further, these policies should provide a surrender value that gradually increases over the duration of the contract. Savings 5.9 A policy will generally be deemed to have a savings element if it can acquire a cash value at any stage (other than a return of unexpired premiums). 5.10 A functional definition will be required to determine the savings portion (or element) for premiums for mixed policies. For unbundled products the savings premium will be the amount designated as going towards savings and hence buying units in the designated portfolio. An actuary’s certification will be required. 5.11 For bundled and not readily identifiable savings products (such as non-profit endowment insurance and non-profit whole of life) the methodology to determine the risk portion of the premium will need to be prescribed by tax legislation. 5.12 Current financial reporting standards require premiums to be split when feasible. If it is not feasible to split them the deposit element is effectively removed as a result of the change in the insurance or investment liabilities. (Before IFRS 4 these were known as policy liabilities.) 5.13 When the split is not done for financial accounting it should be based on the key assumptions underlying the various services provided by the products. While assumptions will vary between life insurers, general methodologies should be established to ensure that results are consistent between companies and over time. 23 5.14 A simple method could be to relate the savings component of premiums to the change in surrender values over the year (with appropriate allowance for new policies and discontinuances in the year). 5.15 An actuary’s certification will be required. Risk 5.16 As a general proposition any product line for which there is no cash value at any stage (other than a return of unexpired premium) should be classified as pure risk. 5.17 The “risk component” of a premium or claim can accordingly be defined as: (a) If: (i) the policy is not a traditional with-profits policy; and (ii) the policy does not have a savings element the total premium; or (b) if the policy provides for participating benefits or discretionary benefits then nil; or (c) otherwise the total premium less the savings element of the premium. Splitting claims 5.18 The same allocation principles used for premiums apply for claims, where a deduction is allowed in the calculation of shareholder income for the net risk component. Total claims (C total ) need to be split as follows: • Pure risk – non-savings element (C r ) • Traditional – no need to split (C wp ) • Savings – savings element (C s ). 5.19 Claims paid on pure risk policies are fully deductible, while claims for traditional participating policies, and the savings element of claims on other policies are not deductible. 5.20 As with premiums, the “net” reference in claims refers to recoveries subject to a reinsurance arrangement that has been offered or entered into in New Zealand. These occur when a life insurer reinsures a policy and a claim is later made on that policy. The life insurer makes a claim under the reinsurance contract and recovers the amount from the reinsurer. If the life insurer is entitled to a deduction of the reinsurance premium, the amount recovered will be taxable. Total reinsurance claims RC total are made up of their equivalents for RP, that is RC total = RC wp + RC r + RC s . 24 5.21 This means that the deductible amount of claims for a life insurer is calculated as C total – (C wp + C s ) – RC total + (RC wp + RC s ). Definitions of claims 5.22 The definitions for the risk component of claims will be similar to the definitions that apply for premiums. However, a functional definition will be required for mixed risk and savings claims. For these mixed risk and savings policies, the amount of the deductible claim is determined by the SV of the policy immediately before the claim less the SV immediately after, with appropriate allowance for reinsurance. This approach caters for partial claims for a rider benefit, partial surrender or a total discontinuance. Expenses 5.23 Expenses deductible from shareholder taxable profits are total expenses (E total ) reduced by expenses attributable to the with-profits pool (E wp ). 5.24 Deductible risk-related expenses (E r ) incurred include deferred acquisition costs which will be subject to ordinary deductibility rules. Also included in this category are shareholder investment-related expenses. Anti-avoidance 5.25 Specific anti-avoidance rules will aim to prevent the artificial structuring of products when policyholder investment income is not being taxed because the claims that contain the investment income allocated to policyholders are deductible. Timing 5.26 The proposed treatment of the timing when income is earned and when expenses are incurred is discussed in the next chapter. 25 CHAPTER 6 Risk reserves (PSR/UPR/OCR) 6.1 Chapter 5 discussed the proposed tax treatment of net risk income and claims and expenses. The long-tailed nature of many life insurance contracts means that special rules are required to fairly recognise the timing of income derivation and incurrence of expenses, through movements in reserves. 6.2 The need to set up reserves for risk business can be caused by premiums being level for more than one year, or by premiums being contractually fixed with no right for the insurer to change them (even for all policyholders of a similar class). A positive reserve (even if the policy does not have a surrender value) implies an element of investment return, but does not imply it is being earned on behalf of the policyholder or the shareholder – the only benefit the policyholder gets is implicit in the premium being charged. Pure risk products should not, in practice, produce significant reserves. 6.3 The reserve for premiums will be either the Unearned Premium Reserve (UPR) or a Premium Smoothing Reserve (PSR) and will differ depending on the type of product. 6.4 The reserve for claims will be the Outstanding Claims Reserve (OCR). 6.5 UPR will apply for risk products or risk elements of other products for which premiums are stepped yearly or premium rates that are not contractually guaranteed. The UPR will be the unexpired premium (on a pro rata basis). 6.6 The PSR will apply for risk products or risk elements of savings products during the periods in which premium rate are contractually guaranteed or in a period in which level premiums are payable. It differs from the Margin on Services (MoS) basis in that it does not cover all future cash flows and it does not add back acquisition costs. The PSR would be calculated under the following formula: 26 PV future expected risk claims (C r – RC r ) plus PV future expected costs of administration and claims management (E r ) plus PV of future profit (minimum zero) less PV of future risk premiums (P r – RP r ) Where: • PV means present value. • The future period over which the PVs are measured is the duration for which a level premium is payable or for which the premium rates are contractually guaranteed. • Best estimates of claims, discontinuance and expenses are used based on the most recent analysis. • Discounting is at a risk-free rate (gross of tax). • The profit element is a fixed proportion of the PV of future risk premiums or risk claims, based on estimates for similar policies and such that profit emerges evenly over the term of the fixed or guaranteed premium, and the proportion remains constant at policy level over the future period. This could be the profit margin for that class of policy, as at the start of the reserving period, expressed as a proportion of risk premium. Alternatively it is the margin required for the PSR to be zero at inception, excluding acquisition expenses. • C r is the expected claims excluding portions of claims which can properly be regarded as savings elements. • P r is the expected premiums payable under the policy less that part of the premium which can properly be regarded as the savings element. 6.7 The Outstanding Claims Reserve (OCR) will be defined as the provision for claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) and claims admitted but not yet paid (including present value of expected future claims payments for income type claims, using best estimate assumptions and appropriate risk margins). The OCR applies to risk and other products, but not to traditional with-profits business. 6.8 Some form of actuary’s certification will be required for the reserving calculations. Applying the reserving principles to specific product groups Level premium term and other guaranteed premium products 6.9 Level premium term life insurance means a pure risk contract in which the amount of premium is guaranteed and fixed for a number of years. 6.10 Other guaranteed premium products are products with or without a savings element, under which premiums are contractually guaranteed and cannot be changed by the insurer (even for identifiable groups of policies). 6.11 The PSR will apply for these products during the period of level premiums or the period of contractually guaranteed premium rates. 27 6.12 An example of a methodology for a product which has k years to run (when a level premium is payable or when the premium rates are contractually guaranteed) is as follows: C(r,t) = expected risk portion of claim in year t (t=1 for the first year), etc P(r,t) = expected risk portion of premium in year t (t=1 for first year), etc Prob(t) = probability of the policy being in force in year t Claim (t) = probability of a claim occurring in year t, given in force v = discount factor = 1/(1+discount rate) M = profit margin PV Claims = Σ (from t=1 to k) \[C(r,t)–RC(r,t)\]\*Prob(t)\*Claim(t)\*v^(t) PV Premiums = Σ (from t=1 to k) \[P(r,t)–RP(r,t)\]\*Prob(t)\*v^(t) PV Profit = M\*PV premiums PV Expenses = Σ (from t=1 to k) E(r,t)\*Prob(t)\*v^(t) Annual stepped premiums (with ability to review premium rates) 6.13 Annual stepped renewable life insurance means a contract in which the premiums each year are based on the current level of cover. For the purposes of the proposed tax reserving rules, these include contracts in which: • premiums are level and payable through the term of the contract but the premiums may be changed in certain circumstances described in the contract; • premiums are level and payable for some term shorter than the term of the contract (other than a single premium policy) and guaranteed in the contract not to change but the premiums may be changed in certain circumstances described in the contract; and • contracts normally called three-yearly (or five-yearly, or ten-yearly) renewable that are expected to increase after that three, five, ten-year term as the person ages, but the insurer does not guarantee that the rate table will not change during the level premium phase. 6.14 With these products, the UPR is dependent on premium frequency, hence: UPR = RP% \* t \* P • Where RP% = percentage of premium to meet claim cost, administration, commissions, claims, expenses, and profit element (for that remaining period) until next premium payment; • t = period to next premium payment (as a proportion of a year); and • P = actual last premium paid. 28 Single premium 6.15 Single premium life insurance refers to life insurance coverage in which the entire premium is paid at one time at policy inception. 6.16 A life insurer cannot usually require the policyholder to pay for any price increase on these types of policies, so an opening PSR would be the generalised approach set out above. Here the remainder of the term would be the life of the policy. Without profit whole of life and endowment 6.17 This is a mixed product incorporating both savings and risk elements. On the assumption that premiums for these products are guaranteed, it is reasonable to set PSR as above. Each future premium and claim payment will need to be split between risk and savings, which will require an actuary’s certification. Group life 6.18 These are products provided to groups on an annual renewable terms basis, so the reserving basis should be the same generalised approach as for those products. A UPR will apply for these products. 29 CHAPTER 7 Shareholder income (Y s ) – other income and investment income 7.1 The previous two chapters discussed the risk income components of shareholder income and claims. We now turn to discussing the other components of the economic returns to shareholders’ fees and investment income, less expenses. Other income (X) 7.2 X represents a residual category for income determined under ordinary taxation principles that is not included under any of the explicit income categories, but is derived for the economic benefit of the shareholder. X is included in shareholder income. 7.3 In particular life insurers should be taxed on their fee income. Fees can be explicit or implicit and can be imposed at the time the policy begins, at the time the policy is terminated, or on a regular basis. An “explicit fee” is one that is specifically deducted from a policyholder’s premium or account. Examples of explicit fees include: • premium-based fees that reduce the amount of a premium invested; • asset fees specifically debited from a policyholder’s account; • time-based fees debited from a policyholder’s account; and • entry, exit and switching fees. 7.4 Premium-based fees in respect of non-participating business are included in shareholders’ taxable income by: • including all premiums in gross income; and • allowing a deduction for the savings or deposit element of those premiums, as described in Chapter 5. 7.5 Explicit fees that are not included in premiums can be relatively easily identified and quantified for tax calculation purposes. These include fees that may be sourced from premiums but separately identified, such as policy fees and investment management fees from unit-linked business. 7.6 An “implicit fee” is one that is implicitly charged to a policyholder rather than explicitly deducted from a policyholder’s account. An example of an implicit fee is an asset fee where the investment return credited to a policyholder’s account is net of investment management fees. The fee implicitly reduces the value of the policyholder’s account. Or, for unit-linked policies, an asset fee is removed from the unitised fund on a daily basis so that the growth in the value of units reflects the investment return after allowing for the asset fee. 30 7.7 Implicit fees can be determined only by completing an actuarial valuation of the life insurer’s liabilities. 7.8 The amount of fees and charges from traditional participating business are only those fees which are paid direct to the shareholder or are deducted from premiums before the net premium is credited to the identifiable with-profit pool. Shareholder investment and other income (I r ) 7.9 One of the aims of the new rules is to include all investment income derived by shareholders and policyholders and to continue to allow the deduction of all related investment expenses. When life insurers maintain segregated shareholder and policyholder funds the investment income allocation will be as determined by those funds. 7.10 However, in many cases, investment income (I total ) will need to be apportioned (or assets segregated) between with-profits (I wp ), savings (I s ) and risk (I r ). Allocating I total 7.11 The new rules will require the deduction of the amount relating to policyholders from the life insurer’s total investment income in its annual financial statements (I total ). Accordingly, investment income, excluding that relating to segregated funds and participating pools needs to be apportioned between I r and I s. . If participating pools are not segregated then they need to be part of an apportionment process – that is, the participating pool’s share of investment income (I wp ) will need to be determined by apportionment. 7.12 It is proposed that, as much as possible, a life insurer’s ordinary accounting and actuarial calculations should be followed. For example, investment income of policyholders may be calculated on the basis of the savings portion of policy liabilities, with the deduction from total investment income thereby being shareholders’ investment income. 7.13 If the life insurer is unable to use this basis as a default method, the investment income attributable to policyholders could be calculated using the following methodology: 31 Let: I = Total investment income to be apportioned SV(0) = Total surrender values of savings products at start of year SV(1) = Total surrender values of savings products at end of year A(0) = Total market value of pooled assets at start of year A(1) = Total market value of pooled assets at end of year then I s = I \* \[SV(0) + SV(1)\] / \[A(0) + A(1)\] • A similar apportionment can be made for investment income by asset class if needed for PIE calculations and for tax credits. • The investment income relating to any with-profits pool will need to be separately identified as part of I total as it does not directly enter the tax calculations. • Deducting I s and I wp from I total will yield I r. . 7.14 Policyholder investment income so calculated will be taxed separately from shareholder income. Chapter 8 outlines the taxation of policyholder income. Adjustments to I r 7.15 The current rule contained in sections CR 1(5), CR 2(5) and EY 46(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007, where investment assets held by a life insurer for the purposes of the life insurance business are on revenue account, will be removed. Life insurers will therefore have to determine whether an investment is on revenue account or capital account under ordinary tax principles. This places them on the same footing as comparable taxpayers. Investment income will be subject to ordinary taxation rules of timing and realisation, as amended by bodies of rules such as the accrual rules, the PIE rules and the fair dividend rate rules. 7.16 Some submissions to the taxation bill currently before Parliament have argued for realised gains on sale of Australasian equities held directly by shareholders funds to be treated as being on capital account. However, there is no reason for life insurers to be taxed differently from other comparable financial institutions that may hold such equities on revenue account. Shareholder profit on traditional with-profit policies (W s ) 7.17 The deductible component of the premium for policies that provide participating benefits is the whole of the premium paid by the policyholder after any specific fees paid direct to the shareholder. This recognises that under these policies, policyholders are entitled to share in the profits of the business, including underwriting and expense profits. 32 7.18 Profits from the pools for these types of products are allocated between policyholders and shareholders through a mechanism called the “gate”. 9 Profit allocation decisions are based on a variety of factors, including current and expected profitability of the asset portfolio, indications given to policyholders at the time policies were sold, comparable market performance, the interests of the shareholders of the company, and the need to service shareholders’ funds. The profits allocated to shareholders form part of the shareholder’s retained earnings and can be distributed as dividends. 7.19 Effectively, the profits allocated to shareholders consist of investment returns and other profit sources. As participating premiums are excluded from taxation, the profits and investment returns should be taxed on allocation to shareholders. 7.20 Accordingly, the allocation of shareholders’ profit through the “gate” (W s ) from its participating business should be taxed. The amount allocated should be that determined by the life insurer’s rules of the particular fund and its normal practice. In the event the actual gate is not specified the default rate will be 20%. 7.21 W s will be deducted from investment income derived from with-profits products (I wp ) to arrive at the amount of policyholder income from those products. This is discussed further in Chapter 8. 9 Actuarial standards determine the valuation of assets backing the with-profits pool. The payment to shareholders from this pool is determined by the rules of the particular life insurance fund. 33 CHAPTER 8 Policyholder investment income and expenses (Y ph ) = (I wp – W s + I s – EI wp – EI s ) 8.1 Under the proposed rules, investment income attributed to policyholders will be taxed separately from shareholders’ income. The life insurer will pay the tax on behalf of policyholders. In this way, life insurers act as collective savings vehicles on behalf of their policyholders. The income may be split into its product components. 8.2 Theoretically, policyholders should get the benefits of the PIE rules with the non-taxation of Australasian equity gains and attribution of income to be taxed at individual investor tax rates. However, it may not be possible in practice to attribute income to participating policyholders, and some life insurers may not be able to attribute for policyholders in non-participating savings products. Calculation of investment income 8.3 Allocation of gross policyholder investment income was discussed in the previous chapter. The investment income allocated to policyholders will be: • I wp – investment income attributed to the with-profits pool. This will be reduced by the amount of with-profits income that is attributable to shareholders (W s ); and • I s – investment income attributable to other policyholder savings. Adjustments to investment income 8.4 The taxation bill currently before Parliament excludes from taxation under the life office basis realised Australasian equity gains derived by unit-linked products. This exclusion will continue for such products under the new rules. The capital gains exclusion will also be extended to Australasian equities derived in respect of participating business. Expenses 8.5 Fees and charges applied against policyholder funds are deductible against policyholder income to the extent that they relate directly or indirectly to the derivation of investment income. Generally, the aggregate deductible fees of policyholders should also be included as fee income to shareholders. 34 8.6 It will be necessary for expenses to be apportioned to the expenses relating to the generation of investment income for the with-profits pool and the savings elements of other policies, that is, EI wp and EI s . This will require some form of certification. 8.7 Policyholders’ taxable income (Y PH ) is therefore equal to I wp – W s + I s – EI wp – EI s . Imputation credits 8.8 The allocation of imputation credits and dividend withholding payments on dividends derived by the life insurer between shareholder and policyholder income will follow the allocation of the dividend income using the methodology discussed earlier. Excess imputation credits allocated to the policyholder base will be converted into policyholder losses and carried forward. Tax rate 8.9 As a default, the policyholder income calculation applies tax at the top PIE rate even though it is intended to tax the income derived on behalf of policyholders, who will be individuals with various tax rates. This is done for practical reasons if there are no ways to apply tax at individual policyholders’ tax rates and applies generally in the PIE rules when income cannot be attributed to individual investors. 8.10 Some submissions made in the earlier consultation exercise suggested that life insurers should be able to elect that policyholders in unit-linked products be taxed at their marginal rates (as amended by the PIE rules), and this will be provided for in legislation. If income is attributed, the economic cost of each policyholder’s tax must be borne by that policyholder. 8.11 The government is open to attributing participating policyholder income to individual policyholders and allowing them to apply their own tax rate to the income. However, this is subject to life insurers wanting to have the attribution option and development of a practical system for doing that. To date, there appear to be very difficult technical and practical problems in doing so. In this regard, taxing all policyholders at 19.5% is not viable as it would provide a tax benefit to higher marginal rate taxpayers. 8.12 A composite rate between 19.5% and 30% is also unacceptable on similar equity grounds as it would also mean that no-one would be taxed at the appropriate rate. However, ideas are still sought for a practical way of incorporating participating policies into this aspect of the PIE rules, which will achieve the result of policyholders being taxed at their personal tax rate. 35 CHAPTER 9 Transition to the new rules 9.1 Given the expected timeframe to enactment of the legislation, and the need for life insurers to have certainty of their tax treatment, the government expects the proposed rules to be effective the first day of the life insurer’s income year beginning on or after 1 April 2009. 9.2 All new life insurance products sold from 1 April 2009 will be subject to the new rules. There are, however, a number of tax and credit balances that arise from the current rules that will need to be provided for in a manner that is fair to the shareholders and the policyholders. 9.3 Existing policies and those sold up until 31 March 2009 will be subject to the transitional rules. Existing tax balances 9.4 To be fair to different life insurers, realised tax losses existing before the date of effect of the new rules should be available to be carried forward, since life insurers who are in corporate groups would have been able to benefit from life insurance losses by way of group offset. 9.5 It is important to ensure that allowing losses carried forward to apply under the new rules does not give rise to doubling the benefit (for example, allowing losses that may have been previously used for group loss offsets). Accordingly, the maximum aggregate tax loss that can be carried forward should be the lesser of the LOB loss and the PHB loss existing at year end before the new rules come into effect. 9.6 Because the proposed shareholder income base does not exist in the current rules it will be necessary to consider ways to allocate losses carried forward from the existing bases to the new income calculations (shareholders and policyholders). The government invites submissions on ways to allocate the transitional losses. 9.7 Imputation credits in the life insurer’s imputation credit account and policyholder credit accounts (being excess credits after paying the 2008–09 PHB tax liability) can be carried forward into the new system. These credits will be carried forward in the life insurers’ imputation credit account, with rules enabling the transfer of credits from the policyholder credit account to the imputation credit account, with the former account then ceasing. Similar rules will apply for dividend withholding payments. 36 9.8 The credits so carried forward in the imputation credit and dividend withholding payment accounts can be used only by shareholders, for either obtaining refunds of tax, or for attaching to dividends paid. The credits cannot be used for any reason against policyholder income. 9.9 Income tax balances held by the life insurer with Inland Revenue can be carried forward for application against the tax liability on shareholder income. Transition of pre-application date policies 9.10 Policies are priced on a number of factors, including policyholder-specific matters, general mortality rates, commissions and the tax rules existing at the time the contract was written. They can also take into account future events, in particular, proposed changes to tax rules. A balance therefore needs to be reached between applying the proposed rules, and not creating undue disadvantages in doing so. 9.11 There are a number of policies for which terms and conditions of the contracts cannot be changed, either legally, or, even if technically allowed owing to provisions that allow premiums to change in the event of a tax change, it would be bad commercial practice. Changes in tax rules may also have a negative impact on the financial accounting results for particular products. Any transitional measures, however, must be guided by four general principles. 9.12 The first principle is to be fair to policyholders. 9.13 The second is that the transition rules should not benefit life insurers with late balance dates over earlier balance date insurers. Accordingly, although the new rules will become effective for life insurers on the first day of their income year beginning after 31 March 2009, the grandfathering and transitional rules will apply only to products sold before 1 April 2009, regardless of the insurer’s balance date. 9.14 The third principle is that it is undesirable to have long-term transitional arrangements as that would defer the overall benefits without necessarily deferring all the expenses, including accounting and IT costs in maintaining two systems. A period of five years is a reasonable time to meet the duration of a large number of life policies, with minimal commercial impacts (though some exemptions from the limited period for certain policies are proposed.). There is recent international precedent in that the taxation of management fees in Australia was subject to limited 50% taxation for five years in the transition to its new tax life rules. However, more extensive grandfathering is appropriate for policies for which premiums are fixed for a period or for the duration of the policy. 9.15 Finally, to avoid complexity there should not be a multiplicity of rules operating during the transition period. Transitional relief, where appropriate, should incorporate the main taxing driver of the current rules (the premium loading formula) within the context of the proposed rules. 37 9.16 Accordingly, the proposal is for the calculation of shareholder income to be reduced by a transition adjustment (Z) written on a policy-level basis for policies sold before 1 April 2009: • Where: Z=P – 1.2 \* EDS – (Change in reserves). • The transition period is the lesser of five income years from the application date of the new rules, and the duration of the policy, or as determined for level premium term products and other guaranteed premium policies (discussed below). • Z would be equal to zero at the policy level if it were negative. • Change in reserves means change in UPR, OCR and PSR as they apply to the particular products. 9.17 The application of the transition formula would be at the election of the life insurer for particular products, based on its assessment of whether the transitional rules or being fully subject to the proposed life rules give a more appropriate tax result. To provide maximum flexibility and minimise compliance costs, a life insurer can elect not to use the transitional basis at the end of any income year during the transitional period. However, a life insurer cannot switch into the transitional basis once the new rules are used for the particular type of products, even when this occurs during the transitional period. 9.18 Products sold between 1 April 2009 and the life insurer’s balance date will be subject to the current rules in the income year before the new rules apply to the insurer. However, on the application date (the beginning of the first income year beginning after 31 March 2009), the product will be fully subject to the proposed rules. Level premium term products and other guaranteed premium products 9.19 Level term products issued before 1 April 2009, when there is no change in the absolute level of the premium, will be subject to the proposed transition rules for the duration of the policy. Such products sold on or after 1 April 2009 will be subject to the new rules except during the income year before the new rules apply to the insurer. In other words, if a level term policy is sold on 1 April 2009 and the insurer has a 30 June balance date, the policy (and all other policies) will be subject to the current tax rules for the insurer’s income year ending 30 June 2009. For the next and all later income years, the policy will be subject to the new rules. 38 9.20 There is a grey area between level term and “pure” annual renewable policies. For example, there are products for which there is a period of level premiums (for up to ten years) and then the premiums become annually renewable. There are other products for which the premiums are fixed for three or more years at a time. For these types of products, sold before 1 April 2009, the transition period will be the greater of: • the duration of the guaranteed premium period which straddles that date; or • five income years from application date. 9.21 Policies sold after 31 March 2009 will be subject to the new rules except during the income year before the new rules apply to the insurer. Annual renewable term products 9.22 Increases in premiums for annual renewable term products reflect the increased age of the insured but also, typically, take into account other factors, such as improvements in overall mortality, and other economic considerations. The proposed transitional rules therefore will apply for annual renewable term policies that were in force at 1 April 2009 for the five-income year period. Single premium products 9.23 The transitional rule applies to all risk products. Some single premium products, such as mortgage payment insurance, are typically for 25 to 30 years (or even longer), so the transitional period will be the duration of the particular policy. Group life 9.24 Typically, the life insurer has the right to review the terms and conditions of these policies at the end of a “guarantee” period (often two or three years). When a guarantee period ends within the five-income year transition period, the transition period will apply for the full five income years. When a guaranteed premium period is longer than five income years after the application date, the transition period may apply until the end of the guaranteed premium period. Traditional with-profit policies and other products 9.25 There are no features of savings products (both participating and non- participating business) that require any transitional provisions. In the case of mixed products, the transitional rules will apply to the risk portion of the premiums and claims. All policies sold after the application date will be subject in full to the new rules. 39 Summary of proposed transitional rules Product Sold before 1 April 2009 Sold between 1 April 2009 and application date Sold after application date Level term Grandfathering for duration of policy Current tax rules then subject to proposed rules from application date Proposed tax rules Guaranteed premium Grandfathering for the greater of duration of guaranteed period or five income years Current tax rules then subject to proposed rules from application date Proposed tax rules Annual renewable term Grandfathering up to five income years from application Current tax rules then subject to proposed rules from application date Proposed tax rules Single premium Grandfathering for duration of policy Current tax rules then subject to proposed rules from application date Proposed tax rules Group life (guaranteed period less than five income years after application date) Grandfathering up to five income years from application Current tax rules then subject to proposed rules from application date Proposed tax rules Group life (guaranteed period greater than five income years after application date) Grandfathering for guaranteed premium period Current tax rules then subject to proposed rules from application date Proposed tax rules Traditional products and savings policies No grandfathering from application Current tax rules then subject to proposed rules from application date Proposed tax rules Note: Life insurers can elect out of the transitional rules for any product at any time. Changes to pre-application date policies 9.26 Contracts existing before the application date can have terms subsequently added on to them. For example, a person who has a term insurance policy for $100,000 cover existing at the beginning of the new rules could later extend the cover under the same policy to $150,000 (or alternatively, reduce the cover to $50,000). If these terms were part of the contract as initially issued, the contract as whole would still be subject to the transitional rules. 9.27 However, if the fundamental nature of the original policy is changed (and the previous example is an illustration of such a fundamental change), the old policy will be deemed to come to an end, and a new policy created. This new policy, if the fundamental change occurred after the application date, will be fully subject to tax under the terms of the new rules and not under the transitional rules. 40 CHAPTER 10 Miscellaneous issues Definition of “life insurance” 10.1 Earlier consultation sought feedback on whether the current definition of “life insurance” in tax legislation requires amendment, for example, to be consistent with other legislation that deals with life insurance. However, there was no clear impetus for change in the submissions received, though some raised the valid point that the matter should be considered when more details of the new rules were made available. 10.2 The life rules proposed here are based on the current tax definition. In the government’s view, there is no policy reason for the income tax definition to be, word for word, the same as definitions for other, non-income tax purposes. However, if anyone thinks there is a good reason to change the definition, that would be taken into consideration. Non-resident life insurers 10.3 Under the current rules, a non-resident life insurer who issues policies that were offered or entered into in New Zealand is taxed as if the business of the insurer consists of or relates to those policies. The gross income so determined is deemed to be derived from New Zealand. It is not necessary for the life insurer to have a fixed establishment or an agent in New Zealand. Nor is it necessary for the policies to have been issued in New Zealand. 10.4 The new rules should apply to a non-resident life insurer by applying existing provisions applicable to life insurers, including source rules. Any income of the non-resident which is not related to the life insurance business should continue to be calculated as if no life insurance business was carried on in New Zealand. 10 10.5 The current law provides that a New Zealand branch of a non-resident life insurer is deemed to be a company resident in New Zealand for purposes of applying the life insurance provisions. Submissions are invited on whether the deemed resident company treatment should continue. 10 On 22 August 2007 the OECD released a revised public discussion draft on Report on the Attribution Of Profits To Permanent Establishments Part IV Insurance, which discusses principles of attributing profits of insurance companies to a permanent establishment under Article 7 of the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital. 41 Reinsurance premiums 10.6 Reinsurance is a way by which insurers manage risks. These risks include underwriting risk, timing risk (in settling claims), investment risk (low return or asset defaults), expense risk (higher than expected expenses), and credit risk (risk that the reinsurer will default on its payments). The risk is being transferred from one insurer to another. A transfer of premium will also occur, proportionate to the risk being transferred. 11 10.7 The proposed rules will provide that, generally, reinsurance premiums paid are deductible and reinsurance claims received are taxable when the reinsurance policies are offered or entered into in New Zealand. 10.8 This treatment will be confined to “true” reinsurance, which will obviously need to be carefully defined, particularly as this provision will have an anti- avoidance purpose. A suggested definition is that the reinsurance contract must meet the following conditions: • There must be a transfer of insurance (underwriting and timing risks). • The transfer must not include the transfer only of investment risk, expense risk, and credit risk, unless these risks are an incidental component of the contract. • There must be a business purpose for the reinsurance. This condition will be met if there is an exposure to significant loss (calculated as the PV of cash flows from a worst case scenario). • The transactions must not be entered into to avoid tax. 10.9 If the “true reinsurance” definition is not met, the contract may be treated as financial reinsurance. In such cases the premiums will be treated as a deposit and non-deductible to the life insurer, and the investment income accruing in respect of the amount deposited will be brought to tax by the life insurer. The accrual rules may need to be amended accordingly or some other method used to determine the income. A New Zealand-resident reinsurer (or one that is subject to New Zealand tax on its reinsurance income) would not include the premiums in income and would be allowed a deduction for the accrued interest. 10.10 Submissions on practical ways of taxing the income are invited. The government is also interested in any other issues related to reinsurance that may require legislative clarification. 10.11 If a life insurer fully reinsures its business, the company will not be subject to the life insurance rules, as is the case under the current rules. 11 There are two basic types of reinsurance. Under a reinsurance treaty, the reinsurer contracts to accept a specified amount of all risks or losses defined in the treaty. The reinsurer does not have the right to examine and select from those risks that meet the defined risks under the contract. With a facultative reinsurance contract, the reinsurer assesses each policy before agreeing to assume risks. This type of reinsurance is usually limited to large insurance policies. Under either type of contract, the reinsurer and insurer will share risks on an agreed basis. Under proportional reinsurance arrangements, a constant proportion of each risk is shared. Non-proportional reinsurance arrangements, on the other hand, can be used to limit the maximum risk faced by an insurer. 42 International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 10.12 Financial accounting for life insurance is governed by IFRS 4. However, owing to the complexity of the accounting issues, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued Discussion Paper: Preliminary Views on Insurance Contracts, on 3 May 2007. This document sets out preliminary views on the measurement and recognition of insurance contracts and financial instruments with discretionary participating features. 10.13 The proposed tax rules discussed in this document are based on the current standard. It is not certain when and to what extent the IASB proposals will become part of an amended IFRS 4, though it should be noted that in that event, every country will have to address its life tax legislation in the light of any changes. 43 APPENDIX 1 Comparison of selected countries: inco me taxation treatment of life insurers Country Underwriting profits In vestment income and realised capital gains Allocation of income between shareholders and policyholders Premium or other life insurance-specific taxes Australia • Risk premiums taxable and risk claims deductible. • Movement in risk-related liabilities also deductible/assessable. • Fees taxable.

Some of the information may be dated, but has been included as indicative of the approaches taken by different countries 50 APPENDIX 3 Life insurance tax calculation under proposed model ABC Life Insurer – year ended 30 June 20xx The following example shows the operation of the proposed rules for a life insurer that conducts the following business: • annual renewable term (YRT) – insurance risk only product; • investment-linked – savings and risk product, with investment assets held in separately defined pools; and • fixed interest investments that are held in a separate investment pool for shareholders. For the purposes of illustration, the annual renewable term product is fully taxable under the proposed rules. No policies have income calculated under the transitional provisions, and policy liabilities have not been separately broken down between Investment Contract Liabilities and Insurance Contract Liabilities, as are required under IFRS 4. No losses or other tax balances have been brought forward. The overall shareholder income and policyholder income is: • shareholder income is $7,638 (tax at 30% of $2,291) • policyholder income is $2,600 (tax of $575) ABC LIFE INSURER INCOME STATEMENT & TOTAL TAX CALCULATION (IN $) INCOME STATEMENT SHAREHOLDER INCOME POLICYHOLDER INCOME Accounting net profit Shareholder Tax adjustments Taxable profit: shareholder Shareholder income calculation Policyholder Tax adjustments Taxable profit: policyholder Policyholder income calculation Premium revenue 14,770 14,770 (42) 14,728 P r +/- U UPR Investment revenue 8,000 3,000 3,000 I r 5,000 (2,000) 3,000 I s Total revenue 22,770 17,770 (42) 17,728 5,000 (2,000) 3,000 Claims expense (5,540) (5,540) (5,540) C r +/- U OCR 0 Policy acquisition costs (2,750) (2,750) (2,750) E total 0 Other costs (1,500) (1,500) (1,500) E total 0 Investment management expenses (300) (300) (300) E total (400) (400) EI s Transfer to policy liabilities (4,425) (4,425) 4,425 0 Total operating expenses (14,515) (10,090) 0 (10,090) (4,425) 4,025 (400) Operating surplus (loss) before tax 8,255 7,680 (42) 7,638 575 2,025 2,600 Tax (2,879) (2,291) (575) Operating surplus (loss) post tax 5,376 51 The total calculation is broken down as follows: YRT INCOME STATEMENT SHAREHOLDER INCOME Accounting net profit Shareholder Tax adjustments Taxable profit - shareholder Shareholder income calculation Premium revenue 10,000 10,000 1 (42) 9,958 P r +/- U UPR Investment revenue 1,000 1,000 1,000 I r Total revenue 11,000 11,000 (42) 10,958 Claims expense (5,040) (5,040) 2 (5,040) C r +/- U OCR Policy acquisition costs (2,000) (2,000) (2,000) E r Other costs (1,000) (1,000) (1,000) E r Investment management expenses 0 0 0 Transfer to policy liabilities 0 0 0 Total operating expenses (8,040) (8,040) 0 (8,040) Operating surplus (loss) before tax 2,960 2,960 (42) 2,918 Tax at 30% (including timing differences) (888) (888) 13 (875) Operating surplus (loss) post tax 2,072 2,043 NOTES Unearned premium reserve adjustment for tax UPR (monthly premium) closing balance (417) UPR (monthly premium) opening balance 375 Change in unearned premium reserve (UPR) (42) 1 Claims expense OCR (including IBNR) closing balance (840) OCR (including IBNR) opening balance 800 Change in outstanding claims reserve (OCR) (40) Claims paid (5,000) Claims expense (5,040) 2 SHAREHOLDER FIXED INTEREST INVESTMENTS INCOME STATEMENT SHAREHOLDER INCOME Accounting net profit Shareholder Tax adjustments Taxable profit - shareholder Shareholder income calculation Investment revenue (all interest) 2,000 2,000 2,000 I r Operating surplus (loss) before tax 2,000 2,000 2,000 Tax at 30% (600) (600) Operating surplus (loss) post tax 1,400 1,400 52 Investment-linked specific assumptions • Premium components include savings premiums of $20,000 (included in policy liabilities) risk premiums of $3,000 and explicit fee charges of $1,770, comprising a policy fee of $120 and fees to cover other costs of $500, acquisition costs of $750 and investment management expenses of $400 (which includes a profit of $100).

Two alternative approaches proposed in the earlier consultation process were also examined. The following describes why these two alternatives are not being pursued. Premium taxation 1.2 Several countries (or at sub-levels such as Provincial Governments in Canada, and some states in the US) levy taxes, stamp duties or other assessments on insurers’ premium revenues. Under a typical structure, the tax base is simply the total of the insurer’s premium revenue with certain alterations. Usually, but not always, the life insurer is responsible for tax payment. 1.3 While premium taxation is simple to administer and comply with, there are less desirable features: • It is regressive in that it burdens lower-income purchasers of life insurance more than higher income persons, as unit costs for small policies (which are typically bought by the former) are higher than for larger policies. • It discriminates unfairly against higher premium forms of life insurance. • It discriminates against those who must pay higher insurance premiums owing to their age, health, or other difficulties. • It must be paid irrespective of life insurer profitability. • It is a direct tax on life savings products that is not applicable to other savings products. 1.4 Therefore, a premium tax is not considered appropriate for the New Zealand environment. Economic basis 1.5 One life insurer suggested life insurance should be taxed on an “economic” equivalence basis incorporating taxation of the policyholder. This would entail taxing insurance claims paid to policyholders while making premiums paid tax deductible. This is not consistent with New Zealand’s tax policy that, except for certain income protection insurance, life insurance claims are not income to the policyholder. 54 1.6 Further, the insurer suggested that a life insurer would deduct the premiums and recognise the claims as a “proxy” of the policyholders. This would nullify recognition of a life insurer’s underwriting income. This would not be economically equivalent to taxing policyholders on their claims, even if that were desired, because those policyholders who did receive claims in excess of premiums would not be taxed. Instead they would benefit from a global loss of all policyholders. 1.7 Effectively, a life insurer’s tax loss would be greater than that shown in the earlier examples in Chapter 2 as there would be no taxation of underwriting profit. It therefore would perpetuate the anomalous tax treatment of term insurance, and so was also not considered appropriate.
Payroll giving: providing a real-time benefit for charitable giving A government discussion document Hon Dr Michael Cullen Minister of Finance Hon Peter Dunne Minister of Revenue First published in November 2007 by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue, PO Box 2198, Wellington. Payroll giving: providing a real-time benefit for charitable giving – a government discussion document. ISBN 978-0-478-27157-7 Foreword Budget 2007 laid the foundation for building a culture of charitable giving in New Zealand by introducing measures aimed at removing the limits on the current tax relief on charitable donations made by individuals, companies and Māori authorities. The next step is to make charitable giving easier. Introducing a payroll-giving scheme is one way that this goal might be achieved. Payroll giving is well accepted in other countries such as Australia and the United Kingdom for its simplicity, convenience and effectiveness in facilitating charitable giving. It also has the potential to increase donation levels and establish genuine partnerships between businesses and the community, while supporting employees’ community activities. The government seeks your views on a possible payroll-giving scheme for New Zealand. We must ensure that such a scheme does not raise undue costs and is easy to administer for employers who choose to offer payroll giving. This initiative recognises the importance of charitable giving to our social, cultural, environmental and economic well-being in New Zealand and the important role charitable organisations play in delivering the services we need to make a positive difference in our communities. This discussion document is the direct result of the Confidence and Supply agreement between United Future and Labour and has been issued as part of the government’s commitment to fostering a culture of charitable giving in New Zealand.

The study estimated that through trusts and foundations, individuals and businesses, New Zealanders gave $1.27 billion in 2005, or 0.81 percent of New Zealand’s gross domestic product to philanthropic and charitable causes. This result compares favourably with levels of giving in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. 1 1.2 In Budget 2007, the government announced plans to look at several measures aimed at laying the foundation for a stronger culture of charitable giving in New Zealand. Among those measures was the early release of a discussion document on the implications of introducing payroll giving in New Zealand, for public consultation. 1.3 Payroll giving enables employees to make regular charitable donations from their pay. The employer forwards these donations either directly to a charitable or philanthropic cause or an intermediary, who passes on donations to those causes. 1.4 Other countries, such as Australia and the United Kingdom, have introduced payroll-giving schemes and their experiences suggest that payroll giving is a simple, convenient and effective way of supporting charitable giving. These countries have also found that payroll giving enables businesses to connect with their communities in ways that achieve tangible and mutual benefits for everyone involved. The payroll-giving systems in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom are described in Annex 1. 1.5 The payroll giving system envisaged for New Zealand would remove the need for employees to retain receipts and file end-of-year rebate claim forms. It would also enable employees to receive the tax benefit of their payroll donations each payday in real time. Donations that are not made through payroll giving can continue to receive tax relief through the existing rebate process. Context of reforms 1.6 In October 2006, the government released the discussion document, Tax incentives for giving to charities and other non-profit organisations, for public consultation. The document canvassed a range of options for encouraging greater giving to charitable organisations and for making it easier to give in time, money and skills to these organisations. 1 Report to Philanthropy New Zealand, Giving New Zealand: Philanthropic Funding 2006, March 2007, Business and Economic Research Limited. 2 1.7 Feedback on the discussion document strongly supported the government’s efforts to promote greater giving to charities and other non-profit organisations. 1.8 Consistent with its Budget Statement, Fostering a culture of charitable giving, the government has introduced legislative proposals aimed at: • Removing the current caps on the dollar amount of charitable donations that are eligible for tax relief. Individuals will be able to claim rebates on charitable donations up to the level of their taxable income, and companies and Māori authorities can claim deductions for charitable donations up to the level of their annual net income. • Extending the company deduction to unlisted close companies (companies with five or fewer shareholders). 1.9 Once enacted, the changes will apply from 1 April 2008. 1.10 The government recognises, however, that charitable giving is not just about removing the rebate or deduction limits; it is also about making it easier for people to give in both time and money. Along with payroll giving, the government has committed to further policy work, including: • Clarifying the tax treatment of reimbursement payments to volunteers and honoraria. This work includes an officials’ issues paper to canvass options for streamlining and clarifying the current tax treatment of reimbursement payments and honoraria paid to volunteers. The government’s objective in this review is to clarify the tax obligations for volunteers and the organisations that they serve. • A review of other tax incentives for charitable giving. This review will look at other mechanisms for delivering tax relief for charitable donations. Among the measures under consideration is the UK’s gift aid scheme, making it possible to claim tax deductions for non- monetary donations, such as functional assets, and Australia’s prescribed private funds scheme. 1.11 A payroll-giving scheme would also complement other government projects being led by the Office for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Voluntary New Zealand and Philanthropy New Zealand, to encourage giving and volunteering. The purpose of this project is to develop a multi-sector work programme to encourage individuals and businesses to participate in their communities and local community organisations by giving time, money and in-kind donations. 3 The case for payroll giving 1.12 As noted in the October 2006 discussion document, research shows that there is no clear consensus about the impact of tax incentives on charitable giving. While some believe that the absence of tax incentives contributes to low levels of charitable giving in many countries, others believe there is little relationship between the two. However, some empirical evidence suggests that tax incentives for donors can and do reinforce existing inclinations to give to charities and other non-profit organisations, and can lead to larger donations being made. Evidence also suggests that high-income people tend to be more responsive to tax incentives. 1.13 The October 2006 discussion document noted that a more pluralistic approach to promoting philanthropy and giving would have a greater positive effect on its growth. In particular, people are more likely to give more when giving is made easy and they have a range of incentives to give in money, time and skills. 1.14 Payroll giving is one measure that overseas jurisdictions have employed to facilitate greater giving to charities and other non-profit organisations. Their experience shows that a before-tax payroll-giving scheme could have the following benefits: • For charities, payroll giving is an efficient, low-cost way to raise funds and delivers the regular income support they need. • For employers, payroll giving can provide a low-cost and administratively simple way to support employee engagement in the community, while building employee morale and mobilising significant funding and volunteer resources for community benefit. Employers can also use the relationships with charitable organisations established through payroll giving to raise their business profile and promote themselves to their employees and customers. • For employees, payroll giving provides a convenient and simple way to give. In particular, a before-tax payroll-giving scheme is tax-effective and eliminates the need to collect receipts or wait until the end of the year to obtain the tax benefit of donations. 1.15 Even so, a review of the results from countries that have introduced payroll- giving systems shows that payroll donations are relatively low, compared with overall donations, and employee take-up depends heavily on the level of promotion employers are prepared to undertake. 4 Summary of key features of a payroll-giving scheme Participation in payroll giving would be voluntary for employers and employees. It would provide an alternative mechanism for individuals to give to donee organisations while receiving an immediate benefit on their charitable donations at each payday. A donee organisation is an entity or trust whose activities are not carried out for the private pecuniary profit of any individual and whose funds are applied principally for charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes in New Zealand. A donee organisation would include charitable entities registered with the Charities Commission. Two options for delivering tax relief through payroll giving are proposed. Annex 2 provides examples of how each option would affect donors on different tax rates. Option 1 – Tax deduction mechanism (Chapter 3) Donations would be deducted from an employee’s gross pay, thereby reducing the employee’s taxable income. PAYE would be levied on the net amount. The employee receives an immediate tax benefit by way of a reduction in the amount of PAYE required to be withheld. The tax value of charitable donations to donors would be determined by the donor’s marginal tax rate. An employee’s social policy entitlements and obligations that use taxable income as the basis of their calculations would be affected under this option. This option could be offered to all employers. Option 2 – PAYE credit mechanism (Chapter 4) Under the PAYE credit mechanism, employers would be required to calculate a PAYE credit of 33⅓ percent on the amount of the donation made each payday and offset this against the PAYE calculated on the employee’s gross pay. This mechanism would deliver an immediate tax benefit. As the PAYE credit would be calculated at a set rate, all employees who donate through payroll giving would receive the same tax benefit regardless of their marginal tax rate. An employee’s social policy entitlements and obligations that use taxable income as the basis of their calculations would not be affected under this option. Because of the information requirements of this option, payroll giving could be offered only to employers who file employer monthly schedules electronically. Timing of possible changes 1.16 Any legislation resulting from this discussion document is expected to be included in a taxation bill to be introduced in 2008. If payroll giving is to be implemented, the earliest date for implementation would be 1 April 2009. 5 How to make a submission 1.17 The government invites submissions on the merits of introducing payroll giving in New Zealand and the two options for delivering tax relief through payroll giving. 1.18 Submissions should be made by 25 January 2008 and can be addressed to: Payroll Giving Project C/- Deputy Commissioner – Policy Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 Wellington Or email: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Payroll giving project” in the subject line. 1.19 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for officials from Inland Revenue and the Treasury to contact those making submissions to discuss their submission, if required. 1.20 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, would be determined in accordance with that Act. Accordingly, those making submissions who feel there is any part of it that should be properly withheld under the Act should indicate this clearly. Regulatory impact statement 1.21 This discussion document incorporates the substantive regulatory impact analysis elements. 6 CHAPTER 2 Designing a payroll-giving scheme 2.1 In New Zealand, payroll giving is neither well known nor widely practised. Even so, a small number of employers have established payroll-giving relationships with individual donee organisations and with United Way. 2 Donations are made from the after-tax pay of the employee. As long as they keep records, employees can claim the tax benefit of these donations at the end of the year through the current rebate process, like any other charitable donation. This is an example of an after-tax payroll-giving system. 2.2 Many employers that currently offer a post-tax payroll-giving scheme are trans-Tasman employers. Individual donee organisations are also running, investigating or developing payroll-giving programmes. For example, Workplaces for change is a programme set up exclusively for the purpose of encouraging workplace giving to Amnesty International, Greenpeace and Oxfam New Zealand. 2.3 The government is interested in exploring the merits of a before-tax payroll- giving system. A before-tax payroll-giving system enables employees to make regular financial contributions from their gross pay to philanthropic and charitable causes and receive an immediate tax benefit on their donations at each payday. This form of payroll giving operates in the United Kingdom and Australia. 2.4 There are several important design considerations that need to be taken into account in designing a before-tax payroll-giving system in New Zealand. These considerations are discussed later in this chapter. Current rebate for charitable donations by individuals 2.5 Currently, individuals can claim a tax rebate at a set 33⅓ cents in the dollar, up to a maximum of $1,890 for cash donations made to charitable organisations. The maximum rebate is therefore $630. Donations of $5 or more that are supported by a receipt from the charitable organisation qualify for the rebate. The sum of the donations claimed cannot exceed the taxable income of the individual in the year in which the rebate is claimed. The rebate is claimed through a separate process at the end of the year. 2.6 Legislation currently before Parliament will remove the rebate threshold of $1,890 so that donations will be limited only by the level of the donor’s taxable income. This change is due to take effect from 1 April 2008. 2.7 Removing the current threshold is an important step, making it easier to implement a before-tax payroll-giving system in New Zealand. 2 United Way is an independent, non-religious, non-political, volunteer-based organisation that encourages generosity by brokering resources (money, time and skills) between individuals, businesses and the community. 7 2.8 The government envisages that any before-tax payroll-giving system would operate alongside the current rebate process. Therefore, for employees who do not or are not able to give through payroll giving they can still claim tax relief on their charitable donations through the current rebate claim process. Payroll giving is simply another way of facilitating giving to donee organisations and receiving a tax benefit on charitable donations. Some important design considerations Non-filing environment for individuals 2.9 Significant changes were made to the tax filing requirements for individuals in 2000, which means that a large number of individuals are no longer required to file personal tax returns. At the same time, it became possible to claim charitable donations through a separate rebate claim process. These changes gave rise to considerable simplification benefits, including lower compliance costs for affected individuals and administrative savings for Inland Revenue. 2.10 Implementing payroll giving in New Zealand enables employees to obtain an immediate tax benefit for their charitable donations without them having to retain receipts, and request and file a rebate claim form at the end of the year. Social policy entitlements and obligations 2.11 Social policy entitlements and obligations such as child support liabilities, student loan repayments, Working for Families tax credits and KiwiSaver contributions are calculated based on an individual’s taxable income. Any change to an individual’s taxable income as a result of payroll giving would affect all of these entitlements and obligations. For example, if an individual’s taxable income is decreased then any child support liabilities or student loan repayments would also decrease. 2.12 Likewise, the ACC earner premium and the low-income rebate would be altered if an employee’s taxable income is changed. Both the ACC earner premium and the low-income rebate are incorporated into the PAYE tax tables. Any alteration to an employee’s taxable income because of payroll giving would result in a change to the amount of PAYE deducted each payday which would, in turn, alter the amount of the ACC earner premium and the low-income rebate computed. 2.13 For most employees, their gross pay represents their taxable income. Inland Revenue administration 2.14 Inland Revenue currently collects all employee information through the employer monthly schedule, which is completed by the employer. The employer monthly schedule includes information about an employee’s gross earnings, PAYE, child support liabilities, student loan repayments, and KiwiSaver employee and employer contributions. 8 2.15 Payroll giving should enable Inland Revenue to collect appropriate information to enable it to effectively administer the tax relief on charitable donations. The logical source of this information would be the employer monthly schedule. 2.16 Because of space limitations, it is not possible to collect additional information for payroll-giving purposes on the paper form of the employer monthly schedule without significant redesign of the form itself or Inland Revenue systems and processes. If payroll giving is to be implemented promptly, it would need to be limited to those employers who file their employer monthly schedules electronically. 2.17 Inland Revenue data shows that 19 percent of employers file electronically, representing 71 percent of all employees and 84 percent of PAYE forwarded to Inland Revenue. Any employer with access to a computer and the internet can file electronically, using Inland Revenue’s secure IR-File system. Inland Revenue provides relevant support and education to employers who choose this option of filing their employer monthly schedules. Employer compliance obligations 2.18 A payroll-giving scheme would entail extra work for employers, which could range from additional payroll actions to establishing and maintaining relationships with particular donee organisations that employees have chosen to give to. However, it is important to note that payroll giving would be voluntary and employers could mitigate their compliance obligations by using either a payment or facilitating intermediary. Chapter 5 discusses the role of intermediaries in helping to support employers with payroll-giving functions. 2.19 Overseas evidence suggests that employers with large, computerised payroll systems can incorporate payroll giving easily. 2.20 The government acknowledges the current compliance obligations on employers. To mitigate these costs, any payroll-giving scheme should be voluntary. Special points for submissions Submissions are sought on the following matters: • Should New Zealand implement a before-tax payroll giving system? • What features could be offered to minimise the compliance costs for employers? • What concerns would there be if payroll giving was available only to employers who file their employer monthly schedules electronically? • What measures could be undertaken to promote payroll giving, and who should undertake this promotional work? 9 CHAPTER 3 Option 1 – Tax deduction mechanism Summary of proposals • Donations would be deducted from the employee’s before-tax pay. • The tax benefit would be at the employee’s marginal tax rate. • All calculations that use taxable income as a basis would be affected – for example, the ACC earner premium, low-income rebate, child support liabilities, student loan repayments, Working for Families tax credits and KiwiSaver contributions. 3.1 Under this option, payroll donations would be deducted from an employee’s gross pay each payday before the imposition of PAYE. This would essentially reduce the amount of the employee’s taxable income by the amount of the donation, and the employee would receive an immediate tax benefit as no tax would be paid on the donation amount. 3.2 This would also mean that the tax value of charitable donations to donors would be determined by the employee’s marginal tax rate. For example, if the employee is on a 19.5 percent tax rate, then the tax benefit they would receive from the deduction would be 19.5 percent for every dollar donated to a donee organisation through payroll giving. A person on a 39 percent tax rate would receive a tax benefit of 39 percent for every dollar donated to a donee organisation. This delivers a different tax benefit to the current rebate system which is a flat rate of 33⅓ percent for all donors. Consequently, 19.5 percent donors would be worse off under this option than under the current rebate regime while 39 percent donors would be better off. Example 3.3 The following example illustrates how the tax deduction mechanism would operate in practice. The employee receives $400 per week and makes regular contributions of $10 each pay. The employee is on a 19.5 percent tax rate. Employee’s (donor) weekly gross pay $400 Less donation $10 Employee’s (donor) residual weekly pay $390 Less PAYE on $390 $76 Employee’s net pay $314 Charity receives $10 Inland Revenue receives $76 10 Implications of this option Non-filing environment 3.4 Employees would be able to access an immediate tax benefit without having to retain receipts and file rebate claim forms. Social policy entitlements and obligations 3.5 An employee’s social policy entitlements and obligations that use taxable income as the basis of their calculations would be affected by this option. Deducting the donation amount from the employee’s gross pay would, in effect, reduce his or her taxable income. For example, a reduction in an employee’s taxable income could result in a decrease in their child support liabilities and student loan repayments, and an increase in their Working for Families tax credit entitlements. In addition, the employee’s ACC earner premium would be reduced and the low income rebate would increase. 3.6 KiwiSaver employee contributions would also decrease as a result of donations made through payroll giving under this option. KiwiSaver employer contributions would likewise decrease. Inland Revenue administration 3.7 Under option 1, an employer would not need to provide any additional information through the employer monthly schedule, as all entitlements and obligations would be based on the reduced taxable income amount. 3.8 However, it might be desirable to collect some information from the employer about the level of donations made through payroll giving for the purposes of reporting on the success of the scheme. This information would also contribute to a better understanding of giving trends in New Zealand, and would apply to employers rather than individual employees. This information could be collected outside of the employer monthly schedule through a separate form. Employer compliance obligations 3.9 In general, the current compliance obligations for employers would increase. In addition to making the required payroll deductions and retaining donation records, employers would be required to file an extra form with Inland Revenue at the end of the year. The extra form would contain information on the total amount of donations collected during the year through payroll giving. 3.10 While employers would not need to keep receipts under a payroll-giving scheme, they would have to provide evidence of the payroll donations made on behalf of their employees for audit purposes. 11 Government’s assessment of this option 3.11 On balance, although this option has the advantages of simplicity and reduced costs for employers and Inland Revenue, it has significant drawbacks, such as its affect on employees’ social policy entitlements and obligations. When compared with the current rebate, it also gives employees on higher incomes a greater benefit and those on lower incomes less benefit. As a result, donors on a tax rate of 19.5 percent would still have an incentive to claim the tax benefit of their donations through the rebate process, rather than through payroll giving. For these reasons, the government has developed a second option, which is discussed in Chapter 4. Special points for submissions Submissions are sought on the following matters: • Should tax relief on payroll donations be based on the donor’s marginal tax rate? • What are the compliance obligations for employers under this option? 12 CHAPTER 4 Option 2 – PAYE credit mechanism Summary of proposals • A PAYE credit is calculated at a set rate of 33⅓ percent on employee donations. This option essentially delivers the same tax benefit as the current rebate system but on a pay-by-pay basis. • The PAYE credit reduces the amount of PAYE deducted by the employer from an employee’s gross pay. • This option would only be available for employers who use e-filing with Inland Revenue. • All calculations that use taxable income as their basis (such as child support liabilities) would not be affected. 4.1 Under option 2, employers would calculate a PAYE credit of 33⅓ percent on the amount of the donation and would offset this amount against the PAYE calculated on the employee’s gross pay each payday. 4.2 All employees would receive a tax benefit of 33⅓ percent for every dollar donated to a donee organisation through payroll giving, irrespective of their marginal tax rate. This option would deliver an immediate tax benefit to the employee consistent with the current charitable rebate, without altering the level of their taxable income. Example 4.3 The following example illustrates how the tax deduction mechanism would operate in practice. The employee receives $400 per week and makes regular contributions of $10 each pay. The employee is on a 19.5 percent tax rate. Employee’s (donor) weekly gross pay $400.00 Less donation $10.00 Employee’s (donor) residual weekly pay $390.00 Less PAYE on $400 $78.23 PAYE credit @ 33.3 percent $3.33 Employee’s net pay $315.10 Charity receives $10.00 Inland Revenue receives $74.90 13 Implications of this option 4.4 Under this option it is possible that a donor might not receive the full tax benefit of his or her charitable donations on each payday. This would occur when the PAYE credit exceeds the PAYE liability that is calculated on a donor’s gross pay each payday. The result is that there would be a portion of the PAYE credit that cannot be accessed by the donor. For example, a donor earns $400 each payday and gives more than 58 percent of his or her pay to charity. In this instance, the PAYE credit would exceed the actual PAYE calculated. Similarly, for a donor earning $1,100 each payday, this problem would occur if the donor gave more than 76 percent of his or her pay to charity each payday. 4.5 To address this problem, the donor could be permitted to claim a refund of the difference between the PAYE credit and the PAYE liability at the end of the year. This measure would ensure that donors receive the full tax benefit of their charitable donations. Non-filing environment 4.6 For most donors, this option would allow the delivery of an immediate tax benefit on payroll donations without the need for employees to retain receipts and request and file rebate claim forms. Social policy entitlements and obligations 4.7 This option would have no impact on an employee’s current social policy entitlements and obligations that use taxable income as the basis of their calculation. Similarly, as the employee’s PAYE is still calculated on their pre-donation gross pay amount there would be no impact on the PAYE calculation, the ACC earner premium, and the low-income rebate would not be affected. Constraints on Inland Revenue administration 4.8 The PAYE credit would need to be reflected in the employee’s end-of-year summary of earnings to ensure it has been applied to offset the employee’s PAYE liability. To do this, employers would need to provide either the PAYE credit amount or the donation amount. This information could be collected from the employer as part of the employer monthly schedule. 4.9 As noted earlier, there are significant difficulties in collecting additional information on the paper-based employer monthly schedule. Given the information requirements of this option, payroll giving would have to be limited to employers who electronically file their employer monthly schedules. 14 Employer compliance obligations 4.10 Overall, this option would impose greater compliance costs on employers compared with the tax deduction mechanism in option 1. Extra calculations would be needed to calculate the PAYE credit and to offset this against an employee’s PAYE obligation. Employers would also need to provide extra information on the donation amounts and supply this information in the employer monthly schedule to Inland Revenue. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this would be relatively easy for employers with computerised payroll systems. 4.11 While employers would not need to keep any receipts under a payroll-giving scheme, they would need to provide evidence of the payroll donations made on behalf of their employees for audit purposes. 4.12 Under this option, employers would be required to file electronically. Government’s assessment of this option 4.13 This option addresses the perceived shortcomings of the tax deduction mechanism outlined in option 1 – that is, social policy entitlements and obligations would not be affected and it would deliver the same tax benefit as the current tax rebate for donations. However, this option would result in higher compliance costs for employers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue, and would require employers to electronically file their employee returns. Special points for submissions Submissions are sought on the following matters: • What are the merits of the PAYE credit mechanism? • Should tax relief on payroll donations be based on a flat rate of 33⅓ percent? • What would the level of compliance obligations be for employers under this option? 15 CHAPTER 5 Support for employers 5.1 This chapter discusses possible measures to help employers ease the costs associated with a payroll-giving scheme and make it easier for them to offer the scheme to their employees. 5.2 Countries that have established payroll-giving schemes have employed a range of measures to support and promote payroll giving, including setting up payment and facilitating intermediaries and educative resources. Intermediaries 5.3 Intermediaries are used to receive and distribute payroll donations to charities (payment intermediaries) and/or to help employers establish payroll-giving schemes (facilitating intermediaries). 5.4 Some overseas experiences have raised concerns about the role of intermediaries, such as intermediaries having control of donor information and the relationship with donors. Payment intermediaries 5.5 Payment intermediaries enable employees to donate to their chosen charity confidentially and help alleviate costs associated with payroll giving for employers. Using a payment intermediary can potentially enable employees to give to a wider group of charitable organisations. The United Kingdom currently uses this type of intermediary in its payroll giving scheme. 5.6 However, payment intermediaries add another step between the donor (employee) and the receiving charity, and usually take a portion of the donation to cover their administrative costs. This reduces the amount of the donation that is received by the chosen charities, although it can be argued that this cost is often less than the cost of other forms of fundraising by charities. Facilitating intermediaries 5.7 In overseas jurisdictions, facilitating intermediaries have helped employers with the initial set-up of payroll-giving schemes and on-going support. They can provide support to employers by providing introductory materials on payroll-giving and can help employers to establish and maintain their relationships with charities. An example of this in the Australian context is the Australian Charities Fund. 16 5.8 They can also help employers with modifying their current payroll systems and facilitate communication between employers, employees and charities. Facilitating intermediaries could reduce the initial administrative burden for employers looking to implement a payroll-giving scheme by providing support in the initial implementation period and on an ongoing basis. 5.9 Intermediaries are likely to charge a fee for their services, which will add further costs in setting up a payroll-giving scheme. 5.10 The government is interested in readers’ views on the level of support for using payment and scheme facilitation intermediaries. Inland Revenue’s role in helping employers with payroll giving 5.11 Inland Revenue could provide general information to employers to help them start up a payroll-giving scheme and help them comply with any requirements of the scheme. 5.12 In providing information and advice, Inland Revenue could also support employers who choose to change to electronic filing so they can offer payroll-giving to their employees. Special points for submissions Submissions are sought on the following matters: • What support should be provided to employers who offer payroll giving to their employees? • Would a payment or facilitating intermediary be helpful to employers who wish to implement payroll giving? 17 ANNEX 1 Payroll giving in other countries Australia The Australian system of payroll giving, known as “workplace giving”, was launched by the Minister of Revenue, the Australian Tax Office and the Australian Charities Fund in 2002. The initiative was largely driven by the corporate community and, in particular, a number of very influential businesspeople. Workplace giving is a voluntary scheme for both employers and employees. Employers who wish to offer workplace giving invite their employees to enter into a workplace-giving programme. Employees nominate their preferred charity or non- profit organisation (referred to as a “deductible gift recipient” (DGR)) from a selection provided by their employer and specify the amount they wish to donate. The amount is deducted from an employee’s salary or wage before the imposition of tax. As a result, employees receive an immediate tax benefit by way of an automatic reduction in the amount of tax paid on each payday. The donation is paid directly by the employer to the DGR. The Australian workplace-giving scheme is an example of a before-tax payroll giving system. The details of the workplace-giving scheme are determined by the employer, usually in consultation with its employees. Factors they must consider include: • the nature and number of DGRs to invite to participate in the scheme; • the arrangements to be made with each DGR, including the payment of donations; • the minimum donation amount; • whether to reduce the PAYG (Pay as You Go – similar to New Zealand’s PAYE) amount required to be withheld from the employee’s salary to account for the total amount donated by the employee to DGR(s) each pay period. There is no obligation on the employer to reduce the amount to be withheld from the employee’s salary. If the employer decides not to vary the amount of PAYG to take account of the donation, the employee must claim any tax relief for their donations in their end-of-year tax return; • possible matching of donations by employers; and • providing information about workplace giving to employees. Payment intermediaries are not used in Australia as the donation is paid directly by the employer to the chosen DGR. 18 The Australian Charities Fund (a non-profit organisation) was established to help employers set up workplace-giving schemes. The Australian Charities Fund charges a fee for its services and the amount of the fee is dependent on the number of employees employed by each employer. The Australian Charities Fund is the main provider of corporate community engagement and workplace-giving programmes in Australia. The Fund has worked with over 60 corporate employers and 25 government departments to implement workplace-giving schemes. It offers a wide range of expertise, including personnel, design and graphics and pre- and post- implementation support. The Fund charges a fee, which depends on the number of employees involved in a scheme. The role of the Australian Tax Office in administering workplace giving is limited to compliance work, providing information to employers when requested, and administering the end-of-year deduction process which is incorporated into annual income tax returns. The Australian Tax Office does not actively promote the scheme. Workplace giving was able to be implemented within the pre-existing tax administration and without the need for specific legislation and so there was very little impact on the Australian Tax Office’s administrative system. Administrative concessions were made to accommodate workplace giving, such as allowing DGRs to issue only one receipt to the employer rather than to each individual employee. The Giving Australia research project found that about 0.7 percent of those surveyed had made a donation through a deduction from their pay, which suggests that about 100,000 people participate in such schemes. 3 Canada Workplace giving in Canada is mostly through United Ways-Centraides (United Way) although some companies, particularly large corporations, choose to operate their own internal workplace-giving programmes. Donations made from an employee’s pay are deducted from the after-tax amount of the employee’s pay. The amount is then forwarded to the employee’s choice of charities or to United Way. Employees can claim a tax credit on the amount donated through payroll on their end-of-year tax return in the same way as any other donation. There are 125 local United Ways-Centraides in Canada. Donations made to United Way will go either to United Way’s own programmes or any registered charity in Canada as chosen by United Way. There appear to be no direct support or incentives for payroll-giving donations other than the general tax incentive provided by the government. A federal tax credit may be claimed for any donation made to a registered charity or a qualified charity. The total amount of the tax credit may differ as the amount of provincial tax credit available varies between provinces. 3 The Giving Australia Project, Giving Australia: Research on philanthropy in Australia, December 2005. 19 Payroll giving in Canada is dominated by United Way. As well as administering most workplace schemes, the majority of donations appear to go to United Way or community foundation-type programmes, although employees typically have the option to select any registered charity. In 2000, the National Survey of Giving, Volunteering and Participating showed that payroll deductions accounted for about 3 percent of the total number of donations made in Canada. In terms of the total dollar value, payroll deductions made up approximately 6 percent of the total donations, representing C$294 million. 4 United Kingdom This year marks the 20th anniversary of payroll giving in the United Kingdom. The payroll-giving scheme is administered by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). Under this scheme, employees can give to any United Kingdom charity from their before-tax pay and receive an immediate tax benefit on their donations. The value of the tax benefit is determined by the employee’s personal tax rate. Employers can establish payroll-giving schemes by signing with a payroll-giving agency. The payroll-giving agency acts as a payment intermediary and is responsible for passing on payroll donations from the employer to the employee’s chosen charity. There are nine HM Revenue and Customs-registered payroll-giving agencies. A small fee is charged by the payroll-giving agency to cover its administration costs. The fee is usually deducted from the donation amount but employers may pay this fee so that the whole of the employee’s donation goes to charity. Employees give the name of the charity they wish to donate to directly to the payroll- giving agency. This process ensures the confidentiality of the employee’s chosen charity. As well as promotion campaigns, two financial incentive schemes have been run to encourage participation: • a government top-up of donations in 2000–04; and • a grants scheme for small employers in 2005–07. The government, as part of a promotional campaign, added a further 10 cents to all donations made through payroll giving in the period 2000 to 2004. In 2005–06, small and medium-sized enterprises with less than 500 employees were made eligible for a grant of up to ₤500 for setting up payroll giving. The first ₤10 of each employee’s monthly donations was also matched, pound for pound, for a period of six months up to March 2007. The small-medium enterprises grant programme encouraged 3,380 new employers to sign up. 4 www.givingandvolunteering.ca/pdf/reports/where\_Canadians\_Donate.pdf 20 The government also funds the Payroll Giving Centre – a comprehensive online information centre about payroll giving aimed at businesses, charities and the general public (operated by the Institute of Fundraising). It also supports the Payroll Giving Quality Mark and Awards system for recognising employers with a payroll-giving scheme in place and who achieve specified levels of participation. During 2006–07, almost ₤89 million was received from employees donating from their before-tax pay and distributed by Payroll Giving Agencies. More than 640,000 people donated by payroll giving, an increase of 6.5 percent from 2005 to 2006. 5 5 www.payrollgivingcentre.org.uk 21 ANNEX 2 Examples Examples showing how the tax deduction mechanism (option 1) would operate 19.5% donor Employee’s (donor) weekly pay $400.00 Less donation $10.00 Employee’s (donor’s) weekly pay post-donation 390.00 PAYE (including ACC and LIR\*) on $390 $76.00 PAYE payable to IRD $76.00 Employee receives ($400 – $10 – $76.00) $314.00 Charity receives $10.00 IRD receives $76.00 33% donor Employee’s (donor) weekly pay $800.00 Less donation $10.00 Employee’s (donor’s) weekly pay post-donation $790.00 PAYE (including ACC and LIR) on $790 $172.31 PAYE payable to IRD $172.31 Employee receives ($800 – $10 – $172.31) $617.69 Charity receives $10.00 IRD receives $172.31 39% donor Employee’s (donor) weekly pay $1,500.00 Less donation $10.00 Employee’s (donor’s) weekly pay post-donation $1,490.00 PAYE (including ACC and LIR) on $1,490 $432.58 PAYE payable to IRD $432.58 Employee receives ($1,500 – $10 – $432.58) $1,057.42 Charity receives $10.00 IRD receives $432.58 \* Low-income rebate 22 Examples showing how the PAYE credit mechanism (option 2) would operate 19.5% donor Employee’s (donor) weekly pay $400.00 Donation $10.00 PAYE (including ACC and LIR) on $400 $78.23 Tax credit @ 33.3% $3.33 PAYE payable to IRD $74.90 Employee receives ($400 – $10 – $74.90) $315.10 Charity receives $10.00 IRD receives $74.90 33% donor Employee’s (donor) weekly pay $800.00 Donation $10.00 PAYE (including ACC and LIR) on $800 $175.74 Tax credit @ 33.3% $3.33 PAYE payable to IRD $172.41 Employee receives ($800 – $10 – $172.41) $617.59 Charity receives $10.00 IRD receives $172.41 39% donor Employee’s (donor) weekly pay $1,500.00 Donation $10.00 PAYE (including ACC and LIR) on $1,500 $436.61 Tax credit @ 33.3% $3.33 PAYE payable to IRD $433.28 Employee receives ($1,500 – $10 – $433.28) $1,056.72 Charity receives $10.00 IRD receives $433.28 23 Comparison of the tax benefit under option 1, option 2 and the current rebate system The comparison is based on a donation amount of $1,000. 19.5% donor 33% donor 39% donor Option 1 $195.00 $330.00 $390.00 Option 2 $333.33 $333.33 $333.33 Current rebate $333.33 $333.33 $333.33
